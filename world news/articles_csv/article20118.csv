"'11-08-01,'0','To break the buck, its value must fall by one-half of 1 percent, to 99.5 cents a share. Since Treasury bond prices move inversely with interest rates, if the market attaches greater risk to owning Treasuries, their interest rates would rise and prices would fall to attract buyers. A steep swing in rates and prices could cause the value of a money market fund to sink below the $1 level.Chris Plantier, a senior economist at the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, and Sean Collins, a senior director of industry and financial analysis, said last week that their models showed that it would take a 3 percentage point rise in short-term interest rates, affecting every security in a money market fund’s portfolio, to drive a fund’s value down to 99.5 cents a share.With short-term rates currently near zero, a jump of 3 percentage points would be such a catastrophic event that money funds might be the least of investors’ problems. It’s so inconceivable that rates for consumers and businesses could jump that far that fast that it evokes dire images of people in bread lines.More likely, managers say, is that a downgrade of Treasury bond ratings would push short-term rates up by one-quarter to three-quarters of a point, leaving the net asset value of money funds safely at $1 a share.Over all, though, fund managers and regulators were optimistic that money market funds would be relatively untouched by further market turmoil.“We’ve had a contingency team focused on this since the end of May,” Robert Brown, president of money markets at Fidelity Investments, the nation’s largest manager of money market funds, said Friday. “We have to be prepared to respond to the unthinkable.”Federal regulators, too, say they believe that investors have seen what is possible — unlike in 2008, when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt over a weekend.“I don’t believe the Treasury markets are going to freeze up,” said one federal regulator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared the knowledge that regulators were watching might cause undue concern about a market segment. “The funds we have talked to are well positioned to substantially handle the kinds of outflows that they have seen recently.”Money funds must hold only highly rated, short-term assets, but government securities are exempt from the requirement. So a ratings downgrade would not automatically force fund managers to sell Treasuries.The greater danger is to money funds with extensive holdings of short-term corporate i.o.u.’s, or commercial paper. Any issuer that enjoys a high credit rating because of implicit or explicit support from the government could be subject to downgrades if the government’s rating fell.Those include Fannie Mae, one of the big government mortgage companies, whose debts are guaranteed by Washington but which would likely be downgraded as well, and some of the largest banks, which might enjoy an implicit belief that the government would bail them out in a financial crisis, as it did in 2008.Regulations after 2008 require taxable money market funds to hold 10 percent of their assets in a form that can be converted to cash in a single day, and all funds to hold 30 percent of assets in a form that can be converted to cash within five days.According to one market analyst, iMoneyNet, many funds have gone beyond that. On June 30, the company said, the average government money market fund had 58 percent of its assets in securities that would mature within five days.Even so, the next-to-nothing interest rates that most money market funds are currently earning have been judged by many investors not to be worth the risk. A little-noticed portion of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the wake of the financial crisis, provides federal insurance through the end of 2012 for unlimited amounts of deposits in noninterest-bearing checking accounts.That has led to a sharp upswing in the assets in bank checking accounts, to $2.4 trillion at the end of last year from $2.1 trillion at the end of 2009.So far, it doesn’t seem to have worried investors that the government that is promising to make interest payments on Treasuries is the same government insuring those checking accounts. Insurance on bank accounts is covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.'"
"'11-08-01,'0','“Our audit found that M.T.A.’s service diversions are increasing in frequency and leaving taxpayers on the hook for millions of dollars in cost overruns,” Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, said in a statement accompanying the audit.Mr. DiNapoli’s office conducted the audit with the office of the city comptroller, John C. Liu.“Sadly, this confirms the nagging suspicion of riders, residents and business owners alike, that subway service is taken down more than necessary,” Mr. Liu said in the statement.In response to the audit, Kevin Ortiz, a spokesman for New York City Transit, said in an e-mail: “Due to the 24-hour, seven-day-a-week operation of the subway system, planned service diversions are necessary in order to perform maintenance and capital work. We make every effort to minimize customer inconvenience by coordinating work — performing multiple jobs in the same area so that we do not have to go back again. However, some projects are extremely involved, requiring several shutdowns.”A service diversion happens when all or part of a subway line is closed for maintenance. For each diversion, the transit agency has to shut off power for the affected subway tracks, move workers to and from the site, and provide alternative service for passengers.There were 3,332 service diversions during the period that auditors examined.Auditors reviewed a random sample of 50 of those service diversions.New York City Transit officials provided auditors with time sheets for 29 of those service diversions. Work started late on 28 projects and ended early for 21, auditors found.The loss of work time ranged from 10 to 27 percent, as a result of workers’ starting late or leaving early, the audit found.The auditors assumed that each of the 3,332 projects was unproductive 10 percent of the time and calculated $10.5 million in costs that could have been avoided.Auditors also reviewed four contracts that were not completed within budget and found that they were $26.6 million over their budget of $56.5 million.Auditors found that eight other contracts were within budget.New York City Transit has hundreds of contracts for work that is currently being done.'"
"'11-08-01,'0','WASHINGTON — For the better part of two days, Kobe Bryant was surrounded by Spanish speakers and soccer players but looked completely in his element.He spent time with the players and coaches of Barcelona, his favorite soccer team, at their downtown hotel, where they treated him as one of their own. He was even the star of their halftime show on Saturday, during their match against Manchester United. As the crowd roared, he deftly dribbled the ball off his size 14 feet, then rocketed a shot into the goal.On Sunday, in the searing sun and temperatures that hovered around 100, he donned a Barcelona uniform and played in a celebrity soccer match hosted by Mia Hamm, showing unexpected grace on the pint-sized field. (Yet his endurance needed work. Only minutes into the game, he shouted: “This is tiring! I need a timeout!)Perhaps more than any other American-born N.B.A. player, Bryant fits into the European sports world remarkably seamlessly. He is familiar with the culture, having lived in Italy when he was young while his father played professional basketball there.But that does not mean he will play for the Turkish basketball team Besiktas during the lockout, as the rumors — and Besiktas itself — have suggested, Bryant said Sunday in a joint news conference with the Barcelona players Carles Puyol and Sergio Busquets.'"

"'11-08-01,'0','If so, it will be the 17th consecutive annual increase in a business whose prices have outpaced the effect of general inflation by more than half since 1999. Theater attendance has fallen by about 10 percent in that period, or even more when measured as a share of the growing population.Executives from Hollywood’s major studios are generally reluctant to discuss prices. But with domestic box office down 5.55 percent — to $6.42 billion from $6.80 billion — from last year at this time, according to Hollywood.com, even some of the best-compensated players are beginning to wonder whether exhibitors and studios are pushing their luck with consumers.At the Comic-Con International fantasy convention in San Diego last month, Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson, two of Hollywood’s most prominent directors, voiced a strong hope that ticket prices for 3-D films would ultimately fall into line with the lower charge for 2-D movies. Consumers are being charged an extra $5 to see a movie only to find out it is “as bad as the one you saw in 2-D,” Mr. Jackson said.Their plea brought a sharp response last week from Jeffrey Katzenberg, the DreamWorks Animation chief executive, who has been an advocate of 3-D and the increased price that comes with it.“They’re not getting complaints at the box office about pricing, it’s just not happening,” said Mr. Katzenberg, who spoke by telephone on Thursday. Mr. Katzenberg said his own company’s recent experience with “Kung Fu Panda 2,” which took in about 45 percent of $161 million in domestic ticket sales from the higher priced 3-D tickets, showed that a substantial number of consumers would still pay a premium for good films.“Whatever Peter and Steven are talking to, maybe they’re following their instincts,” Mr. Katzenberg said of the Spielberg-Jackson pricing critique. “But there’s actually no factual data.”Asked whether 3-D pricing had been too aggressive, David Passman, the chief executive of Carmike Cinemas, said by e-mail: “Perhaps in some markets, but generally, no.”Historically, the big theater chains like Regal, AMC Entertainment, Cinemark Theatres and Carmike or their predecessors have been reluctant to raise ticket prices because their profit margins were higher on the sale of popcorn and other concessions than from tickets. Thus, they had an interest in raising the number of attendees, rather than maximizing film revenue that would be shared with studios. (The studios and exhibitors typically split the proceeds from each ticket sale, although the exhibitors alone set the price to consumers.) Patrick Corcoran, the director of media and research for the National Association of Theatre Owners, points out that a ticket purchased for the average price of $1.65 in 1971 would cost $9.20 today — higher than the actual industry average, if adjusted according to the general inflation rate.More recently, though, theater chains turned to price increases, and especially to premium prices for 3-D and big-screen formats like Imax, for added cash that sometimes has been used to pay large dividends to shareholders or to pay down debt.Cinemark Holdings, though generally more restrained than some of its peers when it comes to pricing, raised its quarterly dividend 17 percent, to 21 cents a share from 18 cents, an amount that nearly equaled its earnings in the first quarter. Meanwhile, Carmike, which operates many small-town theaters with relatively low ticket prices, has paid down a substantial $100 million in debt in just over three years.Regal, of which Philip Anschutz is a major shareholder, has an average ticket price of about $8.75, nearly 9 percent higher than the industry average of $8.06. And, like Cinemark, it recently raised its quarterly dividend to 21 cents from 18 cents, after declaring a special dividend of $1.40 a share, or $216 million, in December.Speaking privately to avoid conflict with their business partners, some studio executives contend that such payouts are draining the chains of money that could be used to upgrade or replace theaters that are charging higher prices but offering a less-than-premium experience, beyond the investment in the digital projectors required for 3-D.Theater owners say otherwise. “The dividend payments were not at the expense of reinvestment,” Amy E. Miles, Regal’s chief executive, said in an e-mail on Friday. Movie-going remains relatively inexpensive, and two-thirds of Regal’s customers continue to pay $10 or less for a ticket, Ms. Miles added.Mr. Corcoran said the theater owners association did not compile publicly available statistics on the average surcharge for 3-D tickets. But the average add-on appears to be about $3, rather than the $5 sometimes seen at big-city theaters. Of a $3 surcharge, the theater owner and the studio would each receive about $1.50, but each would typically pay about 50 cents to a technology provider like RealD — the theater owner for licensing, the studio for glasses.From its share, the studio must cover the incremental cost of making a 3-D film, while the theater owner’s remaining stake moves more directly to the bottom line, since technology firms like RealD cover the cost of maintaining their equipment.The industrywide average ticket price — which factors in low-price small-town theaters, second-run houses and discount sales through outlets like Costco — can appear impossibly low to urban dwellers, who are accustomed to paying far more at theaters in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, where real estate is expensive and zoning laws can require, for instance, a lobby as large as the auditorium, to avoid lines on the street.In some markets, too, pricing changes have caused surprising distortions. In Santa Monica, for instance, the price of a regular adult ticket at AMC Loews Broadway 4 theater, also owned by AMC, has risen by 47 percent since 2001, to $11.75 from $8 — only a little more than the 41 percent increase in the average ticket price for the same years. But children’s tickets rose 67 percent for the period, to $8.75 from $5.25, while senior tickets are up 95 percent, to $10.75 from $5.50. Add 3-D, and a child’s ticket goes to $12.75, while a senior pays $14.75, two to three times the cost of a ticket 10 years ago.At AMC, whose average price tops the industry average, the added cash contributed since December to $263.1 million in dividends, which the privately held firm’s parent used to pay down debt, according to a recent company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AMC executives declined to be interviewed, citing restrictions on their ability to speak publicly pending a planned stock offering.Plans for new theater construction in Santa Monica have been held back by a regulatory review and the need to resolve zoning issues.Though generally well tended, the Santa Monica 7 theater is showing its age. Here and there, the wallpaper is cracked or a piece of trim is missing, and the basement level, where “Captain America” was showing on Wednesday in a large 3-D auditorium, had a distinctly musty smell.As for Ms. Galvin, she just wished the tickets were a little cheaper.“I’d bring my husband,” she said.'"

"'11-08-02,'0','The road to Washington is paved with broken campaign promises. But few are so rich in hypocrisy as those of House Republican freshmen caught engineering hometown pork even as they vow to slash the federal budget for the supposed good of the nation.In March, just months after being sworn in, 22 of them plumped for more military spending in their districts than President Obama requested.Representative Steven Palazzo, of Mississippi, who campaigned fiercely against earmarks, voted to slash military spending and then voted for an amendment to quietly restore the same money, including $150 million for a warship to be built in his district. Pork? Earmark? No, he insists, saying he merely voted for a package that happened to include that hometown goodie and the Pentagon now must decide how to finance it.These gyrations have been detailed by The Times’s Ron Nixon, who found nearly two dozen Republican freshmen pushing hometown projects ultimately worth billions.Representative Tim Scott, a Tea Party favorite from South Carolina, helped secure the down payment on a $300 million harbor dredging project back home. Not at all pork, said Mr. Scott, pronouncing the dredging a matter of the national interest. In the case of a new bridge in Wisconsin, Representative Sean Duffy reasons it’s no earmark since the legislation listed no specific costs.Representative Michele Bachmann, Minnesota’s three-term incumbent and presidential aspirant, also supports the bridge — and calls for a “redefinition” of what an earmark is. “There’s a big difference between funding a teapot museum and a bridge over a vital waterway,” is Ms. Bachmann’s head-scratching guidance.'"
"'11-08-02,'0','In a city where ethnic Norwegians and immigrants have only started to become cohesive, Mr. Ahmed, a native of Somalia, would stroll down the streets in Lady Gaga-inspired outfits of his own making, holding impromptu public dance parties with his friends from Norway, Somalia, Bosnia and elsewhere.“He never touched alcohol, never girls — he just danced,” said Woria Ali Ahmad, another friend. “There is no way to start to describe him. He is too special.”Mr. Ahmad, 21, was with his friend to the last, he said. Both ran to the water when the shooting started, but the gunman, identified by the police as Anders Behring Breivik, tracked them down. Standing on the bank above them, he sprayed bullets in their direction, killing several girls trying to hide nearby. Both men played dead on the rocky shore, but in Mr. Ahmed’s case the killer did not believe the ruse.“He aimed and shot him in the head,” said Mr. Ahmad, who went unnoticed behind some rocks. “He died, and I didn’t do anything. I feel guilty.”Smoking a water pipe and eating potato chips and McDonald’s hamburgers on a grassy patch overlooking Lake Mjosa, Mr. Ahmad, an ethnic Kurd born in Iraq, joined several other survivors in an effort to ease some of the strains that most said are unbearable when they are alone.Many in Mr. Ahmed’s circle were immigrants or the children of immigrants for whom his death was especially wrenching. With their families, they had fled war-torn corners of the world in search of a peaceful life. Their homelands made a virtual catalog of the world’s conflicts over the last two decades: Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, Iraq, Kosovo and the Palestinian territories.Mr. Ahmed was like them to a point. He came to Norway with his family in 2002 at age 10. Though originally from Somalia, his family had fled the violence there in the early 1990s, settling for about a decade in Yemen before moving as asylum seekers to Hamar, a town of about 28,000 that is 80 miles north of Oslo.In those days, with the town only starting to see an influx of immigrants from Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, the welcome was not as warm as they might have hoped.Despite Norway’s emphasis on egalitarianism and tolerance, Mr. Ahmed’s brother, Khalid, said the family met with what he described as “indirect racism.” It was noticeable, he said, in the suspicious looks of store clerks and elderly women at the bus stop, who clutched their bags more tightly when a dark-skinned immigrant walked by.Khalid Haji Ahmed, 32, decided to confront such attitudes through politics, joining the local branch of the liberal Labor Party’s youth wing. His brother also joined, but found he could best shape attitudes through dance.“My brother was always inspired by dance,” he said. “He lived inside the music, and the music comes inside him.”Mr. Ahmed arranged charity concerts for people in need, the latest to raise money for cancer research. What little money he had, he either spent on his wildly extravagant clothes or gave to the poor, friends said. Poor people in the town, who patronized his charity, used to call him “the Boss,” friends said.Before long he was a local celebrity. He had recently staged a production of the musical “Hair,” and in a tribute to Lady Gaga choreographed a theatrical version of her single “Judas,” casting himself as Jesus. This year, he took part in a televised talent competition similar to “American Idol,” dancing with a Norwegian girl who had converted to Islam.His parents tolerated his somewhat unorthodox lifestyle to a point, his brother said, and he accommodated their wishes when possible. He agreed, for instance, to his mother’s request to dye his bleach-blond mohawk dark for Ramadan.His celebrity extended to the summer camp on Utoya, an annual affair organized by the ruling Labor Party, where Mr. Ahmed’s dance shows became legendary. For decades the camp, which is run by the youth wing of the Labor Party, has provided a platform for young people to come together and effect change.For Mr. Ahmed, it also provided a stage.His last show was an impromptu event on the campgrounds. There was no music, only Mr. Ahmed, banging sticks together for an improvised beat. A crowd formed immediately and began dancing along with his wild gyrations, friends said.“That’s my last memory of him,” said Mr. Vranesi, his friend. “It’s a very good memory.”It was a week before the police released Mr. Ahmed’s body to his family. As a final service to him, a day before his funeral on Friday, several of his friends decided to wash his body in accordance with Islamic custom.“It felt right. He was our friend,” said Mr. Ahmad, his friend from Iraq. “And I felt stronger when I did it.”'"
"'11-08-02,'0','Analysts say Mr. Hegde’s findings provide evidence of corruption in important parts of the Indian economy, including land and natural resources, that are still tightly controlled by politicians and corporate executives — even as other sectors, including consumer goods, banking and information technology, have become more competitive and open.Procedurally, it is unclear what will happen next. Mr. Hegde does not have the power to prosecute the companies and individuals he accuses in his report. That is up to Karnataka’s government, which has previously played down concerns about mining, or to the judicial system.India’s Supreme Court on Friday temporarily suspended all iron ore mining in Bellary, the region that was the main focus of the inquiry. The court in recent years has often led the charge to prosecute officials accused of corruption, and anticorruption advocates hope that it will do so in this case.The scandal forced the chief minister of Karnataka state to resign on Sunday, although he has denied wrongdoing.Shares of Adani Enterprises were down nearly 23 percent on Thursday and Friday, but they regained almost 9 percent on Monday.The stock of another company implicated in the report, JSW Steel, fell more than 10 percent late last week. JSW’s shares dropped by an additional 10.3 percent on Monday, after Citigroup downgraded the stock and put a sell rating on it.A big break in the investigation occurred early last year. Anticorruption agents raided the offices of Adani Enterprises, which operated an iron ore terminal at the Indian port of Belekeri, on the Arabian Sea, and discovered a document that appeared to be an illicit payroll.A computer file from 2008 listed payoffs that Adani Enterprises was suspected of making to government officials. The port director, for instance, was paid 50,000 rupees ($1,100) per ship that set sail from the port, the file said. A customs official got 100,000 rupees every three months and 0.50 rupee per ton of iron ore shipped, it said. Police inspectors received 14,000 rupees every month, and local politicians were paid “once in a while,” the file said. The report was issued as Indians increasingly questioned the growing wealth and power amassed by a small elite group. In a separate corruption scandal, government auditors estimated that officials may have cost the federal government $40 billion by giving telecommunications licenses to favored companies rather than auctioning them.The mining scandal in Karnataka state, which is also home to the technology hub Bangalore, has been brewing for several years. In 2008, Mr. Hegde, who is the state’s lokayukta or ombudsman, produced a report on problems of illegal mining in the state’s Bellary region.In his latest report Mr. Hegde said the situation had only worsened since then, as the companies had sought to avoid paying royalties to the state and export duties to the federal government, and as companies had mined in forests that were supposed to be protected under conservation laws.But the government in Karnataka state, which is controlled by the Bhartiya Janata Party, did little to control the mining, much of which was in the hands of three businessmen brothers, the Reddys, who are powerful members of the party.In 2009 the chief minister, B. S. Yeddyurappa, backed down on his proposal to impose a $21 fee on each truckload of iron ore, after the Reddys threatened to withdraw their support of his government.Even now, while national Bhartiya Janata Party leaders have forced Mr. Yeddyurappa to step down, the party has not pushed out Janardhana Reddy, a mining magnate and the state’s minister of tourism, and his two brothers, Somashekhar and Karunakar. Mr. Hegde’s report accuses them of many violations, including using front companies to evade taxes and royalties and threatening his investigators.The Reddys say they have done nothing wrong.In the case of Adani Enterprises, Mr. Hegde’s report says the company helped mining concerns export illicitly obtained iron ore to China and other countries from the port, while engaging in a systematic bribery campaign that covered virtually every level of government. He recommended that the company be “barred from participating in any future contract, grant or lease, etc. by the government.”In a written statement, Adani Enterprises Ltd. strongly rebutted the accusations and said it had been involved only in handling iron ore shipments and had never mined or owned the commodity itself.“Any alleged illegal gratification or payoffs cannot be attributed to AEL given that AEL has been a mere port operator and the cargo interest always was with either miners or other parties,” the statement said, referring to the company by its initials. “Such gratifications if at all having been made, cannot be attributed to AEL.”JSW Steel, one of India’s largest producers of iron ore, is accused of making a 100 million rupee ($2.3 million) donation to an educational trust run by Mr. Yeddyurappa’s sons. The company and its affiliate, according to the report, also spent 200 million rupees to buy an acre of industrial land outside Bangalore from the Yeddyurappa family. Mr. Hegde charges that similar land sold in the area at the time for as little as 12.4 million rupees an acre.In a statement, JSW Steel said “all the transactions have been done in a legally compliant manner.”'"
"'11-08-02,'0','ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. — We know well the vicious cycle of an opera that’s less than an immediate hit. The work is neglected, so it is assumed to be lacking in quality, so it’s neglected some more. And so on.Objections to such a piece take on the tone of authority. The libretto of Richard Strauss’s 1940 opera, “Die Liebe der Danae,” we’ve been confidently told, is lethally uneven. Its effects — a shower of gold, the transformation of a woman into a statue — are unstageable. The main roles are too difficult to cast satisfactorily. And why bother? The music is second-rate.Well, no, no, no and, especially, no. In a beautiful performance on Sunday afternoon at Bard College, as part of the Bard SummerScape festival, the conductor and scholar Leon Botstein and his American Symphony Orchestra showed that most everything you’ve heard about “Danae” is wrong. With gorgeous music and a plot seemingly tailor-made for our troubled times, it is one of those operas that make you resent the stubborn smallness of the standard repertory.Mr. Botstein has long championed the work. In 2000 he and the American Symphony presented it in concert, with the soprano Lauren Flanigan, at Avery Fisher Hall. (The performance was captured on a fine recording.)But an opera needs to be able to catch fire onstage, and in the SummerScape production, directed with imagination and emotional nuance by Kevin Newbury, “Danae” certainly does.'"
"'11-08-02,'0','Dr. Sally Shaywitz, a director of the Center for Dyslexia and Creativity at Yale University, said the study “demonstrates the centrality of spoken language in dyslexia — that it’s not a problem in meaning, but in getting to the sounds of speech.”That is why dyslexic children often misspeak, she said, citing two examples drawn from real life. “A child at Fenway Park watching the Red Sox said, ‘Oh, I’m thirsty. Can we go to the confession stand?,’ ” she said.“Another person crossing a busy intersection where many people were walking said, ‘Oh, those Presbyterians should be more careful.’ It’s not a question of not knowing, but being unable to attach what you know is the meaning to the sounds.”Dr. Gabrieli said the findings underscored a critical problem for dyslexic children learning to read: the ability of a child hearing, say, a parent or teacher speak to connect the auditory bits that make up words, called phonemes, with the sight of written words.If a child has trouble grasping the sounds that make up language, he said, acquiring reading skills will be harder.The research shows that spoken language deficiencies persist even when dyslexics learn to read well. The study subjects were mostly “high-functioning, high-I.Q. young adults who had overcome their reading difficulty,” Dr. Gabrieli said. “And yet when they had to distinguish voices, they were not one iota better with the English-language voices that they’ve heard all their life.”Experts said the new study also shows the interconnectedness of the brain processes involved in reading. Many scientists had considered voice recognition to be “like recognizing melodies or things that are primarily nonverbal,” Dr. Gabrieli said. Voice recognition was thought to be a separate task in the brain from understanding language.But this research shows that normal reading involves a “circuit, the ability to have all of those components integrated absolutely automatically,” said Maryanne Wolf, a dyslexia expert at Tufts University. “One of the great weaknesses in dyslexia is that the system is not able to integrate these phoneme-driven systems” with other aspects of language comprehension.As a follow-up, the M.I.T. researchers have been scanning the brains of subjects performing voice recognition and other activities, and have found “very big differences in dyslexics and nondyslexics in a surprisingly broad range of tasks,” Dr. Gabrieli said. “We think there might be a broader kind of learning that’s not operating very well in these individuals and that in some areas you can circumvent it pretty well. But in language and reading, it’s hard to circumvent.”One of the unusual aspects of the M.I.T. study is that it isolated the skill of processing vocal speech from reading and from skills involving the meaning of language, experts said. The sentences were basic, like “The boy was there when the sun rose,” and the Mandarin sounds meant nothing to the listeners.Dr. Wagner suggested that something like the voice-recognition task might be used to identify young children at risk for dyslexia.Often diagnostic tests require separating sounds from words. A child might be asked to say “cowboy” without the “boy” part.“For young children, it’s a real difficult task,” Dr. Wagner said. “Sometimes they’ll say, ‘cowboy without saying boy,’ because that’s exactly what you’ve asked them. The holy grail is to come up with tasks you can give to a 3-year-old.”Dr. Shaywitz said the study also has implications for teaching.If a teacher asked, “ ‘Oh, Johnny, what is the capital of New York State?,’ Johnny will go, ‘Uh, uh, uh,’ and the teacher will say, ‘Oh, gee, you don’t know it,’ ” Dr. Shaywitz said. “It’s more likely to be a problem of word retrieval than knowledge. If she reframes it as, ‘Is the capital Houston or Albany?,’ Johnny is more likely to answer correctly.”'"
"'11-08-02,'0','The taller a woman is, the greater her risk for cancer, a large study has found.Researchers at the University of Oxford in England analyzed data on more than 1.2 million British women followed for an average of 9.4 years. There were more than 97,000 cases of cancer among them. The researchers found that for each four-inch increase in height over 5 feet 1 inch, the risk that a woman would develop cancer increased by about 16 percent. The study was published online July 21 in The Lancet Oncology.The analysis covered 17 types of cancer, but the relative risk increase was statistically significant for just 10 of them. The authors suggest that levels of growth hormone might be involved in the genesis of cancer, or that taller people are at greater risk for mutations simply because their bodies comprise more cells.The authors also reviewed previous studies showing that a similar link between height and an increased cancer risk has been observed in Asia, Australasia, Europe and North America.“The interest in this study is in giving us a clue about how cancers might develop,” said Jane Green, the lead author and an epidemiologist at Oxford. “It’s the similarity for many different kinds of cancers, in people with many different risk factors and in many different populations, that makes us think it’s something very fundamental in cancer development.”'"

"'11-08-03,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — Seeking to stem what they call misleading advertising, San Francisco officials on Tuesday began a two-pronged attack on “crisis pregnancy centers,” which are billed as places for pregnant women to get advice, but often use counseling to discourage abortions.The first element was a bill introduced to the city’s Board of Supervisors that would make it illegal for such centers to advertise falsely about their pregnancy-related services, something already more broadly covered by a state law barring deceptive advertising. But the bill’s author, Malia Cohen, said the law was necessary to protect low-income women who are drawn into the centers, which often offer free services.“As a city, we have a responsibility to protect our most vulnerable residents,” said Ms. Cohen, who accused the centers of pushing “anti-abortion propaganda and mistruths on unsuspecting women.”At the same time, Dennis Herrera, the San Francisco city attorney, said his office had written to a local center, First Resort, about its advertisements, which he said “appear to be designed to confuse or mislead consumers.” In a letter to the center’s chief executive, Shari Plunkett, Mr. Herrera asked that the ads be corrected to make clear that the center does not perform abortions or make referrals for them.Mr. Herrera, a Democrat and a candidate for mayor, was also explicit in his distaste for the centers, calling them “right wing, politically motivated” institutions whose mission was “to dissuade women from seeking their constitutionally protected rights.”First Resort, a nonprofit corporation whose statement of purpose says it is a Christian group devoted to “an abortion-free world,” advertises its centers as offering “counseling and medical care to women who are making decisions about unplanned pregnancies.”'"
"'11-08-03,'1','Like the police, the military has been accused of acting with impunity, getting rebukes by the United States, international organizations and human rights advocates. Last year, the United States withheld part of its drug enforcement aid out of concerns over police and military abuse, and in April, a United Nations panel urged Mexico to consider withdrawing its use of the military because of complaints about “involuntary disappearances.”The most recent, and possibly farthest-reaching, effort to bring accountability to the military, however, has come out of Mexico itself: a Mexican Supreme Court decision last month that may help lift the lid on the thousands of complaints against the military about disappearances, torture and other abuse.The court, concurring with a ruling by an international court, said rights cases against the military belonged in civilian courts, not in military tribunals where wrongdoers are rarely punished.The decision raises the prospect of more transparent civilian investigations into the cases, said Nik Steinberg, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, which has been tracking military cases. But military leaders declared afterward that they could not operate without some protection from prosecution, and several lawmakers came out to support them.The ruling stemmed from a 1974 case, pressed for years in national and international courts by the family of Rosendo Radilla Pacheco, an advocate for health and education in a poor area of the southern state of Guerrero, who disappeared after being stopped at a military checkpoint. At the time, Mexico and other Latin American countries were taking a hard line on perceived leftist agitators.Typically, civilian authorities defer to the military, a powerful institution with the trust and a mandate from President Felipe Calderón to take on the cartels while the police and other law enforcement institutions are built up.Up to 45,000 troops have been sent to several states to assist, and sometimes take over for, civilian forces — the most boots on the ground in highly populated areas since the Mexican Revolution, said David Shirk, principal investigator for the Justice in Mexico project at the University of San Diego’s Trans-Border Institute.“The Mexican military has experienced a dramatic and sustained mission creep from the 1940s to the present,” Mr. Shirk said. “Its role has shifted from eradicating drug crops in remote rural areas to its current urban deployments to restore order and reclaim lost spaces in Mexico’s largest cities.”But as complaints of human rights abuses rise, Mexico has grappled with how, or even whether, to police the military.The National Human Rights Commission said it has logged more than 5,000 complaints of abuse at the hands of the military, chiefly the army. In addition, it has said, more than 5,300 people have been missing since Mr. Calderón began his offensive against organized crime in 2006.Under international pressure to curb the use of torture and arbitrary detentions, Mr. Calderón proposed to Congress late last year that allegations of rape, kidnapping and torture against the military be heard in civilian courts. Murder was left off the list, to the dismay of human rights advocates, and the bill has not advanced.The State Department last year withheld part its counternarcotics military aid over human rights concerns. The money, $26 million under the $1.4 billion Merida Initiative, still has not been delivered, though the court’s decision on July 12 could help persuade lawmakers to release it, State Department officials said.But several analysts questioned whether the civilian justice system was prepared to take on such cases.“Mexico’s civilian courts have proved woefully ineffective,” Mr. Shirk said. “If military human rights violators find the same degree of impunity we see for other criminal actors, then their victims will have little justice and this decision will have little real meaning.”Military leaders have long expressed skepticism over the complaints, arguing that most are unfounded or the work of cartels manipulating human rights and international organizations with false accusations to tarnish their name.Just last week, the secretary of the navy, Adm. Mariano Francisco Saynez, said as much at a graduation ceremony for cadets.“By using the banner of human rights, they try to damage the image of our institutions with the malevolent goal of obstructing their participation in the fight against them and having an open field for their evil doing,” Admiral Saynez said.Still, he added, the marines “do not tolerate or protect those who by mistake or lack of professionalism violate human rights.” Both the navy and the army say they now incorporate human rights awareness into their training.The use of the military against the drug organizations remains highly popular in Mexico, though a number of cases here in Monterrey and surrounding Nuevo Leon State have raised alarms. Several people who the authorities later acknowledged were innocent victims have been wounded or killed at checkpoints or in military operations, in some cases with soldiers accused of manipulating crime scenes to cover their tracks.But among the more worrisome cases, human rights advocates said, are the disappearance of people, typically young men, last seen in the custody of or near military units. In Tamaulipas State, which borders Nuevo Leon, Amnesty International in June said witnesses reported four men being picked up by marines and not heard from again, with the marines denying any involvement.“Whether they were suspects or taken by mistake is often hard to know because nobody claims to have answers,” said Sister Consuelo Morales Elizondo, director of Citizens in Support of Human Rights in Monterrey. Confusing matters further, cartel hitmen often disguise themselves as police or soldiers, using fake equipment and sometimes authentic gear stolen or procured from allies in the agencies. That has allowed the authorities to dismiss many disappearances as the work of “clones.”The marines told Mr. Jasso’s family that it had not been operating in the area and suggested it might have been a gang in military disguise.But his brother, Oziel, doubted that. He works as a toll taker on a federal highway and said he sees military convoys all the time, readily recognizing their insignia and manner.One officer during the raid kept accusing him of being a “hawk,” slang for a cartel lookout, before deciding he was not involved and moving on to find his brother.“If it was a cartel, I would not be sitting here talking to you,” he said. “They would have wiped out the witnesses.”A few days after the raid, René Jasso Maldonado’s close friend and fellow taxi driver, Jesus Llano Muñoz, 22, was detained at a military checkpoint, according to witnesses, and has not been heard from since.Mr. Llano’s family members said they believed rival drivers spread false information about Mr. Jasso and Mr. Llano among the marines and soldiers in an effort to eliminate competition.“All we want to know is where he is,” Oziel Jasso Maldonado said.'"
"'11-08-03,'1','MOSCOW — Russian prosecutors said on Tuesday that they had reopened a criminal tax evasion case against a man who died in 2009 — Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer who had accused police officials of corruption and then was arrested.A spokeswoman for the prosecutors’ office said the decision was made “bearing in mind the opinion of Mr. Magnitsky’s family and friends,” because it could result in clearing his name. But Mr. Magnitsky’s aunt, Tatyana Rudenko, said that no one in the family had been consulted, and that the family greeted the news with “great wariness.”Global criticism of Russia over Mr. Magnitsky’s death while in pretrial detention has been mounting. The State Department said last week that it had banned a list of Russian officials who were linked to Mr. Magnitsky’s death from visiting the United States. The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the move as “arbitrary punishment,” and warned that it might retaliate.The case has also produced tensions within the Russian government. The Interior Ministry appears to have dismissed the findings of a human rights commission set up by President Dmitri A. Medvedev, which said last month that powerful police officials at the ministry should be prosecuted in the matter, not just the prison doctors who oversaw Mr. Magnitsky’s care. A July 14 letter from the ministry said it “sees no basis for carrying out an investigation into illegal activities by members of the investigative group.”Mr. Magnitsky was detained in 2008 on suspicion of helping his employer, Hermitage Capital, evade $17.4 million in taxes. The prosecution came after Mr. Magnitsky testified against senior Interior Ministry officials, saying they had used Hermitage companies to embezzle $230 million from the Russian treasury. Mr. Magnitsky’s supporters believe the prosecution was retaliatory, and that investigators assigned to his case — who included individuals he had accused — denied him medical care.The reopening of the case against Mr. Magnitsky, who was 37, flowed from a Constitutional Court decision last week allowing review of cases against dead people. William F. Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital, said the reopening of the case was an attempt by the Interior Ministry to obtain a court decision exonerating its officials.'"
"'11-08-03,'1','If talent were the only guide, Austin would have little problem fitting in with the Giants. A top high-school recruit out of Washington, he spurned scholarship offers from programs like Southern California and Florida State to join Butch Davis’s team at North Carolina, a university known more for basketball than football. He did not take long to earn playing time, starting three games as a freshman in 2007.Austin had a breakout junior season in 2009, earning a second-team all-Atlantic Coast Conference selection and shooting up mock draft boards. But even as he excelled on the field, he still had trouble off it. He was benched for two games each in 2008 and 2009.By 2010, after his surprising decision to return for his senior year at North Carolina, the 6-foot-3, 309-pound Austin was projected as a top-10 draft pick when his path to the N.F.L. took a drastic turn. On a trip to Miami, posts on his Twitter account prompted an investigation into his dealings with agents. As the season approached, he and 13 Tar Heels teammates were suspended for receiving improper benefits; ultimately, Austin and five others, including his fellow draft picks Robert Quinn and Greg Little, were suspended for the entire 2010 season.The program’s fallout continued last week when Davis was fired and Athletic Director Dick Baddour stepped down.“I was allegedly breaking N.C.A.A. rules, but that doesn’t make me a bad person,” said Austin, who would not comment on the recent developments at North Carolina. “If you check out my record, I’ve never been in trouble or hurt anybody or did anything like that. So when they talked about character issues, that was just something for the draft. Somebody had to have an issue. That’s not something I worry about. I know what type of person I am.”N.F.L. teams, however, had their concerns. Not even an impressive showing at the East-West Shrine Game, where he represented North Carolina and scored a touchdown after recovering a fumble, was enough to keep him in the first round.As he fell in the draft, the Giants remained interested and called their wide receiver Hakeem Nicks, Austin’s former Tar Heels teammate.“I know he’s a hard-working player and I know he’s going to go get it,” Hicks said. “He’s hungry. He loves the game and he’s a good kid.”The Giants were well aware of the risk they took in choosing Austin, who was the 52nd overall pick.“Certain people you take a chance on if they aren’t habitual problems,” Marc Ross, the Giants’ college scouting director, said at the time. “With Marvin, he’s genuinely remorseful about what happened.”Despite being out of organized football for so long, Austin will be asked to contribute right away on a team known for its defensive line play. With Barry Cofield and Rocky Bernard not returning, Austin, the veteran Chris Canty and Linval Joseph — an unproven player heading into his second season — will be featured on the inside alongside the team’s stable of ends.So far, Austin is playing with the second-team defense but has impressed.“He really looked powerful,” the defensive coordinator Perry Fewell said Monday. “He looked strong. He looked quick. He retained the information and didn’t have a lot of mental errors. I was pleased the first two days, but it will get tougher as we go along.”It may be early, but Austin is clearly motivated to prove he belongs.“I’m a competitor at the highest level,” he said.“In the draft, they took seven guys before me,” he added, referring to the defensive tackles drafted ahead of him. “I have a problem with that.”The first-round selection, cornerback Prince Amukamara, remains the only Giants draft pick unsigned. ... The Giants signed the free-agent defensive tackle Gabe Watson, who spent his first five seasons with Arizona.'"
"'11-08-03,'1','Today, markets often render credit judgments before the rating agencies can take out their pens, so a downgrade has a less noticeable effect. By that time, many of the traditional benefits of being deemed AAA, like lower borrowing costs and reputational glow, have evaporated.In the early 1980s, around 60 companies had AAA credit. By 2000, the number of AAA companies was about 15. Today just four corporations— Automatic Data Processing, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft — can claim those once-coveted three initials. (Five big insurers and several government affiliated organizations can too.)Analysts say corporate buyouts and acquisitions accelerated the trend. Many AAA companies lost their ratings when they were taken over and their new owners loaded them with cheap debt to help pay for the deal. Other strategic decisions also triggered downgrades.UPS, for example, struck a long-term agreement with its union workers in fall 2007 that raised pay and benefits but froze certain pension obligations. Soon after, the ratings agencies started knocking down the company’s credit rating to AA because of the new pension arrangement.“Maintaining a AAA rating is not a financial goal of this company,” a UPS spokesman said at the time. Investors barely reacted. In the three months after the downgrade, yields on UPS bonds responded by increasing about 0.4 percentage point from 5.32 percent. Today, with borrowers enjoying ultra-low interest rates, the bond yields are back to their levels in late 2007.Meanwhile, the financial crisis and deep recession laid into several of the sturdiest pillars of American capitalism. Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric and Pfizer all lost their AAA ratings.Still, a funny thing happened when these companies were sent down to AA. Investors shrugged off the change; the markets had already rendered their verdict. Borrowing costs for General Electric and Berkshire actually fell in the weeks after they were downgraded in spring 2009, amid a broader market rally.“The rating agencies were late to the party,” said Mr. Orndorff, the bond investor.Ratings for companies and countries are viewed differently, even if they are evaluated in much the same way.For most Americans, the prospect that the government could lose its AAA credit rating is almost unthinkable — a blow to national pride and consumer confidence that could turn out to be more damaging than any increase in borrowing costs.That is why even after President Obama signed a law on Tuesday that lifted the debt ceiling, some in Washington were worried that the plan’s spending cuts were not deep enough to appease all the major rating agencies.For now, all three major rating firms continue to give the United States a AAA rating. But on Tuesday, Moody’s said its outlook was negative after putting the government on notice last month that it could be downgraded. Fitch said on Tuesday that it planned to complete another review of the government’s finances by the end of this month, and Standard & Poor’s has warned that the United States might lose its rating if it did not sharply rein in the deficit.It helps, of course, that the dollar remains the world’s leading currency, ensuring that demand for United States debt is strong in spite of the nation’s myriad financial challenges.But the truth is, even as the government maintained its AAA grade, the markets suggested long ago that the United States was no longer deserving of such a high rating.The credit-default swap market provided one clue. During the financial crisis in early 2009, the price of insurance that would pay off if the United States government defaulted on its debt was similar to that offered for companies ranked just above junk. Even today, the price of insurance on a government default has been higher than that for Colgate Palmolive, the global toothpaste giant, which has a rating two notches below AAA.The economic data also suggests that the United States has higher debt levels than most AAA corporate borrowers. Today, the United States debt as a percentage of the nation’s economic output is 75 percent and could top 84 percent by 2013, according to Standard & Poor’s research. The typical AAA-rated country has a ratio of about 11.4 percent.By contrast, Exxon Mobil and Microsoft each had debt-to-income ratios exceeding 20 percent, while Automatic Data Processing had a ratio of 1.8 percent, according to Capital IQ, a business owned by Standard & Poor’s. Johnson & Johnson had a ratio of 92 percent.But unlike Washington, there is no threat to the AAA credit rating of Johnson & Johnson. That Johnson, the 125-year-old maker of Tylenol and Listerine, could have a better rating than the country in which it resides would be unusual but not a firstToyota retained its AAA rating for several years after a sluggish economy led the rating agencies to start downgrading Japanese government debt in 1998.Today, a handful of European corporations, like Portugal Telecom or Helecom of Greece, have received higher ratings than their fiscally troubled homelands. That is because a big portion of their revenue comes from foreign customers. In the last few weeks, the ratings agencies have made it clear that lowering the AAA rating of the United States government was unlikely to cause any AAA-rated American company to lose its rating— at least in the coming months.But longer-term, top-flight ratings for American companies could be jeopardized if the government’s effort to get its own finances under control caused a slowdown in economic growth.“What agreement there is on the deficit, and what spending is going to be or not be, will have an impact,” said John J. Bilardello, the head of corporate ratings at Standard & Poor’s.A downgrade of a country rating can ripple through other entities that rely on the government for support, potentially raising borrowing costs across the economy. These include mortgage bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as debt sold by dozens of states and counties whose local economies have strong ties to Washington. It also could affect about a dozen insurance companies and too-big-to-fail banks, whose ratings benefit from the perception that the government would bail them out if they ran into trouble again.But could an American company’s credit really be more solid than the full faith and credit of the United States? The ratings agencies may say so one day, but lawmakers and citizens might have a reaction like that of Warren E. Buffett, after his Berkshire Hathaway lost its prized AAA status in 2009.“We’re still AAA in my mind,” he said.'"
"'11-08-03,'1','NYSE Euronext, the exchange company that Deutsche Börse is planning to buy, said its second-quarter profit fell on lower revenue from European derivatives and United States equity trading.Net income decreased 16 percent to $154 million from $184 million a year earlier, the company said Tuesday in a statement. Excluding some items, earnings dropped to 61 cents a share, exceeding the 60-cent average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The results sent the company’s shares down nearly 5 percent, or $1.60, to $31.40.Deutsche Börse’s planned purchase of the parent company would create the world’s largest exchange operator, expanding NYSE Euronext’s revenue from European derivatives. Some of NYSE Euronext’s sales depend on the volume of shares that change hands each day, and trading on American exchanges last quarter fell 9.6 percent from the first quarter, according to the daily average compiled by Bloomberg.It “was a modestly disappointing quarter for NYSE Euronext,” Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst with Raymond James Financial, wrote in a note. “We had expected more momentum from the firm’s data center initiative while operating expenses continue to creep up.”Net revenue from the company’s derivatives unit, which accounted for about 32 percent of the total, fell 5.8 percent to $213 million. Revenue from equity trading and listings increased 1.9 percent to $327 million, according to the statement.NYSE Amex sold almost 53 percent of its options market to seven brokers, winning regulatory approval for the plan last quarter.The European Commission sent a survey last month with 165 questions to Deutsche Börse’s rivals and customers, asking if the deal with NYSE Euronext would reduce competition and what effect it would have on access to market data. The European Union’s antitrust agency set an Aug. 4 deadline to rule on the deal. Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, said Tuesday in a conference call that this was part of the first phase of the European regulatory review.'"
"'11-08-03,'1','Sitting around an oval white table recently, on the top floor of their theater complex between Park and Madison Avenues (three theaters and the pre- and postshow E:Bar), they discussed Edinburgh Fringes past — from happy discoveries to “one of the world’s worst versions of ‘Hamlet’ ever,” as Ms. Kleinhans put it — and about their plans for this summer. The table was soon littered with copies of the Edinburgh Fringe program, news releases on individual productions and the beginnings of the spreadsheet that will guide them to dozens of shows.“Frankly, sometimes it feels like too much,” Mr. Tear said. “There comes a point when you almost run out of steam.”Until that moment, though, they were planning to see a lot and hoping to find productions for the 2012 Brits festival. The 2011 version, which opens on Nov. 8, will include a few shows — “Shadow Boxing,” a solo piece by James Gaddas about the inner life of a boxer, is one — that they discovered a year ago in Edinburgh.“First of all, we start with the Traverse,” Mr. Tear said of that respected theater in Edinburgh, devoted to new writing. With a popular bar that serves as a networking hub at the Fringe, the Traverse usually offers some of the festival’s hardest-to-get tickets, which last year included Enda Walsh’s “Penelope,” and “Roadkill,” conceived and directed by Cora Bissett.This year the hot list is likely to include “The Wheel,” the latest from the National Theater of Scotland, the originator of “Black Watch”; “Ten Plagues,” by Mark Ravenhill and Conor Mitchell; and “The Monster in the Hall” and “The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart,” both by the Scottish playwright David Greig.Ms. Kleinhans and Mr. Tear said they would also visit the Pleasance Theater, where “Julian Sands in a Celebration of Harold Pinter,” directed by John Malkovich, and other intriguing shows will be presented. Once in Edinburgh, they will seek out lesser-known artists as well.“The first year we did this,” Ms. Kleinhans said about scouting for the 2004 Brits Off Broadway festival, “we had Frantic Assembly.”“They were a little company that worked out of the Battersea Arts Center,” she added, “and nobody knew who the hell they were.” A year ago the company’s production of “Beautiful Burnout,” a play by Bryony Lavery about young boxers in Glasgow, was a hit in Edinburgh. It met with less excitement from critics during a run at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn this year.Still, “It’s always great with Brits Off Broadway to bring in a company nobody has ever heard of,” Mr. Tear said. Past Brits programs have featured artists who are popular in Edinburgh, like the controversial writer and director Tim Crouch (no one knew who he was, either, Ms. Kleinhans said), whose production of “The Author” in Edinburgh last year, which sat actors and spectators together for a disturbing story about the portrayal of violence onstage, routinely prompted some in the audience to walk out.Ms. Kleinhans and Mr. Tear are not the only theater entrepreneurs from the United States to prospect for gold at Edinburgh. The philanthropist Carol Tambor takes in the Fringe every year and awards a Best of Edinburgh prize, which includes a fully financed Off Broadway run in New York the following winter.Susan Feldman, the artistic director of St. Ann’s Warehouse, will also be attending the Fringe. A handful of St. Ann’s productions over the last several seasons, Ms. Feldman said, were discoveries she made in Edinburgh, like Daniel Kitson’s solo play “The Interminable Suicide of Gregory Church,” which she saw in Scotland in 2009 and presented in New York this year, and “The Walworth Farce,” by Mr. Walsh, seen in Edinburgh in 2007 and at St. Ann’s the following spring. Mr. Walsh’s plays “The New Electric Ballroom” and “Penelope” were part of subsequent seasons at St. Ann’s.At 59E59, Ms. Kleinhans and Mr. Tear were asked what they looked for when they scouted shows. “We know it when we see it,” Ms. Kleinhans said a bit vaguely, then gestured toward an Edinburgh Fringe brochure: “Three-quarters of this we know right away is not anything we want.”She was not referring to content and quality alone. 59E59 is a presenter, not a producer. While it offers relatively inexpensive theater rentals, marketing and publicity assistance and theater staff for plays that will be seen there, it does not pay production costs. For a show to be booked at the complex, it must have financial backing from other sources. This is true of all productions at 59E59, including the annual East to Edinburgh Festival, also founded by Ms. Kleinhans (this year’s version ended on Sunday) and consisting in essence of warm-up performances for a handful of American productions, mostly based in New York, headed to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.Ms. Kleinhans may have sounded somewhat opaque about what she looks for in the theater, but what she avoids was crystal clear: “We don’t do Shakespeare in any way, shape or form of any kind, ever,” she said. “It’s not that I don’t like Shakespeare, but everybody does it, and it’s one of those things, like, ‘Oh, if you don’t do Shakespeare, you’re nothing.’ Well, I’m sorry, that’s one of those pretentious things that annoy the hell out of me.”Given the thickness of the festival brochure, they should have more than enough other options.'"
"'11-08-03,'1','The agribusiness conglomerate Archer Daniels Midland said Tuesday its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings fell 15 percent as a higher tax rate and inflated corn prices offset surging revenue.The company said that it earned $381 million, or 58 cents a share. That compares with $446 million, or 69 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2010.The results surprised Wall Street. Analysts expected a profit of 85 cents a share on revenue of $19.55 billion, according to FactSet. Shares fell about 6 percent, or $1.88, to $28.60 in regular trading on Tuesday.The company’s operating profit improved in every unit except corn processing. The unit’s growth was hampered by significantly higher corn costs as corn futures traded in Chicago have risen about 70 percent over the last 12 months. The prices on soybeans futures were up 34 percent.For a company like A.D.M., the volatile prices can be both good and bad. The company sells and ships grain, so it can benefit from higher prices. But it also has to buy huge quantities of grain to make processed food ingredients and additives, and higher prices eat into profit.Oil seeds processing operating profit rose by $20 million, to $379 million. Its agricultural services segment operating profit rose by $15 million, to $193 million. At A.D.M.’s other business units, which include wheat milling, cocoa processing and shares in joint ventures, operating profit jumped by $76 million to $198 million.'"
"'11-08-03,'1','Pfizer, the world’s biggest drug maker, reported second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates as sales of pain medicines offset declining revenue from expired patents.Profit excluding some items was 60 cents a share, beating by a cent the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue fell 0.9 percent to $16.98 billion, matching estimates. Sales of the company’s Lyrica pain pill and Enbrel arthritis medicine topped analysts’ predictions.Pfizer is selling its animal health and infant formula units and trimming its work force to prepare for the loss in November of exclusive rights to Lipitor, the world’s best-selling drug, with $10.7 billion in annual sales. Pfizer has three late-stage experimental medicines that analysts estimate may bring in more than $3.5 billion annually by 2015.“Investors are shifting their focus back to the pipeline, shifting back to the cost cutting and the share repurchases,” said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar. “We probably have one more quarter where the divestitures will be of high interest, but people are going back to the core business.”Net income rose 5.2 percent to $2.61 billion, or 33 cents a share, from $2.48 billion, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Pfizer reiterated its 2011 profit forecast range of $2.16 to $2.26 a share. It also maintained its guidance for 2012, the first full year of generic competition to Lipitor.Shares of Pfizer, which is based in New York, fell 87 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $18.14.Revenue at Pfizer’s animal health division rose 18 percent to $1.056 billion for the quarter, the company said. Nutrition sales climbed 4 percent to $493 million.'"
"'11-08-03,'1','“We are in a climate of stable instability,” said Massimo Franco, the chief political columnist of Italy’s leading daily, Corriere della Sera. “The risk is that this instability will become more dramatic because of the market speculation,” he added. “But Italy is trapped in this phase. Berlusconi has no exit. To have a different government, Berlusconi would need to stand down, and he won’t.”Critics have accused the prime minister of focusing more on his personal legal woes than on the country’s problems. The financial pressure on Italy is rising, and despite approving almost $70 billion in spending cuts and tax increases last month, politicians say the country needs to pass new austerity measures as soon as September.Last week, Mr. Tremonti defended the $5,700 he paid in cash each month to stay in a Rome apartment owned by Marco Milanese. Prosecutors are seeking to arrest Mr. Milanese on charges of passing confidential information about a criminal investigation to a businessman in exchange for cash and gifts.In response to criticism that cash payments are a classic means of tax evasion, the finance minister said he had done nothing untoward. “There was nothing under the table, nothing irregular,” Mr. Tremonti wrote in a letter to Corriere della Sera on Friday. In the letter, Mr. Tremonti, whose home is in Pavia, outside Milan, said he had “made a mistake” in not having left the apartment sooner.Mr. Tremonti added that he had chosen against having a formal rental contract “not for economic convenience, but for privacy.”A more surreal plot twist takes place largely between the lines. According to some news reports that cite judicial sources, Mr. Tremonti has testified that he chose to stay in the apartment when in Rome, and not in a hotel or government accommodation, because he was afraid that some members of his security detail were spying on him and gathering information to use against him.Parliament is expected to vote in September on whether to allow prosecutors to arrest Mr. Milanese.Popular anger is rising at the unwillingness of Parliament, which just raised taxes and health care co-payments for Italians, to make cuts in politicians’ perks, pensions and expense accounts.In recent weeks, a blog called Secrets of the Caste of Montecitorio, named after the building that houses Italy’s lower house, has gained considerable traction. The blog has a running ticker of lawmaker perks, including reduced cellphone rates and discounted Fiat cars. The site is run by “Spider Truman,” a man who insists on anonymity and claims he worked as an assistant to a member of Parliament and was paid under the table with no formal contract until being fired this year.Members of Parliament earn $16,600 a month before taxes, and about $10,200 more to cover expenses or pay aides — whom they can choose on their own and without any formal screening process.Gian Antonio Stella, a journalist and the co-author with Sergio Rizzo of “The Caste,” a 2007 best-selling exposé about the staggering cost of Italian politics, figured that Americans spent about $7 a year on their politicians, whereas Italians paid closer to $38.The austerity measures passed last month include pension cuts, tax increases and wage freezes for Italians — but not for politicians. According to Italian news reports, a group of Parliament members met before the vote and removed reductions to salaries and chauffeured cars.The anger “is growing, it’s something very clear,” Mr. Stella said. “We can tell from the letters we get. This time readers on the right understand that it’s not the fault of the left. Readers on the right have finally understood that it’s also the fault of the right.”With the anger growing, Mr. Berlusconi appears to be circling the wagons. Adding to the increasingly paranoid climate here, Corriere della Sera published a front-page report over the weekend that Mr. Berlusconi was growing ever more worried that the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, once his ally, now wanted him dead for Italy’s support of NATO’s intervention in Libya.“I’ve heard this from my reliable sources,” the newspaper said, attributing the words to Mr. Berlusconi through an omniscient narrator approach common in Italian journalism.Mr. Berlusconi’s office later issued a characteristically florid denial, calling the report “the fruit of the most fervid fantasy.”'"
"'11-08-03,'1','The Mixtec farmworkers are recent arrivals, having migrated first within Mexico where they picked cotton or cut sugar cane. Many hail from home villages that are specks on the map, like San Martin Peras, an impoverished community of fewer than 1,500 people.For Antonio Barrera, originally from the state of Guerrero, who rises long before dawn to pick onions, the market is “an entertainment” that reminds him of home. Many farmworkers have come from remote villages without electricity, down tortuous gravel roads, hours from a semblance of a supermarket. Arriving in the Central Valley, they might earn $8 an hour if they are lucky, and often what amounts to $3 an hour for a piece rate.Speaking in 16 indigenous Oaxacan languages, the laborers trade recipes, discuss politics back home and exchange intelligence on who is hiring around the valley and what the job pays. They argue over whether it is better to buy nopales, the fleshy pads of edible prickly pear cactuses, cut up or whole.There are roughly 7,000 Mixtec people in greater Madera, said Edward Kissam, a farm labor researcher and consultant. The Madera School District had a Mixtec interpreter until last year, when the position was eliminated because of budget cuts.In , indigenous Mexican farmworkers are the poorest of the poor, with a median family income of $13,750 compared with $22,500 for their mestizo — the Spanish term for people of mixed European and Indian heritage — counterparts, according to a 2007-9 Indigenous Farmworker study done in conjunction with California Rural Legal Assistance Inc.Language is a pressing issue: Farmworkers from Oaxaca speak neither Spanish nor English, making it difficult to follow a doctor’s prescription or respond to a criminal charge. It also makes indigenous migrants vulnerable to exploitation, like getting short-changed on hours or piece-rates, said Irma Luna, a community worker for California Rural Legal Assistance.“It’s very difficult to get by, and because of language barriers, people don’t complain,” Ms. Luna said.Within the material culture of the market, the subtleties of everyday life are revealed: washboards instead of washing machines, for instance, or bicycle parts for the many shoppers who do not own cars.Rey Rodriguez, the 36-year-old son of Zapotec farmworkers, grew up in Oceanside, Calif., and has a thriving business selling Mixtecs $10 DVD videos from annual village fiestas.“They want to see who is dancing with whom,” observed Hugo Morales, a former MacArthur fellow and founder of Radio Bilingüe, the country’s largest Spanish-language public radio network.“The women often dance together because the men are absent,” said Mr. Morales, who is Mixtec. “We Mixtecos yearn to be back in our villages, but many of us don’t have the legal papers or the money to go back, so the Madera market is a space for comfort — despite the over 100-degree heat.”Sergio Aguilar-Gaxiola, a professor of clinical internal medicine and director of the Center for Reducing Health Disparities at the School of Medicine at the , said that in addition to supporting the traditional diet, the market had a mental-health dimension. “It counteracts a host of stressors, such as social exclusion,” he said.At the market, the stress is often disguised with beauty. Sitting beside a mountain of chiles, Socorro Guiterrez was selling crepe-paper flowers that she fashions by hand. Her deepest sadness, a serious injury and the death of nine companions in a van accident while coming home from the fields, was not readily apparent — invisible in colorful crepe-paper petals, as delicate as life.'"
"'11-08-03,'1','“As the macro data comes out, it seems like we may have more on our hands than just getting the debt ceiling raised,” said Myles Zyblock, chief institutional strategist and managing director of capital markets research at RBC Capital Markets.“We get no default, but the bad news is there is a growth trade-off,” he said. “They had to agree on fiscal contraction that would weigh on growth.”Stanley Nabi, the chief strategist for Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said he was starting to hear the word “recession” in questions from clients over the last few days.Recent economic data is already weak, he said, noting the G.D.P. revisions on Friday that indicated the recession was deeper and the recovery more fragile than originally thought. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said personal spending fell 0.2 percent in June, the first time it has declined since September 2009. And now that the debt ceiling deal has offered up the prospect of lower spending from the government, Mr. Nabi said, “Who is going to drive the economy?”“You can’t rely on capital spending,” he said. “Trade is not strong enough to make that much of a difference. As far as the economy is concerned, what the data is showing is the economy has no momentum.”Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager at Federated Investors, said, “The challenges that we are facing economically are that the hits just keep coming. We do have somewhat of a resolution to our budgetary impasse, but that does not overwhelm the fact that, economically speaking, that the data continues to deteriorate.”The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 32.89, or 2.56 percent, at 1,254.05, erasing all of the gains it had made this year. The Dow Jones industrial plummeted 265.87 points, or 2.19 percent, to 11,866.62, with a big dropoff toward the end of trading. And the Nasdaq index fell 75.37 points, or 2.75 percent, 2,669.24.As the markets spiraled, analysts sifted through indexes, graphs and numbers, trying to balance risk and opportunity.Stephen Wood, the chief markets strategist for Russell Investments, noted that the so-called fear index, or Vix, was “bouncing around a lot.” It was down at 24.67, below its high for the year, but also up from the last few weeks when it had hit the teens, even as low as 14.62 at the end of April.“This is a risk-on, risk-off market,” Mr. Wood said. “You see waves of risk acceptance, then risk aversion.“My take on it is volatility will be your constant travel companion,” he said, listing the recent euro zone problems, the latest debt ceiling debates, talk of a United States credit downgrade and the potential for an economic slowdown ahead.“A lot of these variables need to be priced in,” he said.The benchmark 10-year Treasury was at 2.61 percent, compared with 2.75 percent late on Monday. For the month of July, the note was down 37 basis points to 2.80 percent, compared with 3.17 percent in June.Analysts said that the yields showed them that even as the instruments might have been in the line of fire of any government default, their price rose, suggesting economic growth concerns were overriding.“The bond market has a very loud voice,” Mr. Wood said. “And the bond market is telling us that the bond market is more worried about the global economic slowdown than it is about downgrade or default.”One of the largest looming economic indicators in the United States comes on Friday, when the Labor Department releases its national report on jobs, with estimates that the economy added 85,000 nonfarm payrolls in July, according to a Bloomberg News survey, compared with the 18,000 tacked on to payrolls in June.Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at First American Funds, said the behavior of the market on Tuesday is “a bit different than the crisis feel.”“It seems there is an asset allocation change going on oriented around lousy economic data recently, and perhaps there is some prepositioning to that and the expectation of numbers coming in well below the consensus,” he said, referring to Friday’s job report.Still, one bright spot might be the corporate sector. Second-quarter earnings are on the verge of setting a record, and records are also expected for the remaining two quarters of this year, according to a recent survey by Howard Silverblatt, S.& P.’s index analyst.But even that could be in flux.Uri Landesman, the president of Platinum Partners, said that investors were discounting the news of the debt deal and, with such poor economic data, starting to question the viability of corporate earnings for the second half of the year.“Economic data has been a disaster,” he said. “It’s clunker after clunker.“If the economy is desultory, how are the earnings going to excel?”'"

"'11-08-04,'0','On Thursday, more than 14 billion shares changed hands, the heaviest selling in more than a year. In addition to being unnerved by weaker economic data reported in recent days, investors appeared to lose their optimism about the strength of corporate profits that had driven increases in the stock market in the first half of this year.At the close, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 60.27 points, or 4.78 percent, to 1,200.07. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 512.76 points, or 4.31 percent, to 11,383.68, and the Nasdaq was down 136.68, or 5.08 percent, to 2,556.39.The S.& P. 500 has now fallen 10.7 percent from 1,345 on July 22, underlining the new negative sentiment about the economy and about Europe.“We are now in correction mode,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s. “We could have another couple of weeks to go before it bottoms.”The last time the market was in a correction was last summer, when it fell 16 percent before recovering.Analysts said markets were still healthy and the United States was now stronger than just a few years ago so that a repeat of the financial crisis was unlikely.“There is a huge difference — during the financial crisis the banking sector broke down. Right now it’s a crisis of confidence based on weak economies but the banking sector is not broken,” said Reena Aggarwal, professor of finance at .The Vix, which measures the implied volatility of options on the S.& P. 500 index, and is called the fear index by traders, spiked on Thursday, though it is still much lower than during the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.’s reaction to the market’s tumble was muted. The said it did not plan to issue any statements or provide officials to comment.“Markets go up and down,” said the White House spokesman, Jay Carney. “We obviously are monitoring the situation in Europe closely.”As the prospects for economic growth dimmed, several commodities, including oil, silver and palladium, fell by more than 5 percent, perhaps producing some good news for consumers.With oil prices dropping below $87 a barrel, wiping out the rise caused by unrest in the and North Africa earlier in the year, drivers can expect sharply lower gasoline prices  just in time for the Labor Day weekend and back-to-school shopping.Agricultural crops and most industrial metals fell somewhat less drastically, with copper falling 1.9 percent, aluminum by 1.7 percent, corn by 1.9 percent, wheat by 3.4 percent and soybeans by 1.8 percent.Taken together, the drops should mean lower input costs for manufacturers and give the Federal Reserve more policy options should the economy continue to slow.A closely-watched survey of American investor attitudes provided by the American Association of Individual investors on Thursday showed the biggest increase in bearish sentiment for five years in the latest week. As investors fled assets like stocks, they piled into the perceived safety of United States Treasuries where 10-year interest rates fell to 2.41 percent, recording the biggest one day fall since March 2009.Yields on one-month United States notes actually fell into negative territory before closing at zero.Besides piling into Treasuries, institutional investors are also seeking out the safety of cold, hard cash, pouring billions into commercial bank accounts backed up by the . Investors had also been buying Swiss francs and Japanese yen. But earlier this week, unexpectedly cut interest rates in an effort to weaken the franc. on Thursday also intervened to weaken its currency, raising the specter that more nations could take similar steps to try to protect their economies.Around the world, markets from to were battered.In , stocks closed down 3.43 percent. In Germany, the DAX index dropped 3.4 percent. In , the CAC 40 closed down 3.9 percent.“It really is Europe today,” said Barry Knapp, head of United States equity strategy at Capital. “The market feels that European leaders are one step behind, and they are.”Asian markets quickly followed suit in trading lower. In midday trading on Friday, the Nikkei 225 in Japan was down 3.47 percent to 9,312.22 while the S.& P./ASX 200 index in fell 3.98 percent to 4,106.40. The Hang Seng index in opened sharply lower as well, and was down 4.6 percent to 20,865.95 by midday.With some warning signs that weaker European banks are struggling to fund themselves, the central bank moved to help weaker by expanding its lending to institutions in zone. Bank stocks nevertheless fell sharply in Europe.In the United States, as the stock market fell, it broke through critical support levels, leading to more selling as traders rushed to reduce exposure to plummeting prices.  That included computerized program traders, one analyst said.'"

"'11-08-04,'0','Since Europe’s second major rescue package was announced last month — aimed as much at calming fears over Spain and Italy as providing funds to Greece — the yields on Spanish and Italian bonds have hit more than 6 percent, sharply higher than they were paying on new borrowings just a couple of months ago.In doing so they have entered what analysts refer to as the “danger zone” for 10-year bond yields, with the cost of government borrowing so high that investors become unnerved, as was the case with bailed-out Greece, Portugal and Ireland.Bearing the immediate brunt of this development are regional banking heavyweights such as UniCredit in Italy and Santander and BBVA in Spain, which traditionally have been reliable financing machines to their home governments and as a result are now saddled with large bond holdings that are losing value by the day.Many of these banks hold domestic bond portfolios that exceed their capital levels.According to a report issued on Wednesday by Sanford Bernstein, a research firm, UniCredit’s exposure to mostly Italian bonds is 121 percent of its core capital ratio. For Intesa, a less-diversified competitor, that figure rises to 175 percent. For Spain, the ratios are no less daunting: a startling 193 percent for BBVA, Spain’s second-largest bank, and a less alarming 76 percent for the global banking giant Santander.As a result, the markets have begun to focus on a number of warning signs that some European banks are finding it harder to meet their funding needs, especially in dollars.They are borrowing larger amounts directly from the European Central Bank in its weekly lending operations, suggesting they can’t find all the money they need from the private sector to keep themselves going.Some analysts said perhaps most worrying was that the rate it costs European banks to borrow dollars in the open foreign exchange market, by swapping their holdings of euros, has shot up twofold in the past few days — still far below the levels seen in 2008 when the market virtually froze but the highest since May 2010 when the European debt crisis first started to intensify.Recent write-offs by French banks over their own Greek bond holdings have compounded fears over the health of Europe’s banks.“I don’t think anyone wants to be long European banks right now,” said Simon White, an analyst and partner at Variant Perception, a London-based research firm.UniCredit, Italy’s largest lender, reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Wednesday and in a conference call, the bank’s chief executive said it had completed 83 percent of its borrowing needs for the year.Nevertheless, that profit snapshot does not fully take into account the steep rise in Italian government bonds, from about 4.6 percent in early June to just over 6 percent now, which means that the value of those bonds has fallen.Even more worrying is the fact that the European Financial Stability Facility, Europe’s so-called bazooka rescue fund that it endowed last month with the powers to recapitalize weak banks, will not be able to offer any such aid for at least two months.According to a stability fund official, staff members there are working night and day to recast the entity, but do not expect to be finished until the end of August. At that point, it must be approved by the parliaments of the 17 countries that use the euro currency.Only then could it go to the market and raise funds to help a bank in need.That may well be too late.As investors flee Spanish and Italian government bonds, these huge bond holdings have become a significant millstone on their countries’ banks — curbing their ability to lend and, consequently, heightening the prospect of a double-dip recession in Italy and Spain, two of the euro zone’s slowest-growing economies.Despite their best efforts to deleverage, all these banks have loans that significantly exceed their deposits. That makes them dependent on the good lending graces of their banking peers in Europe and the United States. This is one of the reasons American money market funds had more that 40 percent of their assets invested in European banks.Standard banking practice has been for these banks to put up as collateral their home market government bonds, which in the past were seen as liquid, risk-free investments — much like United States Treasuries.If, as was the case with Ireland and Greece, lenders stop accepting these bonds or start demanding more of the bonds to reflect their lower value, these banks may no longer be able to access the day-to-day financing that is their life blood. This is what happened during the crisis in the fall of 2008, when banks stopped lending to one another, causing markets to seize up — and leading the government to bail them out or risk the weakest banks failing.“You could have a C.F.O. of a lending bank say, ‘Look, I just do not want to take this credit risk,’ ” said Marcello Zanardo, a European Bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “We are not there yet — but it is not impossible to get there.”What is worrying many bank analysts — and surely the banks themselves — is that, in an investor panic, one might get there sooner rather than later.One possibility is that LCH.Clearnet, the London clearing entity that in a transaction between two banks or other counterparties assumes the risk if the trade fails, may begin to demand more collateral if these securities continue to lose value.That would mean that an Italian or Spanish bank putting up a government bond to back a short-term loan or repurchase agreement would see that bond marked down by its clearer, forcing it to put up more bonds — or accept less cash to fund its operations.According to LCH, once the spread between, say, a Spanish or Italian government bond and a benchmark AAA bond index surpasses 4.5 percent, the issuer is liable for a trimming. At that point, the borrower is forced to put up more government bonds as security, and if the spread continues to widen is ultimately forced out of the market.But in some cases, demands for more collateral are already being imposed. According to one London-based banker, who declined to be identified, LCH has already begun to require large Spanish banks to put up more bonds to cover transactions.Such was the case earlier with Greek, Irish and Portuguese banks. Exiled from the interbank market — in which banks lend to each other — they were forced to turn to the European Central Bank to satisfy their pressing requirements. So far, Italian and Spanish banks have made minimal use of the central bank’s emergency financing facility.If this trend continues, Merrill Lynch wrote in a report on Wednesday, it “would have a very significant impact not only on Spanish spreads but also on the level of interbank stress. Resulting in full contagion within the euro zone.”'"

The company might pursue both options.Pfizer announced last month that it was looking to sell or spin off animal health and baby formula businesses to streamline the company and help prepare for the loss of Lipitor sales to generic competitors.But the company decided to keep two businesses that Wall Street had speculated might be sold: the generic drug business and the consumer business, which now sells products like Advil and Robitussin. That has led to speculation that the company was planning to sell generic and over-the-counter versions of Lipitor and other drugs that face a loss of patent protection.Pfizer’s plans for the nonprescription Lipitor were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would no doubt be welcomed by insurers because it would cost less.In the past, the F.D.A. advisers have been concerned that over-the counter versions of statins could not be used safely, that some patients who did not need the drugs would take them.Others at significant risk of cardiovascular problems might take the over-the-counter drug and forgo seeing a doctor or getting other necessary care.Since high cholesterol is a symptomless condition, consumers would not know whether the drug was working without having their cholesterol checked periodically.But Steven Francesco of Francesco International, a consulting firm that specializes in converting brand name drugs to over-the-counter products, said technology such as prescription cards used at the drug store would better allow patients to be monitored without physician supervision.“There’s any number of ways to insure that the consumer can use the drug,” said Mr. Francesco. “Lipitor will be one of the first of many drugs that will attempt to switch between now and 2016.”'"
"'11-08-04,'0','The Mets did not end their four-game losing streak Wednesday night, but not because of any bullpen meltdowns or fielding gaffes: their scheduled game against the Florida Marlins at Citi Field was rained out.The postponement was announced at 8:25 p.m., eliciting groans from the considerable crowd lingering in the stadium’s covered concourses.The rainout gave the Mets, who have Thursday off, an additional day of rest before their series this weekend against the Braves, whom they trail by eight games in the National League wild-card race.Had Wednesday’s game been played, it would have been the Mets’ 20th in a row without a day off. Their skid has come after they won five straight on the road last week.Dillon Gee, who was scheduled to start for the Mets, said that the rainout was an annoyance for him, but that it would also give his teammates a welcome break in a hectic period of their schedule.“I hate having to change the routine and the days’ rest,” said Gee, who will now start Sunday. “It kind of throws you off. But at the same time, it’ll be nice to have a few extra days’ rest.”'"
"'11-08-04,'0','BAGHDAD — American officials said Wednesday that an announcement by the Iraqi government that it was ready to open formal discussions with the United States about keeping some troops in Iraq after the end of the year was a positive first step toward resolving the question about the American military’s future presence here.The Iraqi government said early Wednesday morning that it could begin talks about keeping a limited training force in the country. Under a 2008 agreement between the two countries, about 48,000 American troops remaining in Iraq must leave by the end of 2011. As part of that agreement, the Iraqi government ultimately decides if it wants some troops to remain.American officials were encouraged by the announcement, because the Iraqi government has been paralyzed for months by political bickering, which has delayed a decision on whether any American forces will stay past the deadline.Senior United States military officials have been warning the Iraqi government since the spring that because of the logistics in moving the American troops, the Iraqis had very little time to decide whether American forces would stay after this year. And while the Americans have been privately telling their Iraqi counterparts that they want some troops to stay and the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has been privately telling the Americans that it wants their Army to stay, a number of Iraqi political factions have publicly resisted the idea of a continued American military presence.A United States Embassy official said the Iraqi government’s announcement was an important political step, because nearly all the blocs in Parliament supported it. A significant exception was the Sadrists, led by Moktada al-Sadr, an anti-American Shiite cleric who has called on his followers to attack American forces if they remain after the deadline.The embassy official said that the possibility of American troops staying beyond this year “does not reflect the presence of American combat troops doing anything like what they’ve done in the past here. The Iraqi combat forces are quite capable of internal defense.”'"
"'11-08-04,'0','And engage they did, according to Flite, the media and technology company that produced the ad.Consumers on average spent 30 seconds interacting with the ad, compared with an average of what, according to Google, is just 11 seconds. In addition to spending more time on the ad, consumers were more likely to click on a “learn more” button to go to Mrs. Meyers’ own Web site, with 35 of every 1,000 users clicking through, compared with an average, again, of just one in 1,000.“Brands are building a great presence on social networks and are looking at ways of making it more accessible,” said Giles Goodwin, president for product and technology at Flite.The company refers to its technology as a “cloud-based ad platform” because it infuses ads with live content from other sites including Facebook and Twitter, and it has produced such ads recently for brands including Coca-Cola, Lancôme, Volkswagen and AT&T.Another media and technology company, Kontera, is taking a similar approach with in-text advertising, where advertisers pay for keywords to be hyperlinked within an article or blog post. While clicking such words often takes users to an advertiser’s Web site, with Kontera, ads pop out in a window on the same page, and many ads that Kontera is doing these days highlight advertisers’ social networks over their products.In recent ads for Ritz crackers, the Kraft brand, for example, the brand wanted to highlight a promotion with “Glee” that included a sweepstakes to win a trip to meet the cast of the Fox show on their set in Los Angeles.On the Kontera network of sites — which include those for the magazines U.S. News & World Report, Shape and Men’s Fitness — words in content likely to relate to the show, including of course the word “glee” and the names of both the characters and the actors who play them, were highlighted. Positioning the cursor over those words caused an ad to pop out in a window that promoted the sweepstakes and highlighted posts on the Ritz Facebook page about the show and contest.“Social media is not a tactic that stands alone from your advertising campaigns,” said Chris Karl, a senior vice president at Kontera.The “Glee” in-text ads presented themselves to fans of the show when they were most likely to be reading about it, then ended up signing them up as followers of the brand on Facebook, which was required in order to enter the sweepstakes.As for why Ritz aligned itself with the television show to begin, the crackers, often served at social occasions, share the show’s spirit of being “all about fun and a champion of fun,” said Sheeba Philip, the marketing director for Ritz.“A program like Kontera’s is really effective for reaching consumers with common and shared passion points,” Ms. Philip said. “It really was a push to drive people to Facebook to learn more about the brand.”For other in-text ads by Kontera for Verizon, the brand did not even promote its own social network account, but rather that of Will Power, the race car driver who competes in the Indy Racing League, and whom Verizon sponsors. While Mr. Power is not, of course, likely to send Twitter messages with Verizon slogans, in the photo of the driver posing alongside his car on top of his Twitter page, the Verizon logo is prominent on both his uniform and car.Andy Smith, a co-author (with Jennifer Aaker) of “The Dragonfly Effect: Quick, Effective, and Powerful Ways to Use Social Media to Drive Social Change,” said incorporating live content from Facebook and Twitter allows online ads “to feel less static,” and even to be “at least as current if not more current” than adjacent editorial content.Even if those live snippets in ads include brands apologizing about missteps or customers griping, it still could benefit advertisers because in an era when consumers actually become friends with companies on Facebook, those consumers may expect some warts-and-all human characteristics.“There is transparency in being willing to say, ‘This is what people are saying about us,’ ” Mr. Smith said. “And with the relationships that people have with brands today, the more honest and human they seem, the more likely consumers are to like them and stick with them.”'"
"'11-08-04,'0','The price of Clorox bleach will rise 12 percent in the United States, the latest move by the company to fight rising material costs that have cut into profits.Clorox, which has rebuffed two takeover offers from Carl C. Icahn, also said Wednesday that its fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell less than expected and that costs in the current fiscal year will rise less than it previously thought.The company also announced price increases on several of its other products including Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing, Formula 409, Clorox 2 stain fighter and Glad wraps.Clorox, which makes cleansers, charcoal, salad dressing and other goods, is more heavily exposed to volatile commodity prices than some larger peers like Procter & Gamble. The commodities Clorox buys include resin and sodium hypochlorite.“Those pricing increases look pretty aggressive, but I’m sure they’ve thought this through,” said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones. “They realize there’s going to be some volume hit from this.”'"
"'11-08-04,'0','Two major titles were decided on Sunday, the last day of the Summer North American Championships in Toronto.The Spingold final was won by Team Monaco: Pierre Zimmermann, Franck Multon, Fulvio Fantoni, Claudio Nunes, Geir Helgemo and Tor Helness. In the 64-board match it defeated Nick Nickell, Ralph Katz, Bob Hamman, Zia Mahmood, Jeff Meckstroth and Eric Rodwell by 132 international match points to 86. (Conceding fewer than 1.5 imps per board is excellent.)The Roth Open Swiss Teams was captured by Mark Gordon, Pratap Rajadhyaksha, David Berkowitz, Alan Sontag, Terje Aa and Jorgen Molberg. They finished 8.5 victory points ahead of Aaron Silverstein, Chris Willenken, Michael Rosenberg, Andrew Rosenthal, Bjorn Fallenius and Peter Fredin.After 30 boards of the Spingold final the scores were locked at 60 imps each. The diagramed deal was Board 31. It nearly featured an unusual double game swing, in which East-West make game at one table and teammates North-South make a different game at the other table.At the first table Nunes (West) opened two hearts, showing 10 to 13 high-card points (or a good nine) and either six-plus hearts or five hearts and four-card or longer minor. Rodwell (North) passed. Fantoni (East) responded two spades, which was a relay with either a weak hand and length in the minors or at least game-invitational strength. Meckstroth (South) overcalled three diamonds. After two passes East signed off in three no-trump.To go plus, North and South needed to be looking at all 52 cards. Understandably, South led a diamond (the ten, according to partnership agreement). East won with his king and returned a diamond. South rose with his ace and shifted to a low spade, but declarer had a fourth-round stopper to make his contract.'"
"'11-08-04,'0','On Wednesday, new data showed that expansion in the services sector was slowing. The Institute for Supply Management index for the nonmanufacturing sector declined to 52.7 in July, the lowest level since February 2010.Adrian Cronje, the chief investment officer of Balentine, said that as concerns persisted about the euro zone and the United States economy, investors were starting to turn their focus to whether the debt ceiling deal’s cuts could create further headwinds for growth and whether earnings, one of the few bright spots, could be sustained.“People are really taking a step back and saying, ‘How long can this period of record corporate profits continue?’ ” he asked. “There is very little room now to stimulate the economy if it continues to underperform expectations.”Another analyst said that now that the debt ceiling process was in the rear-view mirror, it might actually help alleviate some of the uncertainty. He added that the economic indicators were slowing, partly because of supply problems related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and other issues, but not grinding to a halt.“In general we are seeing by and large it is just less growth,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist of Key Private Bank. “Our conclusion is a lot of the measures are still backward looking.”“Consumers will spend more once we get beyond the insanity of Washington and alleviate worries,” he added, saying that people were worried about the debt ceiling negotiations in addition to the slower economy.“In general the market tends to be gripped by emotional excess,” said Mr. McCain. “There was certainly a lot of disappointment over surprisingly bad news but in the end of it you step back and say, ‘We have driven prices remarkably lower,’ and the selling excesses exhaust themselves. You get a chance to bounce off the bottom.”He said the current climate has led him to become more neutral, but not defensive.“We are just not going to take big bets,” he said.But the debt ceiling deal has not completely removed doubts about the impact on the credit rating. “Bonds are seesawing on whether there still could be a potential downgrade,” Mr. Cronje said.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note slipped 1/32, to 104 12/32, and the yield rose to 2.62 percent from 2.61 percent late Tuesday.Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings reaffirmed their triple-A rating for the United States, but Moody’s put a negative outlook on the country’s rating on Tuesday, a sign that a downgrade remains possible. It warned that further fiscal consolidation would probably be needed and that any slowing in United States economic growth also would pose a risk.Fitch echoed the caution, saying that while the debt ceiling agreement reached in Washington was an important first step, it was “not the end of the process toward putting in place a credible plan to reduce the budget deficit to a level that would secure the United States’ AAA status over the medium-term.”'"

"'11-08-05,'1','“The whole country is watching this movement,” said Eduardo Beltrán, 17, a student at Instituto Nacional, where the students have seized control of the school. “The generation of our parents,” he said, “is watching us with hope, with faith that we have the strength to change this education system and make history.”Even as Chile appears to the outside world to be a model of economic consistency and prudent fiscal management, there is deep discontent here with the neoliberal model and its economic consequences for those who are not part of the economic elite.The sentiments have been building for years, but have begun spilling out only recently. In 2010, when Mr. Piñera became the nation’s first right-wing president since the dictatorship of Gen. , young voters stayed on the sidelines, with few of them registering to vote. But last Friday, Mr. Piñera noted that Chileans were witnessing a “new society” where people “feel more empowered and want to feel they are heard.”He said Chileans were rebelling against “excessive inequality” in a country that has the highest per capita income in Latin America but also has one of the most unequal distributions of wealth in the region. “They are asking for a more just society, a more egalitarian society,” he said, “because the inequalities we are living in Chile are excessive and, I feel, immoral.”Still, he has also shown impatience with the protesters, saying this week that “there is a limit to everything.”The education protests have become ever more creative. There are at least two or three people jogging at all times around La Moneda, the presidential palace, trying to complete 1,800 laps to symbolize the $1.8 billion a year that protesters are demanding for Chile’s public education system. They carry flags that say “Free Education Now.”Others have held a mass kiss-in, dressed like superheroes, danced as zombies to Michael Jackson’s and even staged fake group suicides where they fall in a heap of bodies.Students and teachers say they are determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2006, when a protest movement dubbed Los Pinguinos (“the Penguins”), named after the dark blue-and-white ties of some students’ school uniforms, created a crisis for former President but ultimately failed to win deep reforms.The protests then were over unequal funding and the quality of elementary and middle school education, a complaint that remains. But this year the focus has widened to include demands for a more affordable and accessible university system. General Pinochet decreed a system in 1981 that encouraged the development of private, , which has led to high levels of student debt.Before the Pinochet decree, there were eight state-financed universities and fewer than 150,000 university students in Chile. The state began reducing government funding for public universities, and dozens of private universities sprouted. Today there are 1.1 million students in Chilean universities, in a country of about 17 million people. More of those students are in private colleges than in public ones.“There is a very chaotic and broken-down system,” said María Olivia Monckeberg, author of two books on Chile’s university system. “The students and their families are tremendously indebted,” she added, and educational “quality is totally debatable.”That has led to some tough choices for many university students. “I’d like to study , but I’m not sure I can because of the price,” said Ms. Roque, one of the hunger strikers. “I don’t have the means to pay for it.”Mr. Piñera had promised to address university reform, but by late April student leaders had lost patience and began organizing protests. High school student groups and the country’s teachers’ association soon joined forces, demanding, among other things, that municipal grade schools, many of which are badly run down, be brought under the umbrella of the national Ministry of Education to ensure equitable funding and accountability.The protests leaders are also pushing for constitutional change to guarantee free, quality education from preschool through high school and a state-financed university system that ensures quality and equal access.Where students have taken control of public schools, they have organized security details and held out cans on streets asking for change to pay for food and supplies.The three dozen or so students who remained on hunger strikes this week have huddled under wool hats and blankets in the unheated schools. At Ms. Choapa and Ms. Roque’s school, four hunger strikers, ages 17 and 18, camped on mattresses in a second-floor room. At another school, student leaders require people to wear hospital masks and disinfect their hands with gel before talking to three hunger-striking girls.“For many years our parents’ generation was afraid to demonstrate, to complain, thinking it was better to conform to what was going on,” said Camila Vallejo Dowling, the leader of a university student group. “Students are setting an example without the fear our parents had.”'"
"'11-08-05,'1','Hardship is nothing new for “The County” (as everyone in Maine calls it). “This area was never rich in the first place,” explained the professor’s wife, Kate, who runs a bed and breakfast. The county took its hit in the ’90s when Loring Air Force Base closed. “It’s not as if things are so much harder than they were. They’ve never been easy in the first place.”As I headed away from the three-story-tall cross-section sculpture of the Sun, the inner planets came swiftly. Each mile represents one astronomical unit, the distance between the Earth and the Sun; I passed the silver model of Mercury in 0.4 miles, followed by a red and white Venus outside the Budget Traveler Inn. There, Stephanie McIntosh, a desk clerk, said occupancy was down except during snowmobiling season and the Maine Potato Blossom Festival. The best part of the festival, she said, is the mashed potato wrestling contest.A cloudless planet Earth, about the size of a navel orange, sat on the top of a pole outside of Percy’s Auto Sales. Brian Rackliffe, a salesman there, told me sales have improved since the dark days of 2008. “But they have a long, long way to go before we’re back to normal.”I found Mars by the “Welcome to Presque Isle” sign on the way out of town. From there, it was a long way to . I passed fields of potatoes, hay and broccoli, and in a ditch near a lot filled with construction equipment, a model of Ceres that represented the asteroid belt.Jupiter was by a sign marked “Moose Crossing.” Five miles beyond was Saturn, which had its own parking lot. It was hard not to be impressed by the planet, with its beautiful rings, built by students at local schools. “Saturn weighs over a ton,” Professor McCartney told me.Next was Uranus, at the Bridgewater rec center, where a sign read, “Congratulations Chloe Wheeler. 2011 Pre-Teen Miss Potato Blossom.” Then there was Neptune, a blue basketball-size sphere another 12 miles down the highway, in front of a large of what looked like squash or vines. Potatoes are still Aroostook County’s No. 1 agricultural crop, but the industry has been in decline for years, the result of shifting consumer tastes and competition from other states, particularly cursed . As I looked up at Neptune, it was clear that the planet had been through a few rough years itself. Paint was flaking around its equator.I’d been wondering how the people of Aroostook County would handle Pluto, since it had been downgraded from planet to dwarf planet in 2006. Professor McCartney admitted that the demotion had hit him hard. With a Mainer’s mix of cussedness and generosity, he reacted to Pluto’s degradation by putting up a second Pluto. He also added a model for Eris, another dwarf planet.At the second Pluto, I met a woman who said she’d spent her whole life in Aroostook County. “My son’s the son of a potato farmer,” she said, “but he had to leave. Now he’s a sea captain. It’s always a problem, keeping the young people from going away.”Earlier in the day, I had driven up to Limestone, Me., on the Canadian border, to the old Air Force base. Once it was a weapons storage area and home to the 42nd Bomb Wing. Now the whole area is called the “Loring Commerce Centre,” a name that I tried hard not to find ironic. As a storm came on, I drove past ruined, rusted hangars, fields of decommissioned military vehicles and a rotting structure with four towers resembling desolated, ruined minarets. After a couple of wrong turns, I accidentally wound up on the vast, wind-swept runway, as rain blew horizontally past my car and lightning struck the ground.The skies cleared on my way to Eris. Driving, I saw the St. Croix River off to the east, and the green forests of beyond, and a black Labrador retriever with a snake in its mouth.When I finally found the dwarf planet, it was across the street from a shuttered general store and next to a veterans’ memorial with a flagpole and no flag. But there was a new store a few doors down, selling lures and cheeseburgers. Loggers were pulling their trucks into the parking lot, their rigs full of newly hewn timber.I cast a glance north, toward the distant model of the Sun, and remembered something Kate McCartney had told me. “People always think the end of the universe is coming,” she said, referring not only to deadly asteroids but to the American economy as well. “But we’re more resilient than that. You drive the Maine Solar System Model, the speed of light is seven miles per hour.” She smiled. “At that speed, you have to believe everything is going to be all right.”'"
"'11-08-05,'1','“The couple had clearly had a tiff,” he wrote. “Heather had fled to India, and Paul was pleading with her to come back. He sounded lonely, miserable and desperate, and even sang ‘We Can Work It Out’ into the answerphone.”Ms. Mills said in a BBC interview broadcast Wednesday that a Trinity Mirror group executive — someone she did not name, though she said it was not Mr. Morgan — had called her at the time and quoted from the message. “He said, ‘I hear you’ve had a big argument with your boyfriend,’ and I said, ‘Why would you know this?’ ” she said. “And he started quoting verbatim from the messages from my machine.”“I said, ‘You’ve obviously hacked my phone, and if you do anything with this story, I’ll go to the police,’ ” she said. “And he said, ‘O.K., O.K., yeah, we did hear it on your voice messages. I won’t run it.’ ”No reference to the voice message appeared in The Daily Mirror’s coverage, and the issue lay dormant until police investigations into the phone hacking practices gained momentum in recent months, when Ms. Mills joined a group of celebrities in Britain who said publicly that they believed that their cellphones had been hacked. In the BBC interview, she said that Mr. Morgan, as The Daily Mirror’s editor at the time, must have known about the hacking. “There was absolutely no honest way that Piers Morgan could have obtained that tape that he has so proudly bragged about unless they had gone into my voice messages,” she said.A statement issued on Mr. Morgan’s behalf by CNN on Wednesday did not mention his reference in The Daily Mail article to having heard Mr. McCartney’s message for Ms. Mills. But the statement attacked Ms. Mills’s credibility, citing a judge’s assessment of her evidence in her divorce from Mr. McCartney as “inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid.”The statement added, “No doubt everyone will take this and other instances of somewhat extravagant claims by Ms. Mills into account in assessing what credibility and platform her assertions are given.”“And to repeat,” it said, “I have never hacked a phone, told anyone to hack a phone, nor to my knowledge published any story obtained from the hacking of a phone.”Mr. Morgan declined requests on Thursday for comment by telephone or e-mail on the interception of the McCartney-Mills message. But a CNN executive who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the subject publicly said the accusations would have no effect on Mr. Morgan’s position as the host of “Piers Morgan Tonight.”“This whole thing has taken on an absurd air that has no impact on us,” the executive said.Meghan McPartland, a spokeswoman for Mr. Morgan, said in an e-mail, “Piers is not going to answer any more questions at this time, as he feels he has said what he has needed to.”In Cincinnati, where he was on a concert tour, Mr. McCartney on Thursday made his first comments on the issue in a closed-circuit relay to a news conference in Los Angeles that was held to promote a documentary about a concert in which he performed in New York after the Sept. 11 attacks. He said he planned to speak to the police when he returned to Britain after the tour and would withhold comment.“I’m going to talk to the police because apparently I’ve been hacked,” he said, adding: “I do think it’s a horrendous violation of privacy. I think it has been going on for a long time, and I think that more people than we know knew about it.”In a separate disclosure, the BBC reported that it had uncovered records showing that the Trinity Mirror group had used private investigators 230 times in a two-year period in the late 1990s  -  when Mr. Morgan was editor of The Daily Mirror - and paid an agency $120,000 for surveillance of celebrities.In Britain, several members of Parliament urged Mr. Morgan to testify before a House of Commons committee. Two weeks ago, the committee summoned Mr. Murdoch; his son James; and Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Mr. Murdoch’s newspaper subsidiary in Britain, to testify on the phone hacking at The News of the World.John Whittingdale, the committee’s chairman, said he had no powers to compel witnesses living abroad to return to Britain to testify. “I would like to see Mr. Morgan come back to this country and answer what are some very serious questions,” he said.'"
"'11-08-05,'1','“The move to cash is symptomatic of a broader concern about growth and the stock market,” said Mike Ryan, chief investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas. “It’s all part of a generic derisking exercise.”Tom Forester, chief investment officer for the Forester Value Fund, based in Lake Forest, Ill., summed up the situation more succinctly. “Cash doesn’t go down,” he said.Mr. Forester said he was shifting assets into a money-market fund that invests in Treasury notes. For other institutional investors, even money market funds seemed risky, and they instead sought the security of cash invested in commercial bank accounts.The huge buildup in cash does not suggest that the world financial system is on the brink of another Lehman-like panic. But it does underscore the broader economic challenges facing both the United States and Europe, particularly the fear and uncertainty that has taken hold among companies, financial institutions and individuals.Many companies are holding off on investing in new capacity and creating new jobs, instead stockpiling cash in case of another panic. And banks on both sides of the Atlantic are cautious about lending, restricting the money available to both businesses and consumers. Finally, individuals are clamping down on spending, too. Consumer spending in June dropped for the first time in nearly two years, according to government data announced earlier this week.At the height of the uncertainty over whether the debt ceiling would be raised and with a potential default in the offing, in late July, investors pulled out more than $100 billion from money market funds and put much of it into banks, lifting fears that the funds could see a run that resembled the one after Lehman Brothers’ collapse in 2008.Since the beginning of this year through July 20th, holdings of cash in United States commercial banks surged 85 percent, or $912.7 billion, to $1.98 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.In a sign of just how much cash had poured into commercial bank accounts, Bank of New York Mellon said on Thursday that it would charge institutional clients with more than $50 million on deposit a fee of 13 basis points. The move is intended to recover some of the cost of managing the money, but is also a bid to slow the so-called hot money that has been ricocheting between Treasuries, money-market funds and pure cash balances at the big banks.The Bank of New York Mellon said the fee would only be applied “to a small number of institutional clients with extraordinarily high deposit levels where the deposits have increased significantly in recent weeks, well above market trends.” The bank did not disclose just how much cash had poured into its coffers recently.Over all, banks took in nearly $200 billion between mid-June and mid-July as institutional investors fled money market accounts and sought the safety of accounts protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, according to Joseph Abate, a money market strategist at Barclays Capital.While its rivals have not yet announced similar moves, the Bank of New York’s charges are likely to force cash out of banks and back into money market funds and Treasuries, driving rates even lower where possible, Mr. Abate said in a note to investors Thursday.“The movement into deposits during a financial crisis is expensive for U.S. banks because they have to pay deposit insurance on these extra inflows,” Mr. Abate wrote. “These inflows mostly represent ‘hot money.’ ”There are signs that money market funds are beginning to regain some of their appeal now that the debt ceiling has been raised and as stocks swoon.Amid the decline on Wall Street and approval of the debt ceiling increase this week, $13.1 billion went back into money market funds on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Peter Crane, the president of Crane Data, which tracks money market mutual fund flows. Data for Thursday was not in yet, but Mr. Crane said he expected this trend to continue in the coming days.“Bad news for everyone else is good news for money market funds,” he said.That is certainly why they appeal to Mr. Forester. He has been building up his cash position for weeks, he said, selling shares of past winners like I.B.M. and Honeywell.The weak growth in gross domestic product in the first half of 2011, a figure released by the government last Friday, only confirmed his doubts, he said. Now, Mr. Forester’s cash position in his $210 million stock fund equals 22 percent of assets, about double the average since he started the fund 11 years ago.“You do this ahead of time, you don’t do it when the world’s falling apart,” he said. “We’ve seen a lot of this coming.”'"
"'11-08-05,'1','HONOLULU (AP) — A federal judge dismissed all charges on Thursday against two brothers accused of bringing 44 laborers from Thailand and forcing them to work on a farm in Hawaii.Federal prosecutors asked Chief Judge Susan Oki Mollway of United States District Court to drop all 12 counts against Alec and Mike Sou of Aloun Farms, and she granted the request, said lawyers involved in the case.The brothers faced up to 20 years in prison if they had been found guilty of the most serious charges.“It’s like 10 tons of watermelon lifted off my shoulders,” said Alec Sou, the president of the 3,200-acre Aloun Farms.Prosecutors cited new evidence that surfaced this week in asking to drop the charges.Judge Mollway ruled Tuesday that prosecutors could not claim it was illegal to charge laborers recruiting fees in 2004 when the Sous brought them to Hawaii.The lead prosecutor, Susan French, conceded that she had wrongly stated to a grand jury that workers could not be charged the fees under federal law at the time. The law was changed in 2009 to prohibit the fees.'"
"'11-08-05,'1','And in each case the second recession began at a time when the usual government policies to fight economic weakness were deemed unavailable. Then, the need to fight inflation ruled out an easier monetary policy. Now, the perceived need to reduce government spending rules out a more accommodating fiscal policy.The American economy fell into what was at first a fairly mild recession at the end of 2007. But the downturn turned into a worldwide plunge after the failure of in September 2008 led to the vanishing of credit for nearly all borrowers not deemed super-safe. Banks in the United States and other countries needed bailouts to survive.The unavailability of credit caused a decline in world trade volumes of a magnitude not seen since , and nearly every economy went into recession.But it turned out that businesses overreacted. While sales to customers fell, they did not decline as much as production did.That fact set the stage for an economic rebound that began in mid-2009, with the , the arbiter of such things, determining that the recession ended in June of that year. Manufacturers around the world reported rapidly rising orders.Until recently, most observers believed the American economy was in a slow recovery, albeit one with very disappointing job growth. The official figures on showed the United States economy grew to a record size in the final three months of 2010, having erased the loss of 4.1 percent in G.D.P. from top to bottom.Then last week the government announced its annual revision to the numbers for the last several years. New government surveys indicated Americans had spent less than previously estimated in 2009 and 2010 on a wide range of things, including food, clothing and computers. returns showed Americans even cut back on . The recession now appears to have been deeper — a top-to-bottom fall of 5.1 percent — and the recovery even less impressive. The economy is still smaller than it was in 2007.In June, more American manufacturers said new orders fell than rose, according to a survey by the . The margin was small, but the survey had shown rising orders for 24 consecutive months. Manufacturers in most European countries, including and , also reported weaker new orders.Back in 1980, a recession was started when the government — despairing of its failure to bring down surging inflation rates — invoked controls aimed at limiting the expansion of credit and making it more costly for to make . Those controls proved to be far more effective than anyone expected, and the economy promptly tanked. In July the credit controls were ended, and the economic research bureau later determined that the recession ended that month.By the first quarter of 1981 the economy was larger than it had been at the previous peak.But little had been done about inflation, and the was determined to slay that dragon. With interest rates high, home sales plunged in late 1981 to the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1963. Now they are even lower.There is, of course, no assurance that a new recession has begun or will do so soon, and a positive jobs report on Friday morning could revive some optimism. But concerns have grown that the essential problems that led to the 2007-09 recession were not solved, just as inflation remained high throughout the 1980 downturn. Housing prices have not recovered, and millions of Americans owe more in debt than their homes are worth. Extremely low interest rates helped to push up corporate profits, but companies have hired relatively few people.In any other cycle, the recent spate of poor economic news would have resulted in politicians vying with one another to propose programs to revive growth. has called for more spending on infrastructure, but there appears to be little chance Congress will take any action. The focus in Washington is now on deciding where to reduce spending, not increase it.There have been some hints that the Federal Reserve might be willing to resume purchasing government , which it stopped doing in June, despite opposition from conservative members of Congress. But the revised economic data may indicate that the previous program — known as , for — had even less impact than had been thought. With short-term interest rates near zero, the Fed’s monetary policy options are limited.Government stimulus programs historically have often appeared to be accomplishing little until the cumulative effect suddenly helps to power a self-sustaining recovery. This time, the best hope may be that the stimulus we have already had will prove to have been enough.'"
"'11-08-05,'1','“They don’t care about us, or they forgot us, or they don’t want us to go there,” said Mubarak Shah, an interpreter in Helmand Province who said he applied for a visa a year ago. “I’m still waiting.”The complaints are mounting. Two weeks ago, a group of unnamed Afghan visa applicants sent an open letter to American officials criticizing the delays and urging the embassy to speed up the process.Seven United States senators recently sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking for information about the delays.“I am very concerned and frustrated that it has taken so long to implement this critical program to help Afghans who have risked their lives to help the United States,” Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, who has worked on refugee issues, said in a statement.American officials say the problems with the Afghan Allies visa program occurred largely because the embassy lacked enough staff members to scrutinize each case and run background checks. After the program was created in early 2009, officials spent more than a year deciding exactly how to screen each applicant.Bureaucratic delays increase the risk for Afghans like Raaz Mohamad Ahmadi, who worked for six years as an interpreter at a military base near the capital.Mr. Ahmadi said he had tried to keep his job a secret to protect himself and his family, but he accidentally wore his uniform home from the base a few times. Three years ago, he received a so-called night letter, a written threat dropped off in the dark, signed by “one of the Taliban brothers” and warning him to quit his job “if you like your life.”He moved his family, telling almost no one where he had gone, but said he had noticed ominous signs in the past few weeks. Someone recently tried to break into his new home, and cars full of men have slowed to look at him as he leaves his house, Mr. Ahmadi said.Such fears may be well grounded. The Taliban have threatened for years to kill any Afghans who work with the American-led coalition, and while there are no specific tallies available, they have carried out those threats countless times.In February 2009, Mr. Ahmadi applied for one of 50 visas allotted annually for Iraqi and Afghan interpreters. He said he had received no response from American officials, except for a notice from a visa-processing center in Nebraska assigning him a case number. They also confirmed that his $375 application fee had been received.“They are not taking care of us,” he said. “I see my life threatened. Everyone in the family is worried.”The problems facing resettlement efforts here resemble, on a smaller scale, the troubles that have long plagued American efforts to take in Iraqis who worked alongside the American government during the war there. In both countries, American forces relied on thousands of local employees to decode languages and bridge cultural gaps, while local construction workers and laborers helped build, supply and maintain military bases.The United States carved out slots for 25,000 Iraqis and their families to emigrate over five years. For Afghans, it allotted 7,500 spaces under the Afghan Allies program.But terrorism fears about Iraqis, especially after two Iraqi immigrants were arrested in Kentucky on suspicion of ties to an insurgent group, have virtually dried up visas for Iraqis in the twilight of America’s war there.The number of Afghans arriving under the special immigrant visa program, the broader program that includes Afghan Allies, has also dwindled. A total of 108 Afghans arrived under that umbrella in the 2010 fiscal year, down from 775 a year earlier, according to State Department figures. This year, they continue to trickle in: 18 in March, 17 in April and none in May, the latest month for which figures were available.Those numbers are bleak to Ahmad Jawaid Sarhal, 26, an adviser to the NATO mission that trains Afghan security forces.Mr. Sarhal said he had no faith in Afghan leaders, and he worried that security would crumble without Western forces. He said his year-old application to emigrate to the United States, still awaiting approval, represented his best hope for educating his family and keeping it safe.“We need to guarantee our future,” he said.'"
"'11-08-05,'1','He also criticized European politicians for “the undisciplined communication and the complexity and incompleteness” of the package agreed to at the summit meeting on July 21.“Markets remain to be convinced that we are taking the appropriate steps to resolve the crisis,” he wrote. “Whatever the factors behind the lack of success, it is clear that we are no longer managing a crisis just in the euro area periphery.”As part of its response to the crisis, the central bank also moved to prop up weaker banks that may be having trouble raising cash, expanding its lending to euro zone institutions at the benchmark interest rate. The central bank left that rate unchanged at 1.5 percent, while the Bank of England left its benchmark rate at a record low of 0.5 percent.Mr. Trichet declined to say what bonds the bank was buying or how much. He said the bank acted in response to “renewed tensions in some financial markets in the euro area.” It was the first such intervention since March.Traders said the central bank had bought Irish and Portuguese government debt during the day. But the bank did not buy bonds of Italy and Spain, two countries with huge bond markets and now seen as most vulnerable in the region.The move to buy Portuguese and Irish debt made little sense, given that they are insulated by their official bailouts and no longer have to raise money on the market, said Michael Leister, a fixed-income analyst at WestLB in Düsseldorf, Germany.Mr. Trichet, however, had “opened the door to acting on behalf of Spain and Italy,” he added. The yield on 10-year Italian debt rose 11 basis points, to 6.19 percent. Yields on 10-year Spanish bonds rose three basis points, to 6.28 percent. Earlier, Spain sold 3.3 billion euros, or $4.7 billion, of bonds due in 2014 with demand more than twice the level of supply. But the average yield rose to 4.813 percent from 4.037 percent at a comparable auction in June.“Over all, sentiment hasn’t changed yet,” Mr. Leister said after the central bank had acted. “Everyone’s afraid that the debt spiral will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. And the E.C.B. is the only institution with the firepower to stop the situation in the short term.”The central bank first began buying bonds in the open market in May 2010 but tapered off the interventions earlier this year, a move investors may have interpreted as a lack of resolve. Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners in Stamford, Conn., warned Thursday that half-hearted forays into the bond market “will fail, just like they did last year.”“In each case, the debt crisis got worse instead of better,” he wrote in a note.The central bank also responded to signs of stress in interbank markets when institutions, wary of each other’s exposure to troubled government paper, became reluctant to lend to each other. One worrisome sign was a surge in the cost at which European banks borrow dollars in the open foreign exchange market.Mr. Trichet said that next week the central bank would lend banks as much cash as they wanted for six months at the benchmark interest rate, assuming the banks could provide collateral. A six-month term is longer than is customary.Speaking to reporters Thursday after a regular meeting of the bank’s governing council, Mr. Trichet also gave a more subdued view of the European economy.“As expected, recent economic data indicate a deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the past few months, following the strong growth rate in the first quarter,” he said. While he expected moderate growth to continue, he said, “uncertainty is particularly high.”Nonetheless, some analysts said they still expected the bank to raise its benchmark rate for the 17-nation euro zone again this year, after Mr. Trichet retires at the end of October, handing the presidency to Mario Draghi, the governor of the Bank of Italy. The central bank has raised its main rate in two steps since April, from 1 percent to the current 1.5 percent, in an attempt to head off rising inflation.“The E.C.B. gave the impression that further rate hikes are necessary,” Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said. “However, the E.C.B. would probably immediately refrain from raising interest rates if the sovereign debt crisis escalated.”Mr. Trichet beseeched political leaders to speed up efforts to cut their budget deficits and remove impediments to growth, like overly protected labor markets. “The key for everything is to get ahead of the curve, in fiscal policy and structural reform,” he said.With Italy in danger of being swept over the same waterfall as Greece, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Thursday pledged sweeping changes to increase growth.He said the measures would include privatization, infrastructure projects, cutting administrative hurdles, streamlining the government, and carrying out a “historic” change to Italy’s constitution that would require balanced budgets.“We want to adopt a comprehensive pact” between the government, labor unions and businesses “absolutely by September,” Mr. Berlusconi said, a day after addressing Parliament.Mr. Berlusconi played down growing fears that Italy could become the next country at risk in the spreading European debt crisis. “I don’t think the crisis will get worse,” he said. “We should not be afraid about the current level of spreads because they only affect a small part of the public debt at any moment, which overall remains at the interest rates it was placed at years ago.”At a news conference later, the Italian finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, said Italy was in contact with the European Union, International Monetary Fund and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on strategies for growth.Mr. Berlusconi interrupted Mr. Tremonti, to add, “And the E.C.B.” Mr. Tremonti looked taken aback and said, “I think it’s important, but not involved.” He suggested the hope the bank would buy some Italian bonds.'"

"'11-08-05,'1','On Thursday, more than 14 billion shares changed hands, the heaviest selling in more than a year. In addition to being unnerved by weaker economic data reported in recent days, investors appeared to lose their optimism about the strength of corporate profits that had driven increases in the stock market in the first half of this year.At the close, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 60.27 points, or 4.78 percent, to 1,200.07. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 512.76 points, or 4.31 percent, to 11,383.68, and the Nasdaq was down 136.68, or 5.08 percent, to 2,556.39.The S.& P. 500 has now fallen 10.7 percent from 1,345 on July 22, underlining the new negative sentiment about the economy and about Europe.“We are now in correction mode,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s. “We could have another couple of weeks to go before it bottoms.”The last time the market was in a correction was last summer, when it fell 16 percent before recovering.Analysts said markets were still healthy and the United States was now stronger than just a few years ago so that a repeat of the financial crisis was unlikely.“There is a huge difference — during the financial crisis the banking sector broke down. Right now it’s a crisis of confidence based on weak economies but the banking sector is not broken,” said Reena Aggarwal, professor of finance at .The Vix, which measures the implied volatility of options on the S.& P. 500 index, and is called the fear index by traders, spiked on Thursday, though it is still much lower than during the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.’s reaction to the market’s tumble was muted. The said it did not plan to issue any statements or provide officials to comment.“Markets go up and down,” said the White House spokesman, Jay Carney. “We obviously are monitoring the situation in Europe closely.”As the prospects for economic growth dimmed, several commodities, including oil, silver and palladium, fell by more than 5 percent, perhaps producing some good news for consumers.With oil prices dropping below $87 a barrel, wiping out the rise caused by unrest in the and North Africa earlier in the year, drivers can expect sharply lower gasoline prices  just in time for the Labor Day weekend and back-to-school shopping.Agricultural crops and most industrial metals fell somewhat less drastically, with copper falling 1.9 percent, aluminum by 1.7 percent, corn by 1.9 percent, wheat by 3.4 percent and soybeans by 1.8 percent.Taken together, the drops should mean lower input costs for manufacturers and give the Federal Reserve more policy options should the economy continue to slow.A closely-watched survey of American investor attitudes provided by the American Association of Individual investors on Thursday showed the biggest increase in bearish sentiment for five years in the latest week. As investors fled assets like stocks, they piled into the perceived safety of United States Treasuries where 10-year interest rates fell to 2.41 percent, recording the biggest one day fall since March 2009.Yields on one-month United States notes actually fell into negative territory before closing at zero.Besides piling into Treasuries, institutional investors are also seeking out the safety of cold, hard cash, pouring billions into commercial bank accounts backed up by the . Investors had also been buying Swiss francs and Japanese yen. But earlier this week, unexpectedly cut interest rates in an effort to weaken the franc. on Thursday also intervened to weaken its currency, raising the specter that more nations could take similar steps to try to protect their economies.Around the world, markets from to were battered.In , stocks closed down 3.43 percent. In Germany, the DAX index dropped 3.4 percent. In , the CAC 40 closed down 3.9 percent.“It really is Europe today,” said Barry Knapp, head of United States equity strategy at Capital. “The market feels that European leaders are one step behind, and they are.”Asian markets quickly followed suit in trading lower. In midday trading on Friday, the Nikkei 225 in Japan was down 3.47 percent to 9,312.22 while the S.& P./ASX 200 index in fell 3.98 percent to 4,106.40. The Hang Seng index in opened sharply lower as well, and was down 4.6 percent to 20,865.95 by midday.With some warning signs that weaker European banks are struggling to fund themselves, the central bank moved to help weaker by expanding its lending to institutions in zone. Bank stocks nevertheless fell sharply in Europe.In the United States, as the stock market fell, it broke through critical support levels, leading to more selling as traders rushed to reduce exposure to plummeting prices.  That included computerized program traders, one analyst said.'"

"'11-08-06,'0','After signing the richest contract of any free agent last winter, Crawford has largely escaped criticism in a baseball-mad city.He is generally good-natured, which helps, and he has three game-ending hits this season, which helps more. But mostly, the Red Sox have a strong enough team to be winning without the vintage Crawford. They lead the majors in runs scored and are comfortably in a playoff position.First baseman Adrian Gonzalez, Boston’s other major off-season prize, has adjusted smoothly and become a leading candidate for the American League Most Valuable Player award. And the Red Sox do have a pesky leadoff man with a .300 average and lots of stolen bases — but it is Jacoby Ellsbury, who has blossomed into an All-Star.After going seven years without batting lower than third for Tampa Bay, Crawford has been slogging, not gliding, through a trying season.“Carl is one of the best competitors I’ve ever, ever been around,” said Red Sox reliever Dan Wheeler, Crawford’s teammate with the Rays. “So he goes out there and battles every single day.“I guess he’s not having the year he wants to have, but he’s still doing a lot of things to help the team win games, just by being in the lineup.”Crawford has never drawn many walks — his career on-base percentage is .334 — and he must rely on hits to get on base. His .278 average on balls in play through Thursday was a career low, and suggests he has often hit into bad luck.Francona praised Crawford’s aggressive base running, although Crawford has not run very much — 12 stolen bases in 17 tries. He made a sliding catch in left to take a hit from Curtis Granderson on Friday, but according to advanced defensive metrics, he has been about average in the field.For now, anyway, it would seem as if the Red Sox again grossly overpaid a free agent. The Yankees have done this many times, of course, but the Red Sox have made it a similar habit. Mike Cameron, Matt Clement, J. D. Drew, John Lackey, Julio Lugo and Daisuke Matsuzaka have all produced less than the Red Sox expected.Drew, Lugo and Matsuzaka, at least, helped deliver a championship in 2007. Crawford has seven years to do the same, plenty of time to earn the money. His problems have not been for lack of trying, and the work ethic that helped him succeed in Tampa Bay should eventually produce results here.“I don’t know if he can work any harder than he does,” Wheeler said. “A lot of guys don’t see Carl. He gets here early. I noticed that through the Tampa years — you don’t see him work out unless you’re there early. He’s had one of the best routines I’ve ever seen. That’s the reason why he’s as good as he is.”Francona agreed with the word disjointed to describe Crawford’s season. After two hitless games to start April, Crawford was dropped to seventh in the order for a day. By the end of April, he was batting eighth and hitting .155.Crawford heated up from there, batting .295 until June 17, when a hamstring strain put him on the disabled list for a month. In his first 16 games since returning, he hit .234. Francona acknowledged the uneven performance but sounded hopeful of a revival.For the money the Red Sox invested — and the track record they invested in — he really has no choice.“If he’s the Crawford that we have come to know,” Francona said, “even if his batting average is a little bit lower at the end of the year than it’s supposed to be, that doesn’t mean he can’t be the player that we are looking for.”'"
"'11-08-06,'0','As Mr. Farrelly put it, “It now seems to be everyone for themselves. The edifice is cracking. They’re all fighting like rats in a sack.”However controversial in Britain, the practice of companies’ paying their officers and employees’ legal expenses in criminal investigations is not only routine in America but has been elevated by some to the status of a constitutional right. A little-discussed but open secret among defense lawyers and prosecutors alike is that who pays the legal fees often decides the outcome of an investigation.As John C. Coffee Jr., Berle professor of law at Columbia, told me: “Someone whose legal fees are not paid may have a strong and urgent need to cooperate with the government. The employee, if he can’t afford to defend himself, has to cut a deal, and he might, shall we say, color his testimony. Who’s going to get the benefit of that, the company or the government? Lawyers know very well how to coach witnesses on what to say without telling them to lie.”Confronted in the 1990s with an unprecedented wave of white-collar crime at major corporations like Enron and WorldCom, Justice Department prosecutors grew exasperated with companies that made public pledges to cooperate with investigators only to unleash a phalanx of defense lawyers bent on anything but.In 2003, when he was chief of the Justice Department’s criminal division, Larry Thompson wrote that a factor in whether a company, as opposed to individuals, would be charged with a crime would be the extent of its cooperation, one measure of which “is whether the corporation appears to be protecting its culpable employees and agents,” among other things, “through the advancing of attorneys fees.” Mr. Thompson might well have added lavish severance packages and other forms of hush money to the list.In 2005, the accounting firm KPMG admitted to creating fraudulent tax shelters that enabled wealthy clients to evade $2.5 billion in federal taxes, and six former partners, including the firm’s former deputy chairman, were indicted. KPMG, as it had in the past, paid their legal bills. All pleaded not guilty and declined to cooperate with the government.As an accounting firm dependent on public trust, KPMG recognized that its survival depended on the firm’s escaping criminal charges. At a meeting with prosecutors, the firm’s lawyer, Robert Bennett, emphasized that KPMG “had decided to change course and cooperate fully.” The prosecutors zeroed in on the issue of legal fees, with one saying that “misconduct should not be rewarded” and another warning that with respect to legal fees, “we’ll look at that under a microscope,” according to notes taken at the meeting.KPMG subsequently said it would pay legal fees up to $400,000 as long as employees cooperated and did not invoke the Fifth Amendment but would cease altogether for anyone indicted, including the six former partners already indicted.Two years later, United States District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan took the drastic step of dismissing the indictments and harshly criticized both the Thompson memo and the prosecutors’ use of it to cow KPMG into terminating the fees to its former partners.He suggested that this violated the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and ruled that the Justice Department “deliberately or callously prevented many of these defendants from obtaining funds for their defense that they lawfully would have had absent the government’s interference. They thereby foreclosed these defendants from presenting defenses they wished to present and, in some cases, even deprived them of counsel of their choice. This is intolerable in a society that holds itself out to the world as a paragon of justice.”In reaching his decision, Judge Kaplan asked the defense lawyers what it would cost to defend the case. Their estimates ranged from $7 million to $24 million per defendant.In the wake of Judge Kaplan’s broadside (subsequently upheld by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals), the Justice Department discarded the Thompson memo. While still giving credit for cooperation, Justice Department policy now states flatly that “prosecutors should not take into account whether a corporation is advancing or reimbursing attorneys’ fees or providing counsel to employees,” unless the fees are part of an effort to obstruct justice, such as making their payment conditioned on supporting “a false version of events.”Today, “99 percent of all publicly held U.S. companies have indemnification agreements with their senior management and directors” to pay legal expenses, Mr. Coffee noted. “Their bylaws state that they will indemnify to the full extent permitted by law.”He noted that in litigious America, this is sound public policy in order to attract qualified officers, directors and employees, who otherwise might face ruinous costs of defending themselves against what are often frivolous lawsuits.Still, not everyone is enamored of either Judge Kaplan’s opinion or the outcome of the KPMG case. The six former partners had their indictments dismissed, but other defendants were found guilty at trial. Both a federal judge and a prominent defense lawyer I spoke to said they doubted that the Supreme Court would elevate a corporation’s payment of legal fees to a constitutional right. “It’s a leap, to put it mildly,” the lawyer said. “Just because you can’t afford the most expensive lawyers or have an unlimited budget doesn’t mean your constitutional rights have been violated.”The right to counsel is far less established in English law, and Parliament may have been well within its rights to pressure the Murdochs on the subject of legal fees. But the News Corporation is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in New York. If I were Rupert Murdoch, I’d wrap myself in the American flag and Constitution, and pay everyone’s lawyers.

"'11-08-06,'0','European stocks were down for a second consecutive day on Friday, on the gnawing realization that Europe and the United States may face fundamental economic problems for years to come.The turmoil prompted a flurry of phone calls between President Nicolas Sarkozy of France from his vacation retreat on the French Riviera, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who had chosen an August getaway to Italy. Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy also each spoke with President Obama on Friday, the White House said, but offered no details on their discussions.Mr. Berlusconi, meanwhile, spoke by phone Friday with Mrs. Merkel and, separately, with Herman Van Rompuy, the European Council president, and with José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero of Spain — the other big debt-saddled European country that, like Italy, is seen as teetering.Mr. Zapatero of Spain, whose economy is in greater peril as investors drive up borrowing costs, also spoke separately to both Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel from his vacation in Andalucia.At a hastily called news conference, Mr. Berlusconi, who has been criticized for being too slow to recognize that Italy’s debt problems threaten the euro union, said his country would take various steps to address the crisis.He said Italy would aim for a balanced budget a year earlier than a previously stated 2013 deadline, seek a constitutional balanced-budget amendment and make other moves to liberalize the nation’s economy — which is so sclerotic from bureaucratic rules that it has barely grown for a decade.Parliament may shorten its August recess to pass the measures, Mr. Berlusconi said. He appeared alongside the economy minister, Giulio Tremonti, whom Mr. Berlusconi had recently treated with public disdain that added to the market’s concerns about Italy.Many analysts remain skeptical that European leaders have grasped the problems confronting them.“Politicians have done everything to demonstrate they are not ahead of the curve,” said Stefan Schneider, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. “That is hitting market confidence and creating a self-fulfilling feedback loop.”Just days after Washington struck a harrowing, last-minute deal to lift America’s debt ceiling, a stark reality has come crashing in on both sides of the Atlantic. Neither the United States nor Europe has yet fully recovered from the financial crisis that spread from spring 2007 through early 2009.Instead, brief bright spots of recovery have been overshadowed by rising unemployment and anemic economies, especially as debt-reduction austerity programs in Europe and spending cuts in the United States weigh on growth.Signs of economic weakness continue to emerge. New data indicates that industrial output fell in June in Italy and Spain, and both economies grew at a tepid pace in the second quarter. While the German economy remained strong, industrial production there slid in June, by 1.1 percent, as construction activity also slackened.Meanwhile, leaders in Brussels on Friday were trying undo the damage wrought by José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, a day after he frightened investors by conceding that Europe was gripped by political paralysis.His remarks, which angered German policy makers, were one of the catalysts for the markets’ downward spiral Thursday, along with a half-hearted attempt by the European Central Bank to bolster the bonds of the most deeply troubled debtors.Many analysts say that the inability of politicians to speak with a unified voice, whether about the debt ceiling in the United States or the debt crisis threatening the foundations of the euro monetary union itself, is at the heart of these problems.China, whose surging growth depends on the West, voiced new worries Friday about the declining fortunes of its two largest trading partners.“Europe’s debt problems are still developing, and the U.S. sovereign debt default risk is escalating,” China’s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said during a visit to Poland. He urged all countries to “further increase communication and coordination.”Europe’s leaders seemed to take the hint — for now.“All of us who are in responsible positions in Europe will have to do much better in order to ensure verbal discipline and rigor,” Ollie Rehn, the European economics commissioner, said at a hastily called news conference in Brussels on Friday.European officials, he said, were “working night and day to put flesh on the bones” of an agreement in principle they struck in July for a second bailout of Greece and to reinforce its sovereign rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility. The fund is supposed to keep the economies of Italy and Spain from succumbing to market attacks the way Greece, Ireland and Portugal did.“Once investors understand that all this work is under way behind the scenes, they will be reassured,” Mr. Rehn said. “It is not as if the fundamentals of the Italian or Spanish economies have changed overnight.”That may be. But with Greece, Ireland and Portugal having received an unprecedented bailout from their European partners, investors are now wary of any country with low growth and high debt — like Spain and Italy, with their much larger economies.European parliaments are scheduled to vote on expanding the capacity and scope of the rescue fund after their vacations. But the worry is that financial markets will not wait that long, and will drive up borrowing costs for Italy and Spain to levels that will make it much harder for them to maintain a sustainable debt load.“If they had agreed on those measures nine months ago it would have prevented the crisis from spiraling to this extent,” said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. “But this is too little too late.”For all their declarations, Europe’s leaders are still not taking the ultimate step that many analysts say would shore up the euro union: moving toward greater fiscal federalism, a system that would make Europe look more like the United States.The reasons for resisting are deep-seated: No country wants to give up its sovereignty. Even discussions about issuing euro bonds are met with fierce resistance in Germany, as are ideas for a pan-European financial regulator and Europe-wide deposit insurance to guard against instability in the region’s banks.Germany warned Friday that it would oppose any plan to introduce euro bonds. Joachim Pfeiffer, a lawmaker and economics spokesman for Mrs. Merkel’s parliamentary bloc, called them “poison.”Another move that critics say would stem the crisis would be for the central bank to buy Italian and Spanish bonds, which would keep their rates from spiraling to the levels that forced Greece and others to take a bailout. But the central bank sees this as a weapon of last resort and is loath to use it.Mr. Sarkozy has something else to fear. If the crises in Italy and Spain cannot be tamed, France, as one of the major contributors to the cleanup operation, would be in an increasingly weak position.Spreads on benchmark French bonds have widened against ultrasafe German bonds. And while growth is not lagging, France’s structural deficit is high. If the size of the rescue fund were to increase enough to protect Spain and Italy, investors might start to look askance at France’s ability to underwrite its share, analysts said.'"
"'11-08-06,'0','In a report presented to Parliament on Friday, auditors criticized India’s preparations and conduct of the Commonwealth Games last year as deeply flawed, riddled with favoritism and vastly more expensive than planned. The games were troubled by construction delays, cost overruns and accusations of corruption. The head of the organizing committee, Suresh Kalmadi, is in jail on corruption charges. The report, by the comptroller and auditor general of India, questioned Mr. Kalmadi’s appointment on a recommendation by the prime minister’s office over objections from the sports minister.

The police detained the leader, Ales Belyatsky of the Vesna group, outside his home in the capital, Minsk, on Thursday, and searched his apartment, country house and the group’s offices. Mr. Belyatsky faces charges of “concealment of income,” the group said in a statement. It said Mr. Belyatsky received large amounts of cash in neighboring Lithuania from Western donors because the group was barred from receiving grants in Belarus.'"
"'11-08-06,'0','Mr. Horan said investors needed to know what their holdings actually were. It is easy. Look up the funds’ Top 10 holdings, available on the fund’s Web site, and the sector concentrations. Then, investors need to have the courage of their convictions. Lynn Ballou, an investment adviser and also an ambassador for the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, said investors inadvertently increased their risk by being swayed by people who had little knowledge of their portfolio.“It’s, ‘I went out to lunch with someone and he said, wink, wink, nod, nod, I’ve heard about this company and I’m going to buy some and you should, too,’ ” Ms. Ballou said. “All that is what I call sexy noise. And 99 times out of 100, it’s just fun lunch talk.”But should investors act on those tips, they risk a problem that Chris Walters, executive vice president at Citizens Trust , calls “portfolio happens,” the accumulation of investments that are not part of an overarching strategy and do not work together.At the extreme, he said, was a client who recently bought $1 million of gold bullion without telling anyone. “We said, ‘How are you going to get it home? What are you going to do with it?’ ” Mr. Walters said. But the best advice is to have a personal benchmark, pegged to when you will need the money, like in retirement. Thomas J. Pauloski, national managing director in the wealth management group at AllianceBernstein, said he urged his clients to do that.“You want to get people away from focusing on the day-to-day jousting,” he said. In doing this, an investor hopes to reduce the risk of buying high and selling low.MANAGING SECURITIES The market crash of 2008 has instilled a fear of being overly concentrated with any one manager or firm. But spreading out everything among different people is not the solution, either.“We think about the best fund managers and do a pretty good job at the beginning of finding them,” Ms. Ballou said. “But we don’t stay on top of them. And then, it’s, ‘I just read my famous fund manager retired or got indicted — what do I do now?’ ”She said more people should think about who is managing their portfolios the way they would think about a garden: after spending time planting beautiful flowers, they don’t let it go without pruning and weeding.This discipline is not easy, even among the wealthiest. One investor, whose family’s wealth came from an agricultural products company and inheritance, said it was not until the family decided to move to another financial firm that they found out how much unintended risk was in their portfolio.The investor, who asked not to be name to protect his family’s privacy, said the family had 5 percent of its $50 million of liquid wealth in Microsoft and 7 to 8 percent in Oracle. But since the stocks were held in various accounts, they did not realize how concentrated they were.“We looked at the stock statements and not what was in the funds,” he said. “Microsoft and Oracle are great companies, but we didn’t have any other significant holdings.”BNY Mellon Wealth Management performed the risk audit on the portfolio and the family moved their money to that firm. But Timothy E. Sheehan, senior director for business development at the firm, said the risk audits he did for clients were something anyone could do.“All of this is public information,” he said. “But when you tell them they own 30,000 different equity shares, they say, ‘How did that happen?’ ”A better way for investors to think about risk in their portfolio may be to consider various situations, Mr. Horan said. One might be looking at how your portfolio would fare with high inflation. (Answer: Banks perform less well than companies with tangible assets, like automakers and airlines.)HIGH-END RISKS Sophisticated, often customized investments have become the norm for those at the top of the wealth scale to minimize losses or maximize returns.Beyond the obvious risk that an investment will not pan out, there are other risks as well. One is being blinded by the name of an investment and not considering what it does with your money.Mr. Walters pointed out that people often talked about being invested in hedge funds as if that alone meant something. A hedge fund, like a mutual fund, is just a vehicle to buy and sell things. Investors who don’t understand the fund’s strategy could unintentionally increase their risk, just like buying six different mutual funds.Likewise, a private equity fund can give investors a sense of stability that may not be real. It comes partly from how infrequently it is valued. “If it was priced daily, it would look more like a microcap fund,” which is more volatile, Mr. Walters said.Then there are investors who think they are doing the right thing by spreading their money across different asset classes without understanding that those assets perform the same way. Mr. Walters said many of his clients in California own real estate along with municipal bonds. But both assets are vulnerable to interest rates and go up and down together.Having a point person to gather all the information could help reduce these unintended risks, but who should that be? Advisers will vie for that role, but winning is not easy.“Upfront, clients are very reluctant and they don’t want to show their hand,” said Nancy Driggers, senior portfolio manager at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in Atlanta. “A lot of times, they’ve never seen everything in one place. They think of it as very compartmentalized.”That may be fine for some investors who are their own point people. Spreading out their money protects them from the risks of a single firm or adviser.But they also could find themselves overly concentrated in one area, not invested in another or lacking an overall plan. Unlike Congressional infighting, that is something individual investors can control.'"

"'11-08-07,'0','But some politicians questioned whether governance issues should play such a large role in the country’s debt rating.Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican who heads the House Financial Services’ Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, said it was appropriate for S.& P. to consider the political situation in its analysis. But he said that it was speculative for the agency to use predictions of what Congress would do in the future as a rationale for a downgrade.“One thing that puts them out in uncharted waters is trying to predict what the political environment is going to be,” Mr. Neugebauer said in an interview.  “They’re not predicting an overly cooperative environment in Congress and that’s a very subjective call.”The tension between Congress and the ratings agencies could have tangible results on the companies’ futures if it speeds up new rules that lessen their roles in the market. As part of the financial reform bill passed last summer, regulators are supposed to write rules designed to reduce the heavy reliance on credit ratings by banks and other buyers of debt securities, a policy that has its roots in the 1930s.Federal bank regulators have not yet created these rules and a Congressional committee held a hearing on July 27 on the slow pace of regulators’ implementation of this part of the law. Fierce debate broke out at the hearing about whether it was appropriate for the ratings agencies — companies regulated by the federal government — to be rating United States debt at all.The pushback against S.& P. echoes the complaints of other governments that have had their debt downgraded and responded with cries of unfairness.Much of the enmity dates to the financial crisis. All three ratings agencies failed to see the credit crisis coming, and for years they bestowed AAA ratings on bundles of mortgage bonds, even though many of the loans inside those securities were highly questionable. Scores of investors purchased the securities based on the positive ratings; when the mortgages inside those deals went south, investors lost billions of dollars, kicking off the panic that drove the financial crisis.The ratings agencies, which profited richly during the mortgage boom by rating those deals, have been identified along with banks and mortgage lenders as parties that contributed to the country economic collapse. Despite all that, the agencies still retain lots of weight in the financial markets, and investors have been following their views carefully on sovereign debt in places like Greece, Japan, Italy and, now, the United States.Moody’s and Fitch have not downgraded the United States, though their analysts said in interviews that a downgrade remains a possibility. Analysts from Fitch Ratings were in their offices over the weekend, churning through financial data. The company has said it may take all month to decide. “Our rating is triple A until the day it changes,” said David Riley, the head of global government debt at Fitch Ratings from his office in London. “That being said, we haven’t formally reaffirmed the rating.”Moody’s reaffirmed the country’s AAA, though it did put the country on negative outlook on Tuesday. The company’s sovereign analyst said Saturday the company is not as concerned about political gridlock.“Despite the contentious political environment and the difficulties in coming to an agreement — even if it’s not the ideal one — they still reached an agreement which we think is a turning point in fiscal policy,” said Steven Hess, the lead analyst on U.S. government debt at Moody’s. “It is not enough, but we thought a downgrade would be premature given that they have come up with a plan for deficit reduction.”Analysts at Fitch agree with Moody’s that, by various debt ratios, the United States is not out of line with other AAA-rated countries — putting the two at odds with S.& P. But Fitch’s top sovereign analyst said it would be monitoring the ability of lawmakers to agree on $1.5 trillion in further cuts and, if they can’t, it will look to see if Congress follows the triggers for automatic cuts it put in place last week.“We’ve had similar triggers in place under previous budget acts and sometimes they’re allowed to operate and sometimes not,” said Mr. Riley , of Fitch.He acknowledged there was a perception in the markets that a country is not a true AAA if all three major agencies do not agree.“In that respect, S.& P.’s action has already weakened the U.S.’ profile,” Mr. Riley added.'"
"'11-08-07,'0','In announcing the strike at 12:20 a.m., the communications workers complained that almost 100 of Verizon’s demands for concessions remained on the negotiating table.“Since bargaining began on June 22, Verizon has refused to move from a long list of concession demands,” the union said in its post-midnight statement. “Even at the 11th hour, as contracts were set to expire, Verizon continued to seek to strip away 50 years of collective bargaining gains for middle class workers and their families.”Early Sunday morning, Verizon issued a statement saying its attempts to reach a construct with the two unions were unsuccessful. The company said, “In anticipation of this development, Verizon has activated a contingency plan to ensure customers experience limited disruption in service during this time.”Mark C. Reed, Verizon’s executive vice president of human resources, said, “It’s regrettable for our employees and our customers” that the two unions “have decided to walk away from the table instead of continuing to work through the issues.”But Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the communications workers, said at 12:30 a.m. that the talks were continuing, emphatically denying that the unions had broken off talks.In its statement, Verizon said it had “trained tens of thousands of management employees, retirees and others to fill the roles and responsibilities of its union-represented wireline workers.”Mr. Reed said, “We are confident that we have the talent and resources in place to meet the needs and demands of our customers.”In the talks that have been held in recent weeks in New York and Philadelphia, Verizon has asked its unionized workers to start contributing to their health care premiums, proposing that workers pay $1,300 to $3,000 for family coverage, depending on the plan. Verizon executives say the contributions would be similar to those already made by its 135,000 nonunion employees.Verizon has also called for freezing pensions for current employees and eliminating traditional pensions for future workers, while making its 401(k) plans somewhat more generous for both. It would also like to limit sick days to five a year, as opposed to the current policy, which company executives say sets no limit.In addition, Verizon wants to make it easier to lay off workers without having to buy them out and wants to tie raises more closely to job performance, denying annual raises to subpar performers.Union officials say these proposals are the most aggressive Verizon has ever made.Verizon called its unionized employees well paid, saying that many field technicians earn more than $100,000 a year, including overtime, with an additional $50,000 in benefits. But union officials say that the field technicians and call center workers generally earn $60,000 to $77,000 before overtime and that benefits come to well under $50,000 a year.The crux of the clash is Verizon’s financial health. The company says its traditional wire line division is struggling, while the union says Verizon’s overall business, including Verizon Wireless, is thriving.Verizon earned $6.9 billion in net income for the first six months of this year, amid strong growth in its majority-owned Verizon Wireless cellphone operation. And its hefty investment in FiOS is starting to pay off.But the company has repeatedly said it needs to rein in costs in its wire lines division because it has lost business to wireless companies, to Internet companies like Vonage and Skype and to cable television companies, many of them nonunion, like Comcast and Time Warner.'"
"'11-08-07,'0','The city began using TIF in 1984, after state lawmakers authorized the financing technique to help cities spur development in blighted or declining areas. Once the city designates an area as a TIF district, the amount of property taxes that the city, county, schools and other local governments can collect from it is frozen for 23 years. Any new tax revenue generated from rising property values — the tax increment — is collected by the city and must be spent within the district or in a bordering one.The intent is to use these pots of money to lure investment from private real estate investors by fixing infrastructure, acquiring properties for developers or subsidizing them directly. As the developers build or renovate offices, homes and factories, property values presumably rise, leading to incremental increases in property tax revenues.“I think the public would be in some ways heartened to know that a lot of their money has gone into public facilities and infrastructure,” said Rachel Weber, associate professor in the urban planning and policy program at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a member of the panel appointed by Mr. Emanuel to examine the program’s effectiveness. “This might answer some of the TIF critics that have said that TIFs have just gone to line the pockets of developers.”But many people remain unswayed. They point out that much of the TIF money was diverted from public schools, parks, libraries and other taxing districts and was instead put into accounts that Mr. Daley controlled and kept shrouded in secrecy.“The findings do nothing to dissuade what had been my longstanding concerns, which were transparency in the process,” said John Fritchey, a Cook County commissioner.Mr. Fritchey, a North Side Democrat, irked Mr. Daley last year when, as a state representative, he introduced legislation that would have funneled TIF money directly to the Chicago Public Schools.Mr. Fritchey and other elected officials in Chicago have said that hundreds of millions of dollars are sitting in the accounts of scores of TIF districts, even after Mr. Daley tapped the TIF account last year to help balance the city’s 2011 budget.“There is no question that several good projects came to be through the use of TIF funds,” Mr. Fritchey said. “The bigger question is, Is the city getting its money’s worth out of that investment? It’s a troubling prospect to give millions of taxpayer dollars to projects that are also generating millions in developer fees.”Mr. Daley vigorously championed the use of TIF. By the end of his tenure in May, city officials had established more than 160 TIF districts that covered about one-third of Chicago. In total, the districts capture about $500 million a year, city and Cook County documents show.The amount is equal to about one-sixth of the city’s annual core budget, although under Mr. Daley the money was not tracked or approved as part of the budgeting process, and his administration provided only a vague accounting of its TIF activities.Mr. Emanuel has already made marked improvement in transparency by making TIF data public. He has promised to detail the flow of TIF dollars in his first city budget proposal, due in October.The analysis by the Chicago News Cooperative relied on TIF expense records obtained from the city’s Department of Finance through the Freedom of Information Act. Because officials did not classify expenditures by spending category in that data, the analysis involved categorizing thousands of payments. Ultimately, all but 2 percent of the city’s TIF spending was able to be tracked.Between 2002 and September 2010 — when Mr. Daley announced he would not seek re-election —he used about $626 million for public projects, including rejuvenated C.T.A. stations, 11 new schools, Millennium Park and dozens of other parks throughout the city. Another $238 million went to street improvements, bridge repairs, new streetlights and other public infrastructure projects.Developers received $505 million in subsidies, just over 30 percent of the total TIF money spent by Mr. Daley. Those payments included $5.4 million to United Airlines to move its headquarters to Willis Tower, $13.7 million for the insurance giant CNA to renovate its South Loop headquarters and $8.5 million to help renovate the Carbide and Carbon building to house the Hard Rock Hotel on Michigan Avenue.The city also spent more than $200 million buying properties, razing vacant buildings and cleaning up toxic land, mostly for the benefit of private developments.Another $90 million, or 5 percent of total spending, was used for program administration, consulting and legal services, and for job training for businesses in select districts.Those figures track closely with city data presented last month at a public forum organized by Mr. Emanuel’s Task Force on TIF Reform. The 10-member panel has promised to release a report and recommendations this month.According to the documents distributed at the forum on the South Side on July 28, the city has spent about $3.7 billion in TIF money on public works and private projects in the almost 30 years since the program began. Private subsidies accounted for a slightly greater share of the disbursements than public works.Of the $1.8 billion devoted to private investors, the leading categories were mixed-use projects (33 percent), commercial (29 percent), industrial (15 percent) and residential development (11 percent).The $1.7 billion for public works was divided among schools (47 percent), “streets and public buildings” (40 percent) and parks (13 percent).The city has also spent $131 million in TIF proceeds on programs to aid small-business owners and homeowners, the city documents show.In recent years, however, the balance of TIF spending has tilted more toward public works than private subsidies. The biggest factor in that shift was the city’s $515.2 million, seven-year initiative to build or renovate 23 schools. More than $340 million of the money earmarked for the schools program has already been spent, records show.That left about $868 million in unspent TIF money at the end of 2010. Although the weak economy and high rates of unpaid property tax bills could slow the program’s growth, city officials project that recently created TIF districts will still drive an increase in revenue, from $463 million this year to more than $508 million in 2013.How that money is used may depend on the reform panel’s suggestions. Members are “charged with developing a comprehensive policy regarding the use of TIF funds, including standards for future investments and measurable performance criteria,” according to the annual financial analysis released by Emanuel aides last month.In that document, city budget officials estimate that private developers contribute $5 for each TIF dollar the city invests.“The city understands that, on a big-picture level, there is value in looking at the program as a whole, which is why the mayor is leading a comprehensive effort to evaluate all aspects of the TIF program,” said Tom Alexander, a spokesman for the Emanuel administration.Representative Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois, praised the new mayor’s efforts at transparency and said the city should conduct an audit to track the contractors, lawyers and others who benefited from the program.“This is Chicago,” Mr. Quigley said, “and when you are flying blind with hundreds of millions of dollars, bad things can happen.”Critics of TIF frequently complain that too much of the money was spent in or near downtown, in areas that scarcely need such help. The analysis confirmed that TIF spending was skewed toward wealthier areas. For example, about $430 million was spent since 2002 in the Central Loop TIF district alone. That district’s TIF status expired in 2008.But some experts say Mr. Daley’s heavy spending on downtown reflected the fact that TIF districts in Chicago’s dense, booming core netted vast amounts of property taxes, while those in poor areas struggled to raise revenue.“In truly blighted areas, it’s very hard for TIF to jump-start development,” said Ms. Weber, the University of Illinois-Chicago professor and TIF panel member. “It’s a sweetener, so it plays off of there being some developer interest in an area.”'"
"'11-08-07,'0','“People are going to look for a safe place to hide,” said Ward McCarthy, the chief financial economist at Jefferies, a securities and investment banking firm. “And there aren’t many places. There’s gold and Treasuries.”Although the debt downgrade itself is somewhat abstract, even those who don’t pay much attention to economic news will hear of it on cable news programs and late-night comedy shows. And S.& P.’s judgment mainly reflects the anxieties many Americans are already feeling as a result of the nation’s debt troubles.“For a household, the concern is, am I going to keep my job and what are my future tax burdens?” said Glenn Hubbard, the Columbia Business School dean who led the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. “If Washington is having a very difficult time getting its fiscal house in order, as a household, I either expect radical spending cuts that will affect me or radical tax increases that are going to affect me,” Mr. Hubbard said. “It doesn’t mean I won’t buy bread, but it might mean putting off purchases” like washing machines, furniture or other large items.The United States stock market will be a crucial barometer when Wall Street opens on Monday morning, and some analysts expect it could actually rally after the big losses last week — down 7.1 percent in just five days. “This may be one of those sell-the-rumor-and-buy-the-news relief rallies,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.The stock market, though, does not have the safe haven protection of Treasuries, and is more a gauge of the broader economic outlook. With up to 70 percent of the economy driven by consumer buying, anything that could cause a further downshift in confidence is worrying.“People may not know the exact details of what’s going on, but when they hear that the U.S. is close to default, even though it may be for all practical purposes a short default, they get scared,” said Raghuram G. Rajan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago. “If people think the full faith and credit of the U.S. isn’t what it was thought to be, they think that something has changed. It does erode confidence a little bit.”For those worried that the downgrade could cause mutual funds, banks or money market funds to withdraw from Treasuries, there was little evidence of that over the weekend. The downgrade of long-term Treasuries does not affect the short-term federal debt widely held by money market mutual funds.Mr. Rajan said that downgrade of debt in a smaller emerging economy would most likely immediately bring jumps in interest rates that would affect companies, home buyers and car purchases. But the strength of Treasuries, which tend to determine mortgage rates, would keep rates low for now, he said.Indeed, Jim Moshier, general sales manager at Ricart Automotive, a car dealership in Columbus, Ohio, said the firm had “no indication from any of the many lenders that rates will go up. No indication whatsoever.”He said the dealership, which sells brands including Ford, Hyundai and Mazda, was enjoying a turnaround, with sales up 25 to 50 percent depending on the brand. Mr. Moshier, whose dealership had already sold 16 cars Saturday morning, said people had been holding onto cars throughout the recession and early recovery and were finally bringing them in for trades.“We’re seeing a lot of 2000-2001 trade-ins,” Mr. Moshier said. Normally we wouldn’t see 10-year-old trade-ins. We see three- to six-year-old trade-ins.”The battered housing market has shown little sign of recovering and has suppressed consumer spending as those who previously borrowed against their home equity to finance things as varied as remodeling, new boats or college educations, now are worried they will never be able to pay back their loans.A wave of foreclosures has further depressed housing prices and made it difficult for others to sell. In that context, the S.& P. downgrade will most likely be another drop in the bucket.“Housing has been bumping around the bottom,” said Richard Smith, chief of Realogy, which franchises brands including Century 21 and Coldwell Banker and owns the Corcoran Group, the New York real estate brokerage firm. “I don’t see it trending any lower than this, and we’re actually starting to see price balance in a number of markets.”Mortgage rates are unlikely to be affected immediately by the downgrade. But longer term, there is a risk that rates will rise.“If the political situation does not improve past the next election and the fiscal situation gets worse, then people might start to agree with S.& P.’s decision,” said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of United States fixed income strategy at Barclays Capital in New York. “If investors around the world then start shunning Treasuries, diversifying away from the U.S. dollar, that will show up in higher yields” — and higher mortgage rates.More near term, jittery buyers could pull back from the housing market. “When people are fearful, it’s never a good thing,” said Ellen Bitton, president of Park Avenue Mortgage in Manhattan. “Does it make somebody want to go out and spend $1 million on an apartment? I don’t think so.”Consumer confidence in general has taken a beating over recent months as high oil prices crimped purchasing power and uncertainty over the political wrangling caused people to defer big purchases.In July, consumer confidence had already hit its lowest level since the beginning of 2009, when the country was still officially in the midst of a recession, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index.Whether the downgrade ultimately leads to the decline of the United States economy or is merely a symbolic turning point is impossible to tell. “But if you picture a history book in 100 years with the timeline of China passing the U.S.,” quipped Mr. Rogoff, “one of the dates on the timeline will be ‘U.S. debt downgraded.’ ”'"
"'11-08-07,'0','A fund used to pay off bonds that financed the $250 million FedExForum could be pushed into the red by 2022 if the N.B.A. lockout lasts the entire year, a situation that would force the city of Memphis and Shelby County, Tenn., to pay the shortfall. The Commercial Appeal reported that the lockout was discussed at Wednesday’s meeting of the Memphis and Shelby County Sports Authority. With the loss of revenue associated with a lockout, projections show the current surplus of $10.8 million would be gone in time for the senior bonds’ Nov. 1, 2022, payment. It could reach $10.6 million by 2029, or about $600,000 annually for each government.'"
"'11-08-07,'0','Leon Washington of the Seattle Seahawks would seem to make the perfect test case for the new rule. He had three returns for touchdowns last season, and he aims to make sure the boom-or-bust glory of the kickoff return is not entirely lost.“I feel like we get past the 20-yard line no matter what,” Washington said last week. “We’re going to do business as usual.”That might work for Washington, whose straight-ahead running style would seem to give him an advantage when he returns from out of the end zone over players who run side to side. But for the rest of the league, the kickoff return is changing.Mike Westhoff, the Jets’ special-teams coach, whose kickoff and return teams are among the best in the league, said that when he had returner Brad Smith last year, he lined him up near the goal line and gave him orders to return anything in the end zone. Now, with Smith gone to Buffalo and the new rules in place, Westhoff does not seem so sure. He may put his returner up to 6 yards deep in the end zone and as long as the kick does not push him back, allow him to take it out. Westhoff has rarely put his lead blockers inside the 10, but this season, he said, he could put them at the 2 to allow for returns from deep in the end zone.But even Westhoff cannot imagine letting his returner take the ball out from the back of the end zone — a starting point that is possible against some strong-legged opponents or in good weather.“Early, you’ll see people run them out from 8 or 9 deep,” Westhoff said. “Leon Washington wants to run the ball. It’s a mind-set. That could end up being catastrophic. They could tackle you at the 14.”So goodbye to the kickoff specialist, and perhaps hello to more surprise onside kicks because the kicking team could end up with better field position. The rule was changed for one reason: the occasional big kickoff return is one of the most thrilling plays in football, but the hundreds of returns are also among the most dangerous plays in the game. In addition to moving the kickoff 5 yards forward, the rule was also changed to allow the coverage unit just a 5-yard running start rather than 10 or 15. Two years ago, when owners voted to eliminate the three-, four- and five-man wedges on returns, the league said there were seven injuries for every 100 kick plays compared with five injuries for every 100 regular plays.Because of the speed of coverage units running down to cover the kickoff, the injuries can be devastating. The Buffalo Bills’ Kevin Everett has made a remarkable recovery from a severe spinal-cord injury he sustained covering a kickoff in 2007. Last year, Rutgers player Eric LeGrand was paralyzed while covering a kickoff, an injury that shook Coach Greg Schiano so deeply that he has become a proponent of eliminating kickoffs in college football and replacing them with a modified punt. Schiano’s proposal, which he first outlined to The Star-Ledger of Newark, would give the “kicking” team the option to run an offensive play from fourth-and-15 on its own 30 or to punt from that position.Abolishing the kickoff seems too radical right now for the N.F.L., which usually makes incremental rules changes after long study and deliberation. Even when teams voted in March to change the kickoff rules, they set aside a proposal to eliminate the two-man wedge.But the Philadelphia Eagles’ special-teams coach Bobby April said Schiano’s idea was “awesome.”“I loved it,” he said. “The punts are totally different than two units coming at each other like Spartans and Trojans running at each other.”April also said he liked an idea by his boss, Andy Reid, not to allow blockers on the coverage team to go past a certain yard line, making those blocks stationary rather than moving at high speed, which would almost certainly diminish the ferocity of the collision. Still, in an indication of the divide between theory and reality, April admitted that he did not like the change to move the kickoff line.“It’s a beautiful part of the game,” he said.April said he was not sure how he would approach the new rule yet. In the past, if the Eagles had given up a 5-yard penalty and the opponent was kicking off from the 35, April’s rule was not to let his returner take the ball out if it was in the end zone. Now he figures the shorter running start for coverage teams will give returners a few more seconds to make their moves. Like most everyone else, he is convinced returners will grow antsy to return a kick, particularly when bad weather late in the season is likely to hold the ball up.“You can only sit back there and catch the ball and kneel down so many times before you say, ‘Forget it, we’ve been practicing all this time, let’s see what we can do,’ ” Giants kick returner D. J. Ware said.Not surprisingly, kickers are unabashed fans of the new rule. Jay Feely of the Arizona Cardinals said he thought that older kickers, who generally lose some distance with the years, would retain more value as free agents because there would be less of a premium placed on kickers who could boom the ball into the end zone.Still, Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes said that teams with good coverage units might kick the ball high to try to pin an opponent well inside the 20. That seems like an especially sound strategy at New Meadowlands Stadium, where the wind, even in good weather, makes kicking treacherous. Last year, in the 16 Giants and Jets home games played there, there were just nine touchbacks in 149 kickoffs (6 percent), according to Elias.Tynes said he wondered if touchbacks would skyrocket so much that the league would abandon the rule change after only one year. That would not be unprecedented. In 1994, the N.F.L. moved the kickoff line back to the 30 from the 35 to generate more returns.Denver’s Invesco Field, where the thin air helped turn 50 of 93 kickoffs (53.7 percent) into touchbacks, may not produce a single kickoff return this season, April said. That could give the N.F.L. its clearest glimpse at the balance between safe and stultifying.“In Denver, it’s going to be a joke,” Tynes said. “They’ll have to put the net up. Do you even work on kickoffs when you play there?”'"
"'11-08-07,'0','New Yorkers are protective of Grand Central Terminal, that Beaux-Arts masterpiece built in 1913 and restored in 1998. So, when word seeped out that Apple planned a store in the balconies of the great hall, there was bound to be a lot of curiosity. We certainly were curious. What did Apple have in mind? A large glass apple rivaling the great clock?Reasonable questions. And Apple must have drawings, right? Not so fast. Getting details from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controls the station, or New York State’s historic preservation office or Apple was like trying to uncover a state secret.Apple’s renderings of a store on the east and north balconies of the hall were very briefly flashed on a screen on July 25 during a meeting of an M.T.A. committee. You can see a rendering of the view from the great hall 1 hour, 28 minutes and 10 seconds into some comically bad video on the transportation agency’s Web site, if you have the right software. Otherwise, it is nowhere to be seen. The state’s historic preservation officer referred us to the M.T.A. And Apple’s spokesman has said the company will not release renderings until the store opens.The store is not a terrible idea. Apple would be paying almost four times the rent of the present tenant, the restaurant Métrazur, for a slightly larger space. The M.T.A. desperately needs the money. Apple, which builds elegant stores, has promised not to offend the more than 750,000 people who come through Grand Central each day. Apple’s presence will mostly be felt only when a new gizmo appears and a line forms. Lines in Grand Central? Not a problem.After some effort, we found someone who let us see the renderings, as long as we didn’t say who it was, and didn’t share them with you. They show a modestly lighted Apple. Useful as a signpost, and fine aesthetically.So stop the cloak-and-dagger. People have a right to be wary about sales pitches for Grand Central. Many of us remember the Kodak fiasco, which defaced some of the loveliest parts of the terminal. The best thing for everyone, Apple included, is public access to plans before projects are built, not after.'"
"'11-08-07,'0','The United States and Europe face parallel debt problems. Here, banks and investors are pitted against homeowners. There, banks and investors are pitted against nations. In both cases, governments have struggled to rebalance their books.There is no surplus of economic strength to throw at the problem. The United States and Europe ran up great debts in the years of plenty, living well and promising to pay later, even as they made expansive promises to aging populations.“The restorative forces of the economy are very weak and the immediate forces that will be in place are worsening the problem,” said Joseph E. Stiglitz, an economist at Columbia University. “We already know it’s not going to be a V-shaped recovery. I had said in my book that it would be more of an L-shaped, slow recovery. I think the answer now is a Japan-style malaise.”The weakness of the American economy is most evident in the lack of jobs. Only 55 percent of working-age adults held full-time jobs in July, the lowest level in modern times. About 25 million American adults want but cannot find full-time work, the government said Friday. The unemployment rate fell slightly, but mostly because 193,000 people stopped searching for jobs.Consumer spending makes up 70 percent of the nation’s economic activity, and people without jobs spend less money. For more than a year the government has reported that the economy was expanding more quickly than employment, fueling hope that hiring would follow.But last week the government said in a new estimate that it was mistaken, and that the economy actually had expanded at an annual rate of only 0.8 percent during the first half of the year — about the rate of population growth.Falling home prices also shadow the recovery. Total household wealth remains 12 percent below its prerecession peak, according to the Federal Reserve. Consumer spending has not suffered a comparable decline, suggesting that people still see brighter days ahead. If they are wrong or if they lose faith, economists say, spending could dip even more sharply — and with it, the broader economy.Corporate profits have climbed to record heights, but companies are not hiring. Long-term prosperity depends on investment in research and equipment and workers. But short-term fears are driving a turn toward austerity, said Gary P. Pisano, a professor at Harvard Business School.“The dynamic that our government has gotten trapped in, companies are trapped in as well,” he said.Professor Stiglitz said that falling stock prices could exacerbate the problem.“Firms with stock prices in decline will be reinvigorated to cut costs,” he said. “And what does that mean? Lowering wages and firing people and making people work harder.”Financial markets have also been slow to recover. A lack of confidence in the reported health of financial institutions is visible in the price of their shares. Bank of America closed Friday at $8.17, implying that investors believe the company is worth about $83 billion. Bank of America estimated its own value at roughly $206 billion at the end of June.There are no easy solutions. Professor Rogoff, who studies the aftermath of financial crises, has written that recoveries tend to take a very long time, particularly when downturns are as long and as deep as this one has been. The only way to hasten the process, he said, is to force the transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors — to rebalance the books. He argues that this could be done through a policy of tolerance for higher inflation, which would reduce the value of debts over time.“People sometimes ask, ‘What is the checklist of things that have to happen for a recovery?’ ” he said. “I think there’s basically one thing on it — improving the balance sheets.”Lawrence H. Summers, President Obama’s former chief economic adviser who has returned to his previous role as a professor at Harvard, said that exacting a toll from creditors could constrain future growth by discouraging future investments.“No one is satisfied with the efforts to reduce foreclosures and support the housing market,” he said. “The barrier to doing more has not been ideology or any solicitude for the financial sector, but concern about the adverse effects of inducing nonpayment by homeowners or reducing the flow of new mortgage credit.”Mr. Summers argues instead that the government should focus on tax cuts and directed spending to stimulate private spending and investment, policies for which there is little political appetite.But even such measures, he said, have only a limited effect.Ultimately, he said, crises are caused by too much confidence, too much borrowing and too much spending — and the irony is that they must be solved by more confidence, more borrowing and more spending.'"
"'11-08-07,'0','Re “Some Bankers Never Learn” (Fair Game, July 31), which described the mortgage banking industry’s opposition to a proposed rule that aims to reduce the number of risky loans in the wake of the subprime debacle:I was touched by the warnings from the Mortgage Bankers Association president, David Stevens, regarding the proposed requirements for down payments and debt-to-income ratios in order for a home loan to be considered of high quality. He called such requirements “unnecessary and not worth the societal costs of excluding far too many qualified borrowers from the most affordable mortgage loans to achieve homeownership.”But I say this: Let the mortgage bankers make loans without down-payment and ratio minimums out of their own money, not mine. Peter A. AmsterThe answer to housing’s ills is not to overregulate the mortgage process and make it harder for working families to buy homes. The fact that alliances of civil rights, real estate, labor, mortgage, consumer advocacy groups and lawmakers have taken a stand against the proposed Qualified Residential Mortgage rule should be checkpoint enough.The column did not mention the damage that the rule  would do  to homeownership for the masses. The rule, which would require the safest loans to have a 20  percent down payment, would exclude many first-time homebuyers, many of whom are Latino. Indeed, minorities have suffered great losses. But making it impossible for minority buyers to achieve homeownership would add insult to injury.We need a housing system that makes homeownership safe, attainable and sustainable.

"'11-08-07,'0','Goose was only 6 feet 4 inches and whippet lean, but he had an 84-inch wingspan. He could handle the ball, lead the fast break, shoot from outside. When he set up inside, he owned the paint. His repertory of tricks — often created spontaneously — combined with his quickness made him impossible to stop. He frequently scored 50-plus points a game. Regardless of the caliber of the opposition, one has to be able to put the ball in the basket to do that.Tatum’s most impressive shot was the hook, which he is credited with inventing. Swooping in one direction, he would arc the ball back the other way, toward the goal. Sometimes, however, he would stand dead still, flip the ball back over his head without looking, and wait for the crowd to tell him he had hit nothing but net. The Globetrotters had perfected the no-look pass; Tatum added the no-look shot.His blend of superb athletic skills with the charisma of a showman was unique. He was beyond cool; he was sly — a hustler, a trickster, a magician. You just knew he was up to no good. His perpetual grin said, “Here it comes, fool, and you can’t stop me.” He studied clowns and mimes, the better to evoke laughter from movement instead of speech.Although the Globetrotters became known primarily as entertainers, Tatum and his teammates could play serious basketball with anyone. In 1948 and 1949 exhibitions, they beat the reigning N.B.A. champion Minneapolis Lakers, led by George Mikan, the most dominant player of that era. Then they split a 22-game exhibition series with a college all-star team led by Bob Cousy.Tatum was born in 1921 in El Dorado, Ark., and played several sports in high school. His first love actually was baseball, and I saw him play first base for the Indianapolis Clowns before I saw him on the court. He began his pro career at age 16 with the Louisville Black Colonels, and appeared thereafter with Negro league teams in Memphis, Birmingham, Indianapolis and Detroit. His clowning on the field and at bat quickly drew Saperstein’s attention.During Tatum’s tenure, the Globetrotters graduated from barnstorming the nation’s backwaters to drawing huge audiences live and on national television. They helped keep the N.B.A. afloat in its early years by filling the arena for the first game of doubleheaders.Whatever Saperstein paid him, Tatum seemed to spend more, and he periodically disappeared while the team was traveling. In 1954, he left the Globetrotters for good, fronting a succession of his own touring teams through 1966. He is said to have carried the gate receipts (and the team’s payroll) in a paper bag.Tatum came to see my Cincinnati team play an N.C.A.A. tournament game in Lawrence, Kan., in 1959, and we took a wild ride afterward in his red Cadillac. That was my last contact with him. He died, apparently of a heart attack, in 1967.I know nothing of Tatum’s personal life, but Haynes once said, “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde had nothing on Goose.” He might have perpetuated the longstanding tradition of the tragic clown, but I remember watching him in awe. I couldn’t wait to get to the playground to emulate some of his tricks, knowing that our coaches would never permit them in organized competition.Even now, the mere mention of Goose Tatum makes me smile.'"
"'11-08-07,'0','“This program is my baby,” Ms. Thomas-Schmitt, 48, a former Alvin Ailey dancer, said during a news media tour of the camp in mid-July. “When we open a camp, we’re looking for a partner that can sustain us. Hopefully this is staying in Newark for a long time.”Stops along the way in the bustling high school, which was hosting two other summer programs for children at the time, included classes in ballet, jazz, modern dance, West African dance, percussion and personal development.Seven instructors — all but one have experience teaching other Ailey Arts in Education programs — lead the classes. In West African dance, children traversed the dance floor flailing their arms and stamping their feet to live accompaniment on a djembe drum; in ballet, a pianist played through a series of ports de bras and leaps.Not only did AileyCamp Newark get financial support from the Prudential Foundation, but it also received help from the high school, which donated its dance-ready spaces and classrooms, and from the performing arts center, which is providing its 514-seat Victoria Theater for the performance.Despite the absence of professional dancers, that performance is likely to have plenty of Ailey flavor.“One of the first things we did here is show the kids Ailey history,” said Felicia Swoope, 42, of Brooklyn, the director of the Newark camp. “We showed them videos of Ailey performing and explained the reason why he created the company.”Alvin Ailey, who died in 1989, founded his troupe in 1958 to promote African-American cultural expression and American modern dance. AileyCamp welcomes children of all races.Though dance experience is not a prerequisite for campers, several children applied to the program because of their interest in becoming professional dancers. By the end of camp, as many as a dozen may receive scholarships to dance with Ailey’s Junior Division at the Ailey School this fall.As for the camp, Ms. Swoope said there were no “real criteria for getting in.”“What we want them to understand most is that Ailey was a remarkable person, but he was also a person just like them,” she said. “He created work from his own experience, and we encourage them to do that also.”That may be more of a challenge in Newark than at the other AileyCamp sites, Ms. Thomas-Schmitt said. Though it is the camp closest to her home in Maplewood, and the easiest for her to visit, “I was a little nervous when we started here,” she said.As Ailey’s Arts in Education director, she has led several residencies in Newark’s public schools. “I knew about the negative hardships a lot of these young people are dealing with on a daily basis,” she said. “We don’t have as many daunting situations in other camps.” Those include incarcerated parents and drug-addicted ones, as well as unsafe neighborhoods, she said.“When we did our interviews for this camp,” Ms. Thomas-Schmitt said, “one of our questions was, ‘If you could change something in your life, what would it be?’ Ninety percent said, ‘Where I live.’ ”By the end of camp, they may feel differently about that. As part of Ms. Amenii’s creative communication class, campers are taking pictures of their neighborhoods and writing poems about them; the poems will accompany a show of the photographs as part of the performance.“When I think about them getting up on that stage, how important it makes them feel, it makes me teary-eyed,” Ms. Amenii said. “It will be one of the biggest moments of their lives.”By mid-July, some campers were already showing signs that the camp had been an enriching experience. “What they want us to remember is that all kids can dance, and no one is special or more important than anyone else,” said Briana Thomas, an 11-year-old from Newark who will enter Newark Early College High School as a sixth-grader in the fall. “I used to catch an attitude, but not so much anymore. It takes two to argue, and I have to think about being responsible for myself.“I learned that from AileyCamp,” she said.'"

"'11-08-07,'0','Oscar Wilde’s jail sentence was catastrophic for his writing, and it is almost obscene to suggest otherwise, as Tony Perrottet does in his essay of July 24 (“Serving the Sentence”). It is true that in the three years of imprisonment he wrote “De Profundis,” but in a comparable period before his arrest, he wrote “Salome,” “A Woman of No Importance,” “An Ideal Husband” and “The Importance of Being Earnest.”To Tony Perrottet’s survey of inspiration under incarceration might be added the case of Gioachino Rossini. The day before the premiere of “La Gazza Ladra” (“The Thieving Magpie”) on May 31, 1817, the opera still lacked an overture. The impresario locked Rossini into a room in La Scala along with some stagehands, who were under orders to toss the composer out the window if he did not produce an overture. The situation concentrated the mind, and as soon as he filled them, Rossini threw pages of his overture out the window to a waiting copyist.STEVEN G.

"'11-08-07,'0','Clyde Edgerton’s slim, charming 10th novel is set in the rural South, as the spring of 1963 turns into summer. It is a fraught moment in American history, but in the town of Starke, N.C., the rhetoric and rupture of the civil rights movement are still felt only as distant tremors. Change may be blowing in the wind, as the idiom of the day had it, but it still has to travel across the ground.Starke, well off the beaten path, is in the throes of a subtler upheaval. What “The Night Train” captures with precision is the manner in which an entire community, black and white, edges toward a new racial reality — bound not by a common will but by a common geography. The biggest moments in this engaging tale are small, and relentlessly upbeat: intimacy trumps bigotry, music expands minds, violence is averted where 10 years earlier it would have been all but assured.It’s difficult, and perhaps counterintuitive, to write about race in America without bombast, outrage or satire. How else to confront a system of structural inequality that has savagely circumscribed lives for generations? From Herman Melville to Flannery O’Connor, Ralph Ellison to Paul Beatty, the great chroniclers of race relations have been unflinching in their confrontation of unfathomable brutality, and also in their examination of a construct brimming with absurdity and paradox. Edgerton shares the latter appetite, even if his outlook is considerably more romantic.A writing teacher at the University of North Carolina Wilmington whose earlier novels include “Raney” and “The Bible Salesman,” Edgerton understands that race is simultaneously defining and illusory, and that the intersection where black meets white is often a musical one — as potent as that fabled crossroads where Robert Johnson is said to have sold his soul. Just as important, Edgerton knows this intersection is invariably on the black side of town, and that it’s whites who seek it out. That’s where Pat Boone learned to mimic Little Richard, Elvis Pres­ley studied Big Mama Thornton and the Beastie Boys ­reimagined themselves as Run-DMC.The vivid ensemble cast in “The Night Train” is anchored by a pair of teenage boys, Dwayne Hallston and Larry Lime Nolan. Both work at a furniture refinishing shop after school and aspire to be musicians. Dwayne is white; Larry Lime is black. Over the course of the novel, each will experience a musical epiphany. For Larry Lime, the jagged, unpredictable jazz of Thelonious Monk, so alive it seems a “part of the future,” demands deciphering and then allegiance. For Dwayne, it’s the funky soul of James Brown, whose brand-new album “Live at the Apollo” Dwayne’s band resolves to learn note for note.On many levels, Dwayne’s race consciousness is pronounced. He constantly examines the contours of his friendship with Larry Lime: painfully aware of its socially imposed strictures, inclined to speculate on the consequences of refusing to obey them and occasionally brave enough to risk those consequences. But when he decides to “be” James Brown, Dwayne spends not a moment parsing the implications. Ultimately — and unsurprisingly, to anyone who has studied the history of American popular music — it will be this white boy who smuggles black music onto the local TV station’s hit show.'"
"'11-08-07,'0','So it is critical to have a game plan. To start with, a little planning and subway route-finding will allow you to see a number of homes in just a few hours. The Sunday open house is a New York real estate tradition, and a broker, if you have one, can provide a list of potential places to visit. For buyers who want to go it alone, many open houses can be found online.Brokers suggest that buyers who are just starting to look see four to six places in a day. The idea is to get a quick sense of what styles and features are most appealing.Vinnie Sood, a 22-year-old who scouted out his first apartment last year, said he figured that out from his early experience with open houses. After learning that his parents would help him buy an apartment in Manhattan, Mr. Sood, while still a student at New York University, booked his Sundays full.“It didn’t take long before I knew that I liked more modern buildings with a sleeker look and modern amenities,” he said.In total, he went to about 30 open houses before closing on a two-bedroom condominium on the Upper West Side that he now shares with a friend.The open house experience actually begins long before passing through the front door, said Jaylin Ramer, an associate broker at Sotheby’s International Realty. Once you arrive in the neighborhood, take notice — and notes and photos — of the sights and sounds and feelings that you get from the building and its surroundings.“I think that a lot of people don’t take advantage of an open house to check out a neighborhood,” Ms. Ramer said. “Sundays are a good day to explore.”Once at the building, continue taking notes: What do you experience just outside the building — is it busy, or quiet? What about the entryway — if there is a doorman, is he friendly and does he seem happy to be there? And if there’s an elevator, can you be comfortable riding in it multiple times a day?“Pay attention to the journey into the apartment as opposed to just the apartment itself,” Mr. Olsen said. “There’s plenty of time to slice the apartment once you’re in there.”Still, slicing the inside is what you’re mostly there to do.Once in the door, make sure to sign in, providing your name and contact information and, if you have a broker, contact details on him or her. The listing agent will use the information to follow up, and would most likely prefer to work directly with your broker.Also, take your time. It can take less than 15 minutes to walk through most New York apartments, but don’t feel rushed. “Look out the window; sit on the couch,” Ms. Ramer said.Do not, however, dwell on photos and other personal effects in the home. Picture yourself there, not someone else.Peek around corners and under carpets, too. Mr. Sood recalls one apartment in Hell’s Kitchen that tugged at his heartstrings, largely because of its layout and balcony. But when he looked a little closer, he noticed water damage that was being shielded by a plant.Needless to say, some love was lost at that point.Not all the input from a visit should be visual. For condos and cooperatives, said Elizabeth Hamersley, an associate broker at Citi Habitats, it is appropriate to ask about building financials and whether any offers have been made. But sharing your own financials, or trying to negotiate, would be premature. If the two sides are serious, there will most likely be future talks.The open house also gives you a chance to learn more about the building itself. Buyers should not hesitate to pose questions to people in the common areas. What are the doorman’s hours? What are the neighbors like? Why is the common charge so high, if it seems to be?Ying Lee, a publicist in New York, learned the hard way that she should have asked these questions. After Ms. Lee, 27, bought a studio on the Upper East Side about four years ago, she discovered a neighbor who was so loud that she had to call the police on him a couple of times. He has since moved out.Whatever you do, said Erin Boisson Aries, a director of Brown Harris Stevens, take full advantage of being able to stroll through your potential home at your own pace. You may visit it again in the future, but you probably will be accompanied by an agent.“Open houses can be lot of hard work, and there’s a lot of information,” she said. “But they’re a great opportunity to be on your own schedule.”'"
"'11-08-07,'0','But to hear urban farmers speak, no borough, and no garden devoted to edibles, whether sprawling or thimble-size, is immune to theft. “Food is more attractive than flowers, especially in this economy,” said Marjorie J. Clarke, a caretaker at the flowers-only Riverside-Inwood Neighborhood Garden, known as RING.On the Upper West Side, cucumbers are tops for filching; in Harlem, the main draws are chilies and herbs; on the Lower East Side, green and red peppers; in Brooklyn and Queens, tomatoes and squash. But then, “tomatoes are universally enticing,” Ms. Bukowski said.“Tomato theft has probably been going on since the first farmer planted the first tomato,” she said.In early July, Gay Snyder, a first-timer at the Floyd Bennett Gardens Association in Brooklyn at the Gateway National Recreation Area, noticed that two of her tomatoes were turning as fiery red as a summer sunset.On July 12, after she roped in another newcomer, Barbara Pearson, to witness her debut harvest, astonishment replaced anticipation. The red tomatoes had vanished; only green ones were left. “Crop theft season at F.B.G.A. has officially begun,” Ms. Pearson observed.Ms. Snyder has added a lock to her gate. “It’s such a shame,” she said. “One of the things I enjoy about the garden is the feeling of peace and freedom and security, the ability to get away from crime and crowds. Losing my tomatoes dampened that dream a bit.”Adriann Musson, the president of the Floyd Bennett Gardens Association, said there were no locks or fences when she began gardening there 19 years ago. “We separated our gardens with string,” she said. Not anymore. “For some reason,” she said, “people don’t seem to consider taking veggies and flowers stealing.”Some culprits are outsiders, like a woman who drove up in a van, took out a hand shovel, and began digging up lilies until Ms. Musson intervened. Some thieves are garden members who pounce on super-ripe produce. Their explanation is that they are taking it lest it rot.Joanie Freedom, a founder in 1983 of the Sixth Street and Avenue B Community Garden, a busy place with 85 plots, said theft was a given. This summer the pepper crop is under tight surveillance.“Last August someone stole every pepper in the garden,” Ms. Freedom recounted. “We’ve lost not only ripe veggies but whole plants and garden ornaments to these folks who want to take an easy way around growing their own. I caught a woman taking all of our honeysuckle blossoms because it was cheaper than buying them in Chinatown.”Sally Young shrouds her 18 heirloom tomato plants in bird netting, but it is not birds she is trying to outwit. Claude Bastide, who grows aromatic herbs, had his spearmint and rosemary plants stolen early in the season. He responded with a sign: “Dear Plant Thief: If I catch you stealing my plants, I will boil you alive in a cauldron filled with poison ivy and stinging nettles until your flesh falls off your bones!”The wording caused an intramural stir. Some gardeners found the sign hilarious, but others thought it overly aggressive. “No one should lose sleep over that sign,” said Mr. Bastide, whose herbs have gone unmolested since he put it up. “I know I don’t lose sleep over the loss of some of my plants. It’s just a big-city annoyance that one has to shrug off.”Garden theft is by no means unique to New York. In 2007, David Tracey, a Vancouver journalist and environmental designer, published “Guerrilla Gardening, a Manualfesto.” Tips from the book appear on Ecolife, a Web site devoted to green living. He says yellow tomatoes are less enticing than red ones; protective fencing and belligerent signs are acceptable; and hiding desirable fruits like raspberries behind beets or parsnips is smart strategy. He also has a Zen-like attitude to dealing with stealing. “Invent some better scenario,” he wrote, “where the stolen food somehow ends up in the stomachs of people who need it.”Robert Cruz helped build the 103rd Street Community Garden in East Harlem, with money from the New York Restoration Project. Since 2004, he has watched over the various herbs, fruits and vegetables in the nine plots, along with two pomegranate trees and the winter-hardy banana tree he calls “the star of the show” for the nostalgia it inspires among his Caribbean neighbors.This summer, the garden, which has sports areas, a shaded picnic space and vegetable plots, is under reconstruction and will be getting a protective fence around the planting area. The old wire mesh was not up to the task of keeping probing hands out of the tomato and pepper patches. “The joke is that we’re going to install a 220-volt electric fence to keep the thieves away,” Mr. Cruz said.“I know that people who garden in the country have trouble with squirrels and deer and turkeys; here in our neighborhood, we have old ladies,” he said. “They’re the culprit.”Mr. Cruz was sitting on his stoop last summer when he noticed a couple of elderly women on hands and knees on the sidewalk clawing their way through the mesh to get at the chili peppers. They did not notice him swoop in for the bust. “Ladies, if you would only ask, I would gladly give you more than what you’re stealing,” he remembers telling them before he gave them a tour, and some peppers.“My philosophy is that I can either get very selfish or I can take pleasure that what I plant gave somebody else pleasure,” Mr. Cruz said. “If taking a ripe tomato that doesn’t belong to them is going to make someone’s day, let them have it.”At the Brooklyn Bears community garden on Pacific Street, the most egregious bandits, members said, were an elderly man who thought it his right to fill shopping bags with produce and a gardener whose key was taken away after she was repeatedly caught pocketing the vegetables of others. A peach tree by the fence had a branch ripped off by sidewalk “grazers” (a euphemism gardeners use for thieves), but all things considered, said Jon Crow, who has gardened there for 26 years, the loss to theft is minimal. Like many gardens, the Pacific Street garden has a communal planting box where goodies like cherry tomatoes are free for the plucking.“As the saying goes, you don’t get too attached to your farm animals, and you don’t get too attached to your vegetables in a community garden,” Mr. Crow said. He sees the next threat to the gardens as politics, not pilferage; the GreenThumb initiative operates on $800,000 in federal funds annually, a perennial target of cost-cutting. (This season’s subsidy was restored after the city’s community gardening coalition organized a rally and petition campaign.) “The community gardening movement here would be lost without GreenThumb,” he warned.Ms. Snyder, crestfallen after losing her ripe tomatoes to theft on July 12, had better news two weeks later. One of her surviving tomatoes was finally ready for harvest. It tasted like validation.'"

"'11-08-08,'0','The leading spokesman for what passes for political liberalism in China, Mr. Wen is by most accounts ideologically isolated on the Communist Party’s nine-member Politburo standing committee. More than once, his views have been rebuffed, tacitly or openly, in party organs. There are tantalizing hints of rifts with his boss, President .“Grandpa Wen,” who shares the common man’s pain and champions his interests, is easily China’s most popular politician. But internally, as Communist Party hard-liners strengthen their control, his advocacy of political reform has increasingly sapped his influence.He has become such a high-risk figure, one official news media editor says, that a conservative-led state radio network last year balked at his offer of an exclusive exchange with listeners on the air. Even liberals who support Mr. Wen’s reformist oratory find themselves disillusioned by his failure to gain traction within the leadership.“When Wen became premier eight years ago, people had high hopes because his speeches always leave people hopeful,” said He Weifang, a liberal Beijing legal scholar. “But now it has been eight years. His term is coming to an end. It’s doubtful whether he genuinely has the strong will to reform, because it doesn’t seem he has taken enough convincing actions to resist the conservatives.”Mr. Wen has never been seen as especially strong. Some scholars of China’s leadership say his unspecific calls for democracy and people power actually fit comfortably within a Communist Party committed to absolute rule.Others question his maverick credentials, calling him less a reformer than the good cop in a bad-cop system. “Wen’s become the human face of the administration, and he’s been very effective,” said Susan Shirk, a longtime China expert at the . “The other possibility is that Wen Jiabao has two faces. He advocates transparency in his public statements, but only insofar as it doesn’t threaten the authority of the party.”But in a mostly faceless and closed-mouth leadership, no one strains so publicly at his tethers — or suffers as many rebuffs — as Mr. Wen. That pattern has intensified as jockeying begins for next year’s choices of a new politburo and the next generation of China’s top leaders.The Wenzhou episode is illustrative. One political analyst close to senior officials said Mr. Wen had not planned to visit the disaster scene; a deputy prime minister who oversees work safety, Zhang Dejiang, was to handle the matter.But with Mr. Zhang in charge, backhoes crushed and buried a wrecked train car at the site — and provoked a national outcry from bloggers who accused the government of a cover-up. Mr. Wen, then in a People’s Liberation Army hospital and limited to occasional appearances, was sent to Wenzhou to soothe the masses.Mr. Wen pointedly mentioned that he had been sick — a rare disclosure for a leader — then delivered a call for truth, justice and an inquiry that was open at “every step” to public supervision. The official state media took Mr. Wen’s broadside as a pass to keep digging into Railways Ministry incompetence.But the event underscored how the Communist Party’s Department trumps a prime minister’s pledge of openness. China’s national CCTV network, which normally trails Mr. Wen to every disaster scene, did not broadcast his remarks live, prompting one anchor to protest on his microblog. Within a day, press coverage backflipped to cheery articles like a paean to the new Beijing- high-speed line.And it showed that Mr. Wen, who leads the cabinetlike State Council, has trouble controlling a State Council investigation — indeed, not even President Hu controls China’s fractured ruling elite.As he did after the train accident, Mr. Wen stood in the rubble of the Sichuan Province earthquake in 2008 and promised a transparent investigation into the collapses of shoddily built schools that killed thousands of children. The press reported that 2,500 investigators were deployed. But no wrongdoing was ever disclosed — instead, several activists who pursued malfeasance wound up in detention.Mr. Wen can be crafty. In April 2010, analysts puzzled over a People’s Daily essay by him — published while President Hu was in — extolling Hu Yaobang, the popular leader forced to resign in 1987 for his reformist bent and whose death, in 1989, helped propel the protests. One anecdote described a Hu Yaobang visit during which he dispatched Mr. Wen to interview with Guizhou Province villagers — secretly, he wrote, because Hu Yaobang did not trust local leaders to let them speak freely.President Hu was the Guizhou party chief during that visit. Outsiders largely missed the article’s implicit jab — but President Hu was mightily displeased, said an editor with high official connections.More often, Mr. Wen is blunt. In a speech last August in , the birthplace of China’s market-oriented reforms, he warned that “without political reform, China may lose what it has already achieved through economic restructuring.”He followed in October by telling CNN that “the people’s wishes for and needs for democracy and freedom are irresistible” and that Chinese should be permitted to criticize the government more freely. The state press, which ignored a similar CNN interview in 2008, ignored this one as well.But shortly afterward, People’s Daily began publishing a five-editorial series on party discipline, which was said by two state media editors to have been orchestrated by President Hu’s leading strategists and approved by top leadership.A sentence in one stood out: “The notion that political reform has seriously lagged” is not only “contrary to objective laws, but also inconsistent with objective facts.”At least once after the CNN appearance, two journalists close to senior party officials said, members of the leadership personally, although how strongly was unclear, warned Mr. Wen about making statements that appeared out of tune with the Communist Party line.At 68, with in sight, Mr. Wen may not care about such slaps on the wrist. In fact, he might gain a voice in shaping the next class of upper-echelon leaders.But Mr. Wen’s happy-warrior persona also shows signs of tarnishing his standing with the masses, as government action consistently falls short of his promises. “More people are starting to ask, ‘Why don’t these words come true?’ ” said Mr. He, the legal scholar.Chen Jianping, 23, a friend of two of Wenzhou train-crash survivors, said “I only believe part of what Premier Wen said. The government is unable to carry out everything it promises; some of what he says may be just show.”Yet in a China that seems more suspicious of authority almost daily, a show may be better than nothing.“The cynicism about the system is rising,” said Cheng Li, a scholar of the Chinese leadership. “My real worry is whether the next generation will have a Wen Jiabao-like leader.”'"
"'11-08-08,'0','Verizon’s chief executive, Lowell C. McAdam, took a hard line on Sunday, arguing that workers in Verizon’s heavily unionized wireline businesses must agree to cost reductions. The wireline businesses, which include home and business telephone landlines as well as the FiOS services, have had declines in their customer base and profitability in the last decade, amid growing competition from mobile phones, cable companies and services like Skype and Vonage.“It is clear that some of the existing contract provisions, negotiated initially when Verizon was under far less competitive pressure, are not in line with the economic realities of business today,” Mr. McAdam wrote in a letter on Sunday to the company’s management to discuss the strike. “As the U.S. automobile industry found out a few years ago, failure to make needed adjustments — when the need for change is obvious — can be catastrophic.”The strike involves Verizon repair technicians, FiOS installers and call center workers from Massachusetts to Virginia. The walkout was called by the Communications Workers of America, which represents 35,000 of the strikers, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents 10,000.Verizon wants the unionized workers to start contributing to their health care premiums, including $1,300 to $3,000 a year toward family coverage. The company has also called for freezing pension contributions for current employees, eliminating traditional pensions for future workers, limiting sick days to five a year, and eliminating all job security provisions.“What they’re asking is hard for us to swallow because the company had profits of $22 billion over the last four years,” said Joe Iorio, a field technician based in Brooklyn, who has worked for Verizon for 15 years. “They’re crying poverty, they say they can’t afford to pay us. We’re just not going to stand for it anymore.”Several union members said they were insulted that they were being asked to make deep concessions when Verizon’s top five executives received a total of $258 million in compensation, including stock options, over the last four years.Verizon says its unionized employees are well paid, with many field technicians earning more than $90,000 a year, including overtime, with an additional $50,000 in benefits. Union officials say the field technicians and call center workers generally earn $60,000 to $77,000 a year before overtime and that benefits come to far less than $50,000 a year.Michael Parker, executive vice president for a communications workers’ local in Annapolis, Md., said it was not easy to go on strike. “It’s a scary thing — we have 45,000 families that don’t have income coming in,” he said. “But we have to draw a line in the sand and defend what we believe in. We bargained for 50 years to gain these things, and we don’t want to give that back.”Jeff Kagan, founder of a telecommunications research firm in Georgia, said the strike would undoubtedly slow construction of Verizon’s FiOS network and installation of FiOS in homes, but the short-term hit was worth it to Verizon.“Their traditional local phone business is shrinking, while the other parts of the business are still growing,” he said. “It’s just a matter of restructuring so they can remain competitive. If they’re not competitive, Verizon will lose business and everyone loses — investors, customers and workers.”Richard Hurd, a professor of labor relations at Cornell, said the two unions felt Verizon was trying to humble them by pushing them to adopt some of the same, less generous benefits that many of the company’s 135,000 nonunion workers have. “When you challenge unions like that, in a sense the company is pushing them into a strike,” he said.In 2000, Verizon had another big strike, when 86,000 workers walked out for two weeks, causing widespread delays in repairs.As recently as Wednesday, union and Verizon officials said they thought a strike was highly unlikely. But several union officials said on Sunday that they were stunned that Verizon still had 100 proposals for concessions on the negotiating table on Saturday, including ones to eliminate Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday and Veterans Day as holidays.“No one expected six weeks of bargaining would produce absolutely no movement or compromise by the company,” said Robert Master, a communications workers spokesman. “This was an unprecedented situation.”Verizon officials have repeatedly said that the two unions broke off talks on Sunday, but union officials said they have asked for new meetings, and Verizon has refused.'"

"'11-08-08,'0','Sumner Redstone should enjoy watching Rupert Murdoch squirm. There’s no love lost between Mr. Redstone, the 88-year-old chairman of Viacom and CBS, and Mr. Murdoch, the head of the News Corporation. Last year, Mr. Redstone even presciently ridiculed his competitor’s fondness for newspapers. But as Mr. Murdoch grapples with the misdeeds of one of his British tabloids, Mr. Redstone can delight only so much. He has his own costly governance problems, too.Mr. Redstone and his deputies have overcome some of them. Under Les Moonves, CBS has been riding an advertising rebound and capitalizing on digital opportunities with Amazon and Netflix. MTV’s unexpected cultural phenomenon “Jersey Shore” and Paramount’s Oscar-winning movie “The Fighter” have helped propel Viacom, which reported better-than-expected earnings last week. So did the decisions last year by Philippe Dauman, its chief executive, to pay a dividend and buy back stock.As a result, shares of CBS and Viacom have outperformed rivals over the last year. Even over a five-year span, roughly since Mr. Redstone separated the older broadcast TV business from the supposedly hipper cable network operations, Viacom’s total shareholder return of around 40 percent matches Disney’s and beats Time Warner’s. News Corporation has lost shareholders around 10 percent in value since mid-2006.Yet Mr. Redstone’s empire has plenty in common with Mr. Murdoch’s. There are dual-class share structures with unequal voting rights giving them control; unspecified succession plans; children on the boards who’ve squabbled with Dad; and an F grade from the Corporate Library, a governance watchdog. While the News Corporation’s board is packed with Mr. Murdoch’s cronies, the average age of nonexecutive directors at Mr. Redstone’s companies makes them old enough to have watched Ed Sullivan’s 1948 debut.Despite operational improvements, the market hasn’t overlooked these flaws. According to Barclays Capital forecasts for 2012, CBS currently trades at around a 20 percent discount to the sum of its parts, and Viacom trades at nearly 30 percent less than it is worth. As the News Corporation’s shareholders are discovering, governance can make a difference. It’s a lesson Mr. Redstone’s people shouldn’t overlook.It’s a love-hate relationship. The White House doesn’t like Standard & Poor’s downgrading of America’s debt — it even picked holes in the firm’s numbers. European officials don’t welcome critiques of sovereign credit either. Yet governments seem broadly inclined to regulate credit rating firms tightly. The better answer is to cut them loose.'"
"'11-08-08,'0','For the federal agents, it seemed less an aggressive recruiting drive than a public diplomacy mission. They took pains to describe themselves as lovable hackers under their crew cuts.Ryan Pittman, an ex-cop who now works computer crime cases in the Army’s criminal investigations division, said the convention was an opportunity to whittle away the federal agents’ image as “jackbooted thugs.” Ahmed Saleh, a computer crime investigator with NASA, described a job that might be appealing “if you’re a geek and you want to catch the bad guys.”There seemed to be plenty of receptive hackers. Christine Banek, 29, a software programmer with plum-colored hair, sidled up to Mr. Saleh after the panel and asked if his agency was still hiring. She said she had applied online and had not heard back. “If they were offering, I would totally take it,” she said. Later, she suggested aloud that the government legalize marijuana. Positive drug tests generally disqualify a candidate from a law enforcement position.It flies. It spies. It is the color of sunshine, and it has googly eyes.Meet WASP, the Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform, one of the star attractions of this year’s Black Hat conference.It’s a remote-controlled plane with a computer in its belly that can fly up to 400 feet above the ground, snoop quietly on wireless networks below and attack one if it wants to. It can also pretend to be a GSM cellphone tower, eavesdropping on calls and text messages that pass through.The WASP was built by Richard Perkins and Mike Tassey using hobby materials, including a Styrofoam plane body, a plastic propeller and foam tires, along with circuit boards and wires. The materials are all off the shelf, costing $6,190 — a fraction of the cost of a spy plane, with cyberweapons included.Its creators eschew the term “spy plane.” “There’s a negative connotation to a spy plane,” Mr. Tassey said. “This was done in an attempt to prove a concept.”“That it can be done,” he said.His sentiment perfectly embodied the ethos of Black Hat, a spirited gathering of technologists who sometimes make scary things to show that they can be made, and at other times break things to show how badly they need to be fixed.The bird conjured by Mr. Perkins and Mr. Tassey is barely four feet long and becomes an imperceptible, quietly humming little creature when it hovers overhead. It could be deployed over, say, an office building to sniff out information going across its wireless network. Or if the office network is well secured, the plane could follow an employee on a trip to a neighborhood Starbucks.The WASP could mimic the cafe’s network, luring the unwitting employee and allowing access to a laptop or cellphone. As Mr. Tassey put it, “In Starbucks, no one can hear your laptop scream.”They sat at tables along the perimeter of a ballroom in the Rio hotel. Lights were low. Laptops burned like campfires. Men and women hunched over the machines, their backs curved like question marks. Their fingers clicked away furiously.“This is a spelling bee for hackers,” explained Giovanni Vigna, 42, a professor of computer science from the University of California, Santa Barbara. “It’s a way to prove your hacking skills.”Each team, he said, was given the same type of virtual server, with the same strengths and weaknesses. The teams were charged with defending their servers and attacking those of others. Each time a weak spot was attacked, a flag was awarded. The team with the most flags won. Hence, the name of the contest: Capture the Flag. This was the final round.Contests are a big deal at Defcon. But they’re not all on computers. Defcon is about celebrating tinkering.There was a “lockpicking village” where interested parties did exactly that: pick locks. “Most of us see locks as puzzles,” Babak Javadi, 26, one of the organizers, explained. He has been taking apart locks since he was a kid, he said, and now runs a security business, specializing in high-security locks.There was a barber offering mohawks. There were vendors selling “advanced gaming eyewear,” glasses that sell for up to $189 a pair, designed to reduce the glare of a computer screen and ease eye fatigue. There were vendors selling luggage tags that said “Geek on Board.”In one hall, a competition was under way to invent a beer-cooling contraption. In another, teams were competing to tamper with so-called tamper-resistant materials.“You’re doing something you’re not meant to do: That’s the essence of hacking,” said Chris Kuivenhoven, 34, a security engineer from Atlanta. “People can use it for good or bad.”'"
"'11-08-08,'0','President Obama acknowledged the challenge in his Saturday radio and Internet address, saying the country’s “urgent mission” now was to expand the economy and create jobs. And Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in an interview on CNBC on Sunday that the United States had “a lot of work to do” because of its “long-term and unsustainable fiscal position.”But he added, “I have enormous confidence in the basic regenerative capacity of the American economy and the American people.”Still, the numbers are daunting. In the four years since the recession began, the civilian working-age population has grown by about 3 percent. If the economy were healthy, the number of jobs would have grown at least the same amount.Instead, the number of jobs has shrunk. Today the economy has 5 percent fewer jobs — or 6.8 million — than it had before the last recession began. The unemployment rate was 5 percent then, compared with 9.1 percent today.Even those Americans who are working are generally working less; the typical private sector worker has a shorter workweek today than four years ago.Employers shed all the extra work shifts and weak or extraneous employees that they could during the last recession. As shown by unusually strong productivity gains, companies are now squeezing as much work as they can from their newly “lean and mean” work forces. Should a recession return, it is not clear how many additional workers businesses could lay off and still manage to function.With fewer jobs and fewer hours logged, there is less income for households to spend, creating a huge obstacle for a consumer-driven economy.Adjusted for inflation, personal income is down 4 percent, not counting payments from the government for things like unemployment benefits. Income levels are low, and moving in the wrong direction: private wage and salary income actually fell in June, the last month for which data was available.Consumer spending, along with housing, usually drives a recovery. But with incomes so weak, spending is only barely where it was when the recession began. If the economy were healthy, total consumer spending would be higher because of population growth.And with construction nearly nonexistent and home prices down 24 percent since December 2007, the country does not have a buffer in housing to fall back on.Of all the major economic indicators, industrial production — as tracked by the Federal Reserve — is by far the worst off. The Fed’s index of this activity is nearly 8 percent below its level in December 2007.Likewise, and perhaps most worrisome, is the track record for the country’s overall output. According to newly revised data from the Commerce Department, the economy is smaller today than it was when the recession began, despite (or rather, because of) the feeble growth in the last couple of years.If the economy were healthy, it would be much bigger than it was four years ago. Economists refer to the difference between where the economy is and where it could be if it met its full potential as the “output gap.” Menzie Chinn, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin, has estimated that the economy was about 7 percent smaller than its potential at the beginning of this year.Unlike during the first downturn, there would be few policy remedies available if the economy were to revert back into recession.Interest rates cannot be pushed down further — they are already at zero. The Fed has already flooded the financial markets with money by buying billions in mortgage securities and Treasury bonds, and economists do not even agree on whether those purchases substantially helped the economy. So the Fed may not see much upside to going through another politically controversial round of buying.“There are only so many times the Fed can pull this same rabbit out of its hat,” said Torsten Slok, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.Congress had some room — financially and politically — to engage in fiscal stimulus during the last recession.But at the end of 2007, the federal debt was 64.4 percent of the economy. Today, it is estimated at around 100 percent of gross domestic product, a share not seen since the aftermath of World War II, and there is little chance of lawmakers reaching consensus on additional stimulus that would increase the debt.“There is no approachable precedent, at least in the postwar era, for what happens when an economy with 9 percent unemployment falls back into recession,” said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. “The one precedent you might consider is 1937, when there was also a premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, and the economy fell into another recession more painful than the first.”There is at least one factor, though, that could make a second downturn feel milder than the first: corporate profits. Corporate profits are at record highs and, adjusted for inflation, were 22 percent greater in the first quarter of this year than they were in the last quarter of 2007.Nervous about the future of the economy, corporations are reluctant to make big investments like hiring. As a result, they are sitting on a lot of cash.While this may not be much comfort to the nation’s 13.9 million unemployed workers, it may be to their employed counterparts.“In the financial crisis, when markets were freezing up, the first response was, ‘I’ve got to get some cash,’ ” said Neal Soss, the chief economist at Credit Suisse. “The fastest way to get cash is to not have a weekly payroll, so that’s why we saw such big layoffs.”Corporate cash reserves today, he said, could act as a buffer to layoffs if demand drops.“There are arguments that another recession would be worse, and there are arguments in the other direction,” Mr. Soss said. “We just don’t know at this juncture.

"'11-08-08,'0','Earlier Sunday, the Obama adminstration announced that Mr. Geithner would be staying on as secretary, a move whose timing appeared intended to reassure nervous investors.As officials huddled to discuss strategy, traders and investors around the world also prepared for the fallout from the downgrade of the United States’ rating, as markets in neared their opening Monday. Although many experts said the impact in the bond market would not be as stark as first feared, the ruling by on Friday has already unnerved global stock markets.Shares across the fell sharply Sunday, with stocks in falling 7 percent, the steepest daily fall in more than a decade. United States stock futures were lower, as well.Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region fell Monday, with the Nikkei index in down 1.3 percent at midday, and the price of gold — considered a safe haven at times of uncertainty — jumped to yet another nominal record high, to more than $1,688, underscoring the lingering anxiety. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 were 1.8 percent lower, and the price of oil sagged $3 a barrel.After the G-7 conference call, Yoshihiko Noda, the Japanese finance minister, told reporters that global markets’ trust in both United States Treasuries and remained “unshaken.”With signs of slowing growth in the United States and Europe, and government budgets and central bank balance sheets already stretched to the limit, the options for policy makers are dwindling. “None of them have a lot of things to do to alleviate the crisis,” Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said Sunday. “Fiscal stimulus is not an option right now.”In addition, it was not clear whether Washington would be able to break out of its partisan stalemate and produce in the next few months the kind of overarching deficit reduction that credit agencies and the markets will most likely demand.“I just keep asking for the sake of the economy: can’t we wait on the things that we’re going to yell at each other about and start on the things that we agree on,” , chairman of the , said on ’s “Meet the Press.”In an interview with CNBC on Sunday, Mr. Geithner emphasized how critical it was for lawmakers to put aside their differences. “Congress ultimately owns the credit rating of the United States,” he said. “They have the power of the purse of the Constitution. And they’re going to have a chance now to earn back the confidence of the investors around the world.”The country, he said, “is much stronger than Washington.”This week the focus may shift to policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who meet on Tuesday, but their options are narrower than they have been at other moments of turbulence in global markets. Short-term interest rates are already near zero, and cannot be lowered further, while long-term rates are also at historic lows.Another series of huge purchases of government bonds and other assets — so-called — remains an option, but two earlier rounds have done little to bolster consumer confidence or economic growth.Some analysts said that Italy, which is fast losing investor confidence, posed a threat to the financial system too great for any one economic superpower to cope with alone, and that a coordinated effort was needed. “They just can’t allow the Italian economy to go down the tubes,” Uri Dadush, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Sunday. “It would be a -type situation.” He was referring to the collapse of the bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008, which helped to touch off the global financial crisis.Mr. Dadush put the cost of a bailout of Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro zone, at $1.4 trillion, with Spain requiring $700 billion. Those sums are far beyond the capability of the Continent’s current rescue fund. Mr. Weinberg and other analysts said that bond buying by the European Central Bank was likely to provide only temporary relief. The bank’s intervention in the much smaller market for Greek bonds failed to prevent a de facto default.“This is just a Band-Aid to show the markets they are doing something,” Mr. Weinberg said.European leaders nevertheless sought to offer their own reassurances to the markets. Late Sunday, the governments of and issued a joint statement promising to quickly enact the expanded bailout package for Greece that they agreed to last month. They also praised efforts by Spain and Italy to improve their finances and competitiveness.The central bank intervened in European bond markets last week for the first time since March. But it appeared that it was buying relatively small amounts of Portuguese and Irish bonds.The bank may have intended this to signal its resolve, but markets seemed to have interpreted the modest intervention as a sign of weakness, creating pressure for a bolder move. The bank’s vigorous response Sunday was a significant escalation of the milder intervention of the past.Markets are likely to quickly test how far the central bank will go to protect Italy and Spain. Even the bank would be hard-pressed to buy enough bonds to hold down yields on Spanish and Italian debt in the long term, and prevent the countries’ borrowing costs from reaching levels that would eventually prove ruinous, analysts said.European governments have agreed to use their joint bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, to buy government bonds on the secondary market. But Germany will be reluctant to risk its own credit rating by committing vast funds to Spain and Italy, a move that would be politically unpopular as well.In any event, it will be several months before the bailout fund has the resources and legal authority to begin buying bonds.'"

"'11-08-09,'1','By Robert Cyran The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.Could Apple be worth $1 trillion? It’s conceivable. The $342 billion iPhone and iPad maker became – if only briefly – the most valuable company in the United States when it surpassed Exxon Mobil on Aug. 9. Yet its sales have been surging 80 percent a year, and profit faster. And Apple trades roughly in line with the growing U.S. market — and at less than half the price-to-earnings multiple it fetched in 2006, when revenue growth was much slower.Apple now trades at about 11 times estimated earnings for the fiscal year ending September 2012. The S&P 500 index is valued at about 10 times next year’s earnings. But Apple’s sales growth is not far off 10 times faster than that of the average company. The gadget producer also sits on $76 billion of cash and investments.To get at this dissonance another way, consider Apple’s PEG ratio. This hints at the price of growth by dividing a company’s PE ratio by its projected percentage earnings growth. A smaller figure suggests a company is cheaper. Apple’s is 0.2. That’s low compared to growth darlings. Burrito purveyor Chipotle Mexican Grill, for instance, comes in at 2.1, and Salesforce.com at 13.2. Pandora and LinkedIn aren’t even expected to make money.Alternatively, put Apple on the same PE multiple it traded on in 2006, and it would be worth almost $900 billion. A premium for today’s faster growth could get it to $1 trillion. Apple can’t be so cheap just because Steve Jobs is in precarious health.True, Apple already sells more per quarter than it did in all of fiscal 2007, and it takes more and more success to move the needle. Growth could easily slow. Yet the smartphone and tablet markets are young, the company’s customers show remarkable fidelity, and areas such as television are ripe for new gadgets. Moreover, Apple’s return on equity is almost twice what it was in 2006, suggesting it has pricing power.Maybe investors simply can’t fathom so large a company. A $1 trillion Apple would mean adding all of Microsoft, Google, Intel and Amazon — and more to the firm’s current market capitalization. Perhaps Apple is correctly priced, the market too expensive, and growth stocks grotesquely so. But something doesn’t add up. In relative terms, Apple should be worth far more.'"

"'11-08-09,'1','HONG KONG — Inflation in China accelerated last month to its fastest pace in three years, with consumer prices up 6.5 percent from a year earlier mainly as a result of rising food prices.Further price increases could be on the way. The National Bureau of Statistics announced in Beijing on Tuesday morning that producer prices, which are primarily wholesale prices measured at the factory gate, were 7.5 percent higher in July than a year ago.Jing Ulrich, the chairman of China markets at JPMorgan Chase, said in a research note that inflation could peak soon in China and then decline. The increase in consumer prices last month was slightly higher than expected while the rise in producer prices was a little smaller than expected.Rising prices could make it harder for the Chinese government to cut interest rates or take other measures to stimulate the economy if weakness in the American and European economies causes a slowdown in Chinese exports.China’s last burst of inflation, in the spring of 2008, ended abruptly when the global financial crisis worsened. When the Chinese economy slowed by early 2009, the authorities responded by rapidly increasing the money supply through currency market interventions and the authorization of heavy lending by state-owned banks.Beijing officials continue to struggle with the aftermath of their huge expansion in the money supply in 2009 and 2010 in response to the global crisis.Share prices fell sharply in early trading on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets, echoing Wall Street’s steep drop on Monday. It was unclear the extent to which prices were also reflecting the latest Chinese economic indicators.'"
"'11-08-09,'1','And racial tension remains high among some groups, he said.“There’s no way to get around it,” Mr. Smith said. “It is what it is.”The district attorney said Mr. Anderson was standing near his car at a Jackson motel about 5 a.m. Sunday, June 26, when two carloads of teenagers pulled off the Interstate and into the motel parking lot. Several jumped from the vehicles and beat Mr. Anderson. A white sport utility vehicle drove away. As Mr. Anderson stumbled along the edge of the parking lot, the police said, the driver of a green Ford F250 pickup truck, Deryl Dedmon, accelerated and drove over him. Mr. Anderson was pronounced dead at a local hospital.“This is the first business that you get to coming off the highway, and so that was the first person that was out here and vulnerable,” Mr. Smith, the district attorney, told CNN.Mr. Dedmon, a slight, blond 18-year-old, was charged with murder and remains in jail on $800,000 bond. Two teenage girls who were in the truck were not charged, the police said.John A. Rice, 18, was originally charged with murder, but a judge in Hinds County, William Barnett, dropped the charges to simple assault.The case is headed this month for a grand jury, where prosecutors will argue that it was both a hate crime and a murder and that both men should be indicted.“These teenagers have a history of harassing white teens who had black friends or gay teens,” Mr. Smith said.Neither man has entered a plea. Their lawyers did not respond to requests for an interview. But Mr. Dedmon’s lawyer, Lee Agnew, had said in an early hearing that he had not seen evidence to support the accusations that the episode was racially motivated.Mr. Dedmon’s uncle, Ray Dedmon, said in a telephone interview that he frequently went fishing with his nephew, and described him as “a good boy” who comes from a “happy and go-lucky” family.“He probably got with the wrong crowd,” he said.On a Facebook page set up by Mr. Rice’s supporters, friends argued his innocence, maintaining he was not driving the truck or even in it.“He is not a racist or a murderer,” Lisa Smith Seale Erwin, his great-aunt, posted on the page. “If anything, he is being tried by the media, suffering from reverse racism and placed in jail without bond. I am sick of the race card.”Mr. Rice has since been released on bail.That such a crime might have happened in a state whose history is laced with racially motivated crimes does not surprise Winston Thompson III, a lawyer who is working with Mr. Anderson’s family. Both Mr. Thompson and prosecutors are interviewing other teenagers and studying Facebook and other social media sites, trying to determine if the case is an isolated incident or part of a more deliberate effort to single out African-Americans for violence.“This is almost like a culture with these teens,” he said. “It’s evidently a little network. To see it manifest in the way it did it was shocking.”'"
"'11-08-09,'1','It’s hard not to feel a certain contempt for in the wake of its downgrade of American debt. Its sole job as a -rating agency is to gauge the creditworthiness of , yet like its competitors, and , it has consistently fallen short. It downgraded days before the company went bankrupt. Its willingness to slap a AAA rating on securitized subprime junk was the foundation upon which the entire financial crisis was built. And now, to show that it’s got some spine, S.& P. decided to downgrade the ? From a purely economic standpoint, the likelihood of a U.S. default is nil. As my friend Daniel Alpert, a founding managing partner of Westwood Capital, put it: “The size of the U.S. economy, the wealth of its inhabitants and the assets of the sovereign entity itself are unquestionably more than adequate to repay, with interest, all of the $14 trillion or so of the nation’s debt.” He added, “Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of finance and economics can figure that out.” On Monday, with the market collapsing, where did investors rush to put their money? In the one security they still considered safe: U.S. Treasuries.On the other hand, I also found myself nodding in agreement as I read S.& P.’s analysis. The downgrade, after all, was less about economics than politics. S.& P. was frightened by the same thing that has scared most Americans: the spectacle of an unyielding minority of Republicans ready to push the country into default rather than accept even modest increases to help bring down the deficit. “The effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policy-making and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges,” wrote S.& P. in its downgrade report. Who can disagree?Has any president in American history left behind as much lasting damage as ? In addition to two unfinished wars, he also set us on the path to our current financial mess. The , which turned a surplus into a growing deficit, have been disastrous. As pointed out in a prescient 2005 article in The Atlantic predicting a meltdown, they reduced tax revenue “to its lowest level as a share of the economy in the modern era.” (In its downgrade report, S.& P. suggested that it did not believe that Congress would let the cuts expire at the end of 2012, as they’re supposed to.) Then, in 2003, Bush pushed through prescription drug coverage for recipients. David M. Walker, then the comptroller general, described 2003 as “the most reckless fiscal year in the history of the Republic,” adding some $13 trillion in future entitlement costs.When did become such a lousy speech-maker? His remarks on Monday afternoon, aimed at calming the markets, were flat and uninspired — as they have consistently been throughout the crisis. “No matter what some agency may say,” he said, ”we’ve always been and always will be a triple-A country.” Is that really the best he could do? The markets, realizing he had little or nothing to offer, continued their swoon. What is particularly frustrating is that the president seems to have so little to say on the subject of job creation, which should be his most pressing concern. On Monday, Obama mentioned a payroll tax holiday and the extension of unemployment benefits. Both moves would help people in need; neither will do much to create new jobs. I know that there are limits to what any government can do to create jobs. But what one yearns for is a little imagination from this White House. Someone suggested to me recently that the government could create a $50 billion fund for small business, and use it to pay, say, 20 percent of the wages of new hires for two years — first come, first served. Why doesn’t Obama suggest something like that?In the end, a downgrade from a ratings agency shouldn’t keep anyone up at night; it’s a sideshow. What should cause some sleepless nights is the never-ending turmoil in . I keep thinking about the moment in 1931 when the failure of an Austrian bank led to a contagion of bank runs, first in Europe and then in the United States, and helped bring about the Depression. Could Europe’s current debt contagion jump the Atlantic again? The possibility strikes me as painfully plausible.I keep waiting for one wealthy, well-known figure to stand up and say publicly that he or she is willing to pay more in taxes as part of the shared sacrifice necessary to gain control of the country’s deficit. I know there are wealthy people who’ve had that thought — not just liberals like , but old-fashioned, rock-ribbed Republicans who are worried about the country’s debt problems. I even have a pretty good idea who some of them are. Come on, folks. Your country needs to hear from you.'"

"'11-08-09,'1','The Rev. Roy Bourgeois, who refused to renounce his increasingly public campaign to see women ordained as priests in the Roman Catholic Church, has been notified of his dismissal by his religious order, the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers.A letter to Father Bourgeois, signed by the superior general and the general secretary of the Maryknoll order in the United States, said the dismissal was necessary because of his “defiant stance” in opposition to church teaching.“Your numerous public statements and appearances in support of the women’s priests movement continues to create in the minds of many faithful the view that your position is acceptable to our Church,” the letter said, adding that Father Bourgeois had caused the church “grave scandal.”Father Bourgeois has gone further than any other priest in good standing to ally himself publicly with the growing women’s ordination movement. The group Roman Catholic Womenpriests claims to have ordained 120 women as priests and 10 as bishops in the last few years. The Vatican regards the ceremonies as illicit and invalid. Father Bourgeois participated in one such ceremony in 2008, and since then has given speeches around the country in support of female priests.“They want two words: I recant,” Father Bourgeois said. “And they can’t get that out of me. For me, the real scandal is the message we are sending to women: you’re not equal, you cannot be priests, you’re not worthy.”The case now moves to the Vatican for his formal removal from the priesthood, or laicization. Father Bourgeois said he had hired the Rev. Thomas Doyle, a canon lawyer known for testifying as an expert witness on behalf of victims suing the church in clergy sexual abuse cases, to represent him at the Vatican.The order’s move, while expected, nevertheless surprised Father Bourgeois and some of his supporters who had hoped that the Maryknolls, often in the forefront of liberal causes, would stand with their fellow priest. More than 200 priests signed a petition to the Maryknolls saying that they supported his right to follow his conscience.'"

"'11-08-09,'1','BENGHAZI, Libya — Rebel leaders dissolved their own cabinet on Monday, in an effort to placate the family of an assassinated rebel military leader and quiet discord in a movement already struggling to remove the country’s leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, from power.A rebel spokesman said that the prime minister, Mahmoud Jibril, the only member of the cabinet who kept his job, would have to present a new slate of cabinet members to the rebel legislative body, the Transitional National Council, for approval in the coming days. The cabinet was dissolved, the spokesman said, “for improper administrative procedures” that led to the arrest and subsequent killing of the military leader, Gen. Abdul Fattah Younes, a former top Libyan commander who defected to the rebel side.The move left the rebels without several of its leaders — including the ministers of defense, finance, interior and justice — as they try to fight a three-front war, run dozens of cities under their control and rein in armed militias that have multiplied since the February uprising.And it threatened to halt a flurry of negotiations between the rebels and foreign governments, just as the rebels have started to wrest millions of dollars in loans and other grants from their allies.Mazin Ramadan, a member of the finance committee, said that he believed the changes were supposed to take effect on Thursday and that he planned on continuing his work: “The interruption is not good. But this is not something we are going to worry about. This is not going to stop us.”'"
"'11-08-09,'1','Still, lower oil and gas prices do provide a modest economic lift. Some economists compare them to a tax cut since they put extra dollars in people’s pockets, offsetting a bit of the pain caused by a weak job market, soft home prices and evaporating investment portfolios. Falling fuel costs are especially good news for lower-income families, particularly in rural areas where people drive long distances.The average household consumes 1,200 gallons of gasoline a year, which translates into a $120 annual savings for every dime shaved off the price of gas, according to Fred Rozell, director of retail pricing at the Oil Price Information Service.“Everybody is helped when gasoline prices come down,” said Michael P. Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers.The rule of thumb of many economists is that every $10 drop in the price of a barrel of oil increases economic growth by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point, although in the event of a broad economic slowdown, that increase is likely to be offset by other factors, such as cutbacks in consumer spending and business investment, economists say.Lower energy prices bring down expenses for some businesses that are heavily dependent on oil, like airlines, freight delivery services and makers of plastics and fertilizers.Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consulting firm, estimated that the drop in oil prices over the last couple of weeks alone could translate into yearly savings of $13.5 billion for commercial truck fleets, $5 billion in savings for small trucks and local delivery fleets, $5 billion for domestic airlines and $1.4 billion for railroads.Over all, the decline in oil prices since the spring, if it persists, could save the United States economy as much as $270 million a day in transportation costs, or almost $100 billion a year, according to researchers at the Oil Price Information Service.Retailers like Wal-Mart and the dollar-store chains should particularly benefit, since they rely on customers whose ability to spend is tied to how much money is left after filling up their tanks.“You’ll find a very, very significant correlation between the two,” William S. Simon, who oversees Wal-Mart’s United States business, said recently. “One goes up, the other goes down. One goes down, the other goes up.”Auto executives say consumers will be more likely to buy larger vehicles when gas prices are lower, and prices on smaller cars could go down slightly.Few consumers seem to be celebrating yet. Shoppers interviewed at a grocery store in downtown Houston on Thursday night, after the Dow fell more than 500 points, said they were more worried about their jobs and stock prices than the cost of a gallon of gas.Ericka Schiche, a 40-year-old real estate agent, said: “If prices go down and stay down for a long time, it matters. But they’re saying there is going to be another recession, and the new recession may be longer than the last one.”But for those looking for a silver lining to the cloudy outlook, lower gas and oil prices offer the prospects of some, albeit limited, relief.“This will make it easier for the Federal Reserve to stay easier on rates and perhaps increase the size of its balance sheet — that is, to print more money” by buying assets, Mr. Sinai said. “Lower oil prices are an automatic response to the prospect of worse times, and in turn set up a counterforce against the possibility of recession.”'"
"'11-08-09,'1','AIDS is on the rise in many Muslim countries, driven by men having sex with other men in secret because of homophobia, religious intolerance and fear of being jailed or executed, according to a new study.The new report, released last week in the journal PLoS Medicine, was led by researchers from the Qatar branch of Weill Cornell Medical College who drew from dozens of smaller studies in Arabic, French and English.About 2 to 3 percent of men in the region have sex with other men, consistent with global averages, the study found. But condom use is low, gay and bisexual prostitution is common, and many married men hide their bisexuality and risk infecting their wives. In some countries, even male prostitutes often marry for appearances’ sake.Truck drivers, prisoners and street children often engage in risk behaviors for H.I.V. infection; in Pakistan, infection rates are rising rapidly among transgender prostitutes known as hijra.The lowest rates of condom use were reported in populous countries like Egypt and Pakistan, while they were highest in Sudan (above), Oman and Lebanon.To fight their nascent epidemics, some countries have adopted compulsory H.I.V. testing for marriage licenses and work visas.Accurate statistics on some aspects of health are hard to get from governments in some Middle Eastern countries. For example, international health authorities say that the world’s highest rates of birth defects are in Muslim countries where cousins sometimes marry, but that governments are reluctant to admit it.'"

"'11-08-09,'1','The new role for dogs as testimony enablers can, however, raise thorny legal questions. Defense lawyers argue that the dogs may unfairly sway jurors with their cuteness and the natural empathy they attract, whether a witness is telling the truth or not, and some prosecutors insist that the courtroom dogs can be a crucial comfort to those enduring the ordeal of testifying, especially children.The new witness-stand role for dogs in several states began in 2003, when the prosecution won permission for a dog named Jeeter with a beige button nose to help in a sexual assault case in . “Sometimes the dog means the difference between a conviction and an acquittal,” said Ellen O’Neill-Stephens, a prosecutor there who has become a campaigner for the dog-in-court cause.Service dogs have long been permitted in courts. But in a ruling in June that allowed Rosie to accompany the teenage victim to the trial here, a Court judge, Stephen L. Greller, said the teenager was traumatized and the defendant, Victor Tohom, appeared threatening. Although he said there was no precedent in the state, Judge Greller ruled that Rosie was similar to the teddy bear that a New York appeals court said in 1994 could accompany a child witness.At least once when the teenager hesitated in Judge Greller’s courtroom, the dog rose and seemed to push the girl gently with her nose. Mr. Tohom was convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life.His lawyers, David S. Martin and Steven W. Levine of the public defender’s office, have raised a series of objections that they say seems likely to land the case in New York’s highest court. They argue that as a therapy dog, Rosie responds to people under stress by comforting them, whether the stress comes from confronting a guilty defendant or lying under oath.But they say jurors are likely to conclude that the dog is helping victims expose the truth. “Every time she stroked the dog,” Mr. Martin said in an interview, “it sent an unconscious message to the jury that she was under stress because she was telling the truth.”“There was no way for me to cross-examine the dog,” Mr. Martin added.In written arguments, the defense lawyers claimed it was “prosecutorial misconduct” for the Dutchess County assistant district attorney handling the rape case, Kristine Hawlk, to arrange for Rosie to be taken into the courtroom. Cute as the dog was, the defense said, Rosie’s presence “infected the trial with such unfairness” that it constituted a violation of their client’s constitutional rights.Ms. Hawlk declined to discuss Rosie. In written arguments, she said that all Rosie did was help a victim suffering from serious emotional distress, and she called the defense claims “frivolous accusations.”The defense lawyers acknowledged the risk of appearing antidog. Rosie, they wrote, “is a lovely creature and by all standards a ‘good dog,’ ” and, they added, the defendant “wishes her only the best.”As the lawyers prepare their appeal, Rosie has been busy. She spent much of her time in recent weeks with two girls, ages 5 and 11, who were getting ready to testify against the man accused of murder in the stabbing of their mother.The Dutchess prosecutor in that case, Matthew A. Weishaupt, argued that Rosie and dogs like her did not affect the substance of the testimony about horrifying crimes. “These dogs ease the stress and ease the trauma so a child can take the stand,” Mr. Weishaupt said in an interview.In the end, Rosie was not needed in the second case: the defendant, Gabriel Lopez-Perez, who had a history of domestic violence, interrupted his trial last week to plead guilty to killing the girls’ mother, his girlfriend, in the rooming house where they lived.But Rosie’s promised appearance next to the children might well have played a role. “It became obvious,” said Mr. Lopez-Perez’s lawyer, Andres Aranda, “that the children were going to be testifying, and he decided to avoid that.”The defense’s appeal of Rosie’s first courtroom outing, in the rape case, is likely to establish legal principles on the issues of dogs in the witness box. “It is an important case, and appeals courts will consider it an important case,” James A. Cohen, a professor of criminal law at School of Law, said.When New York appeals courts study the question, they are likely to look at the experience of courtroom dogs around the country, including in . In Seattle, a developmentally disabled 57-year-old man, Douglas K. Lare, recently recalled how a Labrador retriever named Ellie, who has made more than 50 court appearances, helped him testify against a man charged with a scheme to steal from him.Ellie gave him courage when he was afraid, Mr. Lare said in an interview: “It was like I had no other friends in the courthouse except Ellie,” he said.For 11-year-old Rosie, said her owners, Dale and Lu Picard, the courtroom work is a career change after years working with emotionally troubled children at a residential center in Brewster. The Picards’ organization, Educated Canines Assisting With Disabilities, or ECAD, places service dogs after training them to perform tasks like turning lights on and off and opening doors.Rosie, named for the civil rights pioneer , was originally taught to follow 80 commands, including taking off a person’s socks without biting any toes. But she has a special talent with traumatized children, said Dr. Crenshaw, the psychologist who has worked with all three of Rosie’s witnesses and many other troubled children.“When they start talking about difficult things,” Dr. Crenshaw said, “Rosie picks up on that and goes over and nudges them. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”'"
"'11-08-09,'1','The stock sell-off picked up speed even though sought to calm markets, telling reporters that “our problems are eminently solvable and we know what we need to do to solve them.” But there is sharp disagreement how to solve them, as demonstrated by the fiercely partisan battle over raising the government’s borrowing limit, which was resolved only through a last-minute compromise.In the wake of the financial collapse more than two years ago, the government took various steps to invigorate the economy, pouring money into the financial system and adopting stimulus spending. Some economists say they think more stimulus spending is needed now to keep the economy from slowing further, but this seems unlikely given that many Republicans say the country can ill afford to add to the gaping budget deficit with more spending.It was not just the stock market that was rattled. A few obscure but important parts of the market also showed signs of some stress. For example, the market for , short-term that companies use to finance themselves, became less favorable. This was not nearly as bad as during the financial crisis but people will be keeping an eye on this to see if conditions deteriorate.“The cause of all this was the marking down of growth expectations,” said Barry Knapp, strategist at Capital. “It has morphed into one giant global growth recession concern.” The trading day opened ominously in the United States, after sharp drops of in Asia and in Europe. The sought to calm investors by intervening aggressively in bond markets with special measures to help support financially troubled and , to little avail.On the floor of the , Doreen Mogavero, a trader for Mogavero, Lee & Company, noted that other traders had canceled vacations in anticipation of a wild day. More staff members were on duty to make sure computers were working properly as volumes surged.The exchange processed a record 390 million orders in the first hour of trading, eclipsing the last record in May 2010. All told, 18 billion shares traded on the nation’s stock market, the most active day in a year.Many investors — burned by the relentless decline of stocks in the months after the 2008 financial collapse — seem inclined to sell rather than wait. “It is the psychological impact that I am concerned about in terms of confidence on the market,” said Ms. Mogavero.The force of the stock market sell-off that has accelerated over the last two weeks — the broader S.& P. 500-stock index has lost 16.8 percent since July 22 — is creating the growing sense that the economy may be nearing a double-dip recession as everyone from consumers to businesses retrench.The biggest declines were in bank stocks. fell 20 percent. fell 16 percent. dropped 14 percent. JPMorgan fell 9 percent. And fell 6 percent.Investors feared that could be hit by the economic slowdown and that, with government spending constrained, lenders would be less likely to receive official support in the future should they need it, as they did during the financial crisis.There was little positive news to calm investors. Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency that unleashed the latest uncertainty, took more action on Monday. It downgraded financing entities backed by the federal government, including and , the two housing giants at the center of the nation’s market, because of the support they receive from the federal government.The pall cast by the downgrades is now raising questions among some heavily indebted states about whether their own credit ratings could be in jeopardy. There are also signs investors are looking for the next country that could lose its AAA rating: the cost to insure French government debt widened significantly. ”There is speculation could likely be the next target,” said Otis Casey, a credit analyst at Markit.The German index, the Dax, which dropped 5 percent Monday, has lost 21 percent of its value since the recent peak on May 2. That reflects investor fears that the European Central Bank’s extraordinary bond buying could entangle even in the euro zone’s debt problems.In the United States, the selling came from both panicked individuals and institutions.Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Investments of , which serves private and institutional investors, said he was fielding calls from clients who “are anxious about is this a replay of 2008-2009 and do I have to go through that again?” he said. “But we say the fundamentals are very different. Corporate America has fortresslike balance sheets.”All 500 stocks in the S.& P. 500 index were lower by the end of the day. The index closed down 79.92 points, or 6.66 percent, at 1,119.46. The Dow Jones closed below 11,000 for the first time this year, falling 634.76 points, or 5.55 percent, to 10,809.85.As investors fled the stock market, and commodities like oil dropped on fears of a slowdown, they sought the safety of gold, which rose past $1,710 an ounce.A surprising beneficiary was United States Treasuries, where, despite the downgrade of government debt, 10-year yields fell to 2.32 percent, from 2.56 percent, and the yield on the two-year note was at a record low., perhaps the nation’s most famous private investor, also said he thought the downgrade was unwarranted.“If there were a quadruple A, I would give it to the U.S.,” he said in an interview. “We will always pay the bonds — the only way we won’t pay is if the printing press strips a gear.”'"

"'11-08-10,'0','The Gross family, which owns Granite Broadway Development, owns five Marriott hotels, one in Philadelphia; one in Ghent, Belgium; and three in New York: the Courtyard New York JFK Airport, the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Times Square South and the Residence Inn Manhattan/Times Square.When construction on the Residence Inn Manhattan/Times Square began in 2004, Harry Gross, the president of Granite Broadway Development, said he planned to start building another Marriott hotel at 54th Street and Broadway in 2005.Although Mr. Gross declined to be interviewed about the new project, documents from the New York City Department of Finance show the Gross family bought three lots on the northwest corner of 54th Street and Broadway in 2001, and later acquired development rights, using available space from two lots on the southwest corner of 55th Street and Broadway.Designed by Nobutaka Ashihara, the tower will have a main entrance and arrival lobby on West 54th Street; the lobby for the Residence Inn will be on the building’s third floor, and the Courtyard lobby will be on the fourth floor.  Courtyard guest rooms will be on floors 6 through 32, while Residence Inn rooms will be on floors 36 through 64; each hotel will have its own elevator banks.The project will include ground-floor retail space; a leased restaurant on the second floor; a lounge and terrace with outdoor seating and views of Broadway on the fifth floor; and a fitness center, for use by guests of both hotels, on the 34th floor.The lobby of the Courtyard, whose brand is geared to business travelers, will have a contemporary design, flexible space and what Marriott calls a GoBoard, a 55-inch interactive touch screen where guests can obtain local information and news headlines.  The Residence Inn, an extended-stay hotel, will offer guests suites with kitchens. Since the Residence Inn will sit above the Courtyard, Marriott officials said it would also offer the project’s best views of the city and Central Park.Hotel industry experts expect the project to do well, despite the recent surge in the number of hotels in the New York market.  According to Smith Travel Research, a lodging research company, there are 544 hotels, with about 100,500 rooms, in the New York metropolitan statistical area, including  33 that have opened in the last 12 months, with about 5,700 rooms.An additional 171 hotels, with a total of about 20,700 rooms, are in construction or in various stages of planning, not all of which will open.  These figures do not include the two new Marriott hotels.Mr. Fox said he expected that demand for rooms in New York would continue to be very strong, and he predicted room rates would regain their 2008 peak by 2013.Bjorn Hanson, the divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, said the two Marriott hotels could reduce their annual operating expenses by more than 5 percent by sharing one building, facilities like the fitness center, management and administrative staff, and departments like housekeeping and marketing.He also said the new project’s visibility because of its location and height would be a competitive advantage, “the equivalent of numerous billboards without the expense.”One hurdle the project could face, aside from the economy, is development delays.  As Mr. Marriott said, “There is always a construction challenge or two when you build in New York.”'"

"'11-08-10,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — For several hours on Tuesday, Apple surpassed Exxon Mobil, the energy company, as the stock market’s most valuable company.But by trading’s close, Exxon Mobil was back in the lead, although less than $2 billion ahead of Apple, the maker of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.At the end of regular trading, Apple shares closed at $374.01, up 5.89 percent, for a market valuation of $346.74 billion. Exxon Mobil closed at $71.64, up 2.07 percent, with a market capitalization of only $1.58 billion more, $348.32 billion. During the day’s seesaw trading, Apple’s market cap surpassed Exxon Mobil by as much as $7 billion.Analysts say they expect Apple and Exxon Mobil to continue jockeying for the top slot while the markets remain volatile. Apple peaked at $403.41 a share on July 26. But Exxon, which began sliding before the most recent market turmoil, hit a 52-week high of $87.98 on April 29.The change in market valuation has more to do with the falling price of oil than with the popularity of Apple’s electronics. “Clearly the oil market has declined substantially over the past 10 days due to the debt crisis and the cost of oil,” said Andrew Lipow, a former Amoco trader who is president of his own Houston consulting firm. “However, we’re sure to see Exxon bounce back and forth” Mr. Lipow said that if the price of oil bounced back, Exxon stock would firmly reclaim the top spot.Charles S. Golvin, an analyst specializing in mobile technology for Forrester Research, said: “For Apple to continue its success they will need to leap ahead of their own innovation and design approach before their competitors, including Google and Amazon, close the gap on smartphones and tablets.”'"
"'11-08-10,'0','Could Apple be worth $1 trillion? It’s conceivable. The $347 billion maker of iPhones and iPads became — if only briefly — the most valuable company in the United States when it overtook Exxon Mobil on Tuesday. Yet Apple’s sales have been surging 80 percent a year, and its profit faster. What’s more, it trades roughly in line with the growing stock market — and at less than half the price-to-earnings multiple it fetched in 2006, when revenue growth was much slower.Apple now trades at about 11 times estimated earnings for the fiscal year ending September 2012. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index is valued at about 10 times next year’s profit. But Apple’s sales growth is nearly 10 times faster than that of the average company. Apple also holds $76 billion of cash and investments.To get at this dissonance another way, consider Apple’s price-to-earnings growth ratio. This hints at the price of growth by dividing a company’s price-to-earnings ratio by its projected percentage earnings growth. A smaller figure suggests a company is cheaper. Apple’s is 0.2. That’s low compared with growth darlings. Chipotle Mexican Grill, the burrito purveyor, for instance, comes in at 2.1, and Salesforce.com at 13.2. Pandora Media and LinkedIn aren’t even expected to make money soon.Alternatively, put Apple on the same P/E multiple it traded on in 2006, and it would be worth almost $900 billion. A premium for today’s faster growth could get it to $1 trillion. Apple can’t be so cheap just because Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive, is in bad health.True, Apple already sells more each quarter than it did in all of fiscal 2007, and it takes more and more success to move the needle. Growth could easily slow. Yet the smartphone and tablet markets are young, the company’s customers show remarkable fidelity and areas like television are ripe for new gadgets. Moreover, Apple’s return on equity is almost twice what it was in 2006, suggesting it has pricing power.Maybe investors simply can’t fathom a company so large. A $1 trillion Apple would be the equivalent of adding all of Microsoft, Google, Intel, Amazon and more to Apple’s current market value. Perhaps Apple is correctly priced, the market too expensive and growth stocks grotesquely so. But something doesn’t add up. In relative terms, Apple should be worth far more.'"
"'11-08-10,'0','Cablevision Systems, the New York-area cable company, said on Tuesday that second-quarter net revenue rose 9 percent but missed expectations.The company’s net income was $87.8 million, or 31 cents a share, for the April-to-June period. That was up from $60.8 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company took a one-time charge.Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting higher earnings, at 42 cents a share.Excluding its cable networks, which Cablevision spun off at the end of the quarter, revenue rose 9 percent to $1.69 billion. It was helped chiefly by the acquisition of a smaller cable company in December.Cablevision shares fell $2.50, or nearly 13 percent, to $17.02 on a day when the broader market was up.Much of the stock decline derives from the spinoff of AMC shares a month ago, which gave Cablevision shareholders one AMC share for every four Cablevision shares.AMC Networks owns We TV, IFC and Sundance Channel in addition to AMC.Cablevision lost 23,000 video subscribers, continuing a declining trend in the face of competition from Verizon Communications’ FiOS service. The company said revenue was lower because of the weak economy in lower-income areas.Cablevision ended the quarter with 3.3 million video subscribers, making it the ninth-largest provider of pay-TV service in the country.'"
"'11-08-10,'0','If you’ve passed through the city in the past century or so, you might expect that pushcart to be serving what everyone (even a drooling aficionado) likes to call a “dirty-water dog,” a hot frank plucked with tongs from a metal vat full of warm, salty liquid.The delivery system is simple. The cooking method is rudimentary. And the result, with the way that soft bun sops up spare droplets of broth, is so essential to the New York gestalt that visiting world leaders must take a ceremonial bite for the cameras when strolling our sidewalks.Water-heated wieners can be found on countless blocks of the city, and plenty of people are still ordering and devouring them. The other day, Gerri Queren, an airline employee from Queens, was picking up one with sauerkraut and mustard near the southeastern corner of Central Park.“This is like a staple of New York,” she said. “It’s a little soggier, but it’s the way New York is.”But the way New York is has been changing. Parents who insist on wholesome, natural franks in Central Park are one of many challenges quietly, slowly chipping away at the street-corner dominance of the dirty-water dog.Upgraded versions have turned up at sit-down restaurants like Bark Hot Dogs in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and Crif Dogs in the East Village, in Manhattan, and in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where some of the franks are served Jersey style, deep-fried and swaddled in bacon. Customers might encounter kimchi, habanero sauce and other unconventional toppings, many with a multicultural bent. Sidewalks where a hot dog swaddled in a paper napkin was once the only available protein source are now crowded with vendors hawking biriyani, dumplings, tacos and lobster rolls.There’s even a movement afoot to bear down with fussier scrutiny on the carts, whose hygienic standards have often belonged, in the minds of hungry and hurrying New Yorkers, to the “don’t ask, don’t tell” category.“People want to know that their food is safe and clean and free of bacteria and vermin,” said Daniel R. Garodnick, a city councilman who represents parts of Manhattan, and who has proposed giving food carts the same health-department letter grades given to restaurants.The suggestion seems to be gaining momentum, having received Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s official endorsement last week.Mr. Garodnick is 39 and concedes that, like many New Yorkers of his vintage, he is no stranger to the pleasure of a salty impulse buy. “I’ve always enjoyed a dirty-water dog from time to time,” he said. “But I would like to know that it’s hopefully not that dirty.”None of this means that hot dogs are disappearing from city streets. Boyd Adelman, the president of Sabrett, the company that supplies most of the hot dogs to New York carts, said he was not especially anxious about the threat of haute dogs or other fancy newcomers. Although he would not give any numbers, Mr. Adelman said there had been “no real decline in our sales as a result of new dining options.”“New people are sampling the alternatives,” he added. “The regulars stand firm.”What seems to be on the wane, though, is the practice of heating hot dogs in liquid, and one key reason is the evolution of the carts themselves.“All the carts looked pretty much the same in New York for a long, long time,” said Wayne Sosin, the president of Worksman 800-BUY-CART, which manufactures many of the stainless-steel carts on the city’s streets. The carts might have had a hinged bin for the dirty water, a shelf for squeeze bottles of mustard and an anchor for the umbrella. That was about it.Gradually, vendors began to catch their own street-corner strain of expansion fever, and strangely enough, it had something to do with permits. With what is known as a nonprocessing permit, they could sell only premade treats like dirty-water dogs, ice cream or pretzels. But if they had a processing permit, they could cook food: kebabs, falafel, fried eggs, you name it. As more vendors came to understand, that variety magnified their potential income.“As a pure business decision, people want to upgrade what they have because they can gross more,” Mr. Sosin said. Larger, more elaborate carts are on the rise on the streets, he explained, while “just the simple, generic hot dog cart is less and less popular.”Of course, once a street vendor has a grill or a griddle and a license to use it, it is only a matter of time before hot dogs are rolled on it, giving them a nice coat of char.Skin-crisping methods are hardly unfamiliar to New Yorkers. Griddled versions, with that perfect between-teeth snap, can be found at landmarks like Katz’s and Papaya King. Traditionally, carts were supposed to stick to water.Lately, though, they have been upping their game. Memmed Chaaibi, who oversees the gastronomy at a cart parked on the corner of Third Avenue and 86th Street, on the Upper East Side, has the little metal vat where the water is supposed to go, but said he doesn’t use it anymore. Instead, Mr. Chaaibi prepares his dogs the same way he cooks his shish kebabs: on the griddle.Mr. Chaaibi described the two-dollar Catch-22 when it comes to dirty water: The health department mandates that hot dogs must be kept floating in 140-degree liquid, but when a hot dog stays submerged for too long, its flavor and texture can start to erode.“The hot dog should not pass 15 or 20 minutes in the water,” Mr. Chaaibi said. “If it goes past this, no more hot dog.”At the Fahima Halal cart near the corner of 45th Street and Avenue of the Americas, in Midtown Manhattan, Mohammed M. Rahman nearly winced when asked whether he cooked his hot dogs in water. “I do the grill,” he said with pride. “My hot dog and other people’s hot dogs are 100 percent different. My hot dog is halal. And when I cook my hot dogs, I use butter. They’re more tasty.”This is not to say that a griddled-hot-dog entrepreneur cannot make a few extra dollars pushing boiled dogs.“I have both; I have a grill, and I have the water,” said Saleh Gobran, a seller at the corner of Broadway and 43rd Street. “Customer wants it grilled, I grill it for him. The customer every time is right.” And if that customer prefers the water-heated variety, Mr. Gobran has a surprise in store, a technique that might be seen in a three-star French kitchen.“Look,” he said, popping open the water vat and lacing it with a few pro-bono dashes of Trappey’s Louisiana Hot Sauce. “To avoid the lost flavor, I put in some lemon slices and hot sauce. Makes it tasty.”Bruce Kraig, the author of “Hot Dog: A Global History,” surmised that wooden pushcarts might have switched to water instead of an open flame toward the end of the 19th century and in the early years of the 20th century, possibly to avoid going up in smoke.“They had fires all the time,” Mr. Kraig said. “They went to hot water because it’s safer, and then people came to like that.” Stainless-steel carts rarely burn down, of course, and now, over time, dirty-water dogs could “decline because of the rise of griddling,” Mr. Kraig said.If so, there are eaters, and cooks, who would miss them. “If they started disappearing, I would be annoyed, because I like a boiled-water dog,” said Eddie Huang, the New York chef behind Baohaus. “Certain things you just like cheap.”So does Brian Shebairo, even though he’s a competitor. “I love them, I do,” said Mr. Shebairo, an owner of Crif Dogs. “As much as they probably are filthy and disgusting, I ate one two weeks ago. I came out of a concert a few months ago and probably ate three.”Change is a metropolitan constant, but the prospect of a citywide low tide for dirty water seems, to some, like a threat to the very identity of New York. “I’m a Brooklyn kid,” said Curtis Sliwa, the activist and radio host. “I grew up on dirty-water hot dogs. Now people look at you like, ‘Oh, my God, what are you putting into your body?’ ”Mr. Sliwa doesn’t pull any rhetorical punches about what he sees as the rise of “trendoid, new-jack hot dogs.”“This really is the class warfare of New York,” he said. “Beer. Hot dogs. What’s next? It seems like every arena that used to be traditional, blue-collar, working class, now it’s like: ‘Oh no, we’ve got to have our own. God forbid we eat what common folks eat! And we have to pay a premium price to prove to you it’s the best.’ ”Any change in the demographic of dogs will probably lead to the most New York concept of all: tense coexistence.“I just consider those gourmet hot dogs a different experience,” said Alexandra Guarnaschelli, the chef at Butter and the Darby, who says that she, too, grew up on dirty-water dogs.“Just because a Porsche and a Honda are both cars doesn’t mean they offer the same things,” Ms. Guarnaschelli said. “If we gather all the hot dogs around a campfire, metaphorically speaking, and strum a little ‘Kumbaya’ on the guitar, we can achieve world peace among all hot dogs. I do think it’s possible.”'"

"'11-08-10,'0','The productivity of workers dropped from April through June for the second consecutive quarter, leading to an increase in labor costs that may restrain gains in profits.The measure of employee output per hour fell at a 0.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter after a revised 0.6 percent drop in the previous three months, figures from the Labor Department showed Tuesday. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was a 0.9 percent decrease. Expenses per employee rose 2.2 percent.With higher labor costs, “profitability will come under pressure,” said Eric Green, chief market economist at TD Securities in New York, who had forecast a decline in productivity. “This would create more caution in expanding payrolls, especially at a time when there is so much uncertainty.”Economists’ productivity forecasts in the Bloomberg survey ranged from a decrease of 2 percent to a 2.2 percent gain. Efficiency in the first quarter was previously reported as having increased 1.8 percent.The back-to-back drop in productivity was the first since the third and fourth quarters of 2008.Unit labor costs, which are adjusted for efficiency gains, were projected to rise 2.4 percent. Labor expenses in the first quarter were revised to 4.8 percent, the biggest gain since the fourth quarter of 2008, from a previously reported 0.7 percent advance.From the second quarter of 2010, productivity rose 0.8 percent compared with a 1.2 percent year-over-year increase in the first quarter. Labor costs rose 1.3 percent from the year-earlier period after a 1.1 percent increase in the 12 months ended in the first quarter.The productivity report incorporated revisions to previous years. Worker efficiency growth was revised to 4.1 percent in 2010 from a previously reported 3.9 percent. For 2009, it was revised to 2.3 percent from 3.7 percent.'"
"'11-08-10,'0','In response to questions from Pamela Miller, the city’s lawyer, Mr. Cassano said that of the 16,825 people who have applied so far to take the exam, 15.2 percent were black. That figure, he said, was almost twice the percentage of blacks who applied during the same time period for the last test, which was given in 2007.Mr. Cassano also said that with the application period, which runs to Sept. 15, about half over, 40 percent of all applicants were members of minority groups. Minority candidates accounted for 40 percent of the total applicants for the 2007 test, he said.“Never in the history of the Fire Department have our numbers been as good,” Mr. Cassano said.None of this seemed to impress Richard Levy, a lawyer for the Vulcan Society, who questioned Mr. Cassano on the undisputed fact that blacks have made up only about 3 percent of the department for more than four decades. Mr. Levy asked if that was a problem for the department.“All we can do as a department is recruit as many minorities as we can,” Mr. Cassano responded. “If you look at the results of our recruitment process so far, I don’t see how anyone can deny that the department has done its utmost to get candidates to apply for this exam.”Judge Garaufis ruled that the 1999 and 2002 tests were biased under a concept known as “disparate impact,” in which discrimination can be inferred from statistics: if minorities fare worse than whites, a circumstantial case can be made. He then extended his decision by ruling that the discrimination was intentional. He did not find that specific questions on the exam were discriminatory in their content or design.The hearing grew tense only as Mr. Levy ventured into the sensitive question of how the department’s homogeneity was said to be maintained by family ties — which is to say, by fathers bringing sons, or brothers bringing brothers, onto the job. He quoted a study by Columbia University commissioned by the Fire Department in 2004: “Historically, the F.D.N.Y. has been composed of white males with similar backgrounds, values and traditions.” He asked Mr. Cassano if having a friend or relative in the department would help a candidate succeed.“That might be the case,” the commissioner said, “but that’s one of the reasons I’ve been out heavily involved in our recruitment process — to let minority people know the value of becoming a firefighter.”He added that the department had recently switched its recruitment strategy from emphasizing the adventurous aspects of the job — “the bells and whistles, the engines racing down the street” — to focusing on its civil service benefits, which include lifetime medical care and an early and generous retirement plan.Part of the history of the issue is an effort nearly 40 years ago by a previous federal judge, Edward Weinfeld, to impose a hiring plan on the department in which one minority candidate was to be hired for every three white ones. The plan fell prey to the city’s fiscal crisis of the 1970s, officials said, and the judge’s injunction eventually expired.The notion of quotas, however, remains anathema to the department.Mr. Levy asked Mr. Cassano if it would be helpful to set a target percentage for recruitment — not a quota, he insisted, but a goal so that success could be measured.“I have a goal,” Mr. Cassano said. “My goal is to get the most qualified candidates as possible as firefighters and to diversify the department as much as I can.”'"
"'11-08-10,'0','Britain and Germany will win billions in needed revenue and, in return, will no longer pursue Swiss banks in criminal cases related to a lack of compliance with tax rules. And the Swiss banking model will shift further from reliance on managing undeclared money. That will particularly affect smaller banks.Banking secrecy was enshrined in law in Switzerland in the 1930s and has been used to protect anonymity as well as to evade taxes, which is not in itself a crime under Swiss law. But under increasing international pressure, Switzerland agreed in 2009 to apply new standards in bilateral tax treaties, allowing for an exchange of information in tax evasion as well as fraud cases. It has since incorporated those rules into some 30 bilateral double-taxation agreements.“The whole structure of Swiss banking secrecy has already changed,” said Pietro Sansonetti, a partner at the Geneva offices of the law firm Schellenberg Wittmer. “Secrecy can still protect privacy for personal reasons but no longer for simple tax avoidance.”The new treaties will be much more sophisticated and broader than existing accords with the European Union, in force since 2005, which charge a withholding tax on interest income on savings. That levy is then returned anonymously to the home country, but it is easy for depositors to mask their identities.After the deals are ratified by legislatures, German and British clients would pay a one-time retroactive sum on their capital, as well as an annual tax on capital gains and dividend payments rather than just on interest income.Germany and Britain will consider the withholding tax as final and their citizens will no longer have the legal obligation to declare their Swiss income to their home authorities.Mario Tuor, a Swiss government spokesman for finance, said negotiations with Germany were in their “final phase” and talks with Britain were moving “in a parallel track.” He declined to provide further details.A German official, who was not permitted to speak publicly, said an agreement was “very close.” The British Revenue and Customs department said “constructive discussions are continuing with the Swiss authorities, and we hope to conclude these as soon as possible.”The Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung reported last weekend that a deal with Germany could be announced Wednesday, and would include a one-time payment of 2 billion Swiss francs, or $2.7 billion, to cover the last 10 years, and a future withholding tax of 26 percent. Swiss banks would make the initial payment and then recoup it from their German clients.The figures could be higher in the deal with Britain, where similar income would be taxed at progressive and probably higher rates.If successful, the agreements might then be replicated by other European countries like France, Italy and even struggling Greece.Washington has followed a different path. American clients are obliged to inform United States tax collectors of their Swiss assets. And the authorities have been conducting investigations involving Americans with undeclared funds in Switzerland since a landmark case in 2009 against UBS. The Swiss bank was forced to identify some of its American clients and was fined $780 million for helping tax evasion. The Swiss government agreed that further client names could be provided if it were shown that other banks acted like UBS.This week, it emerged that at least six more unidentified banks in Switzerland and one in Liechtenstein were being investigated by prosecutors about whether they helped Americans evade taxes, The Financial Times reported.The treaties with Germany and Britain will bring further change to the smaller private banks that have traditionally served as niche fund managers to global elites. As the size of the undeclared funds that they manage ebbs, those banks will have to compete on the basis of fiscally transparent services.Many smaller Swiss banks have already started to change their models and shift away from undeclared money, Mr. Thévenoz said. Some have closed their offices in the United States.There will be “less income for some smaller Swiss banks and a push to merge,” he said. There may also be opportunities for auditors, consultants and firms dealing in new compliance and information technology systems.“There has been some capital outflow and there will be more, but I think Swiss banks can retain their clients and attract new ones,” he said. “To be able to move to Asia, for example, you would have to be ultra-high-net worth given the costs, the complications and the risks.”Louise Somerset, tax director at RBC International Wealth Planning in Britain, said the agreements might put the onus on Singapore and Hong Kong to enact similar deals to clamp down on tax evasion.Peter Thorne, an analyst in London for the Swiss brokerage firm Helvea, estimated in a report in April that for Credit Suisse, which had 808 billion francs under management at the end of last year, the initiative could affect 18 percent of the total. For UBS, it would be 20 percent of the 768 billion francs under management. For Julius Baer, a smaller bank, the estimate was 30 to 40 percent of assets.“Swiss banks have been preparing for this development for some time,” Mr. Thorne said. “Indeed, an extension of the withholding tax arrangements that these measures effectively represent is probably a better outcome than the feared automatic exchange of information which would in reality completely end any pretence of bank secrecy in Switzerland.”He said Credit Suisse and UBS had more “onshore” business in Europe “and would expect to use their presence to retain this money.”But smaller Swiss banks “may decide to merge to spread costs across a broader asset base and achieve some economies of scale,” he said.'"
"'11-08-10,'0','“There are now a lot of things that no longer depend on Portugal but instead on Spain and Italy and other countries around us,” he said. “In this crisis not even bigger countries than ours can say that they control fully their destiny.”Still, since his electoral victory in June, Mr. Passos Coelho, Portugal’s new prime minister, has struck a confident note, insisting that his government would reduce the budget deficit by more than a third this year, to 5.9 percent of gross domestic product from 9.1 percent in 2010.Such drastic tightening would be a significant improvement on the performance of the previous government. It would also contrast with the situation in Greece, which remains on the brink of default more than a year after becoming the first euro zone country to be rescued.The Finance Ministry in Athens reported last month that the budget deficit there had widened by almost a third in the first six months of this year — blowing its targets — as a deep recession exacerbated by budget cuts dampens government revenue.“What we learnt from Greece is that it’s all about implementation,” said Carlos Moedas, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker named by the Portuguese prime minister to oversee the budget agreement with its foreign creditors. “The kind of implementation monitoring that we are putting in place is completely new in Portugal and I believe even ahead of what was done in past I.M.F. programs.”As in the bailouts of Greece and Ireland, the lenders have set quarterly progress reviews. For Portugal, the outcome of the first review is expected as early as the end of this week.When the I.M.F. was last called to Portugal’s rescue in the early 1980s, the intervention was widely unpopular, largely because it led to a sharp rise in interest rates.This time, despite grumblings by Portugal’s powerful Communist party about foreign intervention and excessive austerity demands, “there is a real and widespread sense of relief that we are finally getting helped by qualified financial experts, because people here are completely fed up with mismanagement by our politicians,” said Pedro Reis, author of “Returning to Growth,” a recent book detailing Portugal’s economic woes.Nuno Vasconcellos, who heads Ongoing, a family investment company that has several media businesses, as well as a significant stake in Portugal Telecom, said the arrival of the I.M.F. “must be seen as the perfect excuse to make all the reforms that Portugal has refused to consider for the past 30 years.”Indeed, one of Mr Passos Coelho’s challenges is to lead by example and rein in spending in the country’s bloated public administration, as well as improve performance at state-controlled companies that have accumulated about €40 billion of debt.This week, for instance, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the debt of Comboios de Portugal, the railroad company, warning that “there is an increasing likelihood the company could default on its next five months’ maturities if timely extraordinary support is not provided by the Portuguese government.”His Socialist predecessor, José Sócrates, pushed three separate austerity packages through Parliament that failed to make much of a dent. At the fourth attempt, opposition lawmakers balked, prompting Mr. Sócrates to resign.After an early election on June 5, Mr. Passos Coelho formed the youngest and smallest government since Portugal’s return to democracy in the 1970s. Four out of 11 ministers have no party affiliation, including Vitor Gaspar, the finance minister.In contrast to Mr. Sócrates, who governed with a parliamentary minority, Mr. Passos Coelho can count on the support of a center-right coalition that is in command of Parliament. In fact, lawmakers agreed last month to limit their traditional summer recess to two weeks instead of five weeks to sign off on urgent legislation.But despite the political change in Lisbon, bond investors have kept Portugal’s borrowing costs close to record highs, although the bailout was designed to cover the country’s financing needs until 2013. Meanwhile, Portugal is next scheduled to sell as much as €1.25 billion in short-term bills on Aug. 17.Furthermore, the Portuguese stock market index has tumbled this month amid worldwide concerns over fiscal imbalances in much larger economies like the United States and Italy. That could jeopardize Portugal’s privatization calendar because falling share prices mean that sales will not raise as much as the government had hoped.First in line is the power company EDP, in which the government is hoping to sell a stake of about 20 percent to a foreign utility for about €2.5 billion.Anxiety over Portugal’s own fiscal performance has not subsided. On July 5, Moody’s Investors Service cut Portugal’s debt rating to junk status, and warned of a further cut because of the “formidable challenges” faced by the incoming government. Underlining such challenges, the statistics agency reported in late June that the deficit was 8.7 percent of G.D.P. at the end of the first quarter — leaving almost three percentage points to be cut before year-end.Mr. Passos Coelho has since announced a one-time tax on the traditional Christmas bonus paid to Portuguese employees, which could yield €800 million in additional proceeds. While taxpayers are seeing their salaries squeezed, banks have been ordered to raise their core capital to 9 percent by year-end, higher than the 7 percent threshold set under the most recent international banking rules.Carlos Costa, the governor of the Bank of Portugal, said that banks had a “very big” pool of assets that could be divested to strengthen their balance sheets. Such deleveraging would also prepare the banks for the eventual winding down of loans to commercial banks from the European Central Bank.“We must avoid the mistake of thinking that the provisioning of liquidity from the E.C.B. will stay forever,” he said.Bankers, however, are upset. Carlos Santos Ferreira, chief executive of Millennium BCP, one of the country’s biggest banks, warned that stricter capital requirements would lower profitability, pushing investors to search for higher returns on equity elsewhere.“Portuguese banks are no longer on a level playing field,” he said.The additional pressure on banks comes as Portugal is already bracing for a lengthy recession. Mr. Gaspar, the finance minister, forecast last month that the economy would contract 2.3 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2012.Mr. Mexia, the chief executive of EDP, said he was worried most that retrenchment by the banks would cause them to slow their lending to businesses.“The main problem is already one of liquidity,” he said. “Without liquidity, you just dry up in the sun.”'"
"'11-08-10,'0','HONG KONG — Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist and dissident, on Tuesday broke his silence on political topics for the first time since he was released from detention in China nearly two months ago, denouncing in Twitter postings the treatment of business colleagues who had been detained with him and expressing support for two other incarcerated dissidents.In a brief telephone conversation on Wednesday morning, Mr. Ai said he had felt personally compelled to speak out on his colleagues’ behalf even though he knew that it might cause further legal difficulties for him. He said his colleagues were in greater danger in prison than he had been because they were unknown to the general public and faced harsher treatment as a result.“If I don’t speak out for them, this is not possible, even though it may bring damage to my condition,” he said in English.Mr. Ai said that he had decided to speak out even though the terms of his release from detention prohibited him from making public statements either online or in interviews. “I have to obey the law,” he said. “Otherwise I have to face the consequences.”Mr. Ai, 54, formerly an outspoken critic of Chinese political and social restrictions, was arrested in April, held for three months by state security officials and later charged with tax evasion arising from his Shanghai art studio business. He was released after Chinese authorities said he had confessed and had been a model prisoner. His tax evasion case is pending.In his Twitter post, Mr. Ai said that four colleagues who were arrested were “illegally detained because of me.” Referring to the four — Liu Zhenggang, Hu Mingfen, Wen Tao and Zhang Jinsong — Mr. Ai wrote, “Innocently they suffered huge mental devastation and physical torture.”'"

"'11-08-11,'1','Dual agency has become more common as buyers shop for houses on the Internet on sites like Realtor.com. The typical situation: Potential buyers come across a house they are interested in, contact the listing agent — whose name and contact information are often displayed prominently on the Web page — and ask to be shown the property. The buyers are at that point using the same agent as the sellers.As Stephen R. Meyers, the president of Houlihan Lawrence, observed, dual agent arrangements have their advantages: “There’s one less intermediary involved, and they can offer a buyer a more direct pipeline to the seller during negotiations.”Under state law, though, a dual agent cannot be an advocate for the buyer or the seller. In other words, the dual agent cannot negotiate for either, or suggest an offering price. Nor can the agent provide information about the reason for selling, the price the sellers originally paid for the property, or how long and how many times the property has been on the market, among other things.Joan O’Meara, a broker for Houlihan Lawrence, was recently the listing agent for the builder of a five-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath colonial for sale in Rye at $2.995 million. Then she became a buyer’s agent for a Manhattan couple who had a budget of $2.975 million. She wound up representing both parties when the couple bought the builder’s house.“It’s always a little bit tricky,” Ms. O’Meara said, “because you want to make everybody happy and at the same time you don’t want either side to question your allegiance. This was a first for me, but it all worked out. The builder decided to offer less in the way of high-end finishes and fixtures, and in the end, the couple got their house.”Mark Seiden, a broker-owner in Briarcliff Manor, is among those opposed to dual agency under any circumstances. “I never allow it my office,” he said. “It’s not only about conflicts of interest, but also about the importance of specializing. No matter how brilliant a heart surgeon may be, would you want him to operate on your brain? The same goes for real estate agents. That’s why I have one department for sellers and listing agents and a separate one for buyers.”But even that degree of separation is not enough to prevent conflicts of interests, according to Gary Herbst, principal broker of Buyer’s Edge Realty in Tarrytown, which represents customers in Westchester and Putnam counties. Mr. Herbst, who refers to dual agents as “double agents,” says that sellers’ and buyers’ agencies should be separate business entities to eliminate any opportunity for collusion within a brokerage. His agency advocates only for buyers and does not list property.Mark Nadler, the owner-broker of Prudential Centennial Realty, said that in general, negotiations between buyers and sellers tend to be more aboveboard now than they were before the state first issued guidelines in the 1990s.Before then, said Mr. Nadler, whose company has offices in Larchmont and Scarsdale, “it was completely like the wild, wild West out there when it came to real estate. There was a lot of confusion about roles and allegiances, and the reputation of the industry suffered from those who did not conduct themselves properly. I could tell you horror stories.”Today, a broker acting in a dual agent capacity who fails to have a disclosure form filled out faces a monetary penalty, according to Edward I. Sumber, counsel to the Westchester Putnam Association of Realtors and the Rockland County Board of Realtors.If the buyer or seller denies that dual agency was authorized, the broker may be considered to have acted as an undisclosed dual agent, which could result in the loss or suspension of his or her license and/or larger fines, Mr. Sumber said. The return of a commission in this instance would be adjudicated in a civil action.'"

We generate substantially all of our revenue and players through the Facebook platform and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Any deterioration in our relationship with Facebook would harm our business and adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.We are subject to Facebooks standard terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of games and other applications on the Facebook platform. We have entered into an addendum to these terms and conditions pursuant to which we have agreed to use Facebook Credits, Facebooks proprietary payment method, as the primary means of payment within our games played through Facebook. This addendum expires in May 2015.Our business would be harmed if:We have benefited from Facebooks strong brand recognition and large user base. If Facebook loses its market position or otherwise falls out of favor with Internet users, we would need to identify alternative channels for marketing, promoting and distributing our games, which would consume substantial resources and may not be effective. In addition, Facebook has broad discretion to change its terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and those changes may be unfavorable to us. For example, in 2010 Facebook adopted a policy requiring applications on Facebook accept only its virtual currency, Facebook Credits, as payment from users. As a result of this change, which we completed in April 2011, Facebook receives a greater share of payments made by our players than it did when other payment options were allowed. Facebook may also change its fee structure, add fees associated with access to and use of the Facebook platform, change how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the Facebook platform or restrict how Facebook users can share information with friends on their platform. Beginning in early 2010, Facebook changed its policies for application developers regarding use of its communication channels. These changes limited the level of communication among users about applications on the Facebook platform. As a result, the number of our players on Facebook declined. Any such changes in the future could significantly alter how players experience our games or interact within our games, which may harm our business.We operate in a new and rapidly changing industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.Social games, from which we derive substantially all of our revenue, is a new and rapidly evolving industry. The growth of the social game industry and the level of demand and market acceptance of our games are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Our future operating results will depend on numerous factors affecting the social game industry, many of which are beyond our control, including:Our ability to plan for game development, distribution and promotional activities will be significantly affected by our ability to anticipate and adapt to relatively rapid changes in the tastes and preferences of our current and potential players. New and different types of entertainment may increase in popularity at the expense of social games. A decline in the popularity of social games in general, or our games in particular would harm our business and prospects.We have a new business model and a short operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future financial results and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.We began operations in April 2007, and we have a short operating history and a new business model, which makes it difficult to effectively assess our future prospects. Our business model is based on offering games that are free to play. To date, only a small percentage of our players pay for virtual goods. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the challenges we face, including the ones discussed in this section.We rely on a small percentage of our players for nearly all of our revenue.Historically, less than 5% of our players have been paying players. We lose paying players in the ordinary course of business. In order to sustain our revenue levels, we must attract new paying players or increase the amount our players pay. To retain paying players, we must devote significant resources so that the games they play retain their interest and attract them to our other games. If we fail to grow or sustain the number of our paying players, or if the rate at which we add paying players declines or if the average amount our paying players pay declines, our business may not grow, our financial results will suffer, and our stock price may decline.A small number of games have generated a majority of our revenue, and we must continue to launch and enhance games that attract and retain a significant number of paying players in order to grow our revenue and sustain our competitive position.Historically we have depended on a small number of games for a majority of our revenue and we expect that this dependency will continue for the foreseeable future. Our growth depends on our ability to consistently launch new games that achieve significant popularity. Each of our games requires significant engineering, marketing and other resources to develop, launch and sustain via regular upgrades and expansions, and such costs on average have increased. Our ability to successfully launch, sustain and expand games and attract and retain paying players largely depends on our ability to:It is difficult to consistently anticipate player demand on a large scale, particularly as we develop new games in new genres or new markets, including international markets and mobile platforms. If we do not successfully launch games that attract and retain a significant number of paying players and extend the life of our existing games, our market share, reputation and financial results will be harmed.If our top games do not continue to be popular, our results of operations could be harmed.In addition to creating new games that are attractive to a significant number of paying players, we must extend the life of our games, in particular our most successful games. For a game to remain popular, we must constantly enhance, expand or upgrade the game with new features that paying players find attractive. Such constant enhancement requires the investment of significant resources, particularly with older games and such costs on average have increased. We may not be able to successfully enhance, expand or upgrade our current games. Any reduction in the amounts players spend on our most popular games, any decrease in the popularity of our games or social games in general, any breach of game-related security or prolonged server interruption, any loss of rights to any intellectual property underlying such games, or any other adverse developments relating to our most popular games, could harm our results of operations.A significant majority of our game traffic is hosted by a single vendor and any failure or significant interruption in our network could impact our operations and harm our business.Our technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our games and to player satisfaction. Our games run on a complex distributed system, or what is commonly known as cloud computing. We own, operate and maintain elements of this system, but significant elements of this system are operated by third parties that we do not control and which would require significant time to replace. We expect this dependence on third parties to continue. In particular, a significant majority of our game traffic is hosted by Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Our agreement with AWS continues until terminated by either party. AWS may terminate the agreement without cause by providing 180 days prior written notice, and may terminate the agreement with 30 days prior written notice for cause, including any material default or breach of the agreement by us that we do not cure within the 30 day period. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, website disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors and capacity constraints. For example, the operation of a few of our significant games, including FarmVille and CityVille, was interrupted for several hours in April 2011 due to a network outage. If a particular game is unavailable when players attempt to access it or navigation through a game is slower than they expect, players may stop playing the game and may be less likely to return to the game as often, if at all. A failure or significant interruption in our game service would harm our reputation and operations. We expect to continue to make significant investments to our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve all aspects of player experience and game performance. To the extent that our disaster recovery systems are not adequate, or we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate increasing traffic, our business and operating results may suffer. We do not maintain insurance policies covering losses relating to our systems and we do not have business interruption insurance.Security breaches, computer viruses and computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operations.Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We have experienced and will continue to experience hacking attacks. Because of our prominence in the social game industry, we believe we are a particularly attractive target for hackers. Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players.If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed.We continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational, financial and technological infrastructure. As of March 31, 2011, approximately 64% of our employees had been with us for less than one year and approximately 92% for less than two years. As we continue to grow, we must expend significant resources to identify, hire, integrate, develop and motivate a large number of qualified employees. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and successfully integrate our new hires, our ability to continue launching new games and enhance existing games could suffer.To effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, we will need to continue spending significant resources to improve our technology infrastructure, our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures by, among other things:These enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these enhancements and improvements effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public reporting companies will be impaired. In addition, if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses, our operating results will suffer.Our growth prospects will suffer if we are unable to develop successful games for mobile platforms.We have limited experience developing games for mobile platforms. We expect to devote substantial resources to the development of our mobile games, and our limited experience makes it difficult to know whether we will succeed in developing such games that appeal to paying players or advertisers. The uncertainties we face include:These and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will succeed in developing commercially viable games for mobile. If we do not succeed in doing so, our growth prospects will suffer.Our core values of focusing on our players first and acting for the long term may conflict with the short-term interests of our business.One of our core values is to focus on surprising and delighting our players, which we believe is essential to our success and serves the best, long-term interests of Zynga and our stakeholders. Therefore, we have made, in the past and may make in the future, significant investments or changes in strategy that we think will benefit our players, even if our decision negatively impacts our operating results in the short term. For example, in late 2009 and in 2010 we reduced in-game advertising offers in order to improve player experience. This decrease in in-game offers led to a reduction of advertising revenue in 2010 as compared to 2009. Our decisions may not result in the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case the success of our games, business and operating results could be harmed.If we lose the services of our founder and Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.Our success depends in a large part upon the continued service of our senior management team. In particular, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Pincus, is critical to our vision, strategic direction, culture, products and technology. We do not maintain key-man insurance for Mr. Pincus or any other member of our senior management team. The loss of our founder and Chief Executive Officer, even temporarily, or any other member of senior management would harm our business.If we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees, we may not be able to grow effectively.Our ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Such employees, particularly game designers, product managers and engineers, are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating and retaining these employees. We have historically hired a number of key personnel through acquisitions, and as competition with several other game companies increases, we may incur significant expenses in continuing this practice. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled employees as necessary could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause additional disruptions to our business.We believe that two critical components of our success and our ability to retain our best people are our culture and our competitive compensation practices. As we continue to grow rapidly, and we develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition, many of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets after our initial public offering, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Moreover, we expect that this offering will create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among employees.An increasing number of individuals are utilizing devices other than personal computers to access the Internet, and versions of our games developed for these devices might not gain widespread adoption, or may not function as intended.The number of individuals who access the Internet through devices other than a personal computer, such as smartphones, tablets, televisions and set-top box devices, has increased dramatically, and we believe this trend is likely to continue. The generally lower processing speed, power, functionality and memory associated with these devices make playing our games through such devices more difficult; and the versions of our games developed for these devices may not be compelling to players. In addition, each device manufacturer or platform provider may establish unique or restrictive terms and conditions for developers on such devices or platforms, and our games may not work well or be viewable on these devices as a result. We have limited experience in developing and optimizing versions of our games for players on alternative devices and platforms. To expand our business, we will need to support a number of alternative devices and technologies. Once developed, we may choose to port or convert a game into separate versions for alternative devices with different technological requirements. As new devices and new mobile platforms or updates to platforms are continually being released, we may encounter problems in developing versions of our games for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such devices and platforms. If we are unable to successfully expand the platforms and devices on which our games are available, or if the versions of our games that we create for alternative platforms and devices are not compelling to our players, our business will suffer.Expansion into international markets is important for our growth, and as we expand internationally, we face additional business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks, any of which could increase our costs and hinder such growth.Continuing to expand our business to attract players in countries other than the United States is a critical element of our business strategy. An important part of targeting international markets is developing offerings that are localized and customized for the players in those markets. We have limited operating history as a company outside the United States. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to international expansion through acquisitions, the establishment of additional offices and development studios, and increasing our foreign language offerings. Our ability to expand our business and to attract talented employees and players in an increasing number of international markets requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. We have experienced difficulties in the past and have not been successful in all the countries we have entered. Expanding our international focus may subject us to risks that we have not faced before or increase risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:Entering new international markets will be expensive, our ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any particular market is uncertain, and the distraction of our senior management team could harm our business.Competition within the broader entertainment industry is intense and our existing and potential players may be attracted to competing forms of entertainment such as offline and traditional online games, television, movies and sports, as well as other entertainment options on the Internet.Our players face a vast array of entertainment choices. Other forms of entertainment, such as offline, traditional online, personal computer and console games, television, movies, sports and the Internet, are much larger and more well-established markets and may be perceived by our players to offer greater variety, affordability, interactivity and enjoyment. These other forms of entertainment compete for the discretionary time and income of our players. If we are unable to sustain sufficient interest in our games in comparison to other forms of entertainment, including new forms of entertainment, our business model may no longer be viable.There are low barriers to entry in the social game industry, and competition is intense.The social game industry is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry and we expect more companies to enter the sector and a wider range of social games to be introduced. Our competitors that develop social games for social networks vary in size and include publicly-traded companies such as Electronic Arts Inc./Playfish Inc. and The Walt Disney Company/Playdom Inc. and privately-held companies such as Crowdstar, Inc., Popcap Games, Inc., Vostu, Ltd. and wooga GmbH. In addition, online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets, such as Tencent Holdings Limited in Asia, and high-profile companies with significant online presences that to date have not developed social games, such as Amazon.com, Facebook, Google Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Yahoo! Inc., may decide to develop social games. Some of these current and potential competitors have significant resources for developing or acquiring additional games, may be able to incorporate their own strong brands and assets into their games, have a more diversified set of revenue sources than we do and may be less severely affected by changes in consumer preferences, regulations or other developments that may impact the online social game industry. In addition, we have limited experience in developing games for mobile and other platforms and our ability to succeed on those platforms is uncertain. As we continue to devote significant resources to developing games for those platforms, we will face significant competition from established companies that may have far greater experience than us, including Electronic Arts Inc., DeNA Co. Ltd., Gameloft SA, Glu Mobile Inc. and Rovio Mobile Ltd. We expect new mobile-game competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games and applications.The value of our virtual goods is highly dependent on how we manage the economies in our games. If we fail to manage our game economies properly, our business may suffer.Paying players purchase virtual goods in our games because of the perceived value of these goods which is dependent on the relative ease of securing an equivalent good via non-paid means within the game. The perceived value of these virtual goods can be impacted by an increase in the availability of free or discounted Facebook Credits or by various actions that we take in the games including offering discounts for virtual goods, giving away virtual goods in promotions or providing easier non-paid means to secure these goods. If we fail to manage our virtual economies properly, payers may be less likely to purchase virtual goods and our business may suffer.Some of our players may make sales and/or purchases of virtual goods used in our games through unauthorized third-party websites, which may impede our revenue growth.Some of our players may make sales and/or purchases of our virtual goods, such as Zynga Poker virtual poker chips, through unauthorized third-party sellers in exchange for real currency. These unauthorized transactions are usually arranged on third-party websites. We do not generate any revenue from these transactions. Accordingly, these unauthorized purchases and sales from third-party sellers could impede our revenue and profit growth by, among other things:To discourage unauthorized purchases and sales of our virtual goods, we have stated in our terms of service that the buying or selling of virtual currency and virtual goods from unauthorized third-party sellers may result in bans from our games and/or legal action. We have banned players as a result of such activities. We have also developed technological measures to help detect unauthorized transactions. If we decide to implement further restrictions on players ability to transfer virtual goods, we may lose players, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.The proliferation of cheating programs and scam offers that seek to exploit our games and players affects the game-playing experience and may lead players to stop playing our games.Unrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to develop, cheating programs that enable players to exploit our games, play them in an automated way or obtain unfair advantages over other players who do play fairly. These programs harm the experience of players who play fairly and may disrupt the virtual economy of our games. In addition, unrelated third parties attempt to scam our players with fake offers for virtual goods. We devote significant resources to discover and disable these programs and activities, and if we are unable to do so quickly our operations may be disrupted, our reputation damaged and players may stop playing our games. This may lead to lost revenue from paying players, increased cost of developing technological measures to combat these programs and activities, legal claims relating to the diminution in value of our virtual currency and goods, and increased customer service costs needed to respond to dissatisfied players.Our quarterly operating results are volatile and difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.Our revenue, traffic and operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and may fail to match our past performance because of a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Any of these events could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results include the risk factors listed in this section and the factors discussed in the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Factors Affecting Our Performance.In particular, we recognize revenue from sale of our virtual goods in accordance with GAAP, which is complex and based on our assumptions and historical data with respect to the sale and use of various types of virtual goods. In the event that such assumptions are revised based on new data or there are changes in the historical mix of virtual goods sold due to new game introductions, reduced virtual good sales in existing games or other factors, the amount of revenue that we recognize in any particular period may fluctuate significantly. For further information regarding our revenue recognition policy, see the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting PoliciesRevenue Recognition.Given our short operating history and the rapidly evolving social game industry, our historical operating results may not be useful in predicting our future operating results. In addition, metrics we have developed or those available from third parties regarding our industry and the performance of our games, including DAUs, MAUs, and MUUs, may not be indicative of our financial performance.Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could harm our business and operating results.We regard the protection of our trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names and other product rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others.We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our innovations through increased patent filings that are expensive and time-consuming and may not result in issued patents that can be effectively enforced.Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity or diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property rights, our business and operating results may be harmed.We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.From time to time, we have faced, and we expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors, non-practicing entities and former employers of our personnel. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. As the result of any court judgment or settlement we may be obligated to cancel the launch of a new game, stop offering certain features, pay royalties or significant settlement costs, purchase licenses or modify our games and features while we develop substitutes.In addition, we use open source software in our games and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims from companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our games, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results.Although we do not believe that the final outcome of litigation and claims that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business, our expectations may not prove to be correct. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, operating results, financial condition, reputation or the market price of our Class A common stock.Programming errors or flaws in our games could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance of our games, which would harm our operating results.Our games may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data, and these defects may only become apparent after their launch, particularly as we launch new games and rapidly release new features to existing games under tight time constraints. We believe that if our players have a negative experience with our games, they may be less inclined to continue or resume playing our games or recommend our games to other potential players. Undetected programming errors, game defects and data corruption can disrupt our operations, adversely affect the game experience of our players by allowing players to gain unfair advantage, harm our reputation, cause our players to stop playing our games, divert our resources and delay market acceptance of our games, any of which could result in legal liability to us or harm our operating results.Evolving regulations concerning data privacy may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could prevent us from providing our current games to our players, or require us to modify our games, thereby harming our business.The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the Internet and mobile platforms have recently come under increased public scrutiny, and civil claims alleging liability for the breach of data privacy have been asserted against us. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. In addition, the European Union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies with users in Europe. Various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices.We began operations in 2007 and have grown rapidly. While our administrative systems have developed rapidly, during our earlier history our practices relating to intellectual property, data privacy and security, and legal compliance may not have been as robust as they are now, and there may be unasserted claims arising from this period that we are not able to anticipate. In addition, our business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally, could be adversely affected if laws or regulations are adopted, interpreted, or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of our website, games, features or our privacy policy. In particular, the success of our business has been, and we expect will continue to be, driven by our ability to responsibly use the data that our players share with us. Therefore, our business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the use or disclosure of data our players choose to share with us, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such use and disclosure is obtained. Such changes may require us to modify our games and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new games and features that make use of the data that our players voluntarily share with us.We process, store and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.We receive, store and process personal information and other player data, and we enable our players to share their personal information with each other and with third parties, including on the Internet and mobile platforms. There are numerous federal, state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other player data on the Internet and mobile platforms, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. We generally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our own privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties (including voluntary third-party certification bodies such as TRUSTe). We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and certain industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent reasonably attainable. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to players or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other player data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our players to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as players, vendors or developers, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our players information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to players when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to Californias Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.Our business is subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding consumer protection, intellectual property, export and national security, that are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers ofonline services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves and our games are played in a greater number of countries, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. We are potentially subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering of certain types of content, such as that which depicts violence, many of which are ambiguous, still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business or expose us to liability. In addition, certain of our games, including Zynga Poker, may become subject to gambling-related rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties if we do not comply. It is difficult to predict how existing laws will be applied to our business and the new laws to which we may become subject. See the discussion included in the section titled Business  Government Regulation.If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our games, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business and operating results.It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the online and mobile industries, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution and antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and banking institutions may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. If that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of social game services and impair our business.Companies and governmental agencies may restrict access to Facebook, our website or the Internet generally, which could lead to the loss or slower growth of our player base.Our players need to access the Internet and in particular Facebook and our website to play our games. Companies and governmental agencies, could block access to Facebook, our website or the Internet generally for a number of reasons such as security or confidentiality concerns or regulatory reasons, or they may adopt policies that prohibit employees from accessing Facebook, our website or other social platforms. For example, the government of the Peoples Republic of China has blocked access to Facebook in China. If companies or governmental entities block or limit access to Facebook or our website or otherwise adopt policies restricting players from playing our games our business could be negatively impacted and could lead to the loss or slower growth of our player base.Our business will suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired companies into our business or otherwise manage the growth associated with multiple acquisitions.We have acquired businesses, personnel and technologies in the past and we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that are complementary to our existing business and expand our employee base and the breadth ofour offerings. Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend on the availability of suitable acquisition and investment candidates at an acceptable cost, our ability to compete effectively to attract these candidates and the availability of financing to complete larger acquisitions. Since we expect the social game industry to consolidate in the future, we may face significant competition in executing our growth strategy. Future acquisitions or investments could result in potential dilutive issuances of equity securities, use of significant cash balances or incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The benefits of an acquisition or investment may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition or investment will produce the intended benefits.Integration of a new companys operations, assets and personnel into ours will require significant attention from our management. The diversion of our managements attention away from our business and any difficulties encountered in the integration process could harm our ability to manage our business. Future acquisitions will also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with any acquired liabilities, the integration of new operations, technologies and personnel, unforeseen or hidden liabilities and unanticipated, information security vulnerabilities, the diversion of resources from our existing businesses, sites and technologies, the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions, and potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees, players, and other suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses.Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will affect our financial results, which we report in U.S. dollars.As we continue to expand our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency, and an increasing percentage of our international revenue is from players who pay us in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of such expenses being higher and/or the dollar equivalent of such foreign-denominated revenue being lower than would be the case if exchange rates were stable. This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies, and any such strategies, such as forward contracts, options and foreign exchange swaps related to transaction exposures that we may implement to mitigate this risk may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.The enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.The current administration has made public statements indicating that it has made international tax reform a priority, and key members of the U.S. Congress have conducted hearings and proposed new legislation. Recent changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.A change in the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions could result in an increase to our worldwide effective tax rate and a change in how we operate our business.Our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property and the transfer pricing of our intercompany transactions, are intended to provide us worldwide tax efficiencies. The application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States,to our international business activities is subject to interpretation and depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with the manner in which we report our income to the jurisdictions, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.Our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment, which could require us to curtail or cease operations.Our principal offices and a network operations center are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, an area known for earthquakes, and are thus vulnerable to damage. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power loss, fire, explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be impaired.We may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.We intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new games and features or enhance our existing games, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.Risks Related to This Offering and Ownership of Our Class A Common StockThe three class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to this offering, including our founder and Chief Executive Officer and our other executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates; this will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.Our Class C common stock has              votes per share, our Class B common stock has              votes per share and our Class A common stock, which is the stock we are offering in this offering, has one vote per share. The holders of Class B common stock and Class C common stock, including our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Pincus, and our other executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, will collectively hold approximately     % of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock following this offering. As a result, these holders, along with Mr. Pincus, will have significant influence over the management and affairs of the company and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated voting control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock or Class C common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those stockholders who retain their existingshares of Class B or Class C common stock. In addition, as shares of Class B common stock are sold and converted to Class A common stock, the sole holder of Class C common stock, Mr. Pincus, will have greater relative voting control to the extent he retains his existing shares of Class C common stock. Mr. Pincus is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests and may do so.Certain provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors or current management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our board of directors or management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws will include provisions that:These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder.Our share price may be volatile, and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the initial public offering price, if at all.The initial public offering price for the shares of our Class A common stock will be determined by negotiations between us and representatives of the underwriters and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market. The market price of our Class A common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. If the market price of our Class A common stock after this offering does not exceed the initial public offering price, you may not realize any return on your investment and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have beensubject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.Our Class A common stock price may be volatile due to third-party data regarding our games.Third parties, such as AppData, publish daily data about us and other social game companies with respect to DAUs and MAUs and other information concerning social game usage, in particular on Facebook. These metrics can be volatile, particularly for specific games, and in many cases do not accurately reflect the actual levels of usage of our games across all platforms and may not correlate to our bookings or revenue from the sale of virtual goods. There is a possibility that third parties could change their methodologies for calculating these metrics in the future. To the extent that securities analysts or investors base their views of our business or prospects on such third-party data, the price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may not reflect the performance of our business.We may invest or spend the proceeds of this offering in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a return.The net proceeds from the sale of shares by us in the offering may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. Our management will have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. The net proceeds to us from this offering may be invested with a view towards long-term benefits for our stockholders, and this may not increase our operating results or the market value of our Class A common stock. Until the net proceeds are used, they may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value.If securities or industry analysts do not publish research about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our Class A common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market could cause our share price to decline.Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market after this offering, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Based on the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock as of March 31, 2011, upon the closing of this offering, we will have              shares of Class A common stock,              shares of Class B common stock and              shares of Class C common stock outstanding, assuming no exercise of our outstanding options and warrants or vesting of ZSUs, and the sale of              shares of our Class A common stock to be sold by the selling stockholders.All of the shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, except for any shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The              shares of Class B common stock and              shares of Class C common stock outstanding after this offering, based on shares outstanding as of March 31, 2011, will be restricted as a result of securities laws, lock-up agreements or other contractual restrictions that restrict transfers for              days after the date of this prospectus, subject to certain extensions.After this offering, the holders of              shares of Class B common stock, or     % of our total outstanding common stock, and              shares of Class C common stock, or     % of our total outstanding common stock, based on shares outstanding as of March 31, 2011 and giving effect to the sale of shares by the selling stockholders, will be entitled to rights with respect to registration of these shares under the Securities Act pursuant to an investors rights agreement. Shares of our Class B and Class C common stock automatically will convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon any sale or transfer, whether or not for value, except for certain transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to become effective upon closing of this offering. If these holders of our Class B and Class C common stock, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our Class A common stock. If we file a registration statement for the purposes of selling additional shares to raise capital and are required to include shares held by these holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights, our ability to raise capital may be impaired. We intend to file a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register up to approximately              million shares of our common stock for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to a lock-up period and other restrictions provided under the terms of the applicable plan and/or the agreements entered into with the holders of these shares.No public market for our Class A common stock currently exists, and an active public trading market may not develop or be sustained following this offering.Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common stock, and there has been no public market or active private market for our other classes of capital stock. Although we have applied to list our Class A common stock on the             , an active trading market may not develop following the completion of this offering or, if developed, may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the market price of your shares of Class A common stock. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.We recently identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that resulted in a restatement of our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2011 and for the three months then ended. If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.Subsequent to the initial filing of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we determined that our accounting policy related to changes in estimated average playing periods for paying players was inconsistent with Accounting Standards Codification No. 250, or ASC 250, Accounting Changes. Pursuant to our previous policy, we had applied our then most current estimate of the average playing period for paying players to current period sales but did not adjust the ending balance of deferred revenue for the revised estimates for related sales from prior periods. We determined such adjustment of the ending balance of deferred revenue was necessary in accordance with ASC 250. As a result, we restated our March 31, 2011 financial statements and determined we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011. The impact of this restatement was to increase revenue by $7.5 million and increase the provision for income taxes by $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and to decrease deferred revenue by $7.5 million as of March 31, 2011. A material weakness is defined under the standards issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. The effects of the misapplication of ASC 250 were immaterial in all periods prior to the first quarter of 2011. We believe that this material weakness was remediated when we revised our accounting policy to properly reflect the provisions of ASC 250 as it relates to our accounting for changes in our estimated average playing period for paying players.If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls for financial reporting in the future, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls as will be required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports may be impacted or the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted.The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert managements attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.As a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the              and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results.We also expect that being a public company will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.As a result of disclosure of information in this prospectus and in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results.We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and as a result your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock.We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.Im proud and excited to be writing this letter to you today.Zynga is a company with more than 2,000 amazingly talented employees dedicated to engaging, surprising and delighting an audience that has grown to 148 million monthly unique users in 166 countries. And because our users typically play more than one of our games each month, they account for 232 million MAUs (monthly active users). Our players create and store more than 38,000 virtual items every second and spend 2 billion minutes a day with our service. In just over 4 years, weve generated over $980 million in revenue and over $1.5 billion in bookings.We founded Zynga in 2007 with the mission of connecting the world through games. We believed playlike search, share and shopwould become one of the core activities on the internet.Play is one of lifes big macrosits an activity people love to do and do often. Zynga was founded on a deeply held passion for games that family and friends play togetherconnecting, collaborating, gifting, bragging, nurturing, admiring and sometimes just doing silly stuff together. Reality is, we all wish we had more time to play together.To put the play macro in perspective, games have become the second most popular internet activity based on time spent, and have even surpassed email. Weve turned our rapidly growing base of smartphones and tablets into play devices. In fact, games are now the most popular category of apps on smartphones and represent nearly half of the time spent. But, Zynga has a lot of hard work, innovation and growth ahead of us to create a future where social gaming becomes a daily habit for nearly everyone.Our strategy from the beginning has been to build the biggest macro bet on social gaming to provide our players with the most accessible, social and fun games. Despite our rapid growth, we have been careful to build for the long term. Ive always thought of this journey as being a series of sprints that make up a marathon.We raised hundreds of millions of dollars to maximize our ability to make large investments in teams, games and infrastructure. For example, our Chief Technology Officer joined us in the fall of 2008 with a mission of building the greatest data warehouse in the game industry, which now processes 15 terabytes of game data every day. We will continue to make these big investments and big bets in pursuit of our mission.Our operating philosophies have been fundamental to our growth. They include:As we look to the future, we believe our core values will be key to our continued growth. Our goal is for everyone at Zynga to be a CEO with accountability and authority to drive important outcomes. It takes inspiredpeople to make inspiring products. Weve endeavored to create an environment that fosters intelligent risk-taking in order to invent bold beatsinnovations that really advance the social gaming experience for our players. Our company is diverse, creative and entrepreneurial. I often describe Zynga as a confederation of entrepreneurs.More specifically, our core values that make up these philosophies are:And now, by offering our shares to the public we hope to enable Zynga to invest more in play than any company in history. To accomplish this, we will continue to make big investments in servers, data centers and other infrastructure so players farms, cities, islands, airplanes, triple words and empires can be available on all their devices in an instant. We will also continue to fund the best teams around the world to build the most accessible, social and fun games.We believe we will maximize long-term shareholder value by delivering long-term player value. This means we will make decisions and trade-offs that are different from other companies. We will prioritize innovation and long-term growth over quarterly earnings. We will not make short-term decisions that sacrifice our core values or veer from our long-term vision.As we have done with our current investors, we will strive to communicate with transparency to help you understand how we are doing against our mission. You will be able to track our performance every day in publicly available third-party traffic reports. And of course, youll be able to play our games yourself to be able to track our progress against being the most fun and most social.With this offering we are inviting you to join our mission. Invest with us because you believe in the potential for the world to play together. Evaluate us by how many of your friends and family play our games. Before you invest, we hope you will play our games. And, if youre part of the hundreds of millions who have already played our games, thank you. Youre part of the future.At Zynga, we feel a personal connection to our games through our friends and family. I love that my brother in-law, who has five kids and no free time, religiously plays our game Words with Friends.While Im humbled by the size of the audience we enable to play today, were just getting started. Were thinking every day how much more accessible, social and fun our games can get.My kids decided a few months ago that peek-a-boo was their favorite game. While its unlikely we can improve upon this classic, I look forward to playing Zynga games with them very soon. When they enter high school theres no doubt that theyll search on Google, theyll share with their friends on Facebook and theyll probably do a lot of shopping on Amazon. And Im planning for Zynga to be there when they want to play.This prospectus, including the letter from our founder and the sections titled Prospectus Summary, Risk Factors, Market Data and User Metrics, Use of Proceeds, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Business and Shares Eligible for Future Sale, contains forward-looking statements. In some cases you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, could, would, project, plan, expect or the negative or plural of these words or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following:These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in Risk Factors. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this prospectus may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, except as required by law, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this prospectus to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.You should read this prospectus and the documents that we reference in this prospectus and have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this prospectus concerning our industry and the sector in which we operate, including our general expectations and position, opportunity and size estimates, is based on information from various sources, on assumptions that we have made that are based on those and other similar sources and on our knowledge of the audience for our games. This information involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and we caution you not to give undue weight to such estimates. We have not independently verified any third-party information and while we believe the position, opportunity and sector size information included in this prospectus is generally reliable, such information is inherently imprecise. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industry in which we operate is necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this prospectus. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.We believe that our games compete for the attention of players with the other forms of entertainment that comprise the global entertainment industry. Collectively, we refer to these markets as the Worldwide Entertainment Market. According to IDC, the worldwide markets for Internet advertising, television advertising, video game software and radio advertising in 2011 are forecasted to be $79 billion, $191 billion, $52 billion and $31 billion, respectively. According to IBISWorld, Inc., a media research and consulting company, the worldwide markets for movies, books, newspapers (including newspaper advertising), magazines (including magazine advertising) and recorded music in 2011 are forecasted to be $125 billion, $97 billion, $169 billion, $119 billion and $30 billion, respectively. According to Screen Digest, Ltd., a market research firm, the worldwide market for television subscriptions in 2011 is forecasted to be $184 billion. Aggregating these sources, we believe that the Worldwide Entertainment Market in 2011 is forecasted to be more than $1.0 trillion.In this prospectus, when we refer to DAUs, MAUs or MUUs, unless otherwise indicated, we are referring to internally-measured user information. For information concerning these metrics as measured by us, see the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsKey MetricsKey Operating Metrics. We also refer in this prospectus to DAUs and MAUs as measured and published by AppData, an independent service that publicly reports traffic data for games and other applications on Facebook. We rely on AppData information whenever we refer to the ranking of our games on Facebook or compare our games to the games of other developers on Facebook. Each of these references is identified by the phrase according to AppData or a similar phrase. References in this prospectus to AppData mean Inside Networks AppData service, together with other services run by Inside Network. Our DAU and MAU information is based on our own internal analytics systems and may differ from the corresponding information published by AppData. Reasons for the differences include:AppData has changed its methodologies for calculating DAUs and MAUs in the past and may change its methodologies in the future.We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock offered by us will be approximately $         million, based upon an assumed initial public offering price of $         per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters over-allotment option to purchase additional shares in this offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $         million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock by the selling stockholders.Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $         per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $         million, assuming the number of shares offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of                  shares in the number of shares of Class A common stock offered by us would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $         million, assuming that the assumed initial public offering price remains the same, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions.The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a public market for our Class A common stock. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us of this offering. However, we currently intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, game development, marketing activities and capital expenditures. We also intend to use approximately $         million of the net proceeds to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of ZSUs held by current or former employees and other service providers, which will occur in connection with this offering. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, technologies or other assets that complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any material acquisitions or investments. We intend to contribute a portion of the net proceeds to charitable causes through Zynga.org, our philanthropic initiative. We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds in this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.We have never declared or paid, and do not anticipate declaring or paying, any cash dividends on our capital stock. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.The following table sets forth our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and our capitalization as of March 31, 2011:You should read the information in this table together with our financial statements and accompanying notes and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.The outstanding share information in the table above is based on 562,466,698 shares of our Class B common stock (including preferred stock on an as converted basis) and 20,517,472 shares of our Class C common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2011, and excludes:If you invest in our Class A common stock, your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per share of our Class A common stock and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering. The historical net tangible book value of our common stock as of March 31, 2011 was $628.8 million, or $2.25 per share. Historical net tangible book value per share represents our total tangible assets less our total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of outstanding common stock.After giving effect to (i) the automatic conversion of our outstanding preferred stock into our Class B common stock immediately prior to the closing of this offering, (ii) the issuance of              shares of Class B common stock upon the vesting of outstanding ZSUs in connection with this offering and (iii) the receipt of the net proceeds from our sale of              shares of Class A common stock at an assumed initial public offering price of $         per share, the mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of March 31, 2011 would have been approximately $        , or $         per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value of $         per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $         per share to investors purchasing Class A common stock in this offering.The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis to new investors:Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $         per share would increase (decrease) the pro forma net tangible book value, as adjusted to give effect to this offering, by $         per share and the dilution to new investors by $         per share, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of                  shares in the number of Class A common stock offered by us would increase (decrease) the pro forma net tangible book value, as adjusted to give effect to this offering, by approximately $         per share and the dilution to new investors by $         per share, assuming the assumed initial public offering price remains the same and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A, Class B and Class C common stock, as adjusted to give effect to this offering, would be $         per share, and the dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share to investors in this offering would be $         per share of Class A common stock.The table below summarizes as of March 31, 2011, on a pro forma as adjusted basis described above, the number of shares of our common stock, the total consideration and the average price per share (i) paid to us by our existing stockholders and (ii) to be paid by new investors purchasing our Class A common stock in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $     per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.The total number of shares of our Class A, Class B and Class C common stock reflected in the discussion and tables above is based on no shares of our Class A common stock, 562,466,698 shares of our Class B common stock (including preferred stock on an as converted basis) and 20,517,472 shares of our Class C common stock outstanding, as of March 31, 2011, and excludes:Sales by the selling stockholders in this offering will cause the number of shares held by existing stockholders to be reduced to              shares, or     % of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding after this offering, and will increase the number of shares held by new investors to              shares, or     % of the total number of shares outstanding after this offering.To the extent that any outstanding options are exercised, new options are issued under our stock-based compensation plans or we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, there will be further dilution to investors participating in this offering. If all outstanding options under our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan as of March 31, 2011 were exercised, then our existing stockholders, including the holders of these options, would own     % and our new investors would own     % of the total number of shares of our Class A, Class B and Class C common stock outstanding upon the closing of this offering. In such event, the total consideration paid by our existing stockholders, including the holders of these options, would be approximately $         million, or     %, the total consideration paid by our new investors would be $         million, or     %, the average price per share paid by our existing stockholders would be $         and the average price per share paid by our new investors would be $        .The following selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this prospectus. The consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 as well as the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2009 and 2010 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this prospectus. The consolidated statements of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, and the consolidated balance sheet data as of March 31, 2011 have been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. We have included, in our opinion, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information set forth in those statements. The consolidated statement of operations data for the period from inception (April 19, 2007) to December 31, 2007, as well as the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2007 and 2008, are derived from audited consolidated financial statements that are not included in this prospectus. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future, and our interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.We have restated our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2011 and for the three months then ended to reflect a correction in our accounting policy to properly apply changes in our estimated average playing period for paying players. The impact of this restatement was to increase revenue by $7.5 million and increase the provision for income taxes by $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and decrease deferred revenue by $7.5 million as of March 31, 2011.NA means data is not available.Stock-based compensation included in the statements of operations data above was as follows:To provide investors with additional information about our financial results, we disclose within this prospectus bookings, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided below a reconciliation between bookings and revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.Bookings is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as the total amount of revenue from the sale of virtual goods in our online games and advertising that would have been recognized in a period if we recognized all revenue immediately at the time of the sale. We record the sale of virtual goods as deferred revenue and then recognize revenue over the estimated average life of the purchased virtual goods or as the virtual goods are consumed. Advertising revenue consisting of certain branded virtual goods and sponsorships is also deferred and recognized over the estimated average life of the purchased good, similar to online game revenue. Bookings is calculated as revenue recognized in a period plus the change in deferred revenue during the period. For additional discussion of the estimated average life of virtual goods, see the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRevenue Recognition.We use bookings to evaluate the results of our operations, generate future operating plans and assess the performance of our company. While we believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate bookings differently or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.In July 2010, we began migrating to Facebook Credits as the primary payment method for our games played through Facebook, and by April 2011, we had completed this migration. Facebook remits to us an amount equal to 70% of the face value of Facebook Credits purchased by our players for use in our games. We record bookings and recognize revenue net of amounts retained by Facebook.The following table presents a reconciliation of revenue to bookings for each of the periods indicated:To provide investors with additional information about our financial results, we disclose within this prospectus adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided below a reconciliation between adjusted EBITDA and net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.We have included adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus because it is a key measure we use to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions for the allocation of capital. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. While we believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:Some limitations of bookings and adjusted EBITDA are:Because of these limitations, you should consider bookings and adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including revenue, net income (loss) and our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in Risk Factors.We are the worlds leading online social game developer with 232 million average MAUs in 166 countries. We have launched the most successful social games in the industry in each of the last three years and generated over $980 million in cumulative revenue and over $1.5 billion in cumulative bookings since our inception in 2007. Our games are accessible on Facebook, other social networks and mobile platforms to players worldwide, wherever and whenever they want. All of our games are free to play, and we generate revenue through the in-game sale of virtual goods and advertising.We are a pioneer and innovator of social games and a leader in making play a core activity on the Internet. We believe our leadership position in social games is the result of our significant investment in our people, content, brand, technology and infrastructure. Highlights in our history include:In 2010, our revenue and bookings were $597.5 million and $838.9 million, respectively, which represented increases from 2009 of $476.0 million and $510.8 million, respectively. Consistent with our free-to-play business model, historically less than 5% of our players have been paying players. Because the opportunity for socialinteractions increases as the number of players increases, we believe that maintaining and growing our overall number of players, including the number of players who may not purchase virtual goods, is important to the success of our business. As a result, we believe that the number of players who choose to purchase virtual goods will continue to constitute a small percentage of our overall players as our business grows.Our top three games vary over time but historically have contributed the majority of our revenue. Our top three games accounted for 93%, 83%, 78% and 63% of our online game revenue in 2008, 2009, 2010 and in the first quarter of 2011, respectively. Our ability to grow both our game audience and the number of paying players will be a critical component of future growth.We have restated our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2011 and for the three months then ended to reflect a correction in our accounting policy to properly apply changes in our estimated average playing period for paying players. The impact of this restatement was to increase revenue by $7.5 million and increase the provision for income taxes by $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and decrease deferred revenue by $7.5 million as of March 31, 2011. This restatement is further described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. The accompanying managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement.We are making significant investments in 2011 to drive long-term growth. We continue to invest in game development, creating both new games and new features and content in existing games designed to engage our players. We are also investing in other key areas of our business, including international market development, mobile games and our technology infrastructure. During the second half of 2011, we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $100 million to $150 million as we invest in network infrastructure to support our expected growth and to continue to improve the player experience.We operate our games as live services that allow players to play for free. We generate revenue primarily from the in-game sale of virtual goods and advertising.Online Game. We provide our players with the opportunity to purchase virtual goods that enhance their game-playing experience. We believe players choose to pay for virtual goods for the same reasons they are willing to pay for other forms of entertainment. They enjoy the additional playing time or added convenience, the ability to personalize their own game boards, the satisfaction of leveling up and the opportunity for sharing creative expressions. We believe players are more likely to purchase virtual goods when they are connected to and playing with their friends, whether those friends play for free or also purchase virtual goods.In May 2010, we entered into an addendum to Facebooks standard terms and conditions requiring us to transition our payment method to Facebook Credits, Facebooks proprietary payment method, as the primary means of payment within our games played through Facebook. We began migrating to Facebook Credits in July 2010, and by April 2011, we had completed this migration. Under this addendum, Facebook remits to us an amount equal to 70% of the face value of Facebook Credits purchased by our players for use in our games. We recognize revenue net of amounts retained by Facebook. Prior to this addendum, we used third-party payment processors and paid these processors service fees ranging from 2% to 10% of the purchase price of our virtual goods which were recorded in cost of revenue. Players can purchase Facebook Credits from Facebook, directly through our games or through game cards purchased from retailers and distributors.On platforms other than Facebook, players purchase our virtual goods through various widely accepted payment methods offered in the games, including credit cards, PayPal, Apple iTunes accounts and direct wires. Players can purchase game cards from retailers and distributors for use on these platforms.Advertising. Advertising revenue primarily includes branded virtual goods, sponsorships and engagement ads. We generally report our advertising revenue net of amounts due to advertising agencies and brokers.Revenue growth will depend largely on our ability to retain existing players, attract new players, convert non-paying players and increase revenue per player. We intend to do this through the launch of new games, enhancements to current games and expansion into new markets and distribution platforms.We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions.Bookings. Bookings is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as the total amount of revenue from the sale of virtual goods in our online games and advertising that would have been recognized in a period if we recognized all revenue immediately at the time of the sale. Bookings, as opposed to revenue, is the fundamental top-line metric we use to manage our business, as it reflects the sales activity in a given period. Annual bookings grew by $292.2 million from $35.9 million in 2008 to $328.1 million in 2009, and by $510.8 million to $838.9 million from 2009 to 2010. For a reconciliation of revenue to bookings, see the section titled Quarterly Results of Operations.Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted for provision for income taxes; other income (expense), net; interest income; gain (loss) from legal settlements; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation and change in deferred revenue. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. For a reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA, see the section titled Quarterly Results of Operations.We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics: DAUs, which measures daily active users of our games, MAUs, which measures monthly active users of our games, and MUUs, which measures monthly unique users of our games, each of which is recorded by our internal analytics systems.DAUs. We define DAUs as the number of individuals who played one of our games during a particular day. Under this metric, an individual who plays two different games on the same day is counted as two DAUs. Similarly, an individual who plays the same game on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) or on two different social networks on the same day would be counted as two DAUs. Average DAUs for a particular period is the average of the DAUs for each day during that period. We use DAU as a measure of audience engagement.MAUs. We define MAUs as the number of individuals who played a particular game in the 30-day period ending with the measurement date. Under this metric, an individual who plays two different games in the same 30-day period is counted as two MAUs. Similarly, an individual who plays the same game on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) or on two different social networks in a 30-day period would be counted as two MAUs. Average MAUs for a particular period is the average of the MAUs at each month-end during that period. We use MAU as a measure of total game audience size.MUUs. We define MUUs as the number of unique individuals who played any of our games on a particular platform in the 30-day period ending with the measurement date. An individual who plays more than one of our games in a given 30-day period would be counted as a single MUU. However, because we cannot distinguish unique individuals playing across multiple platforms, an individual who plays any of our games on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) in a given 30-day period would be counted as two MUUs. Because many of our players play more than one game in a given 30-day period, MUUs are always lower than MAUs in any given time period. Average MUUs for a particular period is the average of the MUUs at each month-end during that period. We use MUU as a measure of total audience reach across our network of games.In the letter from our founder included in this prospectus, the term daily active users means the average of our DAUs for each day during the period January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2011, and the term monthly unique users means the average of our MUUs as of the end of each of the first six months of 2011.NA means data is not available.Our user metrics are impacted by several factors which cause them to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Beginning in early 2010, Facebook changed its policies for application developers regarding use of its communication channels. These changes limited the level of communication among users about applications on the Facebook platform. As a result of this change the number of our players on Facebook declined. Our bookings and revenue growth rates declined throughout 2010 and the three months ended March 31, 2011 due partially to this change and due to our adoption of Facebook Credits as the primary payment method on Facebook. We account for Facebook Credits net of amounts retained by Facebook. Our DAUs, MAUs and MUUs all increased in the three months ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to the launch of CityVille in December 2010, the addition of new content to existing games and the launch of several mobile initiatives. Future growth in audience and engagement will depend on our ability to retain current players, attract new players, launch new games and expand into new markets and distribution platforms.Our operating metrics may not correlate directly to quarterly bookings or revenue trends in the short term. For instance, bookings and revenue have grown every quarter since our inception, including in quarters where DAU, MAU and MUU did not grow.Launch of new games and release of enhancements. Our bookings and revenue growth have been driven by the launch of new games and the release of fresh content and new features in existing games. For a summary of key game launch dates and other significant events, see the section titled Overview above. Although the amount of revenue and bookings we generate from a new game or an enhancement to an existing game can vary significantly, we expect our revenue and bookings growth to be correlated to the success of our new games and our success in releasing engaging content and features.Game monetization. We generate most of our revenue from the sale of virtual goods in our games. The degree to which our players choose to pay for virtual goods in our games is driven by our ability to create content and virtual goods that enhance the game-play experience. Our revenue and overall financial performance is affected by the number of paying players and the amount of money these players spend. In addition, international players have historically lagged the monetization that we achieve for U.S. players and the percentage of paying international players may increase or decrease based on a number of factors, including growth in overall international players, localization of content and the availability of payment options.Changes in Facebook or other platforms. Facebook is the primary distribution, marketing, promotion and payment platform for our social games. We generate substantially all of our revenue and players through the Facebook platform and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Facebook and other platforms have broad discretion to change their platforms, terms of service and other policies with respect to us or other developers, and those changes may be unfavorable to us.Investment in game development. In order to develop new games and enhance the content and features in our existing games, we must invest a significant amount of engineering and creative resources. These expenditures generally occur months in advance of the launch of a new game or the release of new content, and the resulting revenue may not equal or exceed our development costs.Hosting costs. To date, we have primarily utilized third-party web hosting services to operate our games. During periods of higher-than-expected player activity, when we exceeded our committed capacity, our costs have increased as we were required to purchase more expensive temporary capacity. We intend to invest in our network infrastructure, with the goal of reducing our reliance on third-party web hosting services and moving towards the use of self-operated data centers. Under this approach, we would host an increasing amount of data and traffic for our games on servers located in the data centers which we lease, build and operate. Investment in our network infrastructure will require capital expenditures for equipment. We believe that over the long term this investment will produce further operating leverage by reducing our game operation costs and will enhance our games and player experience. As we continue to grow, the capital investment necessary to build our infrastructure will be significant.Player acquisition costs. Although we acquire most of our players through unpaid channels, we also utilize advertising and other forms of player acquisition and retention to grow and retain our player audience. These expenditures generally relate to the promotion of new game launches and ongoing performance-based programs to drive new player acquisition and lapsed player reactivation. Over time, these acquisition and retention-related programs may become either less effective or more costly, negatively impacting our operating results.New market development. We are investing in new distribution channels such as mobile and other platforms, including other social networks and in international markets to expand our reach and grow our business. For example, we have continued to hire additional employees and acquire companies with experience developing mobile applications. We have also invested resources in integrating and operating some of our games on additional platforms, including Yahoo!, mixi and Tencent. As we expand into new markets and distribution channels, we expect to incur headcount, marketing and other operating costs in advance of the associated bookings and revenue. Our financial performance will be impacted by our investment in these initiatives and their success.Vesting of ZSUs. We have granted restricted stock units, or ZSUs, to our employees that generally vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-period condition of up to four years and a liquidity condition. Because the liquidity condition is not met until the occurrence of a qualifying liquidity event (an initial public offering or change of control), we have not recorded any expense to date relating to our ZSU grants. In connection with the initial public offering, we will begin recording stock compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the ZSUs using the accelerated attribution method. If the initial public offering had occurred on March 31, 2011, we would have recorded $139.4 million of stock-based compensation expense on that date related to ZSUs and would have had an additional $492.0 million in unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to ZSUs.Cost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of web hosting and data center costs related to operating our games, including: depreciation and amortization; consulting costs primarily related to third-party provisioning of customer support services; payment processing fees; and salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our customer support and infrastructure teams. Our infrastructure team includes our network operations and payment platform teams. Credit card processing fees, allocated facilities costs and other supporting overhead costs are also included in cost of revenue. We expect cost of revenue to increase for the foreseeable future as we expand our data center capacity and headcount associated with player support.Research and development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our engineers and developers. In addition, research and development expenses include outside services and consulting, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We believe continued investment in enhancing existing games and developing new games, and in software development tools and code modification, is important to attaining our strategic objectives. As a result, we expect research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we grow our business.Sales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of player acquisition costs, which are advertisements designed to drive players into our games, salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our sales and marketing employees and fees paid to consultants. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include general marketing, branding, advertising and public relations costs, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our player base and continue building brand awareness. As a result, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we grow our business.General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our executive, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, charitable donations and facilities and other supporting overhead costs not allocated to other departments. General and administrative expenses also include gains and losses associated with legal settlements. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow our business and incur additional expenses associated with being a publicly-traded company.The following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented as a percentage of revenue for those periods.Revenue increased $142.0 million from the three months ended March 31, 2010 to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase in online game revenue of $132.1 million was the result of an increase in bookings each quarter subsequent to March 31, 2010 driven by increases in the volume of payment transactions as a result of new game content and the launch of several successful new games, including CityVille, FrontierVille and Treasure Isle in 2010. No significant new games were launched in the first quarter of 2011. Bookings are recorded to deferred revenue and recognized into revenue over the estimated average life of the purchased virtual goods or as the virtual goods are consumed. The estimated weighted-average life of durable and consumable virtual goods included in new bookings during the three months ended March 31, 2010 was 14 months compared to 12 months for the three months ended March 31, 2011, which increased revenue by $6.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase in online game revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2011 was negatively impacted by our adoption of Facebook Credits as our primary in-game payment method beginning in the third quarter of 2010. International revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased from 33% in the three months ended March 31, 2010 to 34% in the three months ended March 31, 2011.Advertising revenue increased $9.9 million from the three months ended March 31, 2010 to the three months ended March 31, 2011, due to a $4.7 million increase in in-game offers and engagements and a $5.2 million increase in other advertising activity. Our advertising revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was negatively impacted because in the fourth quarter of 2009 we discontinued certain in-game advertising offers in order to improve player experience. Although we resumed and gradually began to increase in-game advertising offers in the three months ended March 31, 2010, our advertising revenue for that period was negatively impacted compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011, which had in-game advertising offers for the entire period.Cost of revenue increased $34.8 million from the three months ended March 31, 2010 to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in hosting costs of $21.7 million to support additional games and player activity, a $9.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to depreciation of new fixed assets and amortization of acquired intangibles, a $5.3 million increase in consulting costs primarily related to third-party customer support necessitated by higher player activity and a $3.0 million increase in headcount-related expenses for our infrastructure groups to support the growth of our business. Payment processing fees decreased by $3.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010, due to our transition to Facebook Credits beginning in the third quarter of 2010. We account for revenue from the redemption of Facebook Credits net of amounts retained by Facebook.Research and development expenses increased $43.9 million from the three months ended March 31, 2010 to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a $37.8 million increase in headcount-related expenses and a $3.3 million increase in consulting costs due to the ongoing investment in new game development, in addition to an increase in allocated facilities and other overhead support costs of $1.7 million.Sales and marketing expenses increased $22.8 million from the three months ended March 31, 2010 to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a $14.9 million increase in player acquisition costs and an increase in headcount-related expenses of $5.3 million.General and administrative expenses increased $10.7 million from the three months ended March 31, 2010 to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.0 million increase in headcount-related expenses as well as a $4.4 million increase in facilities and overhead expenses.Interest income increased $0.4 million from the three months ended March 31, 2010 to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance driven by the increase in cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale and issuance of Series C preferred stock in February 2011.Other income (expense), net decreased $1.2 million from the three months ended March 31, 2010 to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to losses due to foreign exchange rate changes.Provision for income taxes increased $18.8 million from the three months ended March 31, 2010 to the three months ended March 31, 2011. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in pre-tax income of $29.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010 and the realization of deferred tax assets from prior periods that offset current tax expense in this period. In addition, the provision for income taxes at March 31, 2011 was higher as a result of an increase in non-deductible stock compensation expense and the implementation cost of our international tax structure, and a significant change in our geographic mix of income, which provides for income earned in various tax jurisdictions to be taxed at a broad range of income tax rates.2009 Compared to 2010. Revenue increased $476.0 million from 2009 to 2010. Online game revenue increased $488.9 million as we recognized revenue from bookings generated throughout 2009 and 2010. During the last half of 2009 and throughout 2010, our bookings increased significantly due to increases in the volume of payment transactions as a result of the launch of several games including FarmVille in June 2009, Café World in November 2009 and FrontierVille in June 2010, as well as the addition of new content to existing games. The estimated weighted-average life of virtual goods included in new bookings during 2009 was 18 months compared to 13 months during 2010 as data became available to account for consumable virtual goods separately from durable virtual goods beginning October 1, 2009, which increased revenue by $124.6 million in 2010 compared to 2009. Revenue from advertising decreased $12.9 million as we reduced in-game offers in order to improve player experience. International revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 14%, 27% and 33% in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. These increases are primarily due to additional localized content, more international payment methods and more demand for our games internationally.2008 Compared to 2009. Revenue increased $102.1 million from 2008 to 2009. Online game revenue increased $80.5 million as we recognized revenue from bookings generated throughout 2008 and 2009. Our bookings increased in every quarter due to increases in the volume of payment transactions as a result of the launch of several new games including Mafia Wars in June 2008 and FarmVille in June 2009, as well as new content added to existing games. The estimated weighted-average life of virtual goods included in new bookings during 2008 was 15 months compared to 18 months for 2009. Revenue from advertising increased $21.6 million due to player growth and an increase in in-game offers.2009 Compared to 2010. Cost of revenue increased $119.3 million from 2009 to 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $47.6 million in hosting costs to support additional games and increased player activity, an increase of $23.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense related to depreciation of new fixed assets and amortization of intangibles acquired in business acquisitions, an increase of $18.0 million in consulting costs primarily related to third-party customer support necessitated by higher player activity, and an increase of $13.4 million in headcount-related costs for our technology and customer support groups to support the growth of our business. In addition, payment processing fees increased by $9.6 million.2008 Compared to 2009. Cost of revenue increased $46.7 million from 2008 to 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $14.3 million in hosting costs to support new games and increased player activity, an increase of $12.8 million in payment processing fees as a result of increased payment transactions, and an increase of $7.4 million in headcount-related costs for our technology and customer support groups in order to support our ongoing investment in game development and enhancements.2009 Compared to 2010. Research and development expenses increased $98.5 million from 2009 to 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $77.9 million in headcount-related expenses and an increase of $8.2 million in third-party design expenses related to game development and an increase of $8.9 million in allocated facilities and overhead support costs.2008 Compared to 2009. Research and development expenses increased $38.9 million from 2008 to 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $29.5 million in headcount-related expenses related to game development.2009 Compared to 2010. Sales and marketing expenses increased $71.9 million from 2009 to 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $44.5 million in player acquisition costs, an increase of $18.7 million in headcount-related costs and an increase of $5.5 million in general marketing expenses related to new marketing and brand programs.2008 Compared to 2009. Sales and marketing expenses increased $31.3 million from 2008 to 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $26.3 million in player acquisition costs and an increase of $3.2 million in headcount-related expenses.2009 Compared to 2010. General and administrative expenses increased $8.0 million from 2009 to 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $22.8 million in headcount-related expenses, an increase of $14.0 million in professional service costs, a $4.8 million increase in depreciation expense and a $2.5 million increase in information technology costs to support the growth of our business. These increased expenses were offset by a net gain from legal settlements of $39.3 million.2008 Compared to 2009. General and administrative expenses increased $15.4 million from 2008 to 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $13.2 million in professional services associated with ongoing litigation and an increase of $10.3 million in headcount-related expenses related to the support of the growth of our business. In 2008, we recorded $7.0 million of general and administrative expenses related to a legal settlement.2009 Compared to 2010. Interest income increased $1.0 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance driven by the increase in cash flows from operations and cash from financing activities, including proceeds from the sale and issuance of Series B-2 preferred stock in the second quarter of 2010.2008 Compared to 2009. Interest income decreased $0.1 million primarily due to the decrease in interest rates during 2009.2009 Compared to 2010. Other income (expense), net increased $0.6 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to an increase in net transaction gain on foreign exchange rate changes.2008 Compared to 2009. Other income (expense), net decreased $0.4 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to a net transaction loss on foreign exchange rate changes.2009 Compared to 2010. Provision for income taxes increased $36.5 million from 2009 to 2010, primarily as a result of the increase in pre-tax income in 2010 from a pre-tax loss in 2009. In 2010, we recorded a provision for income taxes that was principally attributable to U.S. federal taxes, California taxes and foreign taxes. The effective tax rate for 2010 was 28.7%. The increase in our annual effective tax rate for 2010 was driven by the implementation cost of our international tax structure, state income taxes and non-deductible stock compensation expense. These increases were offset by the benefit of releasing the federal valuation allowance in 2010 due to our achievement of profitability, and by the utilization of both federal and California research and development credits.2008 Compared to 2009. In 2008 and 2009, we recorded income taxes that were principally attributable to the California minimum franchise tax and foreign taxes.The following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for each of the nine quarters ended March 31, 2011 (certain items may not reconcile due to rounding). We also present other financial and operations data, and a reconciliation of revenue to bookings and net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA, for the same periods. We have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of operations data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in this prospectus. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.NA means data is not available.Revenue increased sequentially during every quarter presented due to the launch of new games and the release of enhanced content and features in existing games. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2009 data became available to separately account for consumable and durable virtual goods for one of our games, thus allowing us to recognize revenue related to consumable goods upon consumption. In the three months ended March 31, 2010, this data became available for several of our other games. As consumable virtual goods are typically consumed by our players within a month of purchase, this resulted in revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time beginning in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to previous periods.Cost of revenue increased in absolute terms during every quarter presented. The increases were primarily due to increased web-hosting costs, depreciation and amortization expense, consulting and headcount costs related to customer support in connection with the growth of our business. Payment processing fees decreased $2.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010 due to the transition to Facebook Credits as our primary in-game payment method for games played through Facebook. We do not record any payment processing fees associated with Facebook Credits because we account for revenue related to the redemption of Facebook Credits in our games net of the amounts retained by Facebook. The increase in cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the threemonths ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to web-hosting costs associated with higher-than-expected player activity that required us to purchase additional, more expensive temporary capacity.Research and development expenses increased in absolute terms during every quarter presented, primarily due to headcount-related expenses from continued hiring to develop and enhance our games and consulting costs related to game design and content creation. The increase in the three months ended March 31, 2011 reflects increased resources devoted to existing and new game development. This is a key area of investment for us and core to the long-term success of our business.Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $2.9 million from the three months ended December 31, 2009 to the three months ended March 31, 2010 due to a decrease in player acquisition costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $12.1 million from the three months ended March 31, 2010 to the three months ended June 30, 2010 due primarily to an increase in player acquisition costs related to the launch of new games and a $3.3 million stock-based compensation charge related to a former employee recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2010. Increases in sales and marketing expenses in other quarters were primarily due to increased player acquisition costs, increased headcount-related expenses from continued hiring to support business growth, and increased marketing activities and consulting costs. The timing of these marketing activities and related consulting costs drove fluctuations in expenses during 2010.General and administrative expenses generally increased in absolute terms over the periods presented. This was primarily due to increased headcount-related expenses from continued hiring to support growth, as well as increased costs related to legal professional services. The timing of legal professional service expenses as well as charitable campaign expenses drove fluctuations in general and administrative expenses in the periods presented. The decrease in general and administrative expenses from the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010 was due primarily to a decrease in consulting expenses. During the three months ended December 31, 2010, general and administrative expenses were offset by a net gain from legal settlements of $39.3 million.As of March 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $995.6 million, which consisted of cash, money market funds and U.S. government debt securities. Prior to 2010, we funded our operations and capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and sales of preferred stock. Since 2010, we have been able to fund our operations, including capital expenditures, through cash flow from operating activities. In 2011, our philosophy is to continue to invest for long-term growth. During the second half of 2011, we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $100 million to $150 million as we invest in network infrastructure to support our expected growth and to continue to improve the player experience. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.Operating activities provided $103.7 million of cash in the three months ended March 31, 2011. The cash flow from operating activities primarily resulted from changes in our operating assets and liabilities and our net income, adjusted for non-cash items. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities provided $53.7 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2011, primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue and a decrease in income tax receivable, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. The increase in our deferred revenue and accounts receivable was primarily due to our bookings growth in the three months ended March 31, 2011, which increased by $43.1 million from the three months ended December 31, 2010. Additionally, our accounts receivable balance increased as we transitioned our in-game payment method to Facebook from other payment processors, who generally remit payments faster than Facebook. Our income tax receivable balance decreased as we utilized tax payments made in prior periods to offset tax liabilities incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2011. We had net income in the three months ended March 31, 2011 of $16.8 million, including non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $17.8 million, which continues to grow in correlation with our spending on capital equipment and business acquisitions. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense was $14.5 million, primarily driven by stock awards issued in connection with business acquisitions and to executives.Operating activities provided $326.4 million of cash in 2010. The cash flow from operating activities primarily resulted from an increase in bookings, which resulted in an increase in deferred revenue of $241.4 million from 2009 to 2010. Additionally, the growth of our business resulted in increased spending, causing an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $102.4 million. We had net income in 2010 of $90.6 million, which included non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $39.5 million, driven by investments in capital equipment and business acquisitions we made during 2010. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense was $25.7 million, driven primarily by stock awards issued in connection with business acquisitions. The favorable components of cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by an increase in income tax receivable of $25.3 million, due to tax payments made in excess of taxes due; an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based awards of $39.7 million, due to the realization of tax benefits from stock option activity in 2010; and an increase in accounts receivable of $69.5 million, primarily due to our bookings growth. Additionally, our rate of collection on accounts receivable was impacted in the second half of the year, as we began transitioning our in-game payment method to Facebook from other payment processors, who generally remit payments faster than Facebook.Operating activities provided $191.0 million of cash in 2009. The cash flow from operating activities primarily resulted from an increase in bookings, which resulted in an increase in deferred revenue of $206.6 million from 2008 to 2009. The growth of our business also resulted in increased spending, causing an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $40.5 million. The favorable components of cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by our net loss in 2009 of $52.8 million and increases in income tax receivable and accounts receivable. The increase in income tax receivable was due to tax payments made in excess of taxes due for 2009 and the increase in accounts receivable was due to the increase in bookings.Operating activities provided $11.5 million of cash in 2008. The cash flow from operating activities primarily resulted from an increase in bookings, which resulted in an increase in deferred revenue of $16.5 million from 2007 to 2008. The growth of our business also resulted in increased spending, causing an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $15.4 million. The favorable components of cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by our net loss in 2008 of $22.1 million.Our primary investing activities have consisted of purchases and sales of marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and business acquisitions.Cash used in the purchase of marketable securities was $10.0 million in 2008, $125.1 million in 2009 and $804.5 million in 2010. Cash provided by the sale and maturity of marketable securities was zero in 2008, $62.4 million in 2009 and $324.0 million in 2010. Cash used in the purchase of marketable securities was $104.4 million and $272.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. Cash provided by the sale and maturity of marketable securities was $17.6 million and $287.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively.Our purchases of property and equipment have primarily resulted from our investment in our data centers. We also continued to invest in technology hardware and software to support our growth. Purchases of property and equipment may vary from period to period due to the timing of the expansion of our operations and game and software development. We expect to continue to invest in property and equipment and development of software associated with online games for the remainder of 2011 and thereafter.We used zero, $0.5 million and $62.3 million, net of cash acquired, in connection with acquisitions in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. We used $5.5 million and $10.4 million, net of cash acquired in connection with acquisitions for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. In line with our growth strategy, we completed these acquisitions to expand our social game offerings, obtain employee talent and expand into new international markets.Our financing activities have consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and preferred stock partially offset by the repurchase of common stock and preferred stock.In the three months ended March 31, 2011, we issued 34.9 million shares of Series C preferred stock for net proceeds of $485.3 million. In addition, we repurchased 23.7 million shares of our outstanding capital stock for a total purchase price of $261.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011.In July 2011, we executed a revolving credit agreement with certain lenders to borrow up to $1.0 billion in revolving loans. Per the terms of the credit agreement, we paid upfront fees of $2.5 million and we are required to pay ongoing commitment fees of up to $625,000 each quarter based on the portion of the credit facility that is not drawn down. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates.We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements in 2008, 2009 or 2010 or in the three months ended March 31, 2011.We have entered into operating leases for facilities space. In 2010, we executed an operating lease agreement for 267,000 square feet of office space for our future headquarters in San Francisco, California. The lease term is seven years from the defined commencement date, with options to renew for two five-year terms. In addition, we have entered into several service contracts for web hosting services. The minimum lease payments and the future minimum purchase commitments as of December 31, 2010 are included in the table below. We do not have any debt or material capital lease obligations, and all of our property, equipment and software has been purchased with cash.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this prospectus. We have identified below our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe require the greatest amount of judgment. These estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.We derive revenue from the sale of virtual goods and from the sale of advertising within our games.We operate our games as live services that allow players to play for free. Within these games, players can purchase virtual currency to obtain virtual goods to enhance their game-playing experience. Players can primarily pay for our virtual currency using Facebook Credits when playing our games through the Facebook platform, and can use other payment methods such as credit cards or PayPal on other platforms. We also sell game cards that are initially recorded as a customer deposit liability which is included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, net of fees retained by retailers and distributors. Upon redemption of a game card into one of our games and delivery of virtual currency to the player, these amounts are reclassified to deferred revenue.We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the player; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. For purposes of determining when the service has been provided to the player, we have determined that an implied obligation exists to the paying player to continue displaying the purchased virtual goods within the online game over their estimated life or until they are consumed. The proceeds from the sales of virtual goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue. We categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods,such as energy in CityVille, represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action. Common characteristics of consumable goods may include virtual goods that are no longer displayed on the players game board after a short period of time, do not provide the player any continuing benefit following consumption or often times enable a player to perform an in-game action immediately. For the sale of consumable virtual goods, we recognize revenue as the goods are consumed. Durable virtual goods, such as tractors in FarmVille, represent virtual goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time. We recognize revenue from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the estimated average playing period of paying players for the applicable game, which represents our best estimate of the average life of our durable virtual goods. If we do not have the ability to differentiate revenue attributable to durable virtual goods from consumable virtual goods for a specific game, we recognize revenue from the sale of durable and consumable virtual goods for that game ratably over the estimated average period that paying players typically play our games. We determine our estimated average playing period of paying players for each significant game beginning with the time a player first purchases a virtual good. For the three months ended March 31, 2011, the estimated average playing period of paying players for our games ranged from ten to 25 months. Future paying player usage patterns and behavior may differ from the historical usage patterns and therefore the estimated average playing periods may change in the future.Prior to October 1, 2009, we did not have the data to determine the consumption dates for our consumable virtual goods or to differentiate revenue attributable to durable virtual goods from consumable virtual goods. Beginning in October 2009, we had sufficient data to separately account for consumable and durable virtual goods in one of our games, thus allowing us to recognize revenue related to consumable goods upon consumption. Since January 2010, we have had this data for substantially all of our games, thus allowing us to recognize revenue related to consumable goods upon consumption. Future usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns and therefore the estimated average playing periods may change in the future. We assess the estimated average playing period for paying players and the estimated average life of our virtual goods quarterly. We expect that there will be changes in the mix of virtual goods sold due to new game introductions, reduced virtual good sales in existing games or other factors, including changes in estimates in virtual good life or our ability to make such estimates. When such changes occur, and in particular if more of our revenue in any period is derived from goods for which revenue is recognized over the estimated average playing period, or that period increases on average, the amount of revenue that we recognize in a future period may be reduced from prior periods, perhaps significantly. We estimate chargebacks from our third-party payment processors to account for potential future chargebacks based on historical data and record such amounts as a reduction of revenue.We determine our estimated average playing period for paying players by game beginning at the time of a payers first purchase and ending on a date that is calculated based on an attrition rate which factors in historical data. To determine the attrition rate for a given game, we analyze all paying players for that game who made their first in-game payment between six and 18 months prior to the beginning of each quarter and determine whether each player within the analyzed population is an active or inactive player as of the date of our analysis. If a new game is launched and only a limited period of paying player data is available for our analysis, then we also consider other factors, such as the estimated average playing period for other recently launched games with similar characteristics, to determine the estimated average playing period.In May 2010, we entered into an agreement with Facebook that required us to accept Facebook Credits as the primary in-game payment method for our games played through the Facebook platform. The agreement required us to begin migrating our games to Facebook Credits in our games beginning in July 2010, and by April 2011 this migration was complete. Facebook Credits is Facebooks proprietary virtual currency that Facebook sells for use on the Facebook platform. Under the terms of our agreement, Facebook sets the price our players pay for Facebook Credits and collects the cash from the sale of Facebook Credits. Facebooks current stated face value of a Facebook Credit is $0.10. For each Facebook Credit purchased by our players and redeemed in our games, Facebook remits to us $0.07, which is the net amount we recognize as revenue. We recognize revenue net of the amounts retained by Facebook because we do not set the pricing of Facebook Credits to the players of ourgames. Prior to the implementation of Facebook Credits in our games, players could purchase our virtual goods through various widely accepted payment methods offered in the games and we recognized revenue based on the transaction price paid by the player.We have contractual relationships with agencies and brokers for advertisements within our games. We recognize advertising revenue as advertisements are delivered to customers as long as evidence of the arrangement exists (executed contract), the price is fixed and determinable, and we have assessed collectability as reasonably assured. Certain branded virtual goods and sponsorships are deferred and recognized over the estimated average life of the branded virtual good, similar to online game revenue.We report our advertising revenue net of amounts due to advertising agencies and brokers because we are not the primary obligor in our arrangements, we do not set the pricing, and we do not establish or maintain the relationship with the advertiser.We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based on available evidence. We account for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes.In line with our growth strategy, we have completed acquisitions to expand our social games and mobile offerings, obtain employee talent, and expand into new markets. We account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of the acquisition to the tangible assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of such items requires judgment, including estimating future cash flows or estimating the cost to recreate an acquired asset. If actual results are lower than estimates, we could be required to record impairment charges in the future. Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances exist which indicate an impairment may exist.Acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. During the one-year period beginning with the acquisition date, we may record certain purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed against goodwill. After the final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage relating to the development of our games and computer software developed or purchased for internal use. The application development stage occurs after management has approved and funded the project and determined it is probable the project will be completed and the resulting product will function as intended. Significant judgment is required in determiningwhether it is probable that a project will be completed and the resulting product will function as intended. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. Costs incurred prior to or after the application development stage are expensed as incurred.We grant restricted stock units, or ZSUs, to our employees that generally vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based condition of up to four years and a liquidity condition. The ZSUs have a contractual term of seven years. Because the liquidity condition is not met until the occurrence of a qualifying liquidity event (an initial public offering or change of control), we have not recorded any expense to date relating to our ZSU grants. In connection with the initial public offering, we will begin recording stock compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the ZSUs using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forefeitures. If the initial public offering had occurred on March 31, 2011, we would have recorded $139.4 million of stock-based compensation expense on that date related to ZSUs and would have had an additional $492.0 million in unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to ZSUs.We have historically issued unvested Series Z preferred stock to employees of certain acquired companies. As these awards are generally subject to post-acquisition employment, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the Series Z preferred stock on a straight-line basis over the four-year service period, net of estimated forfeitures.We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires the use of the following assumptions: (i) expected volatility of our common stock, which is based on our peer group in the industry in which we do business; (ii) expected life of the option award, which we elected to calculate using the simplified method; (iii) expected dividend yield, which is 0%, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock; and (iv) the risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with maturities equal to the grants expected life. Option grants generally vest over four years, with 25% vesting after one year and the remainder vesting monthly thereafter over 36 months. The options have a contractual term of 10 years. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model changes significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously.The following table summarizes the assumptions relating to our stock options granted in 2009 and 2010:Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures so that expense is recorded for only those stock-based awards that we expect to vest. We estimate forfeitures based on our historical forfeiture of equity awards adjusted to reflect future changes in facts and circumstances, if any. We will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates. We record stock-based compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting term.For stock options issued to non-employees, including consultants, we record expense equal to the fair value of the options calculated using the Black-Scholes model over the service performance period. The fair value of options granted to non-employees is remeasured over the vesting period, and the resulting value is recognized as an expense over the period the services are received.Valuation of Our Common Stock and Series Z Preferred StockThe valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Although we did not obtain separate valuations of our Series Z preferred stock, our board of directors determined that the fair value of our Series Z preferred stock was equivalent to the value of our common stock because the value of the additional rights and preferences of our Series Z preferred stock was not significant. Our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine its best estimate of the fair value of our common stock and Series Z preferred stock as of each grant date, including but not limited to, the following factors:We have granted the following ZSUs, unvested Series Z preferred stock and stock options since January 1, 2010:Based upon the assumed initial public offering price of $             per share, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding as of December 31, 2010 was $             million, of which $             million related to vested options and $             million related to unvested options.We obtained third-party contemporaneous valuations of our common stock in April 2010, June 2010 and January 2011. The valuation analyses applied a combination of multi-period discounting method to after-tax cash flow available to invested capital, valuation metrics of comparable private transactions and publicly traded companies as well as recent negotiated arms-length transactions in our common stock and preferred stock, giving greatest consideration to the latter as this was determined to be the best evidence of fair value.We also obtained a third-party contemporaneous valuation of our common stock in March 2011. This valuation analysis determined the total value available to equity holders by applying a probability-weighted expected return model. The expected returns were based on a multi-period discounting method to after-tax cash flow available to invested capital and potential exit events from a strategic acquirer or initial public offering.During 2010, our board of directors considered several factors in its assessment and approval of our 2010 valuation analyses. The United States economy and the financial markets continued to improve, as evidenced by 12.8% and 16.9% annual gains on the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite Index, respectively. We experienced sequential bookings and revenue growth in each consecutive quarter during 2010. However, our user metrics declined due to several factors. Beginning in early 2010, Facebook changed its policies for application developers regarding the use of its communication channels, and as a result the number of our players on Facebook declined in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2010. Additionally, we began migrating to Facebook Credits in July 2010 which created uncertainty around our financial outlook and reduced our net proceeds from the sale of virtual goods which negatively impacted our revenue growth and operating margin.Since the fourth quarter of 2009, there has been a significant number of secondary transactions in our common stock and preferred stock. The pricing of these transactions was the primary basis for determining the fair value of our common stock and Series Z preferred stock in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, as more specifically discussed below.In April 2010, we issued a total of 2,330,472 shares of our Series B-2 preferred stock for $6.435 per share to two new investors for aggregate proceeds of $15 million. In April 2010, we obtained a third-party valuation that used recent arms length transactions in our stock, including this April transaction, as the primary indication of value. These transactions indicated a valuation of $4.25 billion based on fully diluted shares outstanding. To assess the reasonableness of this value a discounted cash flow analysis was utilized rendering a value of $3.67 billion. Based on this April 2010 valuation and the factors described above, our board of directors determined that the fair value of our common stock and Series Z preferred stock was $6.435 per share for grants made during the second quarter of 2010.In May 2010, we issued a total of 45,832,608 additional shares of our Series B-2 preferred stock for $6.435 per share to one existing investor and to one new investor for aggregate proceeds of $295 million.In June 2010, we obtained a third-party valuation that used recent arms length transactions in our stock as the primary indication of value. These transactions indicated a valuation of $4.59 billion based on fully diluted shares outstanding. To assess the reasonableness of this value a discounted cash flow analysis was utilized rendering a value of $4.34 billion. Based on this June 2010 valuation and factors described above, our board of directors determined there was objective information that the fair value of our common stock and Series Z preferred stock remained at the same value as our April 2010 valuation described above, which was $6.435 per share for grants made during the third and fourth quarters of 2010.In July 2010, two new investors and one existing investor purchased an aggregate of 27,617,818 shares of Series A and Series A-1 preferred stock and Class B common stock from current employees and early investors, including our chief executive officer and certain other members of our senior management team, at a purchase price of $6.435 per share. In addition, several existing and several new investors purchased common stock from employees who tendered an aggregate of 16,059,796 shares of common stock into the offer to these new investors, which closed in October 2010. The price used in this tender offer was also $6.435, and since the participants in this transaction included highly knowledgeable, informed and sophisticated parties as both buyers and sellers, our board of directors determined that the terms of this transaction approximated those that would be obtained in an arms-length transaction.In January 2011, in anticipation of purchasing common stock and preferred stock primarily from our employees and an early investor, we obtained a third-party valuation report that used recent arms length transactions in our stock as the primary indication of value. These transactions indicated a valuation of $4.98 billion based on fully diluted shares outstanding. To assess the reasonableness of this value a discounted cash flow analysis was utilized rendering a value of $4.91 billion. This valuation concluded that the fair value of our common stock was $6.435 per share. We subsequently purchased an aggregate of 9,219,504 shares of common stock and Series A preferred stock from an early investor, a consultant and certain of our employees at a purchase price of $6.435 per share. In addition, a new investor who became a board member purchased an aggregate of 388,410 shares of common stock from an employee at $6.435 per share. Based on the above, our board of directors determined there was objective information that the fair value of our common stock and Series Z preferred stock remained at the same value as our April 2010 valuation described above, which was $6.435 per share for the grants made in January 2011.In February 2011, we issued a total of 34,927,368 shares of our Series C preferred stock for $14.03 per share to five new investors and one existing investor for aggregate proceeds of $490 million. In March 2011, we obtained a third-party valuation report that used recent arms length transactions in our stock as the primary indication of value. These transactions indicated a valuation of $11.15 billion based on fully-diluted shares outstanding. As of the valuation date, we had increased visibility into an exit strategy. As such a probability weighted analysis was conducted. Management estimated the probability of an initial public offering in the future at 80%, strategic sale at 5%, and continued operations at 15%. These estimates were based on our financial and operating performance and improving market conditions. For example, the United States economy and the financial markets continued to improve, exhibited by 5.4% and 4.8% gains on the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite Index, respectively. Additionally, in late February, peer companies achieved significant increases in their valuations, including comparable public companies as well as comparative private entities, including Facebook, Inc. and Groupon, Inc. based on news media reports of third party investments in these companies. We experienced bookings and revenue growth throughout the first quarter and our user metrics increased with average DAU, average MAU and average MUU growing 29%, 21% and 32%, respectively, driven by the recent launch of CityVille. Based on the March 2011 valuation and the factors described above, our board of directors determined there was objective information that the fair value of our common stock and Series Z preferred stock was $13.96 per share for grants made in early March 2011.In late March 2011, our board of directors determined that the fair value of our common stock and Series Z preferred stock remained $13.96 per share. Our board of directors considered several factors, including the proximity in time to the March 2011 valuation and the lack of material changes in our business or in market conditions subsequent to the March 2011 valuation. Our board of directors also considered the March 2011 repurchase of 14,427,924 shares of Series A, Series A-1 and Series B-1 preferred stock and common stock from five early investors and our Chief Executive Officer at $13.96 per share.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, money market funds and U.S. government debt securities. We do not have any long-term borrowings.The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. Because our cash and cash equivalents have a relatively short maturity, our portfolios fair value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. We determined that the increase in yield from potentially investing our cash and cash equivalents in longer-term investments did not warrant a change in our investment strategy. In future periods, we will continue to evaluate our investment policy in order to ensure that we continue to meet our overall objectives.Our sales transactions are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. However, certain of our operating expenses are incurred outside the U.S. and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen and Indian Rupee. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Although we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of transaction gains (losses) related to revaluing certain cash balances, trade accounts payable, current liabilities and intercompany balances that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, we believe such a change would not have a material impact on our results of operations.We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue ArrangementsA Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13), which updates the existing multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under Accounting Standards Codification 605-25. The revised guidance eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and also eliminates the residual method of allocating the arrangement consideration. In addition, the guidance expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. We adopted ASU 2009-13 on January 1, 2011 using the prospective method. Our adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a material impact on revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2011.We founded Zynga in 2007 with the vision that playlike search, share and shopwould become one of the core activities on the Internet. We pioneered online social games with the belief that we could make them accessible, social and fun. We are excited that games have grown to become the second most popular online activity in the United States by time spent, even surpassing email. We have a lot of hard work, innovation and growth ahead of us to create a future where social games are a daily habit for nearly everyone.Our mission is to connect the world through games.We are the worlds leading social game developer with 232 million average MAUs in 166 countries. We have launched the most successful social games in the industry in each of the last three years and have generated over $980 million in cumulative revenue and over $1.5 billion in cumulative bookings since our inception in 2007. Our games are accessible to players worldwide, on Facebook, other social networks and mobile platforms wherever and whenever they want. We operate our games as live services and continually enhance them by adding new content and features. All of our games are free to play, and we generate revenue through the in-game sale of virtual goods and advertising.We are a pioneer and innovator of social games and a leader in making play a core activity on the Internet. We believe our leadership position in social games is the result of our significant investment in our people, content, brand, technology and infrastructure. Our leadership position in social games is defined by the following:We leverage our scale to increase player engagement, cross-promote our portfolio of games, continually enhance existing games, launch new games and build the Zynga brand. We believe our scale results in network effects that deliver compelling value to our players, and we are committed to making significant investments that will further grow our community of players, their engagement and our monetization over time.We have achieved significant growth in our business in a short period of time. From 2008 to 2010, our revenue increased from $19.4 million to $597.5 million, our bookings increased from $35.9 million to $838.9 million, we went from a net loss of $22.1 million to net income of $90.6 million, and our adjusted EBITDA increased from $4.5 million to $392.7 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, our revenue increased from $100.9 million to $242.9 million, our bookings increased from $178.3 million to $286.6 million our net income increased from $6.4 million to $16.8 million, and our adjusted EBITDA increased from $93.6 million to $112.3 million. For a discussion of the limitations associated with using bookings and adjusted EBITDA rather than GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these measures to revenue and net income (loss), see the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial DataNon-GAAP Financial Measures.Consistent with our free-to-play business model, historically less than 5% of our players have been paying players. Because the opportunity for social interactions increases as the number of players increases, we believe that maintaining and growing our overall number of players, including the number of players who may not purchase virtual goods, is important to the success of our business. As a result, we believe that the number of players who choose to purchase goods will continue to constitute a small percentage of our overall players as our business grows.Our top three games historically have contributed the majority of our revenue. Our top three games accounted for 93%, 83%, 78% and 63% of our online game revenue in 2008, 2009, 2010 and in the first quarter of 2011, respectively.The way people use, communicate through and socialize on the Internet continues to evolve. A major shift in peoples use of the Internet is the increased popularity of playing games relative to other online activities. According to a Nielsen report in August 2010, the time spent playing online games in the United States surpassed the time spent on email. There are a number of key trends that we believe will continue to drive the growth and popularity of social games, including:We believe social games represent a new form of entertainment that will continue to capture an increasing proportion of consumer leisure time. In addition, social games are the most popular applications on Facebook and we believe they have been, and will continue to be, a key driver of engagement on social networks, and increasingly on mobile platforms. As consumers gravitate toward more social forms of online entertainment, we believe that social games will capture an increasing portion of the overall $52 billion video game software market, as estimated for 2011 by IDC, as well as the more than $1.0 trillion we estimate for the Worldwide Entertainment Market in 2011.We believe that a player-centric approach is the key to our continued success. We design our games to be:We believe the following strengths provide us with competitive advantages:We measure our business by using several key financial metrics, which include bookings and adjusted EBITDA, and operating metrics, which include DAUs, MAUs and MUUs. Our operating metrics help us to understand and measure the engagement levels of our players, the size of our audience and our reach.For a description of how we calculate each of our key metrics and factors that have caused fluctuations in these metrics, see the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsKey Metrics.In July 2010, we began migrating to Facebook Credits as the primary payment method for our games played through Facebook, and by April 2011, we had completed this migration. Facebook remits to us an amount equal to 70% of the face value of Facebook Credits purchased by our players for use in our games played through Facebook. We record bookings and recognize revenue net of the amounts retained by Facebook.The charts and the table below show the metrics for the nine quarters indicated:NA means data is not available.Our mission is to connect the world through games. In pursuit of our mission, we encourage entrepreneurship and intelligent risk taking to produce breakthrough innovations, which we call bold beats. The key elements of our strategy are:We design our social games to provide players with shared experiences that surprise and delight them. Our social games leverage the global connectivity and distribution on Facebook, other social networks and mobile platforms, such as Apple iOS and Google Android. Our games are free to play, span a number of genres and attract a community of players that is demographically and geographically diverse.We operate our games as live services and update them with fresh content and new features to make them more social, enhance player engagement and improve monetization. We analyze the data generated by our players game play and social interactions to guide the creation of new content and features. We use this ongoing feedback loop to keep our games compelling and enhance the player experience.Play, invest and express are player actions that we believe are central to our social games. Players generally start with a standard game board, such as a virtual island in Empires & Allies, which they then customize and personalize through their game play. We design our games to inspire and enable our players to express their personalities by customizing the appearances of their characters and building and decorating their own virtual city, farm, homestead or restaurant. Players invest time in our games in a variety of ways, such as by tending virtual crops or developing specialized skills like winemaking or baking. Through activities such as these, players advance in the game, which we refer to as leveling up. Players can choose to advance in the game by investing additional time, requesting help from their friends or purchasing virtual goods.Descriptions of some of our leading games are provided below (including MAU data as of June 30, 2011):The social design of our games is at the core of how our players experience our games. Our games encourage players to quickly connect to their friends when they start a game and to build and enhance these relationships throughout the game experience. Examples of social game play on Empires & Allies and Hanging with Friends are detailed below.Our games are free to play. In most of our games, players can earn virtual goods through game play, receive them as gifts or purchase them. Virtual goods are digital representations of real world goods, such as Big Ben in CityVille, poker chips in Zynga Poker or an aircraft carrier in Empires & Allies. Our players created more than three billion virtual goods per day on average in June 2011. Through virtual goods players are able to extend their play sessions, enhance or personalize their game environments, accelerate their progress in our games and share and trade with friends. We believe our players acquisition, gifting and purchase of virtual goods creates social interaction that increases players engagement with our games and with each other.Our primary revenue source is the sale of virtual currency that players use to buy in-game virtual goods. Some forms of virtual currency are earned through game play, while other forms can only be acquired for cash or, in some cases, by accepting promotional offers from our advertising partners. Some virtual goods, such as a virtual horse in FrontierVille, can be purchased with either form of virtual currency, while others, such as a sports car dealership in CityVille, may be purchased only with virtual currency purchased for cash.The following summary provides examples of the benefits received by players from the purchase of virtual goods:The example below illustrates when a player runs out of energy and must either wait for energy to replenish or obtain more energy. The player may ask friends for more energy or purchase additional energy using virtual currency. For example, for nine City Cash (approximately $1), a player can purchase 12 energy units instead of waiting 60 minutes for the same amount of energy.The example below illustrates how a player in FarmVille can gift a friend multiple virtual goods: an unwithering ring which unwithers crops, as well as birthday items and crops celebrating the second anniversary of FarmVilles launch.Our advertising services offer creative ways for marketers and advertisers to reach and engage with our players. The goal of engagement-based advertising is to enhance the player experience while delivering real value to advertisers. Our advertising offerings include:Other advertisers utilizing campaigns such as these have included Discover Financial Services, General Mills Inc., Kraft Foods Inc., McDonalds Corporation, Target Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.In addition to our portfolio of social games, we also offer our players network features, which provide our players real-time updates during game play on what is happening in our games and with their friends who are playing our games. These products enable our players to discover new games, connect with their friends by sending and receiving messages, collaborate with their friends by giving and receiving help to advance in a game, navigate among our games, claim rewards to level up and earn virtual currency across our portfolio of games.We believe these features better enable us to retain and increase the number of our players, cross-promote titles through viral referrals and friend invitations and increase the amount of engagement and fun for our players.These network features include the following:We have invested extensively in developing our proprietary technology stack to support the growth of our business. Our proprietary technology stack includes datacenter and cloud computing management, a shared code base, network and cross-promotional features, proprietary data analytics, monetization and internationalization. We believe that our technology stack is a competitive advantage and we will continue to innovate and optimize our stack to extend our technology leadership.Our technology stack has the ability to handle sudden bursts of activity for millions of players over a short period of time with high levels of performance and reliability. Key elements of our technology stack are described below.Our physical network infrastructure utilizes a mixture of our own datacenters and public cloud datacenters linked with high-speed networking. We utilize commodity hardware, and our architecture is designed for high availability and fault tolerance while accommodating the demands of social game play.We have developed our architecture to work effectively in a flexible cloud environment that has a high degree of elasticity. For example, our automatic provisioning tools have enabled us to add up to 1,000 servers in a 24-hour period in response to game demand. We operate at a scale that routinely delivers more than one petabyte of content per day. We intend to invest in and use more of our own infrastructure going forward, which we believe will provide us with an even better cost profile and position us to further drive operating leverage.Key to leveraging our scalable infrastructure is a comprehensive set of common technology services and systems available to all of our studios and game production engineers, game designers and product managers. These shared services include:Through our philanthropic initiative, Zynga.org, we enable our players to contribute to charitable causes by purchasing specially created virtual goods in our games. We have raised more than $10 million for donations to non-profit organizations from payments made by our players for the purchase of these virtual goods since we launched Zynga.org in October 2009. These contributions have benefitted earthquake victims, families in need of clean water and school children in Haiti; victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan; and tornado-stricken communities in Alabama. Players have donated through many of our games, including Café World, CityVille, FarmVille, FishVille, FrontierVille, Mafia Wars and Zynga Poker.We were founded on a deeply held passion for games and family and friends playing together. Our passion for play is at the core of our mission: to connect the world through games. Our mission and our core values drive everything that we do: design social games that everyone wants to play, assemble and retain talented teams, prioritize our opportunities and make investment decisions.Our core values have enabled us to scale our organization as we continue to grow rapidly and innovate a new way to play. We encourage innovation, the creation of compelling game experiences and acting quickly. These factors are critical to extending our leadership position as we seek to continue building successful franchises. We embrace ownership, meritocracy, career growth and focus on the long-term to motivate our employees and attract and retain world class game design, product management, engineering and operational talent. We remain steadfast in our commitment to surprise and delight our players. We believe our unique company culture serves as the foundation of our success. Our core values are:As of July 31, 2011, we had 2,543 full-time employees.We acquire most of our players through unpaid channels. We have been able to build a large community of players through the viral and sharing features provided by social networks, the social innovations in our games and the network effects of our business.We are committed to connecting with our players. We have fan pages, generally on Facebook, for each of our games to connect with our players; and we leverage various other forms of social media, including Twitter, to communicate with them. We periodically host live and online player events. We also use traditional advertising activities, primarily online advertising spending on Facebook.To date, we have derived substantially all of our revenue and acquired substantially all of our players through Facebook. We expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue and to acquire a substantial portion of our players from the Facebook platform for the foreseeable future. We have an addendum with Facebook that modifies Facebooks standard terms and conditions for game developers as they apply to us and that governs the promotion, distribution and operation of our games through the Facebook platform. This addendum requires the use by us of Facebook Credits as the primary payment method for our games on the Facebook platform and requires Facebook to remit to us an amount equal to 70% of the face value of Facebook Credits purchased by our players for use in our games. This addendum with Facebook expires in 2015.Our business is significantly based on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to enable them to run properly on multiple platforms. Other intellectual property we create includes audio-visual elements, including graphics, music, story lines and interface design.While most of the intellectual property we use is created by us, we have acquired rights to proprietary intellectual property. We have also obtained rights to use intellectual property through licenses and service agreements with third parties. These licenses typically limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods.We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also actively engage in monitoring and enforcement activities with respect to infringing uses of our intellectual property by third parties.In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, trade dress, domain name and patents to protect our games and other intellectual property. We typically own the copyright to the software code to our content, as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our games are marketed. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in locations outside the United States. Our registered trademarks in the United States include Zynga, the names of our games and company taglines, among others.We actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from the company and acquire patents we believe may be useful or relevant to our business. We currently own one issued U.S. patent which expires in 2021 and 112 patent applications pending worldwide.Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which our games are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business, thereby harming our operating results.Companies in the Internet, games, social media, technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. From time totime, we have faced, and we expect to face in the future, allegations by third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities, that we have infringed their trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.The social game sector is intensely competitive and is rapidly evolving. We face significant competition in all aspects of our business. Specifically, we compete for the leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of our players with other social game developers on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of player experience, brand awareness and reputation and access to distribution channels.We believe we compete favorably on these factors. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Other developers of social games could develop more compelling content that competes with our social games and adversely affects our ability to attract and retain players and their entertainment time. These competitors, including companies of which we may not be currently aware, may take advantage of social networks, access to a large user base and their network effects to grow rapidly and virally.We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the United States and internationally, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business. We are potentially subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering of certain types of content, such as that which depicts violence, many of which are ill defined, still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business or expose us to liability.In addition, rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct, such as the unauthorized dissemination of national security information, money laundering or supporting terrorist activities may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our games, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business.Some of our games are based upon traditional casino games, such as poker. We have structured and operate our poker game, Zynga Poker, with the gambling laws in mind and believe that playing Zynga Poker does not constitute gambling. We also sometimes offer our players various types of sweepstakes, giveaways and promotion opportunities. We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services could result in criminal or civil liability and could harm our business.In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to Californias Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.We are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of player data. We post our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service online, which we describe our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of player data. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws, and their application to the Internet is unclear and in a state of flux. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our players privacy and data could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of players, which could adversely affect our business.In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions have claimed and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees, or infrastructure.We lease approximately 100,000 square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California under a lease that expires in April 2012. This facility currently accommodates our principal development, engineering, marketing, business development, human resources and administrative activities. However, we have entered into a lease for approximately 345,000 square feet of office space in a nearby facility in San Francisco which, upon the substantial completion of our tenant improvements in the building, will serve as our new corporate headquarters. The lease for our new facility expires in 2018. Our finance, legal, information technology and mobile groups have already moved to space in this new location.We lease additional domestic office space in Austin, Texas; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Carlsbad, California; Dallas, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Los Gatos, California; McKinney, Texas; New York, New York; San Bruno, California; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Sunnyvale, California; and Timonium, Maryland, and we lease offices for our foreign operations in Bangalore, India; Beijing, China; Dublin, Ireland; Farnham, United Kingdom; Frankfurt, Germany; Luxembourg City, Luxembourg; Tokyo, Japan; and Toronto, Canada. These additional domestic and international facilities total approximately 275,000 square feet of general office space. We also operate several data centers in the United States pursuant to various lease agreements.We believe that our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs. We intend to add new facilities and expand our existing facilities as we add employees and expand our markets, and we believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any such expansion of our operations.From time to time, we are a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.Our executive officers and directors and their respective ages and positions as of the date hereof were as follows:Mark Pincus founded Zynga and has served as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Product Officer and Chairman since April 2007.

Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Feld, Hoffman, Katzenberg and Meresman do not have any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined under the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the listing requirements and rules of the                     . In making this determination, our board of directors considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director.Our board of directors has established an audit committee, a compensation committee, a nominating and corporate governance committee and a mergers and acquisitions committee. Our board of directors may establish other committees to facilitate the management of our business. The composition and functions of each committee are described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors.Our audit committee currently consists of Messrs. Feld, Hoffman and Meresman, each of whom, our board of directors has determined, satisfies the independence requirements under the                      listing standards and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. The chair of our audit committee is Mr. Meresman, whom our board of directors has determined is an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of the SEC regulations. Each member of our audit committee can read and understand fundamental financial statements in accordance with applicable requirements. In arriving at these determinations, the board has examined each audit committee members scope of experience and the nature of their employment in the corporate finance sector. The functions of this committee include:Our compensation committee consists of Messrs. Feld, Gordon and Katzenberg. Our board of directors has determined that each of Messrs. Feld and Katzenberg is independent under the              listing standards, is a non-employee director as defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and is an outsidedirector as that term is defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section 162(m). The chair of our compensation committee is Mr. Katzenberg. The functions of this committee include:Our nominating and corporate governance committee consists of Messrs. Gordon and Katzenberg.

The functions of this committee include:Our mergers and acquisitions committee consists of Messrs. Pincus, Schappert and Van Natta. The chair of our mergers and acquisitions committee is Mr. Pincus. The functions of this committee include:We plan to adopt a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that will apply to all of our employees, officers (including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions), agents and representatives, including directors and consultants. The full text of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics will be posted on our website at www.zynga.com. We intend to disclose future amendments to certain provisions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, or waivers of such provisions applicable to any principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller, or persons performing similar functions, and our directors, on our website identified above.None of the members of the compensation committee is currently or has been at any time one of our employees. None of our executive officers currently serves, or has served during the last year, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors or compensation committee.We do not currently provide any cash compensation to our non-employee directors. As compensation for their services, each of our non-employee directors has been granted options or restricted stock units, or ZSUs, to purchase shares of our Class B common stock under our equity incentive plans.The following table sets forth information regarding compensation earned by or paid to our non-employee directors during 2010.The compensation provided to our named executive officers for 2010 is set forth in detail in the 2010 Summary Compensation Table and other tables and the accompanying footnotes and narrative that follow this section. This section explains our executive compensation philosophy, objectives and design, our compensation-setting process, our executive compensation program components and the decisions made for compensation in respect of 2010 for each of our named executive officers.Our named executive officers for 2010 who appear in the 2010 Summary Compensation Table are:Philosophy. We operate in a new and rapidly evolving industry sector. To succeed in this environment, we must continually refine our strategy, foster the growth of our player base, increase the level of engagement of our players with our games, develop and update games, and expand our international operations. To achieve these objectives, we need to attract and retain a highly talented team of game design, engineering, marketing, business development and administrative professionals. We also expect our team to possess and demonstrate strong leadership and management capabilities.Objectives. We believe in providing a total compensation package to our executive team through a combination of base salary, discretionary bonuses, grants under our long-term equity incentive compensation plan, and severance and change of control benefits. Our executive compensation programs are designed to achieve the following objectives:Design. As a privately-held company, our executive compensation program has been heavily weighted towards equity, including stock options and restricted stock units, with cash compensation that generally fell below the 25 percentile of comparable companies. We believe that relying primarily on equity compensation has focused our executive officers on driving the achievement of our strategic and financial goals while conserving cash during our early years. We continue to believe that making equity awards a key component of executive compensation aligns the executive team with the long-term interests of our stockholders.As our company has grown, so has our need to secure executive talent from larger public companies. To do so, we have determined that it is increasingly necessary to offer significant cash compensation as well as equitycompensation. We do not affirmatively set out in any given year, or with respect to any given new hire package, to apportion compensation in any specific ratio between cash and equity, or between long-term and short-term compensation. Rather, total compensation may skew more heavily toward either cash or equity, or short-term or long-term compensation, as a result of factors described below. As we transition from being a privately-held company to a publicly-traded company, we will continue to evaluate our philosophy, objectives and design as circumstances require. At a minimum, we expect to review executive compensation annually.Role of Our Board. During 2010, our board of directors was responsible for overseeing our executive compensation program, with Mr. Feld taking the lead role in working directly with our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief People Officer. Messrs. Pincus and Van Natta, as members of the board, attended meetings of our board and actively participated in determining our executive compensation philosophy, design and amounts, but abstained from final decisions with respect to their own performance and compensation. Unless otherwise stated, the discussion and analysis below is based on decisions by the board of directors.During 2010, our board of directors considered one or more of the following factors when setting executive compensation, as further explained in the discussions of each compensation element below:We formed our compensation committee in April 2011, and it held its first meeting in April 2011. Starting in April 2011, our compensation committee will be responsible, together with our board of directors, for executive compensation decisions, including establishing our executive compensation philosophy and programs, and determining specific executive compensation, including cash and equity. Because our compensation committee was so recently formed, and with our transition to public company status, our compensation program following this offering may, over time, vary significantly from our historical practices. For example, we expect that following this offering, in setting executive compensation, the compensation committee may review and consider, in addition to the items above, factors such as the achievement of predefined milestones, tax deductibility of compensation, the total compensation that may become payable to executive officers in various hypothetical scenarios, the performance of our common stock and compensation levels at public peer companies.Role of Management. In setting compensation for 2010, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief People Officer worked closely with members of our board, particularly Messrs. Feld and Gordon, in managing our executive compensation program, including reviewing existing compensation for adjustment (as needed), determining bonus payments and establishing new hire packages. Our finance department works with our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief People Officer to gather financial and operational data that the Chief Executive Officer reviews in making his recommendations. From time to time, our Chief Financial Officer and our General Counsel attend meetings (or portions of meetings) of the board to present information and answer questions. No executive officer participated directly in the final determinations regarding the amount of any component of his or her own compensation package.Role of Compensation Consultant. Prior to this offering, neither our board nor our compensation committee had retained its own independent compensation consultant. In early 2009, we retained Compensia, a national compensation consulting firm, to assist management in reviewing human resources and compensation matters. Specifically, Compensia prepared an executive compensation assessment that analyzed the then-current cash and equity compensation of our senior management team. Compensia did not provide any services in 2010. In 2011, in preparation for this offering, Compensia was engaged to provide the following services:Compensia has been paid by us and management has had the ability to direct Compensias work. Compensia has not been present at the deliberations of the board or the compensation committee. The total cost of these services did not exceed $50,000 in any given year. Following this offering, the board and/or the compensation committee will consider retaining its own independent compensation consultant.Use of Market Compensation Data; Creation of Peer Group. Prior to 2011, we did not utilize a peer group of companies in setting compensation or benchmark our compensation to a specific level. In reviewing compensation levels for our named executive officers for 2009 and early 2010, management and members of the board referenced, as a touchstone and without specifically benchmarking to a given level, the 2009 Compensia Report. The 2009 Compensia Report analyzed the cash and equity compensation of our employees holding positions at the vice president and general manager levels and above against compensation data of other privately-held companies. In preparing this analysis, Compensia used the Advanced HROption Impact Pre-IPO Compensation Database (information technology companies with revenues of $50 million to $100 million) for equity compensation information and Compensias own proprietary pre-IPO executive compensation database (information technology companies with revenues of $50 million to $200 million) for cash compensation. The 2009 Compensia Report determined that, in 2009, the cash compensation of our senior management team, including our executive officers, was generally below the 10 percentile of the market data, and equity compensation was, on average, at the 75 percentile. Although neither management nor our board had targeted these percentiles, the conclusions of this analysis were consistent with the general design philosophy of 2009 and early 2010 that equity compensation should be the predominant component of our compensation program, with limited cash compensation.In 2010, as our business rapidly progressed and as we determined that we needed to hire executive officers with experience stemming from their work for much larger, mature public companies, management and ourboard members did not rely on the 2009 Compensia Report. Instead, we relied heavily on the reasonable business judgment of our board members and officers (which includes their knowledge and experience with the hiring of hundreds of employees by Zynga in the last two years), and negotiations with the new hire candidates, in determining compensation levels that would allow us to compete in hiring and retaining the best possible talent. Management consulted the data provided in the 2010 Radford Global Technology Survey and the PayScale database as reference points, without benchmarking to any given percentile.We expect that our compensation practices and design will change as we transition to being a public company. As part of this transition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief People Officer have been working with Compensia and our board to develop a set of peer group companies for use following this offering. Compensia has proposed a set of peer group companies, listed below, based on the software and internet industry, with revenue of between $500 million and $1.5 billion, and that are either late-stage private companies or comparable public companies. Compensia will be providing compensation data to management for these companies. While this proposed list includes peers, as determined in accordance with market standards for determining peer companies, this list does not reflect the entire set of companies that we have regularly had to compete with, and expect to continue to compete with, for hiring and retaining executive talent. Therefore, we have requested that Compensia also provide data for a second set of peer companies, listed below. We expect that management and the board will review the peer company data for these two lists as relevant data points, without necessarily benchmarking to any given level of compensation.Base Salary. We provide base salary as a fixed source of compensation for our executive officers, allowing them a degree of certainty in the face of working for a privately-held company and having a meaningful portion of their compensation at risk in the form of equity awards covering the shares of a private company. The board of directors recognizes the importance of base salaries as an element of compensation that helps to attract highly qualified executive talent.Base salaries for our executive officers were established primarily based on individual negotiations with the executive officers when they joined us and reflect the scope of their anticipated responsibilities, the individual experience they bring, the board members experiences and knowledge in compensating similarly situated individuals at other companies, our then-current cash constraints, and a general sense of internal pay equity among our executive officers.The board does not apply specific formulas in determining base salary increases. In determining base salaries for 2010 for our continuing named executive officers, no adjustments were made to the base salaries of any of our named executive officers, as the board or compensation committee determined, in their independent judgment and without reliance on any survey data, that existing base salaries, taken together with other elements of compensation, provided sufficient fixed compensation for retention purposes. For Messrs. Wehner, Van Natta and Chiang, each of whom was hired in 2010, the board established initial base salaries (and, in the case of Mr. Van Natta, his original consulting fee rate), using reasonable business judgment and without reference to survey data, based on the results of individual negotiations, the compensation packages that Messrs. Wehner and Chiang were forgoing at their then-current employers, and taking into consideration, in a general sense, the base salaries of the other executive officers and the value of the other elements of each candidates negotiated new-hire compensation package (including signing bonuses and equity awards).Cash Bonuses. Prior to this offering, our employees, including our executive officers, have been eligible to earn discretionary performance bonuses based on individual and company performance. The amount of the bonus earned, and the evaluations of individual and corporate performance, were determined in a subjective manner, without specific weightings or a formula. The overall performance of the company, as evaluated by our Chief Executive Officer and the board without reference to specific pre-established corporate goals, was the critical factor for determining payouts.Historically, we have not set target bonus amounts, expressed as a percentage of base salary or otherwise, for our executive officers, either at the time of hire or at the start of a given performance period. Each executive officer could earn an annual bonus of up to 100% of his earned base salary in a given year, which our board felt was an appropriate percentage given the relatively low base salaries of our executive officers. In connection with the recent hiring of Mr. Chiang, and consistent with the bonus opportunity provided to the other executiveofficers, the board approved an annual cash bonus target of 100% of base salary but with a guaranteed minimum payout of $400,000 (that is, 133% of base salary) for each of the first two full years of his employment. The decision to provide a guaranteed payment was made based on individual negotiations with Mr. Chiang, which reflected, in large part, the bonus and equity compensation opportunities that he was forgoing with his prior employer, the Chief Executive Officers recommendation and the boards determination of the essential need to attract and retain Mr. Chiang.For our 2010 bonus program, our Chief Executive Officer established, in consultation with the board, objectives and key results, or OKRs, for senior management. The OKRs for our Chief Executive Officer were based on overall corporate performance, and the OKRs of the other named executive officers were based on company performance within their functional unit. No amount of bonus was allocated to a specific OKR. Rather, at the end of each quarter, the Chief Executive Officer reviewed our overall performance and strategic and competitive positioning, as well as each executive officers performance, taking into account the OKRs. The Chief Executive Officer then made recommendations to Mr. Feld for the amount that should be awarded as a bonus for that quarter for each of the named executive officers, including him. For 2010, Mr. Feld concurred with the Chief Executive Officers bonus recommendations, and these recommendations were approved by the board. In addition to the specific individual factors for each executive as discussed below, in determining bonuses for 2010, the board took into account, in the first quarter and each following quarter, strong increases in bookings, in the second quarter, the successful launch of FrontierVille, in the second and third quarters, the impact on our business of changes in certain aspects of the Facebook platform and, in the fourth quarter, the successful launch of CityVille. 2010 payout levels and critical achievements and considerations for each executive were:Mark Pincus. Mr. Pincuss quarterly bonuses were $22,500, $0, $75,000 and $37,500, and reflected our success in increasing the number of players across our various games, increasing bookings each quarter and leading relationships with commercial partners.Owen Van Natta. Mr. Van Natta was not eligible for a bonus payment until he transitioned to employment status in August 2010. His bonuses of $23,077 and $25,000 for the third and fourth quarters reflected his role in providing strategic advice, identifying acquisitions and developing and enhancing relationships with commercial partners.David M. Wehner. Mr. Wehners bonuses of $34,615 and $28,125 for the third and fourth quarters reflected his success related to instituting financial planning systems, maintaining and developing relationship with investors and overseeing the acquisition and integration of companies, including Newtoy.Steven Chiang. Mr. Chiang received his guaranteed payout of $100,000 per quarter (pro-rated based on his start date for the second quarter).Reginald D. Davis. Mr. Daviss quarterly bonuses were $15,000, $25,000, $50,000 and $25,000, and reflected his role in providing corporate legal support for all acquisitions and other transactions in 2010, protecting our intellectual property in pending litigation, including the settlement discussed below and working to expand our intellectual property portfolio.Mark Vranesh. Mr. Vraneshs quarterly bonuses were $15,000, $10,000, $15,000 and $15,000, and reflected his timely completion of the 2008 and 2009 audits, his role in launching our updated tax, accounting and payment systems and his contributions toward preparing our financial operations for this offering.From time to time, the Chief Executive Officer has recommended, and the board has approved, special discretionary bonuses for significant achievements to reward superior performance. In 2010, the board approved a one-time $500,000 special bonus to Mr. Davis in recognition of his critical role in securing a company-favorable settlement of material litigation.In addition, from time to time, the Chief Executive Officer has recommended, and the board has approved, special signing bonuses in order to attract key talent. The board approved these signing bonuses based on individual negotiations which reflect, in large part, bonus and equity compensation opportunities that these executive officers were foregoing from their prior employers, the CEOs recommendations, and the boards determination of the essential need to attract and retain these executive officers. Specifically, the board approved cash signing bonuses of $1.25 million for Mr. Wehner and $2.0 million for Mr. Chiang in light of the significant compensation opportunities that each was forgoing by leaving his prior employer to join Zynga.Equity Compensation. As a privately-held company, we have historically used restricted stock units and, to a lesser extent, options as the principal component of our executive compensation program. Consistent with our compensation objectives, we believe this approach has allowed us to attract and retain key talent in our industry and aligned our executive teams contributions with the long-term interests of the company and our stockholders. We grant stock options with an exercise price not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, so these options will have value to our executive officers only if the fair market value of our common stock increases after the date of grant and the date of vesting. Typically, stock options granted to our executive officers vest over four years. Our ZSUs have historically generally included both a multi-year (generally over four years) time-based vesting condition and a liquidity event vesting condition (that is, the effectiveness of either a change in control transaction or an initial public offering), allowing them to serve as an effective retention tool while also motivating these executive officers to work toward corporate objectives that provide a meaningful return to our stockholders.In addition, our board has approved certain executive grants of options and restricted stock units containing accelerated vesting provisions upon an involuntary termination (both termination without cause and resignation for good reason) as well as upon certain material change in control transactions. Our board believes these accelerated vesting provisions reflect current market practices, based on the collective knowledge and experiences of our board members (and without reference to specific peer group data), and allow us to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers. In addition, we believe these accelerated vesting provisions will allow our executive officers to focus on closing a transaction that may be in the best interest of our stockholders even though the transaction may otherwise result in a termination of their employment and, absent such accelerated vesting, a forfeiture of their unvested equity awards. Additional information regarding accelerated vesting prior to, upon or following a change in control is discussed below under Potential Payments Upon Termination and Upon Termination and Change in Control.From time to time, we have granted to our employees generally, including our executive officers, options with an early exercise feature that allows the holder of the option to exercise and receive unvested shares of our stock, so that the executive may exercise and have a greater opportunity for gains on the shares to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates rather than ordinary income rates. Several of our executive officers hold unvested shares as a result of early exercising their option grants. Our board believes this early exercise feature reflects current market practices for private companies, based on the collective knowledge and experiences of our board members (and without reference to specific peer group data), and allows us to attract and retain highly qualified employees.In determining the form, size and material terms of executive equity awards, our board customarily considered, among other things, individual negotiations with the executive officers at their time of hire (particularly the equity opportunities they were leaving behind at their prior employers), the executive officers total compensation opportunity, the need to create a meaningful opportunity for reward predicated on the creation of long-term stockholder value, the CEOs recommendations, internal pay equity as among our executive officers, notable performance accomplishments, adjustments to duties and the retention implications of existing grants.In 2010, our board of directors made the grants to our executive officers set forth below. Due to the complexity of valuing our common stock for purposes of IRC Section 409A, our board generally granted ZSUsinstead of options. In determining the size of the equity grants in 2010, our board generally considered the CEOs recommendations, the executive officers existing equity award holdings (including the unvested portion of such awards), internal pay equity, our retention and incentive goals, and, as applicable, negotiations with the executive at the time of his hiring. In particular, the board considered the following:Mark Pincus. Consistent with Mr. Pincuss recommendation, the board determined that Mr. Pincuss existing unvested stock options (including his 2009 option grant covering 6,400,000 shares) and vested stock holdings provided the necessary motivation and retention incentive and therefore did not award any equity grants to him in 2010.Owen Van Natta. The board granted Mr. Van Natta 2,250,000 ZSUs and 6,750,000 options, including the 1,000,000 options granted to him in his role as a director. The board determined that this size of award was necessary given the other employment opportunities available to Mr. Van Natta at the time of his negotiations with the company.David M. Wehner. The board granted Mr. Wehner 2,500,000 ZSUs. The board determined that this size of award was necessary given the significant compensation opportunities Mr. Wehner was forgoing at his prior employer.Steven Chiang. The board granted Mr. Chiang 4,000,000 ZSUs. The board determined that this size of award was necessary given the significant equity compensation opportunities Mr. Chiang was forgoing at his prior employer.Reginald D. Davis. The board granted Mr. Davis two ZSU awards. The first award consisted of 573,334 ZSUs, reflecting the boards decision to provide Mr. Davis with additional awards to have his total equity rights reach 2.6 million shares, which the board determined was the appropriate level at that time for internal pay equity. The second grant consisted of 40,000 ZSUs, reflecting the boards recognition of his significant contributions toward the company-favorable settlement of material litigation in 2010.Mark Vranesh. The board granted Mr. Vranesh 200,000 ZSUs, for retention purposes, in light of his substantially vested prior awards, and reflecting his new role in 2010 as Chief Accounting Officer.In hiring our executive officers, we recognized that many of our desired candidates were leaving the security of employment with more mature companies where they had existing severance and change of control compensation rights. Accordingly, we sought to develop compensation packages that could attract qualified candidates to fill our most critical positions. At the same time, we were sensitive to the need to integrate new executive officers into our existing executive compensation structure. To achieve this balance, in 2008 and 2009, our board granted equity awards to our more senior executive officers with limited single and double trigger vesting protections (generally 25% of the award will vest on a change of control, and another 25% will vest on a subsequent termination). We believe these equity acceleration provisions will help our executive officers maintain continued focus and dedication to their responsibilities to help maximize stockholder value if there is a potential transaction that could involve a change in control of our company and a potential for the termination of their employment.In addition, as part of our negotiations with Messrs. Wehner, Van Natta and Chiang, the board approved additional cash and equity acceleration protections in the event of their involuntary terminations of employment, including but not limited to terminations following a change in control. The amount and terms of these benefits reflect the negotiations of each of the executive officers with the company, as well as a desire to reflect internal pay equity among our executive officers with respect to the acceleration rights held by our existing officers. We believe that these protections were necessary to induce these individuals to forego other opportunities or leavetheir current employment for the uncertainty of a demanding position in a new and unfamiliar organization. These benefits also encourage these executive officers to maintain continued focus and dedication to their responsibility to help maximize stockholder value in the face of decisions that are in the best interests of our stockholders but not necessarily in the executive officers own personal best interests.The initial terms and conditions of employment for each of our named executive officers are set forth in written offer letters. For a summary of the material terms and conditions of these offer letters, see Offer Letter Agreements below. For a summary of the material terms and conditions of these severance and change in control arrangements, see Potential Payments Upon Termination and Change in Control.We provide standard health, dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits to our executive officers, on the same terms and conditions as provided to all other eligible employees. Our executive officers may also participate in our broad-based 401(k) plan, which currently does not include a company match or discretionary contribution. We believe these benefits are consistent with the broad based employee benefits provided at the companies with whom we compete for talent and therefore are important to attracting and retaining qualified employees.We also provide certain perquisites to our named executive officers. In considering potential perquisites, we consider the cost to us as compared to the value of providing such perquisites. In 2010, we provided supplemental relocation compensation to both Messrs. Wehner and Chiang, recognizing that such costs were critical to our ability to attract these individuals to join us. We also covered the costs of parking at our offices for all named executive officers as well as other executives and we have leased a car for Mr. Pincus, as we believe that these benefits are consistent with the benefits offered to similarly situated executives at other companies. In 2010, we paid for certain security services for Mr. Pincus. We believe these expenses are reasonable and appropriate, consistent with expenses covered by other companies for their chief executives and in the best interest of the company and its stockholders. We provided Mr. Davis a bonus in the form of a paid two-night trip to see a concert out of town, in recognition of his dedication and long hours worked in 2009 and 2010. We have provided de minimis stipends, and related tax gross-ups, to our officers for expenses incurred in connection with certain offsite business trips, in lieu of addressing those expenses through a formal expense reimbursement process. Our board believes that these perquisites are important for attracting and retaining key talent.Deductibility of Executive Compensation. Section 162(m) of the Code limits the amount that a public company may deduct from federal income taxes for remuneration paid to executive officers (other than the chief financial officer) to one million dollars per executive officer per year, unless certain requirements are met. Section 162(m) provides an exception from this deduction limitation for certain forms of performance-based compensation, as well as for the gain recognized by executive officers upon the exercise of qualifying compensatory stock options. While our board is mindful of the benefit to us of the full deductibility of compensation, our board believes that it should not be constrained by the requirements of Section 162(m) where those requirements would impair flexibility in compensating our executive officers in a manner that can best promote our corporate objectives. We have not adopted a policy that requires that all compensation be deductible. We intend to continue to compensate our executive officers in a manner consistent with the best interests of the company and our stockholders.Taxation of Parachute Payments and Deferred Compensation. Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code provide that executive officers and directors who hold significant equity interests and certain other service providers may be subject to an excise tax if they receive payments or benefits in connection with a change in control that exceeds certain prescribed limits, and that the company, or a successor, may forfeit a deduction on the amounts subject to this additional tax. Section 409A of the Code also imposes additional significant taxes on the individual in the event that an executive officer, director or other service provider receives deferred compensation that does not meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. We did not provide any executive officer, including any named executive officer, with a gross-up or other reimbursement payment for any tax liability that he or she might owe as a result of the application of Sections 280G, 4999, or 409A of the Code during 2010, and we have not agreed and are not otherwise obligated to provide any named executive officers with such a gross-up or other reimbursement.Accounting Treatment. The accounting impact of our compensation programs is one of many factors that are considered in determining the size and structure of our programs, so that we can ensure that our compensation programs are reasonable and in the best interests of our stockholders. Authoritative accounting guidance on stock compensation requires companies to measure the compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, based on the grant date fair value of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our executive officers may never realize any value from their awards. Authoritative accounting guidance also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award.The compensation committee has not determined whether it would attempt to recover bonuses from our executive officers if the performance objectives that led to the bonus determination were to be restated, or found not to have been met to the extent originally believed by the compensation committee. However, as a public company subject to the provisions of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, if we are required as a result of misconduct to restate our financial results due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer may be legally required to reimburse us for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation they receive. In addition, we will comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and will adopt a compensation recovery policy once final regulations on the subject have been adopted.In connection with this offering, our board of directors expects to review the potential risks associated with the structure and design of our various compensation plans, including a comprehensive review of the material compensation plans and programs for all employees. Our material plans and programs operate within our larger corporate governance and review structure that serves and supports risk mitigation.The following table summarizes information regarding the compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer (who is now our Chief Accounting Officer) and our other three most highly compensated executive officers during 2010. We refer to these individuals in this prospectus as our named executive officers.The following table shows all plan-based awards granted to the named executive officers during the year ended December 31, 2010. These amounts have been adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split completed in April 2011. The equity awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2010 identified in the table below are also reported in Outstanding Equity Awards as of December 31, 2010. For additional information regarding incentive plan awards, please refer to the Executive CompensationEmployee Benefits and Stock Plans.During 2010, our board of directors issued ZSUs to certain of our named executive officers. These ZSUs, which have a term of seven years and are settled in shares of our Class B common stock, vest only upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity event-based vesting condition. The liquidity event-based vesting condition can only be satisfied upon the earlier of (a) the signing of an underwriting agreement in connection with an underwritten public offering by us of our securities that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or (b) a change of control (as defined in our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan). The service-based vesting condition can be satisfied in installments as follows: (1) the condition will be satisfied as to 1/4 of the total shares underlying the ZSU on the one year anniversary of the vesting commencement date, and (2) on each subsequent three month anniversary of the vesting commencement date (continuing for three years from the one year anniversary of the vesting commencement date) an additional 1/16th of the total shares underlying the ZSU will vest. The values included in the Stock Awards column of the 2010 Summary Compensation Table above represent the fair value of these awards based on the assumed occurrence of the vesting conditions of the awards on the date of grant.The following table presents information regarding outstanding equity awards held by our named executive officers as of December 31, 2010.The following table shows information regarding options that were exercised by our named executive officers during the year ended December 31, 2010.We do not have any defined benefit pension plans.We do not offer any nonqualified deferred compensation plans.Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in ControlThe section below describes the payments that we would have made to our named executive officers in connection with certain terminations of employment and/or certain corporate transactions like a change in control, if such events had occurred on December 31, 2010.Under the founder restricted stock purchase agreement, dated as of November 2, 2007, as amended, Mr. Pincus is entitled to acceleration of all unvested shares of restricted stock granted thereunder upon a change of control.

We do not expect to utilize our 2011 Plan until after the closing of this offering. Our 2011 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, or ISOs, within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, to our employees and any of our subsidiary corporations employees, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, or NSOs, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, or ZSUs, performance-based stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation to our employees, directors and consultants. Additionally, our 2011 Plan provides for the grant of performance cash awards to our employees, directors and consultants.Authorized Shares. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock that may be issued under our 2011 Plan is              shares, plus any shares subject to stock options, ZSUs or other stock awards granted under our 2007 Plan that expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full and shares issued pursuant to stock awards granted under our 2007 Plan that are forfeited to or repurchased by us. The maximum number of shares to be added to our 2011 Plan pursuant to the clause above is equal to              shares, as of May 31, 2011. Additionally, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2011 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2012 and continuing through and including January 1, 2021, by         % of the total number of shares of our Class A common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or such lesser number of shares of Class A common stock as determined by our board of directors.Shares may be authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of our Class A common stock. Shares subject to stock awards granted under our 2011 Plan that expire or terminate without being exercised in full, or that are paid out in cash rather than in shares, will not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under our 2011 Plan. Additionally, shares issued pursuant to stock awards under our 2011 Plan that we repurchase or that are forfeited, as well as shares used to pay the exercise price of a stock award or to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to a stock award, will become available for future grant under our 2011 Plan.Plan Administration. Our board of directors, or a duly authorized committee thereof, will administer our 2011 Plan. Our board of directors has delegated its authority to administer our 2011 Plan to our compensation committee under the terms of the compensation committees charter. Our board of directors may also delegate to one or more of our officers the authority to (i) designate employees (other than officers) to receive certain stock awards, and (ii) determine the number of shares of our Class A common stock to be subject to such stock awards. Our board of directors has delegated such authority to our Chief Executive Officer. Subject to the terms of our2011 Plan, the administrator has the authority to determine the terms of awards, including recipients, the exercise price, if any, the number of shares subject to each stock award, the fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock, the vesting schedule applicable to the awards, together with any vesting acceleration, and the form of consideration, if any, payable upon exercise of the award and the terms of the award agreement for use under our 2011 Plan.Corporate Transactions. Our 2011 Plan provides that in the event of certain specified significant corporate transactions, as defined under our 2011 Plan, each outstanding award will be treated as the administrator determines. The administrator may (i) arrange for the assumption, continuation or substitution of a stock award by a successor corporation; (ii) arrange for the assignment of any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by us to a successor corporation; (iii) accelerate the vesting of the stock award and provide for its termination prior to the transaction and arrange for the lapse of any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by us; or (iv) cancel the stock award prior to the transaction in exchange for a cash payment, which may be reduced by the exercise price payable in connection with the stock award. The plan administrator is not obligated to treat all stock awards or portions of stock awards, even those that are of the same type, in the same manner.Change in Control. The plan administrator may provide, in an individual award agreement or in any other written agreement between a participant and us, that the stock award will be subject to additional acceleration of vesting and exercisability in the event of a change in control. In the absence of such a provision, no such acceleration of the stock award will occur.Plan Amendment or Termination. Our board of directors has the authority to amend, suspend, or terminate our 2011 Plan, provided that such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant. Our 2011 Plan will terminate automatically in 2021, unless we terminate it sooner.We expect that our board and our stockholders will approve prior to the closing of this offering, our 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or our 2011 ESPP. We do not expect to utilize our 2011 ESPP until after the closing of this offering.The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock that may be issued under our 2011 ESPP is              shares. Additionally, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2011 ESPP will automatically increase on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2012 and continuing through and including January 1, 2021, by the lesser of (i)     % of the total number of shares of our Class A common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, (ii)              shares of our Class A common stock, or (iii) such lesser number of shares of Class A common stock as determined by our board of directors. Shares subject to purchase rights granted under our 2011 ESPP that terminate without having been exercised in full will not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under our 2011 ESPP.Our board of directors, or a duly authorized committee thereof, will administer our 2011 ESPP. Our board of directors has delegated its authority to administer our 2011 ESPP to our compensation committee under the terms of the compensation committees charter.Employees, including executive officers, of ours or any of our designated affiliates may have to satisfy one or more of the following service requirements before participating in our 2011 ESPP, as determined by the administrator: (i) customary employment with us or one of our affiliates for more than 20 hours per week and more than five months per calendar year, or (ii) continuous employment with us or one of our affiliates for a minimum period of time, not to exceed two years, prior to the first date of an offering. An employee may not be granted rights to purchase stock under our 2011 ESPP if such employee (i) immediately after the grant would own stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our common stock, or (ii) holds rights to purchase stock under our 2011 ESPP that would accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 worth of our stock for each calendar year that the rights remain outstanding.Our 2011 ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code. The administrator may specify offerings with a duration of not more than 27 months, and may specify one or more shorter purchase periods within each offering. Each offering will have one or more purchase dates on which shares of our Class A common stock will be purchased for the employees who are participating in the offering. The administrator, in its discretion, will determine the terms of offerings under our 2011 ESPP.Our 2011 ESPP permits participants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock through payroll deductions up to 15% of their earnings. Unless otherwise determined by the administrator, the purchase price of the shares will be 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the first day of an offering or on the date of purchase. Participants may end their participation at any time during an offering and will be paid their accrued contributions that have not yet been used to purchase shares. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with us.A participant may not transfer purchase rights under our 2011 ESPP other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as otherwise provided under our 2011 ESPP.In the event of certain specified significant corporate transactions, such as our merger or change in control, a successor corporation may assume, continue or substitute each outstanding purchase right. If the successor corporation does not assume, continue or substitute for the outstanding purchase rights, the offering in progress will be shortened and a new exercise date will be set. The participants purchase rights will be exercised on the new exercise date and such purchase rights will terminate immediately thereafter.Our board of directors has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate or 2011 ESPP, at any time and for any reason. Our 2011 ESPP will remain in effect until terminated by our board of directors in accordance with the terms of the 2011 ESPP.Our board of directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or our 2007 Plan, in November 2007. Our 2007 Plan was amended most recently in March 2011. There are 352,200,000 shares of our Class B common stock reserved for issuance under our 2007 Plan. Our 2007 Plan allows for the grant of ISOs to our employees and any of our subsidiary corporations employees, and for the grant of NSOs, restricted stock awards and ZSUs to our employees, officers, directors and consultants.As of May 31, 2011, 148,380,024 shares of Class B common stock have been issued upon the exercise of options or pursuant to stock awards granted under our 2007 Plan, options to purchase 117,316,700 shares of Class B common stock were outstanding at a weighted-average exercise price $0.86767 per share, restricted stock units covering 87,339,748 shares of Class B common stock were outstanding at a weighted-average grant date fair value of $8.86 per share, and 9,626,932 shares remained available for future grant under our 2007 Plan.Our board of directors, or a committee thereof appointed by our board of directors, administers our 2007 Plan and the awards granted under it. Our board of directors has delegated its authority to administer our 2007 Plan to our compensation committee under the terms of the compensation committees charter. Following the closing of this offering, no further stock awards will be granted under our 2007 Plan and all outstanding stock awards will continue to be governed by their existing terms. The administrator has the authority to modify outstanding stock awards under our 2007 Plan.In the event that there is a significant corporate transaction, such as a dissolution or liquidation of our company, or a merger or a change in control, the successor corporation may assume, convert, replace or substitute equivalent stock awards for the outstanding stock awards granted under our 2007 Plan and may issue substantially similar shares or other property in place of shares of our Class B common stock outstanding under our 2007 Plan, subject to repurchase rights and provisions no less favorable to the participant than those thatapplied to the shares immediately prior to the transaction.

We believe the terms of the transactions described above were comparable to terms we could have obtained in arms length dealings with unrelated third parties.We have not yet adopted a policy or set of procedures relating to the approval of transactions with related persons. Following the closing of this initial public offering, we plan to adopt a policy regarding related person transactions between us and our executive officers, directors, nominees for election as a director, beneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of our common stock and any members of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons.

Unless otherwise indicated, based on the information supplied to us by or on behalf of the selling stockholders, no selling stockholder is a broker-dealer or an affiliate of a broker-dealer.Our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership prior to this offering is based on no shares of our Class A common stock, 564,024,720 shares of our Class B common stock (including preferred stock on an as converted basis) and 20,517,472 shares of our Class C common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2011. We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership after this offering on             shares of our Class A common stock, 564,024,720 shares of our Class B common stock and 20,517,472 shares of our Class C common stock outstanding immediately after the closing of this offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option, the issuance of              shares of Class B common stock upon the vesting of ZSUs in connection with this offering and the sale of             shares of our Class A common stock by the selling stockholders).Common stock subject to stock options currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of June 30, 2011, are deemed to be outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of the person holding these options and the percentage ownership of any group of which the holder is a member but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of any other person.Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table below is c/o Zynga Inc., 444 De Haro Street, Suite 125, San Francisco, CA 94107.The following description of our capital stock and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws are summaries and are qualified by reference to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws that will be in effect upon the closing of this offering. Copies of these documents will be filed with the SEC as exhibits to our registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part. The descriptions of the common stock and preferred stock reflect changes to our capital structure that will be in effect upon the closing of this offering.Upon the closing of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide for three classes of common stock: Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize shares of undesignated preferred stock, the rights, preferences and privileges of which may be designated from time to time by our board of directors.Upon the closing of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist of             shares, all with a par value of $0.00000625 per share, of which:As of March 31, 2011, we had outstanding 562,466,698 shares of Class B common stock, which assumes the conversion of 302,978,712 outstanding shares of preferred stock into shares of Class B common stock immediately prior to the closing of this offering.

Holders of shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of stockholders. In addition, our Class B common stock and Class C common stock will vote together as a separate class in the following circumstances:We have not provided for cumulative voting for the election of directors in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.Except as otherwise expressly provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or required by applicable law, all shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and be identical in all respects as to all matters, including, without limitation those described below.Dividends and Distributions. Subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will be entitled to share equally, identically and ratably, on a per share basis, with respect to any dividend or distribution of cash or property paid or distributed by the Company, unless different treatment of the shares of the affected class is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such affected class, voting separately as a class.Liquidation Rights. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will be entitled to share equally, identically and ratably in all assets remaining after the payment of any liabilities and the liquidation preferences and any accrued or declared but unpaid dividends, if any, with respect to any outstanding preferred stock, unless different treatment of the shares of the affected class is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such affected class, voting separately as a class.Change of Control Transactions. Upon (a) the closing of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, (b) the consummation of a merger, reorganization, consolidation or share transfer which results in our voting securities outstanding immediately prior to the transaction (or the voting securities issued with respect to our voting securities outstanding immediately prior to the transaction) representing less than a majority of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the company or the surviving or acquiring entity, or (c) the closing of the transfer (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons of securities of the company if, after closing, the transferee person or group would hold 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the company (or the surviving or acquiring entity), the holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will be treated equally and identically with respect to shares of Class A common Stock, Class B common stock or Class C common stock owned by them, unless different treatment of the shares of each class is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the class treated differently, voting separately as a class.Subdivisions and Combinations. If we subdivide or combine in any manner outstanding shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C common stock, the outstanding shares of the other classes need not be subdivided or combined in the same manner.Each share of Class B common stock and Class C common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock. In addition, after the closing of this offering, upon any transfer of shares of either Class B common stock or Class C common stock, whether or not for value, each such transferred share shall automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock, except for certain transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including, without limitation, transfers for tax and estate planning purposes, so long as the transferring holder continues to hold sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares transferred.Our Class B common stock and Class C common stock will convert automatically into Class A common stock on the date on which the number of outstanding shares of Class B common stock and Class C common stock together represent less than 10% of the aggregate combined voting power of our capital stock.Once transferred and converted into Class A common stock, the Class B common stock and the Class C common stock may not be reissued.As of March 31, 2011, there were 302,978,712 shares of our preferred stock outstanding. Immediately prior to the closing of this offering, each outstanding share of our preferred stock will convert into one share of our Class B common stock.Upon the closing of this offering, our board of directors may, without further action by our stockholders, fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of up to an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and authorize their issuance. These rights, preferences and privileges could include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C common stock. Any issuance of our preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C common stock and the likelihood that such holders would receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control or other corporate action. Upon the closing of this offering, no shares of preferred stock will be outstanding, and we have no present plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.We are party to an investors rights agreement which provides that holders of our preferred stock, including certain holders of 5% of our capital stock and entities affiliated with certain of our directors, have certain registration rights, as set forth below. This investors rights agreement was entered into in November 2007 and has been amended and restated from time to time in connection with our preferred stock financings. The registration of shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of registration rights described below would enable the holders to sell these shares without restriction under the Securities Act when the applicable registration statement was declared effective. We will pay the registration expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, of the shares registered pursuant to the demand, piggyback and Form S-3 registrations described below.Generally, in an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter, if any, has the right, subject to specified conditions, to limit the number of shares such holders may include. The demand, piggyback and Form S-3 registration rights described below will expire two years after the effective date of the registration statement, ofwhich this prospectus is a part, or with respect to any particular stockholder, the earlier of (a) 18 months after the effective date of the registration statement and (b) such time that, in the opinion of counsel, that stockholder can sell all of its shares under Rule 144 of the Securities Act during any three-month period.The holders of an aggregate of                      shares of our Class B common stock (including shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding preferred stock except Series Z preferred stock) and without giving effect to the sale of shares in this offering by the selling stockholders, will be entitled to certain demand registration rights. At any time beginning 180 days after the closing of this offering, the holders of at least 50% of these shares may, on not more than one occasion, request that we register all or a portion of their shares. Such request for registration must cover 25% of such shares then outstanding.In connection with this offering, the holders of an aggregate of                  shares of our Class B common stock (including shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding preferred stock except Series Z preferred stock), were entitled to, and the necessary percentage of holders waived, their rights to notice of this offering and to include their shares of registrable securities in this offering. In the event that we propose to register any of our securities under the Securities Act, either for our own account or for the account of other security holders, the holders of these shares will be entitled to certain piggyback registration rights allowing the holder to include their shares in such registration, subject to certain marketing and other limitations. As a result, whenever we propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act, other than with respect to a demand registration or a registration statement on Forms S-4 or S-8, the holders of these shares are entitled to notice of the registration and have the right, subject to limitations that the underwriters may impose on the number of shares included in the offering, to include their shares in the registration.The holders of an aggregate of                          shares of Class B common stock (including shares issuable upon conversion of our outstanding preferred stock except Series Z preferred stock), and without giving effect to the sale of shares in this offering by the selling stockholders, will be entitled to certain Form S-3 registration rights. The holders of these shares can make a request that we register their shares on Form S-3 if we are qualified to file a registration statement on Form S-3 and if the reasonably anticipated aggregate gross proceeds of the shares offered would equal or exceed $6,000,000. We will not be required to effect more than one registration on Form S-3 within any 12-month period.Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to be in Effect Upon the Closing of this OfferingBecause our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights, stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of our shares of common stock will be able to elect all of our directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws to be effective upon the closing of this offering will provide that all stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called meeting of stockholders. A special meeting of stockholders may be called by holders of a majority of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock, voting together as a single class, or by the majority of our whole board of directors, chair of the board of directors or by our chief executive officer. Our amended and restated bylaws will establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors.As described above in Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common StockVoting Rights, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will further provide for a three-classcommon stock structure, which provides Mr. Pincus, our Chief Executive Officer and other stockholders who held our stock prior to this offering, including our other executive officers, directors and affiliates, with significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets.The foregoing provisions will make it more difficult for our existing stockholders to replace our board of directors as well as for another party to obtain control of us by replacing our board of directors. Since our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our officers, these provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management. In addition, the authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change our control.These provisions, including the three-class structure of our common stock, are intended to enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and its policies and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened acquisition of us. These provisions are also designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in our control or management. As a consequence, these provisions also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, with the following exceptions:In general, Section 203 defines business combination to include the following:In general, Section 203 defines an interested stockholder as an entity or person who, together with the persons affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, or within three years prior to the time of determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, any action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.See the section titled Executive CompensationLimitation on Liability and Indemnification.We intend to apply to have our common stock approved for listing on                     under the symbol         .Upon the closing of this offering, the transfer agent and registrar for our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will be             .Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our capital stock. Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale in the public market, could adversely affect market prices prevailing from time to time. As described below, only a limited number of shares will be available for sale shortly after this offering due to contractual and legal restrictions on resale. Nevertheless, sales of our Class A common stock in the public market after such restrictions lapse, or the perception that those sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price at such time and our ability to raise equity capital in the future.Based on the number of shares outstanding as of March 31, 2011, upon the closing of this offering, shares of Class A common stock,                      Class B common stock and 20,517,472 shares of Class C common stock will be outstanding, assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option, no exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the issuance of              shares of Class B common stock upon the vesting of ZSUs in connection with this offering and the conversion of the shares sold by the selling stockholders in this offering into shares of Class A common stock. Of the outstanding shares, all of the shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable, except that any shares held by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, may only be sold in compliance with the limitations described below.The remaining              shares of our Class B common stock outstanding after this offering are restricted securities as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act and/or are subject to lock-up agreements with us as described below. Following the expiration of the lock-up period, restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 or 701 promulgated under the Securities Act, described in greater detail below.In general, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the 90 days preceding, a sale and (ii) we have been subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, periodic reporting requirements for at least 90 days before the sale. Persons who have beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or any time during the 90 days preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of either of the following:Provided, in each case, that we have been subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least 90 days before the sale. Such sales both by affiliates and by non-affiliates must also comply with the manner of sale, current public information and notice provisions of Rule 144.Rule 701 under the Securities Act, as in effect on the date of this prospectus, permits resales of shares in reliance upon Rule 144 but without compliance with certain restrictions of Rule 144, including the holding period requirement. Most of our employees, executive officers, directors or consultants who purchased shares under a written compensatory plan or contract may be entitled to rely on the resale provisions of Rule 701, but all holdersof Rule 701 shares are required to wait until 90 days after the date of this prospectus before selling their shares. However, substantially all Rule 701 shares are subject to lock-up agreements as described below and under Underwriting and will become eligible for sale at the expiration of those agreements.We have agreed with the underwriters that for a period of             days following the date of this prospectus, we will not offer, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of or hedge any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock, subject to specified exceptions. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co. may, in their sole discretion, at any time, release all or any portion of the shares from the restrictions in such agreement.The restricted period described in the preceding paragraph will be extended if:The holders of substantially all of our capital stock have entered into lock-up agreements with us which provide that they will not offer, sell or transfer any shares of our common stock beneficially owned by them for              days following the date of this prospectus.Employees can only sell vested shares. Employees who do not hold vested shares, including shares subject to options, upon expiration of these selling restrictions will not be able to sell shares until they vest.On the date beginning              days after the date of this prospectus, the holders of approximately                  shares of our Class B common stock, or their transferees, will be entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of those shares under the Securities Act.

This discussion is not a complete analysis of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences relating thereto, nor does it address any estate and gift tax consequences or any tax consequences arising under any state, local or foreign tax laws, or any other United States federal tax laws. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, all as in effect as of the date of this offering. These authorities may change, possibly retroactively, resulting in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS with respect to the matters discussed below, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary position regarding the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of our Class A common stock, or that any such contrary position would not be sustained by a court.This discussion is limited to non-U.S. holders who purchase our Class A common stock issued pursuant to this offering and who hold our Class A common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a particular holder in light of such holders particular circumstances. This discussion also does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may be relevant to holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, partnerships or other pass-through entities, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, banks, financial institutions, investment funds, insurance companies, brokers, dealers or traders in securities, commodities or currencies, tax-exempt organizations, tax-qualified retirement plans, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons that own, or have owned, actually or constructively, more than 5% of our common stock and persons holding our common stock as part of a hedging or conversion transaction or straddle, or a constructive sale, or other risk reduction strategy.PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ACQUIRING, OWNING AND DISPOSING OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS AND ANY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS.For purposes of this discussion, a non-U.S. holder is any beneficial owner of our Class A common stock that is not a U.S. person or a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. person is any of the following:If we make cash or other property distributions on our Class A common stock, such distributions will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Amounts not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes will constitute a return of capital and will first be applied against and reduce a holders tax basis in the Class A common stock, but not below zero. Any excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the Class A common stock and will be treated as described under Gain on Disposition of Our Class A Common Stock below.Dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder of our Class A common stock generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividends, or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty. To receive the benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a non-U.S. holder must furnish to us or our paying agent a valid IRS Form W-8BEN (or applicable successor form) including a U.S. taxpayer identification number and certifying such holders qualification for the reduced rate. Treasury Regulations or the applicable treaty will provide rates to determine whether dividends paid to an entity should be treated as paid to the entity or the entitys owners. This certification must be provided to us or our paying agent prior to the payment of dividends and must be updated periodically. If the non-U.S. holder holds the stock through a financial institution or other agent acting on the non-U.S. holders behalf, the non-U.S. holder will be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent, which then will be required to provide certification to us or our paying agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. Non-U.S. holders that do not timely provide us or our paying agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced treaty rate, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.If a non-U.S. holder holds our Class A common stock in connection with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and dividends paid on the Class A common stock are effectively connected with such holders U.S. trade or business, the non-U.S. holder will be exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax. To claim the exemption, the non-U.S. holder must generally furnish to us or our paying agent a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI (or applicable successor form).Any dividends paid on our Class A common stock that are effectively connected with a non-U.S. holders United States trade or business (and if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States) generally will be subject to United States federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in much the same manner as if such holder were a resident of the United States. A non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items. Non-U.S. holders should consult any applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.Gain on Disposition of Our Class A Common StockSubject to the discussion below regarding backup withholding and certain recently enacted legislation, a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our Class A common stock, unless:Gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such holder were a resident of the United States. A non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items. Non-U.S. holders should consult any applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.Gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat 30% rate (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), but may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided that the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.We must report annually to the IRS and to each non-U.S. holder the amount of dividends on our Class A common stock paid to such holder and the amount of any tax withheld with respect to those dividends. These information reporting requirements apply even if no withholding was required because the dividends were effectively connected with the holders conduct of a U.S. trade or business, or withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty. This information also may be made available under a specific treaty or agreement with the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. Backup withholding, currently at a 28% rate, however, generally will apply to payments to a non-U.S. holder of dividends on or the gross proceeds or a disposition of our Class A common stock provided the non-U.S. holder furnishes to us or our paying agent the required certification as to its non-U.S. status, such as by providing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8ECI, or certain other requirements are met. Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding may apply if either we or our paying agent has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the holder is a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient.Backup withholding is not an additional tax. If any amount is withheld under the backup withholding rules, the non-U.S. holder should consult with a U.S. tax advisor regarding the possibility of and procedure for obtaining a refund or a credit against the non-U.S. holders U.S. federal income tax liability, if any.Recently Enacted Legislation Affecting Taxation of Our Class A Common Stock Held by or through Foreign EntitiesRecently enacted legislation generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our common stock paid after December 31, 2012 to a foreign financial institution (as specially defined under these rules) unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners). The legislation also generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our common stock paid after December 31, 2012 to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity. Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. Prospective investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in our common stock.Under the terms and subject to the conditions in an underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus, the underwriters named below, for whom Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are acting as representatives, have severally agreed to purchase, and we and the selling stockholders have agreed to sell to them, severally, the number of shares indicated below:The underwriters are offering the shares of Class A common stock subject to their acceptance of the shares from us and the selling stockholders and subject to prior sale. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the several underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the shares of Class A common stock offered by this prospectus are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to take and pay for all of the shares of Class A common stock offered by this prospectus if any such shares are taken. The offering of the shares by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters right to reject any order in whole or in part. In addition, the underwriters are not required to take or pay for the shares covered by the underwriters over-allotment option described below.The underwriters initially propose to offer part of the shares of Class A common stock directly to the public at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus and part to certain dealers. After the initial offering of the shares of Class A common stock, the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the representatives.We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to             additional shares of Class A common stock at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters may exercise this option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, made in connection with the offering of the shares of Class A common stock offered by this prospectus. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter will become obligated, subject to certain conditions, to purchase approximately the same percentage of the additional shares of Class A common stock as the number of shares listed next to the underwriters name in the preceding table bears to the total number of shares of Class A common stock listed next to the names of all underwriters in the preceding table.The following table shows the per share and total public offering price, underwriting discounts and commissions, and proceeds before expenses to us and the selling stockholders. These amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase up to an additional             shares of Class A common stock.The estimated offering expenses payable by us, exclusive of the underwriting discounts and commissions, are approximately $        .The underwriters have informed us that they do not intend sales to discretionary accounts to exceed 5% of the total number of shares of Class A common stock offered by them.We have applied to list our Class A common stock on the                     under the trading symbol         .We have agreed that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of the underwriters, we will not, during the period ending             days after the date of this prospectus, subject to certain exceptions:whether any such transaction described above is to be settled by delivery of common stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise.The              restricted period described in the preceding paragraph will be extended if:in which case the restrictions described in the preceding paragraph will continue to apply until the expiration of the 18 day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or material event.In order to facilitate the offering of the Class A common stock, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Class A common stock. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more shares than they are obligated to purchase under the underwriting agreement, creating a short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no greater than the number of shares available for purchase by the underwriters under the over-allotment option. The underwriters can close out a covered short sale by exercising the over-allotment option or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out a covered short sale, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the open market priceof shares compared to the price available under the over-allotment option. The underwriters may also sell shares in excess of the over-allotment option, creating a naked short position. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Class A common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. As an additional means of facilitating this offering, the underwriters may bid for, and purchase, shares of Class A common stock in the open market to stabilize the price of the Class A common stock. These activities may raise or maintain the market price of the Class A common stock above independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of the Class A common stock. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions.We, the selling stockholders and the underwriters have agreed to severally indemnify each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on websites maintained by one or more underwriters, or selling group members, if any, participating in this offering. The representatives may agree to allocate a number of shares of Class A common stock to underwriters for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the representatives to underwriters that may make Internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations.The estimated initial public offering price range set forth on the cover page of this preliminary prospectus is subject to change as a result of market conditions and other factors. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the shares will sell in the public market after this offering will not be lower than the initial public offering price or that an active trading market in our Class A common stock will develop and continue after this offering.The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for the issuer, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the underwriters or their affiliates are lenders under our credit facility.In February 2011, eleven mutual funds affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, one of the lead bookrunning managers, purchased 5,346,026 shares of our Series C preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of $75,000,014. As part of the transaction, the funds entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Investors Rights Agreement. The shares of Series C preferred stock that the funds own will convert upon the closing of this offering into 5,346,026 shares of Class B common stock.Allen & Company LLC, one of the underwriters in the offering, has provided financial advisory services to us in the past for which it has received customary fees, including most recently a $4.65 million placement agency fee in connection with our Series C preferred stock financing in February 2011.In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the issuer. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the shares of Class A common stock. The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiations between us and the representatives. Among the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price will be our future prospects and those of our industry in general, our sales, earnings and certain other financial and operating information in recent periods, and the price-earnings ratios, price-sales ratios, market prices of securities, and certain financial and operating information of companies engaged in activities similar to ours.In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive, each underwriter has represented and agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Member State it has not made and will not make an offer of securities to the public in that Member State, except that it may, with effect from and including such date, make an offer of securities to the public in that Member State:(a) at any time to legal entities which are authorised or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorised or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities;(b) at any time to any legal entity which has two or more of (1) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year; (2) a total balance sheet of more than 43,000,000 and (3) an annual net turnover of more than 50,000,000, as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts; or(c) at any time in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by us of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.For the purposes of the above, the expression an offer of securities to the public in relation to any securities in any Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the securities, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State, and the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in that Member State.This prospectus and any other material in relation to the shares described herein is only being distributed to, and is only directed at, persons in the United Kingdom that are qualified investors within the meaning of Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospective Directive (qualified investors) that also (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended, or the Order, (ii) who fall within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order or (iii) to whom it may otherwise lawfully be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as relevant persons).

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Part II, Item 16.(b). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Zynga Inc. at December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.Zynga Inc.

In managements opinion, the unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the Companys statement of financial position as of March 31, 2011 and its results of operations and its cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2011 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year.Upon the completion of the Companys initial public offering, all outstanding convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into shares of the Companys common stock. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet gives effect to the conversion of the convertible preferred stock as of March 31, 2011. Additionally, we grant Zynga restricted stock units (ZSUs) that generally vest upon the satisfaction of a service period criteria and the occurrence of a qualifying liquidity event. This initial public offering will satisfy the liquidity event criteria. As a result, the unaudited pro forma balance sheet gives effect to the stock-based compensation associated with the ZSUs that would have been recorded had the initial public offering occurred on March 31, 2011. This pro forma adjustment was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings (deficit) and an increase to additional paid-in capital. We intend to net settle the ZSUs that vest in connection with the initial public offering in order to satisfy the related tax withholding obligations. The number of ZSUs to be repurchased is based on the applicable withholding rates, and an assumed initial public offering price of $         per share. The amount and number of ZSUs that will be repurchased will be reflected as an increase to pro forma treasury stock once the range of our initial public offering price is determined.The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The consolidated financial statements include the operations of Zynga and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in the financial statements include, but are not limited to, the estimated lives and playing periods that we use for revenue recognition, the chargeback reserve for our third-party payment processors, the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets, accrued liabilities, income taxes, fair value of stock awards issued, accounting for business combinations, and evaluating goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.We have one operating segment with one business activity, developing and monetizing social games. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), our Chief Executive Officer, manages our operations on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources. When evaluating performance and allocating resources, the CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated bookings information for our online games.We derive revenue from the sale of virtual goods associated with our online games and the sale of advertising within our games.We operate our games as live services that allow players to play for free. Within these games, players can purchase virtual currency to obtain virtual goods to enhance their game-playing experience. Players can pay for our virtual currency using Facebook Credits when playing our games through the Facebook platform, and can use other payment methods such as credit cards or PayPal on other platforms. We also sell game cards that are initially recorded as a customer deposit liability which is included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, net of fees retained by retailers and distributors. Upon redemption of a game card in one of our games and delivery of the purchased virtual currency to the player, these amounts are reclassified to deferred revenue.We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the player; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the player is fixed or determinable. For purposes of determining when the service has been provided to the player, we have determined that an implied obligation exists to the paying player to continue displaying the purchased virtual goods within the online game over their estimated life or until they are consumed. The proceeds from the sale of virtual goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue. We categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action. For the sale of consumable virtual goods, we recognize revenue as the goods are consumed, which approximates one month. Durable virtual goods represent virtual goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time. We recognize revenue from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the estimated average playing period of paying players for the applicable game, which represents our best estimate of the estimated average life of durable virtual goods. If we do not have the ability to differentiate revenue attributable to durable virtual goods from consumable virtual goods for a specific game we recognize revenue on the sale of durable and consumable virtual goods for that game ratably over the estimated average period that paying players typically play that game.Prior to October 1, 2009, we did not have the data to determine the consumption dates for our consumable virtual goods or to differentiate revenue attributable to durable virtual goods from consumable virtual goods. Beginning in October 2009, we had sufficient data to separately account for consumable and durable virtual goods in one of our games, thus allowing us to recognize revenue related to consumable goods upon consumption. Since January 2010, we have had this data for substantially all of our games thus allowing us to recognize revenue related to consumable goods upon consumption. Future usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns and therefore the estimated average playing periods may change in the future. We assess the estimated average playing period for paying players and the estimated average life of our virtual goods quarterly. We estimate chargebacks from our third-party payment processors to account for potential future chargebacks based on historical data and record such amounts as a reduction of revenue.In May 2010, we entered into an agreement with Facebook that required us to accept Facebook Credits as the primary in-game payment method for our games played through the Facebook platform. The agreement required us to begin migrating our games to Facebook Credits in our games beginning in July 2010, and by April 2011 this migration was complete. Facebook Credits is Facebooks proprietary virtual currency that Facebook sells for use on the Facebook platform. Under the terms of our agreement, Facebook sets the price our players pay for Facebook Credits and collects the cash from the sale of Facebook Credits. Facebooks current stated face value of a Facebook Credit is $0.10. For each Facebook Credit purchased by our players and redeemed in our games, Facebook remits to us $0.07, which is the amount we recognize as revenue. We recognize revenue net of the amounts retained by Facebook because we do not set the pricing of Facebook Credits sold to our players. Prior to the implementation of Facebook Credits in our games, players could purchase our virtual goods through various widely accepted payment methods offered in the games and we recognized revenue based on the transaction price paid by the player.We have contractual relationships with agencies, advertising brokers and certain advertisers for advertisements within our games. We recognize advertising revenue for branded virtual goods and sponsorships, engagement advertisements and offers, mobile advertisements and other advertisements as advertisements are delivered to customers as long as evidence of the arrangement exists (executed contract), the price is fixed or determinable, and we have assessed collectability as reasonably assured. Certain branded in-game sponsorships that involve virtual goods are deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the branded virtual good, similar to online game revenue.We report our advertising revenue net of amounts due to advertising agencies and brokers because we are not the primary obligor in our arrangements, we do not set the pricing, and we do not establish or maintain the relationship with the advertiser.We offer certain promotions to customers from time to time that include the sale of in-game virtual currency via the sale of a game card and also other deliverables such as a limited edition in-game virtual good. In addition, we may enter into arrangements with customers to sell in-game branded advertising services that include one specified fee that covers various campaign dates across various games.For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, and for the three months ended March 31, 2011, such arrangements were not material. Beginning on January 1, 2011, we adopted new authoritative guidance on multiple-element arrangements, using the prospective method for all arrangements entered into or materially modified from the date of adoption. Under this new guidance, we allocate arrangement consideration in multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price. There was no material impact on our financial statements as a result of implementing this newly adopted authoritative guidance in the three months ended March 31, 2011.The following table presents the components of revenue (in thousands):Amounts recorded as cost of revenue relate to direct expenses incurred in order to generate online game revenue. Such costs are recorded as incurred. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of hosting and data center costs related to operating our games, including depreciation; consulting costs primarily related to third-party provisioning of customer support services; payment processing fees; and salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our customer support and infrastructure teams. Cost of revenue also includes amortization expense related to purchased technology of $2.1 million, $2.3 million and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, and $0.4 million (unaudited) and $6.1 million (unaudited) for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $1.9 million related to purchased technology that was no longer utilized in our operations.Cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, money market funds, and U.S. government-issued obligations with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase.Marketable securities consist entirely of U.S. government-issued obligations maturing within one year of the purchase date. The fair value of marketable securities is determined as the exit price in the principal market in which we would transact. Based on our intentions regarding our marketable securities, all marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of income taxes. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific-identification method and are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations when they are realized. When we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security is written down to the fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is accounted for as a realized loss in other income (expense). The new cost basis will not be adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Determination of whether declines in fair value are other than temporary requires judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery. No such impairments of marketable securities have been recorded to date.Restricted cash consists of collateral for facility operating lease agreements and funds held in escrow in accordance with the terms of certain of our business acquisition agreements.Accounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We review accounts receivable regularly and make estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts when there is doubt as to our ability to collect individual balances. In evaluating our ability to collect outstanding receivable balances, we consider many factors, including the age of the balance, the customers payment history and current creditworthiness, and current economic trends. Bad debts are written off after all collection efforts have ceased. We do not require collateral from our customers.Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 24 to 36 months. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease term.We account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of the acquisition to the tangible assets, liabilities, and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost and are evaluated annually for impairment, or more frequently if circumstances exist which indicate that an impairment may exist. No impairment charges have been recorded to date.Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 12 to 24 months.Long-lived assets, including other intangible assets (excluding indefinite-lived intangible assets), are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying value may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of the long-lived assets by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated fair value calculated based on the undiscounted cash flow associated with the related assets. If the future net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are considered impaired and an expense, equal to the amount required to reduce the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated fair value, is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage relating to the development of our websites, online games, and computer software developed or purchased for internal use. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. We capitalized $0, $0 and $1.4 million in software development costs for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Once placed into service, we anticipate amortizing these costs over a period of three years. Prior to 2010, costs incurred during the application development stage were not material and were expensed as incurred.We grant ZSUs to our employees that generally vest upon the satisfaction of service period criteria of up to four years and a performance condition. The ZSUs have a contractual term of seven years. Because the performance condition is not met until the occurrence of a qualifying liquidity event (initial public offering or change of control), no expense has been recorded to date relating to our ZSU grants. At the time of a qualifying liquidity event, we will record stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the awards using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures.In 2010, we issued unvested Series Z preferred stock to employees of certain acquired companies. As the equity awards are subject to post-acquisition employment, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the Series Z preferred stock on a straight-line basis over the four-year service period, net of estimated forfeitures.We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires the use of the following assumptions: (i) expected volatility of our common stock, which is based on our peer group in the industry in which we do business; (ii) expected life of the option award, which we elected to calculate using the simplified method; (iii) expected dividend yield, which is 0%, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock; and (iv) the risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with maturities equal to the grants expected life. Option grants generally vest over four years, with 25% vesting after one year and the remainder vesting monthly thereafter over 36 months. The options have a contractual term of 10 years.Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures so that expense is recorded for only those stock-based awards that we expect to vest. We estimate forfeitures based on our historical forfeiture of equity awards adjusted to reflect future changes in facts and circumstances, if any. We will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates. We record stock-based compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting term.For stock options issued to non-employees, including consultants, we record expense related to stock options equal to the fair value of the options calculated using the Black-Scholes model over the service performance period. The fair value of options granted to non-employees is remeasured over the vesting period and recognized as an expense over the period the services are received.We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in taxlaws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based on available evidence. We account for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.Generally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. For these subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and foreign currency denominated nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. Foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. For foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the local currency, we use current period-end exchange rates to translate assets and liabilities, and average exchange rates to translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders equity.Financial instruments, which potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities are maintained with four financial institutions with high credit standings. We perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these institutions, and all of our short-term marketable securities are held in U.S. government debt instruments.Accounts receivable are unsecured and represent amounts due to us based on contractual obligations where a signed and executed contract or click-through agreement exists. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers to assess the probability of accounts receivable collection. In cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customers ability to meet its financial obligations, we record a specific allowance as a reduction to the accounts receivable balance to reduce it to its net realizable value.An advertising customer represented 28% of gross accounts receivable at December 31, 2009, and 15% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009.A substantial majority of our 2008, 2009 and 2010 revenue was generated from players who accessed our games through Facebook. As of December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, 69% and 82% (unaudited) of our accounts receivable were amounts owed to us by Facebook, respectively.Costs for advertising are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs, which are included in sales and marketing expense, primarily consisting of player acquisition costs, totaled $9.2 million, $35.6 million and $83.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.We have restated our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2011 and for the three months then ended to reflect a correction in our accounting policy to properly apply changes in our estimated average playing period for paying players for two of our games. Prior to the restatement, in the three monthsended March 31, 2011, we applied our then most current estimate of average playing period for paying players to current period sales but did not adjust the ending balance of deferred revenue for the revised estimated playing periods for related sales from prior periods. The impact of this restatement was to increase revenue by $7.5 million and increase the provision for income taxes by $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and decrease deferred revenue by $7.5 million as of March 31, 2011.The following table presents the effects of the adjustments made to our previously reported consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2011 (in thousands):The following table presents the effects of the adjustments made to the Companys previously reported consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 (in thousands, except per share data):The adjustments did not effect previously reported cash flows from operations, investing activities or financing activities.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of the following (in thousands):The following table summarizes unrealized gains and losses related to our available-for-sale investments in marketable securities as of December 31, 2009 and 2010 and March 31, 2011 (in thousands):Our financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Accounts receivable, net, are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to expected receipt of cash.Cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, consisting of money market funds and U.S. government debt securities, are carried at fair value, which is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable and willing market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that knowledgeable and willing market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. We use a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:Level 1  Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2  Includes other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.The composition of our securities among the three levels of the fair value hierarchy is as follows at December 31, 2009 and 2010 and March 31, 2011 (unaudited), respectively (in thousands):Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):Depreciation expense relating to property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was $0.8 million, $8.0 million, and $30.6 million, respectively.In line with our growth strategy, we completed seven acquisitions in 2010. The purpose of these acquisitions was to expand our social games offerings, obtain employee talent, and expand into new international markets. The results of operations for each of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated statement of operations since the date of acquisition. Goodwill for each of the acquisitions represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisitions is primarily attributable to the assembled workforces of the acquired businesses and the synergies expected to arise after our acquisition of those businesses.In November 2010, we completed our acquisition of Newtoy, Inc., a provider of online mobile gaming services. The purchase price was $53.3 million, consisting of the issuance of 1.4 million fully vested shares of Series Z convertible preferred stock with a fair value of $8.9 million and $44.3 million in cash.During 2010, we acquired six additional companies and these acquisitions were not individually significant. In the aggregate, the total purchase price for these acquisitions was $48.4 million, which consisted of the issuance of 4.1 million shares of Series Z convertible preferred stock with a fair value of $26.3 million, and $22.1 million in cash. In connection with our 2010 acquisitions, we incurred transaction costs of $2.1 million that we expensed as incurred.To retain the services of certain former acquired company employees, we offered equity awards and cash bonuses that are earned over time. As these equity awards and payments are subject to post-acquisition employment, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition compensation expense. During 2010, we issued 21.1 million shares of non-vested Series Z convertible preferred stock with a total fair value of $135.8 million and 6.3 million ZSUs with a total fair value of $39.7 million. We paid retention and incentive cash bonuses totaling $6.7 million.The following table summarizes our unaudited pro forma revenue and net income (loss) of the combined company for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010 if we had made all of our 2010 acquisitions on January 1, 2009 and January 1, 2010, respectively (in thousands):For the three months ended March 31, 2011 we acquired four companies to expand our online social game and mobile offerings and our software development and engineering teams. These acquisitions were not individually significant and had an aggregate purchase price of $10.5 million. As a result of the acquisitions, we recorded $0.2 million of developed technology, $0.4 million of net assets acquired, and $9.9 million of goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. In connection with acquisitions closed in the three months ended March 31, 2011, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $0.4 million. Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisitions is primarily attributable to the assembled workforces of the acquired businesses and the synergies expected to arise after our acquisition of those businesses. The weighted average useful life of the identified acquired intangible assets is one year. Pro forma results of operations related to our 2011 acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to our consolidated statements of operations, either individually or in the aggregate.The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for all business acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2010 and for the three months ended March 31, 2011 (in thousands):Included in net assets acquired in the table above relating to 2010 acquisitions are $11.2 million of net deferred tax liabilities. Developed technologies associated with acquisitions are being amortized over periods ranging from 12 to 24 months. The weighted-average useful life for our developed technology was approximately 1.9 years.The purchase price allocations for our acquisitions during the three months ended March 31, 2011 were based upon a preliminary valuation estimate. These allocations may change as we finalize the estimates and assumptions associated with these valuations.Trademarks acquired through the Newtoy acquisition are estimated to have an indefinite useful life and will be evaluated annually for impairment, or more frequently, if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist.From inception to 2009, there were no additions to goodwill. Changes in the carrying value of goodwill for 2010 and the three months ended March 31, 2011 are as follows:The details of our acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows (in thousands):Amortization expense associated with other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was $2.1 million, $2.3 million, $8.8 million, respectively, and is included in cost of revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2010, future amortization expense related to the intangible assets of $23.3 million and $14.6 million is expected to be recognized in 2011 and 2012, respectively. As of March 31, 2011 future amortization expense related to the intangible assets of $18.0 million (unaudited), $15.5 million (unaudited), and $0.1 million (unaudited) is expected to be recognized in 2011, 2012, and 2013 respectively.Income (loss) before income tax expense consists of the following for the periods shown below (in thousands):Income tax expense consists of the following for the periods shown below (in thousands):The reconciliation of federal statutory income tax provision to our effective income tax provision is as follows (in thousands):Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following (in thousands):The net change in valuation allowance was an increase of $23.8 million and a decrease of $28.3 million during 2009 and 2010, respectively. Included in the decrease of $28.3 million is approximately $0.3 million of valuation allowance that was recorded against goodwill. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income. After considering both positive and negative evidence, we determined that it was more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets with the exception of California deferred tax assets would be realized based on our cumulative earnings history and our projected future taxable income. We recognized an income tax benefit of $28.3 million in 2010 as a result of the release of a portion of our valuation allowance. Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2010, are as follows (in thousands):Approximately $1.0 million of the state net operating loss carryforwards and related valuation allowance relates to the exercise of stock options, the benefit of which will be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):As of December 31, 2010, approximately $14.1 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would, if recognized, impact our effective income tax rate. Our total unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2011 were $19.2 million (unaudited).We file income tax returns in the United States, and various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax authorities for all years since inception.Provision for income taxes increased $18.8 million (unaudited) in the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in pre-tax income of $29.2 million (unaudited) in the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010. Tax expense in the three months ended March 31, 2010 was offset by the realization of deferred tax assets from prior periods. In addition, the provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was higher as a result of an increase in non-deductible stock compensation expense, the implementation cost of our international tax structure and a significant change in our geographic mix of income, which provides for income earned in various tax jurisdictions to be taxed at a broad range of income tax rates.The aggregate liquidation preference of our preferred stock consists of the following as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands):In February 2011, our board of directors authorized the issuance of 53.5 million shares of Series C Preferred Stock (Series C). Series C has similar rights to our existing preferred stock, except for the following: the dividend rate for Series C, if and when dividends are declared by our board of directors, is 8% of the original issue price (OIP) of $14.029115 per share. The holders of Series C have a liquidation preference that allows them to be paid their OIP upon liquidation prior to any other series. In connection with this authorization, we issued 34.9 million shares of Series C convertible preferred stock for $14.029115 per share, or $490 million in gross proceeds.The following are the rights and preferences of our respective series of convertible preferred stock:Dividends The holders of our convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive, when and if declared by our Board of Directors, non-cumulative dividends equal to $0.004515, $0.01, $0.033675, $0.379686, $0.514915, $1.122, and $0.0004 per share per annum for Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1, Series B-2, Series C and Series Z convertible preferred stock, subject to adjustments, respectively. We have not declared any dividends to date.Voting Rights. All series of convertible preferred stock vote in their respective separate series, along with common stock, on an as-if-converted basis on most matters including to elect the board of directors. Holders of Series A and A-1 are entitled to vote together as one class to elect one director. Holders of Series B are entitled to vote as a separate class to elect one director. The holders of Series Z convertible preferred stock and Class A common stock are entitled to vote together as one class to elect one director. The holders of Class B common stock are entitled to vote as a separate class to elect one director. In the event that more than five directors are authorized, all holders of convertible preferred stock and common stock would vote as a single class to elect the remaining directors.Liquidation. If Zynga is dissolved, liquidated, or its business wound up, or if Zynga is acquired, all proceeds available for distribution to stockholders must be paid to the holders of convertible preferred stock up to the amount of their respective liquidation preferences before any distributions may be made to the holders of common stock. The liquidation preference of each series of convertible preferred stock equals the respective series OIP per share plus the amount of declared but unpaid dividends on each series of convertible preferred stock upon the date of distribution. The OIP per share of each series of convertible preferred stock is $0.0564375, $0.125, $0.4209375, $4.746075, $6.436465, $14.029115 and $0.005 for Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1, Series B-2, Series C and Series Z, respectively. If the assets available for distribution are insufficient to make the full distribution to the holders of convertible preferred stock, the remaining assets will be distributed among the holders of the respective series in the following order: Series C; Series B, Series B-1, and Series B-2 as a group; and if any funds remain, they would be distributed to the holders of Series A and Series A-1 as a group. If any further funds remain, such funds would be distributed to the holders of Series Z.Redemption and Conversion. The shares of Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1, Series B-2, Series C, and Series Z convertible preferred stock are not redeemable and are convertible at the option of the holder at any time, subject to a majority vote by the class of stock, with the exception of Series Z, which is convertible upon a majority vote by all holders of preferred shares. In addition, an investor that holds 23.3 million Series B-2 shares has a contingent redemption feature that, at our discretion, would redeem the Series B-2 shares for cash equal to the OIP of $150 million under certain conditions. This right expired in May 2011.Automatic conversion occurs for all preferred stock upon the completion of a public offering through which gross proceeds, before any underwriting discounts and commissions and fees, of at least $75 million are raised. All shares are convertible exclusively into Class A common stock pursuant to terms as described below. Each share of convertible preferred stock is convertible into one share of Class A common stock. The conversion price for each Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1, Series B-2, Series C and Series Z convertible preferred stockis adjusted on a weighted-average basis if we issue shares at a price below the OIP for that series of convertible preferred stock, subject to certain exceptions in our Certificate of Incorporation. This conversion price is subject to proportional antidilution adjustments in the case of stock splits, dividends, reverse splits, and other adjustments in our stock.Our two classes of common stock are Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The following are the rights and privileges of our classes of common stock:Dividends. Subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors may determine.Voting Rights. Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. In general, holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, unless otherwise required by law; except that the holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to vote together with our Series Z Preferred Stock as a single class to elect one director and the holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to vote as a separate class to elect one director. Delaware law could require either our Class A common stock or our Class B common stock to vote separately as a single class in the following circumstances:Liquidation. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders would be distributable ratably among the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock after payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of our preferred stock.Preemptive or Similar Rights. Neither our Class A nor our Class B common stock is entitled to preemptive rights, and neither is subject to redemption.Conversion. Our Class A common stock is not convertible into any other shares of our capital stock. Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of our Class A common stock. In addition, each share of our Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share of our Class A common stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value, except for estate planning, intercompany and other similar transfers. Once transferred and converted into Class A common stock, the Class B common stock may not be reissued. No class of our common stock may be subdivided or combined unless the other class of our common stock concurrently is subdivided or combined in the same proportion and in the same manner.On November 2, 2007, our founder purchased 128.7 million shares of Class A common stock (the Class A Shares) and 20.5 million shares of Class B common stock (the Class B Shares) for an aggregate purchase price of$0.4 million. At the date of grant, all of the Class B common shares and 50% of the Class A common shares were fully vested. The remaining 50% of the Class A Shares vest ratably over a vesting period of 48 months and are subject to Zyngas repurchase right at the original purchase price. We recognize compensation expense related to the vesting Class A Shares over the vesting period. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we recorded compensation expense of $40 thousand annually in connection with these shares. As of December 31, 2010, 13.4 million shares of unvested Class A Shares are subject to repurchase. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common. We refer to Class A and Class B common stock as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.In July 2009, in connection with a third-party service arrangement, we issued a warrant to purchase 0.7 million shares of our Class A Shares at an exercise price of $0.50375 per share to a service provider. This warrant vests ratably over a period of two years, expires in July 2019, and is exercisable upon issuance. We determined the fair value of the warrant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We will revalue this warrant each period as services are performed and expense the portion of the warrant that vests each period. During 2010, we recorded $1.9 million of expense related to this warrant. As of December 31, 2010, these warrants remained outstanding and exercisable.In July 2008, in connection with the issuance of Series B Shares, we issued warrants to purchase 18.2 million shares of our Class A Shares at an exercise price of $0.00625 per share to an investor. These warrants expire in 2018 and are exercisable upon issuance. We determined the relative fair value of the warrants and Series B Shares using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The warrants were allocated a value of $1.4 million, which reduced the proceeds of the Series B Shares and increased paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2010, these warrants remained outstanding and exercisable.During 2010, concurrent with the issuance of 23.3 million shares of Series B-2 convertible preferred stock, we granted an investor a contingent right to a warrant to purchase 7.8 million shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $0.005 per share. We allocated $150 million of proceeds from the investor between the Series B-2 preferred stock and the contingent right to a warrant based on their relative fair values. The amount allocated to the contingent right to a warrant of $4.6 million was recorded to additional paid-in capital on the date the right was granted. The allocation of a portion of the proceeds received for the contingent right also resulted in a beneficial conversion feature related to the Series B-2 shares issued of approximately $4.6 million. Because the Series B-2 shares have no stated redemption date, the discount was immediately charged to retained earnings as a deemed dividend. In April 2011, a distribution agreement was executed and the investors right to receive the warrant was extinguished.As of December 31, 2010, Zynga maintained the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan) for the purpose of granting stock options and ZSUs to employees, directors, and non-employees. As of December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, a maximum of 319.2 million shares and 352.2 million shares (unaudited), respectively, may be granted under the 2007 Plan.The 2007 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options, with unvested shares subject to repurchase at the original exercise price by us in the event of termination of employment with Zynga or termination of service to Zynga in the case of options granted to non-employees. Repurchased shares are returned to the 2007 Plan. Theability to early exercise was eliminated for grants approved after August 31, 2009. 50.6 million and 18.8 million early exercised shares were subject to repurchase as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010, respectively. In addition, in November 2009, two third-party investors obtained a joint right of first refusal relating to the transfer of Class A common stock awarded under the 2007 Plan by certain employees. This right terminates upon a sale or initial public offering of our shares. In the event the third-party investors waive this right, we hold the next right of refusal relating to such share transfers.Early exercise proceeds were $0.1 million and $0.2 million in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and were recorded as a liability. In 2010, employees early exercised 0.6 million stock options. As the shares vest, the related liability is reclassified into equity. We recorded a liability of $0.4 million, $0.2 million, and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, related to these early exercised options. As of December 31, 2010, 19.9 million shares of Series Z convertible preferred stock were unvested, and had a weighted-average grant date fair value of $6.44 per share.The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted in our consolidated financial statements:In the three months ended March 31, 2010, there were no stock options granted (unaudited). For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, the weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted was $0.06, $0.33, and $4.24, respectively.We recorded stock-based compensation expense related to grants of employee and consultant stock options, restricted stock, and vesting Series Z convertible preferred stock in our consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):As of December 31, 2010, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $43.3 million and $128.7 million related to unvested stock options and unvested shares of Series Z convertible preferred stock, respectively, is expected to be recognized during the period from 2011 to 2014. Unamortized deferred stockcompensation relating to ZSUs amounted to $247.7 million and $631.4 million (unaudited) as of December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, respectively. All ZSUs are subject to two vesting conditions: (1) a service condition and (2) a qualifying liquidity event (IPO or change in control). The qualifying liquidity events are considered performance conditions. As of December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, all compensation expense related to our ZSUs remained unrecognized because as of those dates we did not believe either of the liquidity events were probable of occurring. If the vesting condition related to the qualifying liquidity event had occurred on December 31, 2010, we would have recorded $81.8 million of stock compensation expense on that date related to ZSUs. If the vesting condition related to the qualifying liquidity event had occurred on March 31, 2011, we would have recorded $139.4 million (unaudited) of stock compensation expense on that date related to ZSUs.The following table shows stock option and ZSU activity for 2009, 2010, and for the three months ended March 31, 2011 (in millions, except share count, which is in thousands, and weighted average exercise price):The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010 was $0.3 million, $0.01 million, and $110.6 million. The total grant date fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010 was $0.1 million, $1.0 million and $12.9 million, respectively.In December 2010, we cancelled an aggregate of 4.2 million unvested ZSUs held by certain of our employees in order to maintain compliance with certain laws. The ZSUs were cancelled with no consideration given. In March 2011, our board of directors approved a grant of 1.1 million ZSUs to the then current employees impacted by this cancellation, which are subject only to a liquidity condition (IPO or change of control) in order to vest. Our board of directors also approved a grant of 3.1 million ZSUs to these employees that have a 32 month service period condition that is fulfilled monthly and are also subject to the liquidity condition (IPO or change of control) in order to vest. These ZSUs had a grant date fair value of $6.44 per share. We also paid this group of employees retention cash bonus payments totaling $3.6 million.Additionally, in 2010 we repurchased 0.4 million restricted shares from a terminated employee that had been granted in connection with an acquisition. These shares are included in the repurchases of common stock on the consolidated statement of stockholders equity.Options outstanding that have vested and are expected to vest as of December 31, 2010 are as follows:The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options as of December 31, 2010 was $610.9 million. As of December 31, 2010, there were 1.6 million unvested restricted common shares granted in connection with business acquisitions, which had a weighted average grant date fair value per share of $0.12.In July 2009, we received a full recourse note receivable from an employee as consideration for the early exercise of 5.6 million stock options. The note receivable had a face value of $1.0 million and bore a fixed interest rate of 2.8%. This transaction has been accounted for as a substantive grant of equity share options. Accordingly, we have not recorded the note in our financial statements as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. During 2010, pursuant to a mutual agreement between the employee and Zynga, 1.6 million of the early exercised shares were cancelled and the note balance was reduced by $0.3 million. In January 2011, the remaining note balance of $0.7 million, including accrued interest, was paid to us in full.For the period ended shown below, we had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows (in thousands):The components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, were as follows (in thousands):9. Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Class A and Class B Common StockWe compute net income (loss) per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method required for participating securities. We consider all series of our convertible preferred stock to be participating securities. Additionally, we consider shares issued upon the early exercise of options subject to repurchase and unvested restricted shares to be participating securities. In accordance with the two-class method, earnings allocated to these participating securities, which include contractual participation rights in undistributed earnings, are subtracted from net income to determine total undistributed earnings to be allocated to common stockholders.Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing total undistributed earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. All participating securities are excluded from basic weighted-average common shares outstanding. In computing diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, undistributed earnings are re-allocated to reflect the potential impact of dilutive securities, including stock options and warrants. The computation of the diluted net income (loss) per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion from Class B common stock, while the diluted net income (loss) per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares. Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of both outstanding stock options and warrants.The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in thousands, except per share data):Unaudited Pro Forma Net Income Per Share for Class A and Class B Common StockUnaudited pro forma basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the three months ended March 31, 2011 gives effect to the conversion of the Companys convertible preferred stock (using the as if-converted method) into common stock as though the conversion had occurred as of the beginning of the period or the original date of issuance, if later. In addition, the pro forma amounts give effect to the vesting of our ZSUs following the satisfaction of the liquidity event criteria, and therepurchase of shares of common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The number of shares to be repurchased is based on the applicable withholding rates and an assumed initial public offering price of $             per share.The following weighted-average employee stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share and pro forma diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented (in thousands):We have entered into operating leases for facilities space. In 2010, we executed an operating lease agreement for 267,000 square feet of office space for our future headquarters in San Francisco, California. The lease term is seven years from the defined commencement date, with options to renew for two five-year terms. Under the terms of the lease we were provided $13.6 million in leasehold incentives and $9.8 million in rent abatements. Currently we intend to maintain our headquarters in San Francisco through the initial lease term, and therefore, amortize associated incentives and recognize rent associated with the lease on a straight line basis over the initial lease term. The minimum lease commitments for this lease agreement are included in the table below. Future minimum lease payments that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms as of December 31, 2010, are as follows (in millions):Rent expense on operating leases for facilities for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 totaled $0.5 million, $2.2 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Future lease obligations increased during the three months ended March 31, 2011 for costs related to additional leases, amendments increasing the square footage of our headquarters to 345,000 square feet. Payments associated with lease obligations increased by $23.2 million of which $1.5 million are due in less than one year, $8.9 million are due between one and three years, $8.7 million are due between four and five years, and $4.1 million are due after five years.Zynga has entered into several service contracts for hosting of data systems and payment processing. Future minimum purchase commitments that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms as of December 31, 2010, are as follows (in millions):Future minimum purchase commitments increased during the three months ended March 31, 2011 for costs associated with hosting of data systems. Payments associated with minimum purchase commitments increased by $31.9 million (unaudited), of which $30.0 million (unaudited) are due in less than one year, and $1.9 million (unaudited) are due between one and three years.From time to time, we may become subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, we may receive notification alleging infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation that in our opinion would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition should such litigation be resolved unfavorably.Included in general and administrative expense within the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 is a net gain of $39.3 million related to legal settlements. In 2008, we recorded $7.0 million of general and administrative expenses related to a legal settlement.In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements.We have a qualified defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Substantially all full-time employees qualify for participation in the plan. To date, we have not made any matching contributions to this plan.The following represents our geographic revenue based on the location of our players:For our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, we evaluated the following subsequent events through July 1, 2011, the date our consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.In April 2011, we effected a two-for-one stock split of our common and convertible preferred stock. All share, per share, and related option information presented in these financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split.From April through June 2011, we acquired five companies to expand our online social game offerings and our software development and engineering teams. These acquisitions were not individually significant and had an aggregate purchase price of $10.4 million.For our consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2011 and for the three months then ended, we evaluated the following subsequent events through August 10, 2011, the date our consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.In July 2011, we executed a revolving credit agreement with certain lenders to borrow up to $1.0 billion in revolving loans. Per the terms of the credit agreement, we paid upfront fees of $2.5 million and we are required to pay ongoing commitment fees of up to $625,000 each quarter based on the portion of the credit facility that is not drawn down. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as described in the credit agreement.From July 1, 2011 through the date of this filing, we acquired one company to expand our online social game offerings and our software development and engineering teams. This acquisition was not individually significant and had an aggregate purchase price of $7.5 million.ITEM 13. Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution.The following table sets forth the costs and expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, payable in connection with the sale and distribution of the securities being registered. All amounts are estimated except the SEC registration fee, the FINRA filing fee and the                     listing fee. Except as otherwise noted, all the expenses below will be paid by Zynga.Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes a court to award, or a corporations board of directors to grant, indemnity to directors and officers in terms sufficiently broad to permit such indemnification under certain circumstances for liabilities, including reimbursement for expenses incurred, arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be in effect upon the closing of this offering provides for indemnification of our directors, officers, employees and other agents to the maximum extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, and our amended and restated bylaws to be in effect upon the closing of this offering provide for indemnification of our directors, officers, employees and other agents to the maximum extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law.We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers, whereby we have agreed to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law, including advancement of expenses incurred in legal proceedings to which the director or officer was, or is threatened to be made, a party by reason of the fact that such director or officer is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of Zynga, provided that such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner that the director or officer reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interest of Zynga. At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving a director or officer of Zynga regarding which indemnification is sought, nor is the registrant aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification.We maintain insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and amended, that might be incurred by any director or officer in his capacity as such.The underwriters are obligated, under certain circumstances, pursuant to the underwriting agreement to be filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto, to indemnify us, our officers, directors and the selling stockholders against liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.The following sets forth information regarding all unregistered securities sold since January 1, 2008:The offers, sales and issuances of the securities described in Item 15(a) were deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act under either (1) Rule 701 promulgated under the Securities Act as offers and sale of securities pursuant to certain compensatory benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation in compliance with Rule 701 or (2) Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering, or because they did not involve a sales of securities. The recipients of securities in each of these transactions represented their intention to acquire the securities for investment only and not with view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof and appropriate legends were affixed to the stock certificates and instruments issued in such transactions. All recipients had adequate access, through their relationships with us, to information about us.The offers, sales, and issuances of the securities described in Item 15(b) were deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D promulgated thereunder as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. The recipients of securities in each of these transactions acquired the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof and appropriate legends were affixed to the securities issued in these transactions. Each of the recipients of securities in these transactions was an accredited or sophisticated person and had adequate access, through employment, business or other relationships, to information about us.The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement, certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that:Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, we have duly caused this Amendment No. 2 to the Registration Statement on Form S-1 to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of San Francisco, State of California, on the 11Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, this Amendment No. 2 to the Registration Statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated.'"

"'11-08-11,'1','In other Broadway productions Mr. Wood earned a Tony nomination as Guildenstern in Mr. Stoppard’s comedy “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” which opened in New York in 1967.He returned to Broadway in 1974, and garnered a second Tony nomination, for the title role in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s “Sherlock Holmes,” a revival of the 1899 drama by Arthur Conan Doyle and William Gillette.Mr. Wood also originated the role of Sidney Bruhl, the murderous playwright at the center of “Deathtrap,” Ira Levin’s comic thriller, which opened on Broadway in 1978.Explaining his decision to take the part (a more commercial venture than he normally allied himself with), Mr. Wood, who by this time had had no end of costumed period dramas, told Newsweek, “I just wanted to get onstage in ordinary pants and do one-liners.”John Wood was born in Derbyshire, in the English Midlands, in 1930. At Oxford he studied law, but while there directed and starred in a student production of “Richard III” that was so well received it propelled him into acting. He spent the second half of the 1950s doing Shakespeare with the Old Vic Company in London.The life of a young actor, he soon discovered, was not an easy one. “You stand like a horse in a field waiting for the phone to ring,” he told The New York Times in 1998, adding, “That’s if you were a horse that could operate a mobile telephone.”Mr. Wood first performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company in the early 1970s, playing Brutus in “Julius Caesar,” among other roles.In the late 1980s and early ’90s, after success in New York, he returned to the company, playing leading parts including an widely acclaimed Prospero in “The Tempest,” the title role in “King Lear” and Halvard Solness in Ibsen’s “Master Builder.”His screen work includes the feature films “The Purple Rose of Cairo,” directed by Woody Allen, and “Jane Eyre,” directed by Franco Zeffirelli, as well as “Orlando,” “Shadowlands,” “An Ideal Husband,” “Chocolat” and many British television shows.Mr. Wood’s survivors include his wife, Sylvia; their three children; and a child from his first marriage, according to British newspapers.His other stage roles include the elderly poet A. E. Housman in Mr. Stoppard’s drama “The Invention of Love” with the Royal National Theater in 1997. On Broadway he also played the title role in a 1977 production of “Tartuffe” and replaced Ian McKellen as Salieri in Peter Shaffer’s “Amadeus.”To Mr. Wood, late acclaim may ultimately have been a blessing, as he told Newsweek:“In a way,” he said, “I’ve been fortunate to have success delayed, although I will say it was galling to watch Albert Finney and Peter O’Toole go rocketing by. They were a part of a whole group of British actors in the ’60s who made drunkenness a sort of trademark. I didn’t drink as much Scotch as they did — I couldn’t afford it. In a sense, perhaps it saved me. The worst thing that can happen to an actor is to be hailed as a genius the first time he walks onstage.”'"
"'11-08-11,'1','The Stock Market Then ... and NowComparisons have been made between the financial crisis and stock market plunge in 2008 and the current downturn on Wall Street. Back then, troubles in the housing market and losses in mortgage lending spurred a full-on panic after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Credit markets froze, which worsened an economy already in recession. From May 2008, when the charts here begin, to March 2009, stock prices dropped more than 50 percent. This year, the S.& P. 500 has fallen about 18 percent since May, as concerns over government debt in the U.S. and Europe and weak economic growth around the world have mounted. Here is how the two periods compare across a number of market measures.'"
"'11-08-11,'1','Most of the attention so far has been focused on volatility in , with investors spooked by three heart-stopping declines in the last five trading days — including Wednesday’s 4.6 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.But the bigger concern of many financiers and government officials was signs of stress on Wednesday in European markets, which are essential to financing the day-to-day operations of and companies there.Unlike the 2008 crisis, which began in the United States and spread worldwide after the bankruptcy of and the near collapse of the giant insurer as subprime mortgage defaults surged, today’s situation began overseas. The mounting fear about European banks’ exposure to sovereign debt is now fraying nerves here.Financial institutions across Europe have huge holdings of government and corporate bonds from , , , and . Concerns about defaults are growing.Some insist that the comparisons are overblown. “It feels completely different,” said Larry Kantor, the head of research at Capital. “I don’t think there is a U.S. right now, and European debt is not held as broadly as mortgage debt or derivative debt was back in 2008. The prospect of a 2008-like drop in the market is remote.”Experts add it is important not to confuse a stock market rout with an all-out panic.“I think it’s quite different than 2008,” said John Richards, head of strategy at RBS in Stamford, Conn. “This is a stock market correction based on slower growth and the increased probability of a . In 2008 we had a genuine funding crisis, where banks were reluctant to lend to one another.”Others on Wall Street maintain that the turmoil is playing out in similar fashion. Traders compare the threat from Greece that prompted the a year ago to , whose fall in March 2008 was a dress rehearsal for the broader crisis that followed six months later. For these would-be Cassandras, the huge debt loads of Italy and Spain are now equivalent to Lehman and A.I.G., institutions whose downfalls threatened the stability of the entire system.In an ominous echo of 2008, European bank stocks on Wednesday fell 10 percent or more — and banks in Europe are beginning to hoard cash, crimping the interbank that keep the global financial system operating smoothly. While borrowing costs for banks in the United States and have crept up only slightly recently, borrowing costs for Continental banks that lend to one another have doubled since the end of July.More optimistic market watchers point out that these rates are still well below those at the height of the financial crisis. But they nonetheless are the highest since the spring of 2009.Because European banks trade billions of dollars daily with their American counterparts, fears of contagion have spread.Along with the fear is a measure of denial in the period leading up to now, one more echo from 2008. Even as evidence of the subprime threat mounted through 2007 and into 2008, stocks continued to levitate, with the Dow industrials touching 13,000 not long after Bear Stearns had to be rescued. And even as the economy weakens, Wall Street is still predicting earnings in the fourth quarter to be 23 percent above last year’s level, a target that is looking more out of reach by the day.Then, as now, there were huge stock market swings, up as well as down. For example, the Dow plunged 777 points on Sept. 29, 2008, after Congress initially rejected the proposed bank bailout, only to rise 485 points the next day. But over all they kept plunging, with the Dow bottoming out at 6,547 in March 2009.There are, however, some very important differences between now and then that could make the banks more resilient.Financial institutions in the United States have one-third more capital than they did in 2007, and they are better positioned to weather the current storm. And they have reduced their risk-taking. Instead of lending $25 for every $1 dollar worth of capital they hold, they are now lending a more reasonable $16, according to an analysis by Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst with Oppenheimer.There are other ways the financial system has reduced the amount of debt.The size of the market for repurchase agreements, or repos, where financial institutions borrow overnight to finance their operations, has shrunk from a peak of $4.57 trillion in March 2008, the month Bear nearly collapsed, to $2.6 trillion in July 2011.What is more, consumers and companies alike have scaled back their debts — albeit modestly — even if governments have not. After increasing their borrowing for more than three straight decades, consumers reversed course and actually owe slightly less now than they did in 2008. Similarly, the number of companies whose short-term debt exceeds their assets is at a 25-year low, lessening the chance of the kind of credit squeeze that hit in the fall of 2008.Moreover, the scope of the problems today is better understood than in 2008, when policy makers were repeatedly surprised at the amount of subprime mortgage debt and how it had coursed through so many corners of the world’s financial system.Not all the differences are benign, however. Unlike in 2008, when policy makers in the United States moved swiftly to bail out banks and provided guarantees to keep the financial system from seizing up, political divisions in Washington make bold action like another much more difficult.The also has fewer tools to employ. It has already cut short-term interest rates to nearly zero, and two rounds of injections totaling more than $2 trillion to stimulate the economy have yet to fully restore growth.“There’s only so much the Fed can do,” added Mr. Hanson, of Bank of America. “It’s a different kind of war now, but we’re out of conventional bullets.”In Europe, where the current crisis originated, political leaders are at least as divided on a course of action as their counterparts in the United States, because different countries there are having a hard time reconciling their different interests.“We haven’t seen policy makers come out with a plan that is viewed as comprehensive, coordinated and credible,” said Philip Finch, a global bank strategist for . “We need confidence restored and there’s a lot of infighting.”'"
"'11-08-11,'1','After reading the bio of Ruby Rae Spiegel, a playwright in Series A of the annual new American play festival, this year titled “Summer Shorts 5,” I confess my first thought was that she must be the daughter of someone rich. How else could a teenager who just graduated from high school get her play produced alongside veterans like Neil LaBute and Christopher Durang at 59E59 Theaters?Then “Carrie & Francine” started and the snap of her spiky dialogue made my eyes stop rolling. A profane scene with two 13-year-old girls talking about sex and pop culture is nothing new, but this exchange was ruthlessly economical in its forceful momentum, and the taut, mannered prose showed a sensitivity to the sound of language. Ms. Spiegel could tell a broad joke (“I used to think pedophilia was people who liked feet”) and knew how to reveal plot and character gradually to build suspense. Whoever her parents are, Ms. Spiegel, entering Yale in the fall, can write. (According to a Theater Development Fund article, she wrote her first play in seventh grade and this short drama for a festival at her school, St. Ann’s, in Brooklyn. A teacher there, Laura Barnett, the director of this work, sent it out and Throughline Artists, the producer of “Summer Shorts,” included it in the series.)Carrie (Lydia Weintraub), whose bravado hides insecurities, asks Francine (Louise Sullivan) to help her prepare for a make-out session at a bar mitzvah. Drawing conclusions from the “Girls Gone Wild” videos, she believes it is time to, well, go wild. As staged by Ms. Barnett, these scenes may horrify parents, but unlike most frank portraits of teenage life, the play does not resort to despair or sentimentality. These privileged girls are as innocent as they are cruel. But the script suggests that in the end they will be O.K.This kind of maturity is sometimes missing in the work of Neil LaBute, whose “New Testament” is a typically hysterical portrait of racism in which a preposterously unpleasant writer tells an Asian actor he can’t portray Jesus in his play. The debate about colorblind casting includes a number of Mr. LaBute’s characteristically biting zingers as the one-act celebrates its cynical view of show business.Christopher Durang’s “Triple Trouble With Love” is a more interesting short work that features three monologues about the miseries of dating. The first two present both sides of a breakup rooted in a mundane slight, while the third takes off into a wonderfully bizarre flight of lunacy as a woman with possibly the worst taste in men describes her bad luck with husbands. The juxtaposition is a great joke. Less successful is Alexander Dinelaris’s “In This, Our Time ... , ” a standard-issue dysfunctional-family play that shocks right where you expect it to. The news here is Ms. Spiegel. Her labored “Catcher in the Rye” allusion reveals her age and she does occasionally pursue a laugh at the expense of credibility, but even with its flaws, make no mistake: This is a remarkably assured debut.'"
"'11-08-11,'1','Scientists are reporting very preliminary success with a new approach for treating leukemia — turning the patients’ own blood cells into assassins that hunt and destroy their cancer cells.So far, researchers have treated three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and their published paper reports the results for one of them. The patient had initially responded to chemotherapy but relapsed, leaving him only one option, a risky bone marrow transplant. So far, the researchers say, that patient and another leukemia patient appear cancer-free up to a year after treatment. The third patient improved but still has some cancer.Papers describing the work were published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine and Science Translational Medicine.But an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine urged caution, pointing out that there were complications with the therapy and that it was too soon to assess its effectiveness.“Only with the more widespread use of” the therapy “will we learn whether the results reported by Porter et al. reflect an authentic advance toward a clinically applicable and effective therapy or yet another promising lead that runs into a barrier that cannot be easily overcome,” wrote the editorialists, Dr. Walter J.

He described reading it as a “spear in the chest experience.”“I read on and was dumbfounded by how much I did not know about the environment, and the impacts of the industrial system on the environment — the industrial system of which I and my ‘successful’ company were an integral part,” he said in a 2005 speech.“A new definition of success burst into my consciousness, and the latent sense of legacy asserted itself. I got it. I was a plunderer of Earth, and that is not the legacy one wants to leave behind. I wept.”Efforts he began have so far reduced the so-called carbon footprint of the company’s 26 factories by about half, said the current chief executive, Dan Hendrix.“When he first came up with this idea, I have to admit I thought he’d gone around the bend,” Mr. Hendrix said Wednesday. “But he was right.”Ralph Nader, who became friendly with Mr. Anderson after hearing one of his speeches several years ago, called him “the greatest educator of his peers in industry, and the most knowledgeable motivator, by example and vision, for the environmental movement.”Ray Christie Anderson was born July 28, 1934, in rural West Point, Ga., the youngest of three children of William Henry Anderson, a postal worker, and Ruth McGinty, a teacher. He received a football scholarship to Georgia Institute of Technology and graduated in 1956 with a degree in systems engineering.In 1973, Mr. Anderson became one of the first manufacturers in the United States to produce modular carpet, which provided for easier access to wiring and infrastructure beneath floors than broadloom carpet. Interface became the largest manufacturer of modular carpet in the world.His survivors include his wife of 27 years, Patricia Adams Anderson; two daughters from a previous marriage, Mary Anne Lanier, of Marietta, Ga., and Harriet Langford, of LaGrange, Ga., and a brother, Dr. William Anderson, of Conneaut, Ohio.In one of his first speeches after reading Mr. Hawken’s book, Mr. Anderson told an audience of business executives: “We are all part of the continuum of humanity and life. We will have lived our brief span and either helped or hurt that continuum and the earth that sustains all life. It’s that simple. Which will it be?”'"
"'11-08-11,'1','Officials with the striking unions — the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — insist that the landline division is doing just fine. They note that its profit margins have increased over the last five quarters and that its FiOS TV and Internet service is growing strongly.The unions further argue that members in the landline division should not be pressured to accept concessions just because Verizon Wireless is doing better. Union officials maintain that Verizon is seeking concessions worth $1 billion a year or about $20,000 a year per union member.“It’s true that wireline is losing lines, but many of them are going to Verizon Wireless,” said Robert Master, a spokesman for the communications workers. “And regardless of how many lines they’ve lost, they’re obviously operating as an enormously profitable company. Considering these profit numbers and the huge amount that Verizon’s top executives are being paid, it’s not fair that our members are the ones to have to make sacrifices.”Verizon officials say that FiOS is not — as the unions say— going to be the financial savior for the landline business.Verizon’s chief financial officer, Fran Shammo, said Wednesday at a conference that FiOS’s profitability was increasing. But he said that because of the huge upfront costs involved in laying the fiber optic network, FiOS would never be as profitable as the early telephone business, which had little competition.FiOS, he said, faces a “very fierce competitive environment with the cable companies,” adding, “The legacy core business is a real drag. And we have to fix that cost structure.”George Kohl, a special assistant to the communications workers’ president, said Verizon used billions of dollars in profits from its traditional landline business to finance its expansion into wireless. Verizon Wireless, he noted, just announced a $10 billion dividend to its shareholders, with $5.5 billion going to Verizon.“The wireline guys sweated day by day to make the profits to create wireless,” he said. “And now they want to take away the middle-class life from the wireline employees who made the investment in wireless possible.”Craig Moffett, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said the tables had turned in recent years, and profits from wireless were financing the huge investment in FiOS.Mr. Moffett agreed with Verizon’s arguments that its landline business was hurting.“Verizon FiOS is a very good network, but it hasn’t stopped the bleeding in wireline,” he said. “Wireline is a business that is earning about a 1.6 percent return on investment and it has a 7.5 percent cost of capital. It isn’t coming close to earning enough to cover its cost of financing.”The financials of Verizon’s landline business are not the only set of numbers that company and union are fighting over. Union officials dispute the company’s estimate that each employee receives $50,000 worth of benefits each year. In that number, the company includes $14,700 for medical and dental insurance, $10,900 for retiree health care and life insurance, $10,800 for pension and $7,500 for time off.Union officials say total benefits average $25,000 a year. Mr. Kohl, the union official, disputed the $10,800 yearly figure for pensions, noting that Verizon’s annual report said the company’s 2010 contributions to the union’s defined benefit plans “were not significant.” Verizon officials said the $10,800 was an average annual amount.Mr. Kohl also said the $10,900 retiree health care figure was greatly exaggerated, asserting that many retirees had worked years to pay for that care so the cost should not be attributed to current employees.Mr. Kohl also quarreled with Verizon saying the value of time off — vacation, sick days and personal days — was $7,500. He dismissed that as double-counting because that number was already counted in wages.'"

"'11-08-11,'1','Ferruccio de Bortoli, the editor in chief of the leading newspaper Corriere della Sera, the country’s most accurate political barometer, wrote that “what hinges on this meeting, it bears emphasizing, is nothing less than the future of the country.”Yet after the meeting broke up, labor union leaders and the head of Italy’s industrialists’ organization said they were deeply disappointed by the government’s failure to present any concrete proposals, a week after Mr. Berlusconi said he was seeking broad consensus to make radical changes to the labor market and the social welfare system.Under market pressure last week, Mr. Berlusconi and Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti announced that Italy would reduce its budget deficit from the 3.9 percent of gross domestic product expected this year to zero in 2013, rather than 2014 as planned in a $70 billion package of tax increases and spending cuts passed by Parliament last month.It is a tall order. “Not even the Lord Almighty knows” how the government will propose to balance the budget by 2013, said Mario Baldassarri, an M.I.T.-trained economist and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who broke with Mr. Berlusconi’s coalition last year. “They decide at the last minute.”With public debt at more than 120 percent of gross domestic product and a growth forecast of 1 percent, the political costs promise to be high. To square the circle probably means disrupting the social order by cutting pensions and raising taxes, or disrupting the political order by cutting public spending tied to the interest groups now keeping Mr. Berlusconi in power.“This has become a government of confraternities. To change that today would be a tremendous effort,” said Stefano Micossi, an economist, professor at the Council of Europe and director of Assonime, an Italian business research group. “He doesn’t understand the market, he understands interests,” Mr. Micossi added of Mr. Berlusconi.Mr. Berlusconi first came to power in 1994, after a huge bribery scandal that brought down the established political order, in which the Christian Democrats, Socialists and Communists for decades presided over a jobs-for-votes system that helped build up the public sector. Since returning to power in 2001, Mr. Berlusconi has largely kept that time-honored system intact, analysts say, but replaced the old political order with the parties in his coalition. For every concession to the Northern League, which backs Mr. Tremonti and is intent on keeping tax revenue local, Mr. Berlusconi also had to throw a bone to the poorer south.Even after a wave of privatizations in the 1990s, Italy’s economy is still largely connected to the public sector, especially in lucrative areas like infrastructure and health care, and such contracts depend on good connections with the government.“This system used public spending as compensation, as a tool in the mediation of conflicts between interests,” Mr. Micossi said. “It also crushes market stimulus,” he added. “These state subsidies are the kiss of death, and nothing moves.” They also helped drive up Italy’s public debt, which rose from 109 percent of gross domestic product in 2001 to 120 percent today. (The center-left was in power from 2006 to 2008.)“Berlusconi’s majority reflects an Italian electorate that has not internalized” free-market principles, said Carlo Secchi, an economics professor and a former president of Bocconi University in Milan. “So you can do certain things to move in this correct direction only if there’s a big threat that comes from outside.”This week, the Italian news media reported on a letter from the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, and the governor of the Bank of Italy, Mario Draghi, to the Berlusconi government, recommending that Italy undertake significant structural changes, including liberalizing state industry and making the labor market more flexible.According to news reports, the proposals the government is discussing include raising the retirement age for women to 65 immediately, rather than gradually, cutting aid to local governments and increasing property taxes on second homes. In 2008, Mr. Berlusconi won re-election with a campaign that promised to remove property taxes on first homes — and did. Reversing that would help state coffers, but would be a significant political defeat.Few Italians have confidence in Mr. Berlusconi’s ability to deliver. As Rocco Paradiso waited in line at a post office in downtown Rome, he said he did not have high hopes. “For the past three years the Berlusconi government hasn’t done anything,” Mr. Paradiso said, adding, “Not that previous governments did much more.”'"

"'11-08-11,'1','I can think of an aquarium for a very high-end attorney. He lived in California and had a 3,600-gallon tank that was so large he had to build a foundation strong enough to hold it. The company that built the tank built it improperly, and it blew out. The attorney got wind of us and flew me out. I said we could do the job, but we had to do demolition to get the old tank out. It was close to $150,000 in demo alone to get a new tank into this guy’s house. The cost was unbelievable.Was your business affected by the housing boom and bust?We were getting calls every day for custom shapes from architects building these houses. A lot of people didn’t realize everything that goes into an aquarium. They thought it was like a waterbed that was shipped out and went into the house. But you can put the filters outside so it doesn’t create heat or noise inside the house. If you place the aquarium near an outside wall, you can make access for the service guy. There are a lot of tricks.When the bust hit, it hit hard, and everything stopped. If we didn’t have a few jobs in the pipeline to hold us through, we would be out of business.In the first episode of the show, you mention stocking an aquarium with eco-friendly fish. What is an eco-friendly fish?Years ago, a lot of stores would go to wholesalers and pick out fish without knowing where the fish came from. Some are caught with nets. Or people would put cyanide in the water. It didn’t kill the fish, but it shocked the fish and knocked them out. We don’t want anything to do with that. There are some tank-raised fish. Those would be the first choice to put in an aquarium.In the case of a husband and wife, the guy usually wants the sharks, while the wife wants pretty fish. A shark tank is just some sharks swimming around. People get bored of that pretty quick. I try to warn people about that ahead of time.Do you try to match the fish to the client’s personality?You do want to make sure you fit their environment. If I was an attorney and had an attorney’s office, a shark tank is perfect. But if I’m in a dentist’s office and I’m getting my teeth drilled, I don’t know if I want to see sharks swimming around.If “Tanked” isn’t a hit, I’ll bet you could get work as a body double for the actor Kevin James.Three or four years ago, I’m parked in Beverly Hills. This guy comes over and starts taking pictures and yells: “You’re King of Queens. I know you.” I didn’t know who the actor was, the show, anything.

CheckUserNames will show you 160 social networking sites and search them to determine if your name or brand is available for an account or if it’s already been taken. (Sorry, John Smiths.)2. Streamline. If you’re often logging into multiple social networks to repost the same content, sites like OnlyWire, Ping.fm and HelloTxt let you update several networks with a single mouse click.3. Plan ahead. When using Twitter for business or personal brand building, you can write tweets in advance and publish them automatically at a later date with services like Buffer, SocialOomph, HootSuite, TwitResponse, FutureTweets and Pluggio.4. Consolidate. Sites like Digsby and Netvibes reduce desktop clutter by providing a single dashboard to send e-mails and instant messages, and update all your social networks. If the only thing you want to open is your e-mail in-box, NutshellMail will take a snapshot of the updates on your social media sites (including Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, LinkedIn, Myspace and YouTube) and send them to you in an e-mail digest. For those with multiple Twitter accounts, TweetDeck is a way to post from any of them using just one dashboard.5. Create a landing page. If you’re on multiple networks, it’s probably because you want to connect with people. Sites like Retaggr and DandyID allow you to create a free digital business card and a Web page with links to all of your networking pages, blogs and Web sites. (This also helps keep track of your digital footprint.)6. Tame Twitter. Want to remove your inactive Twitter followers? Nest.Unclutterer promises to do it for you. Searching for someone by name on Twitter is exasperating. You can save time and limit frustration by looking for them on Listorious instead. And if you are not using a site that automatically shortens URLs when you paste them into Twitter, download a browser extension, like Bitly.7. Measure your progress. If you use social media to promote your business or brand, you can monitor how well you’re doing with sites like SocialReport, TwentyFeet and SproutSocial. To find out how influential you are, there are sites that assign ratings to people, like Klout and PeerIndex.

She declined to describe the conditions of his release, but a friend and human rights defense lawyer who spoke with him, Pu Zhiqiang, said Mr. Ran would be subject to six months of “residential restriction” during which his movements and his ability to speak or write publicly would be curtailed.Rights advocates said the authorities were likely to drop the charges if Mr. Ran did not resume advocating political reform.The charges against Mr. Ran could have led to 15 years in prison. His arrest in February was widely seen as the opening shot of a government campaign to head off any contagion from the protests that have toppled authoritarian Arab governments.Until his arrest, in the city of Chengdu, Mr. Ran’s daily blog writings and microblog postings provided readers with his thoughts on a range of topics, including the value of an uncensored media, the importance of charitable giving and his struggle with chronic back pain.

"'11-08-11,'1','Mr. Sarkozy gave his ministers a deadline to prepare measures to ensure that France meets its deficit reduction targets, which it had trouble doing in the past. Analysts say France also needs to stoke growth and cut its high sovereign debt, which S.& P. cited in its note accompanying the American downgrade on Friday.That note projected that France’s debt in the year 2015 would be 83 percent of its — even higher than the 79 percent S.& P. forecast for the United States by that year.S.& P. also indicated that it expected France and other AAA-rated nations to have their debts and deficits more under control than the United States by then. But the vultures now circling France apparently did not read, or at least heed, that caveat.“There has been a lot of market noise about France, rather than ratings agency noise,” said Gary Jenkins, a strategist at Evolution Securities. “On the other hand, there was market noise about the PIGS and the United States before they were downgraded,” he noted, using an acronym for the European countries swept up in the — , , Greece and .The annual cost to insure $10 million in French government debt against default jumped to a record $175,000 on Wednesday, up from only $100,000 three weeks ago. The cost also hit records for Société Générale and BNP Paribas.French banks are among the most exposed to Greek, and Italian debt, and they also hold huge amounts of French sovereign debt.Société Générale, a globally interconnected bank that the French government regards as too big to fail, moved closer to the eye of the storm recently. It has significant exposure to Greece through a retail subsidiary there, and it holds vast sums of troubled debt from small and large European economies.On Wednesday, it was hit in particular by talk that Groupama, a large French insurer that owns about 4 percent of Société Générale, needed to raise money. Groupama did not return calls for comment.But David Thébault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris, noted that many other European companies, as well as banks, were scrambling after S.& P. downgraded the United States to AA+ from AAA. Many of those companies and banks need to replace their securities because they are required to hold only top-rated sovereign debt.“Volatility is very high — we’re in quasi-crisis mode,” he said.Société Générale issued a lengthy statement after the close of trading, saying it “categorically and vigorously” denied all the “completely unfounded” market rumors that affected its share price. The bank, which reported a 1.6 billion euro ($2.28 billion) first-quarter profit last week, said it had asked the French stock market regulator to investigate the source of the rumors.The big fear in the markets, though, is the threat of contagion — whatever the reason for the tumult.“We’ve been really cautious, and the sovereign crisis is now escalating,” said Philip Finch, global bank strategist for . “It boils down to a crisis of confidence. We haven’t seen policy makers come out with a plan that is viewed as comprehensive, coordinated and credible.”Despite France’s undisputed influence as Europe’s biggest power broker next to , its debt as a percentage of gross domestic product is expected to reach 85.3 percent this year, according to the . That would be the highest among any European country in the AAA club.France’s budget deficit, meanwhile, will fall to 5.7 percent of G.D.P. this year, the I.M.F. said, still well above the 2.3 percent forecast for Germany, and the second-highest after Britain among the AAA-rated countries in Europe.And despite an array of world-class companies like Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton, L’Oréal, and Danone, France’s economy is gripped by labor market rules and other factors that keep it from growing faster.The economy is expected to grow only 2 percent this year and next, slower than the 3.4 percent pace of Germany. Unemployment is around 9 percent.Mr. Sarkozy pledged on Wednesday to find new ways to cut the deficit and reduce France’s huge debt ratio, which would swell if a widening crisis forced France to supply tens of billions more euros to pay the cleanup bill.

"'11-08-11,'1','Mr. Miskiw, who was questioned at a London police station, could provide details about which executives at the tabloid and its parent company, News International, a British subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, might have known about the illegal practices and how widespread they were.Last month, a former reporter for The News of the World told The New York Times that Mr. Miskiw had helped him find a source he was seeking by using a cellphone number. He and another reporter said this was part of a practice known as pinging, in which the police used proprietary technology to pinpoint a person’s location based on cellphone towers. The reporter said the police were paid $500 for each request.Scotland Yard has recently widened its hacking inquiry to include pinging.Mr. Miskiw’s arrest and the announcement of Mr. Fedorcio’s extended leave suggest that as Scotland Yard is aggressively pursuing possible criminal activity at The News of the World, the police are also examining the long and cozy relationship between some of its own senior officials and the news media. Mr. Wallis, as much as anyone in the phone hacking scandal, exemplifies those overlapping relationships.Late on the afternoon of May 26, 2010, Mr. Wallis, then working twice a month as a public relations consultant for Scotland Yard, visited 10 Downing Street for a drink with Andy Coulson, who was then the communications chief for Prime Minister David Cameron.It appeared to be a routine social occasion between two old friends: Mr. Coulson had been the top editor at The News of the World from 2003 to 2007, and Mr. Wallis was his deputy.The prime minister’s office declined to say what the two men discussed that afternoon. A spokesman said Mr. Wallis did not meet Mr. Cameron or anyone else in the government on that day.But the meeting took place when there were questions about the illegal telephone hacking at the tabloid under Mr. Wallis’s and Mr. Coulson’s stewardship.Mr. Wallis had parlayed decades of success in Britain’s rambunctious press into a new career as a public relations executive with ties to Scotland Yard, 10 Downing Street and News International.Working for newspapers including the Daily Star, Sun and Sunday People, he deployed an aggressive style and bold story ideas to propel himself to the top of the tabloid culture.When Mr. Wallis emerged from his office, former reporters at The News of the World have said, they grabbed for their phones and chatted into dead air to avoid becoming one of his targets. They cringed, they said, when, after reading what they had written, Mr. Wallis would boom, “Can we say ...” followed by suggestions about how to torque up a story.Mr. Wallis left The News of the World in 2009 to start his own media relations company, Chamy Media. In October 2009, Scotland Yard hired him on a contract worth about $3,260 a month. His hiring was approved by Mr. Fedorcio, who testified last month before Parliament’s Home Affairs select committee that he had not asked Mr. Wallis about phone hacking at the tabloid before hiring him to assist Scotland Yard’s press office.Mr. Wallis helped write speeches for Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan Police commissioner who resigned last month, and gave strategic advice to John Yates, the assistant commissioner who also resigned last month. Just three months before Mr. Wallis was hired, Mr. Yates had decided not to reopen the police inquiry into phone hacking by The News of the World.Mr. Wallis has known Mr. Yates since at least 2000, and the men saw each other two or three times a year. Mr. Yates called Mr. Wallis “a friend” and passed on the résumé of Mr. Wallis’s daughter to Scotland Yard’s human resources department so she could get a job.He had also known Mr. Yates’s predecessor Andy Hayman, then an assistant police commissioner. While he was still working for The News of the World, Mr. Wallis met with Mr. Hayman and Mr. Coulson on April 25, 2006, for dinner at Soho House, a fashionable London club, according to diaries that a member of Parliament obtained from Scotland Yard. The dinner occurred while Mr. Hayman was running the initial inquiry into phone hacking at The News of the World.While working for the police, Mr. Wallis maintained his ties to his former journalist colleagues. In the run-up to last year’s election, he gave informal, unpaid advice to Mr. Coulson before he had entered Downing Street, a spokesman for the Conservative Party said.During this same period, Mr. Wallis was also reporting back to his former employer, News International, and Rebekah Brooks, who was then its chief executive, two executives with knowledge of the arrangement said.“It looks very bad for the Met, but I am not that surprised, actually,” a 30-year veteran of Scotland Yard, recently retired, said about Mr. Wallis’s multiple roles. “The connections between all these people were so deep that I would have been more surprised if they had not tried to use them.”Mr. Wallis had resigned his job at the police on Sept. 6, 2010, five days after an investigation into the hacking scandal appeared in The Times. At 10 p.m. that day, Mr. Fedorcio said, Mr. Wallis e-mailed him saying, “With what’s going on here, I fear this is going to embarrass you, and I don’t want to do that, so I wish to suspend the contract.”'"
"'11-08-11,'1','LONDON — The Swiss National Bank announced new monetary measures Wednesday to weaken the surging franc, which it regards as greatly overvalued.The announcement checked the recent surge in the currency against the dollar and the euro. But analysts said it would be hard for the Swiss authorities to restrain the currency unless global markets stabilized.Investors have been eager to hold the franc, pushing it to new highs, even though they receive negative real interest rates for doing so. That reflects their confidence in Switzerland as a stable economy and a lack of faith in other currencies. The euro zone is in the midst of a sovereign debt crisis and Standard & Poor’s last week stripped the United States of its AAA credit rating for the first time.“The massive overvaluation of the Swiss franc poses a threat to the development of the economy in Switzerland and has further increased the downside risks to price stability,” the Swiss National Bank said in a statement. “The S.N.B. is keeping a close watch on developments on the foreign exchange market and on financial markets. If necessary, it will take further measures against the strength of the Swiss franc.”The bank said that it would significantly increase the supply of liquidity to the Swiss franc money market.'"

"'11-08-12,'1','The range extends from 89-year-old Aunt Kathryne, a nun, to his sister Kathy, a nurse, to his three brothers, Roddy, John and Terrence, to the old neighborhood guys and to high school teammates Mike O’Reilly and Joe Cannizzo.Billy Goodwin of the St. John’s crew said he would come all the way from France. Jackson said he would jet in from Los Angeles. Tim Hardaway and Mitch Richmond — who with Mullin formed the Golden State Warriors’ high-scoring trio, Run-TMC — requested tickets as well.So where to begin? That’s the easy part. With Lou Carnesecca as Mullin’s Hall of Fame presenter, standing up for him, right behind him, where the old coach has been for as long as Mullin can remember.“With Coach, it’s not just going back to St. John’s,” Mullin said. “It’s going back to camps and clinics. You know, he’s known me since I was 10.”They never lost touch, the phone calls crisscrossing the continent ever since Mullin became a West Coast transplant following a career based in the Bay Area.Over the years, you could catch the two of them at Madison Square Garden, side by side in the lower stands, watching St. John’s, Carnesecca leaning over and speaking with that familiar raspy voice to make the younger man with the sweet pug face break into a smile.“He was born inside a basketball — you know what I’m trying to say?” Carnesecca said in a telephone interview. “He was just a little kid, and right away, I could see he was a natural.”“Imagine if he could run and jump.”But then he wouldn’t have been Chris Mullin, who once crossed up a Georgetown defender so badly that the referee watching the play was faked out, too.“You remember that? I can’t believe you remember that!” Carnesecca gushed, excited to relive the play with someone who also recognized its pure genius.This was during Mullin’s senior year, 1984-85, at the old Capital Centre in Landover, Md. Mullin was being harassed by one of Coach John Thompson’s intense chasers — Carnesecca was tempted to say it was David Wingate — and he had the ball out front, about 15 to 16 feet from the basket.Having given up his dribble, Mullin showed ball and rose up on his toes, giving every indication that he was about to release a jumper. Only he didn’t, settling back on his heels, allowing the defender to sail past him before leaning into the shot and draining it.No basket. The referee whistled him for what in the Brooklyn schoolyards would be called up and down — officially traveling. Mullin was flabbergasted. He pleaded with the ref and demonstrated what he’d done — on his toes, never off his feet.“What the heck,” said Carnesecca, 86 and unwilling to challenge his blood pressure for something that happened more than a quarter-century ago. “That’s why they put erasers on pencils.”Months later, Mullin was taken by Golden State with the seventh pick in the N.B.A. draft but he missed training camp, holding out for a better contract. When he finally signed, his parents, Rod and Eileen, flew out to Oakland with him. In a private moment, Rod Mullin told me — I had been in Seattle the previous night and was well positioned to cover Mullin’s news conference and first game — that he wished his son could have played for the Knicks. His mother fretted about him being far away.The family was close-knit, old-fashioned Irish. Rod Mullin worked as a customs inspector at Kennedy Airport. The four Mullin boys shared a bedroom, tussling forever but always there for one another. When Roddy needed appendectomy surgery in January 1986 — the emergency bizarrely timed to Chris’s pro Garden debut — the family descended on Long Island College Hospital in downtown Brooklyn, rookie Warrior included.“Chris, get going,” his father told him. “We’ll take care of your brother.”But who was looking after Chris, 3,000 miles away and in one of the league’s more notorious locations for lifestyle malfunction?In Mullin’s third N.B.A. season, Don Nelson became the Warriors’ coach and general manager. He immediately surmised two things about Mullin. One, at 6 feet 7 inches, he was out of position as a shooting guard, and needed to move to small forward, just as Bill Bradley had done in New York. Two, before Mullin could do that, he needed to admit he was an alcoholic.Nelson had dealt with players’ substance-abuse issues and Mullin fit the profile — puffy face and body, a habit of showing up late or missing practice, not to mention eyewitnesses placing him in too many bad-news bars.“What players don’t realize is how many people can’t wait to tell on them,” Nelson said from his home in Hawaii.On Dec. 10, 1987, Nelson suspended Mullin, confronted him and ordered him to call his parents to say he needed help. Telling his father — himself a recovering alcoholic — was the most frightening moment of Mullin’s then 25-year-old life.“I thought it would kill him,” Mullin said.Rod Mullin instead told his son to listen to his coach, as he always had. On Dec. 13, 1987, Mullin checked into a 30-day program at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, Calif. He called it the most important day of his life and said he hasn’t had a drink since.“It made him this beautiful person,” said Nelson, who was amazed by the transformation. Mullin still spoke Brooklynese, but he was open and expressive. He returned to be a team leader, forging unique relationships. Manute Bol, the Sudanese giant, became Mullin’s close friend, calling him Chalk for his palest of skin tones.By the following season, 1988-89, Mullin was an All-Star, averaging a career-high 26.5 points, almost 6 rebounds and about 5 assists per game. He was often called a smaller version of Larry Bird.“Not the best player I ever coached — remember, I had Steve Nash and Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas and Sidney Moncrief in Milwaukee,” Nelson said. “But Chris was probably the most dedicated player I ever coached.”On the eve of the 1989-90 season, Mullin sat in his Alameda condo and described to me how he had learned to channel his compulsive behavior. In the off-season, he awoke every day to run 5 miles, to spend hours in the gym with breaks for lunch and a swim.Hours later, after he dropped me off in downtown Oakland, he was reminded that he lived on a fault line and not just because he was a rehabilitating alcoholic. A punishing earthquake struck the Bay Area, wreaking havoc, causing fatalities, suspending the Bay Area World Series between the Giants and the A’s.If the carnage said anything to Mullin, it was that the struggle for sobriety would come with challenges he could not foresee.He bought a house for his parents on Long Island, having told his mother, “Get something nice, as long as it has a pool.” In a day, she found one with basketball and tennis courts, too. Time spent at home with the family was raucous as ever, just a lot more luxurious — until Rod Mullin got sick with cancer and died at 56 in July 1990.Mullin by then had developed the routine of checking in with his father after games on the West Coast. “He never went to sleep until I called, and it was like two in the morning,” Mullin said in March 1991, in town to play the Knicks the next night, lounging around the new house that was still mourning the loss of its patriarch.Better than anyone, his father had understood the painstaking process of Mullin’s sobriety. With Rod Mullin no longer reachable by phone, Mullin took to walking his dog after games, continuing their late-night dialogue out loud in the solitude of the park.But he would awake the next morning, devastated again that his father didn’t have more time to enjoy the house, didn’t live another year-plus to witness the crowning moment of his son’s basketball career.It wasn’t an N.B.A. championship, but as Mullin said, “Being named to Dream Team, I’d consider that my defining achievement, playing on what was probably the greatest team ever.”I had saved an old clipping from July 1992, datelined Monaco, Monte Carlo, where the Dream Team — which was inducted last year — was preparing for the Barcelona Olympics. The story described Mullin looking out from his fifth-floor balcony of a luxury hotel while his wife, Liz, tended to their month-old son, Sean, inside the room.“Don’t get me wrong, this is a beautiful place,” Mullin said, gazing at the calm blue Mediterranean below. “I’m grateful to be here. I’m proud. But it’s just part of the road I’m taking.”The stopover in Spain was a smashing success, a shooter’s fantasy, as opposing defenders exhausted themselves trying to stop Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and the American athletic forces of nature. Mullin was not one of them, but at 29 was at the height of his career.Then there was another family quake, another test of his character and strength.His mother, Eileen, died a few weeks after the birth of Mullin’s second son, Chris Jr., in 1993. Within two years, both parents were gone, much too soon. Ready or not, Mullin’s transition game was complete. He was the adult now, on the way with Liz to a family of three boys and a girl and a career shift into a veteran or journeyman phase.He was traded to the Indiana Pacers in 1997, made it to the N.B.A. finals in 2000. But at age 36, he lost his starting job to Jalen Rose and played sparingly that postseason.One day during the Eastern Conference finals against the Knicks, I waited outside the gym for Mullin, who as always was the last player to finish shooting, the last one to leave. Even when he could count on 15 to 20 shots per game, there were never enough practice jumpers to take.Sean Mullin was 8 now and just that week had demanded to know why his father would be the only dad missing a nighttime school event.“You know I have a game,” Mullin told him.“But you don’t even play,” Sean said.Mullin didn’t know what hurt more, his son’s disappointment or the fact that his children would never get to see him draining southpaw jumpers with the perfect arc and spin.He shrugged, smiled and said it was all part of moving forward and avoiding detours into the river of lost dreams.In a telephone interview this week, Mullin said he wished that Nelson, who spared him that ordeal, could be in Springfield Friday night instead of watching at home six time zones away. They had worked together on the Warriors’ staff in recent years — Mullin as general manager and Nelson as coach — and with both their names on the ballot, they had hoped to go into the Hall together.“It was always my dream that it would happen that way,” Nelson said. As the all-time leader in career coaching victories, he is likely to be elected eventually. Mullin said he wouldn’t forget Nelson in his speech, or his parents. At 48, Mullin spends a good deal of time trying to be as good at the job as Rod and Eileen were, making up for school events missed. Sean plays lacrosse at Bryant University in Rhode Island. Chris Jr., a 6-2 guard, will play prep school basketball next season in Massachusetts. Both will be within commuting distance of ESPN in Connecticut, where Mullin landed after his career as a basketball executive was aborted — temporarily, he hopes.Meanwhile, the man who talks to cable America still pines for time with his dad. Often, the conversation takes place in the family hot tub out back, where he will look up in the dark California sky, locate a bright enough star and catch Rod Mullin up on the day’s triumphs and travails.“It’s not something I’m hiding,” he said. “I tell my kids that I do it. I want them to know. It’s important to me, just to have those few minutes.”No more than three to five. It is amazing how much ground one can cover in that short time.'"
"'11-08-12,'1','Larson, it turned out, had written a show steeped in the chiaroscuro of bright young lives amid mortal shadows, and had done so with a varied, sparkling, emotionally earnest score that seemed to meld the oil-and-water of silky American show music and ragged rock into one smooth, sweet stream. And then there was the cast, directed by Michael Greif, whose every member seemed to be living exactly in the moment of the show, with that heightened individuality that comes from believing you own — nay, that you are — the part you’re creating.O.K., that was the moment that was, and it’s not one that’s ever likely to be repeated. And since I saw “Rent” — both off and on Broadway — only with its original cast (I even passed on the 2005 movie version), it might be better to have a virgin pair of eyes check out this latest incarnation, which is also directed by Mr. Greif.But to me this “Rent” feels neither close enough to nor different enough from the original to warrant revisiting. It is visually busier than its prototype, with jittery new choreography (by Larry Keigwin) and slapdash mood- and place-defining projections (by Peter Nigrini). It also (and I can’t imagine my hearing has grown more sensitive in a decade and a half) sounds both louder and less coherent than it did before, with the careful contrapuntal strains of Larson’s score sometimes collapsing into one dissonant blur.The cast is passable but seldom more than that in roles loosely inspired by characters from Puccini’s opera “La Bohème.” As the love-burned, H.I.V.-positive rock guitarist Roger Davis, Matt Shingledecker glows a bit bizarrely with ruddy-cheeked, buff-bodied good health and bonhomie.As his drug-stoked girlfriend, Mimi Marquez, Arianda Fernandez looks alluring but sings uncertainly. Adam Chanler-Berat (who was terrific on Broadway in “Next to Normal”) comes across as too nice and easygoing to embody persuasively the self-involved, self-distancing, hyper-intellectual gonzo filmmaker Mark Cohen, the show’s narrator. (Anthony Rapp, who created the part, brought a relentless, sometimes abrasive energy to the show that cut through its stickier sentimentality.)Only Annaleigh Ashford as Maureen Johnson the performance artist (first played by Idina Menzel, if you please) adds a revitalizing grit to her role. She is more precise and funnier than was Ms. Menzel (whose strengths were of a different stripe) in evoking the particular world of downtown performance that’s being satirized here. (Her “Over the Moon” number also inspires the evening’s cleverest and most resonant use of video.)There were moments when the swirling, heart-plucking tunefulness and witty layering of Larson’s score struck me anew. But without characters who are credibly grounded by the actors portraying them, the show feels slicker and more contrived than it did. (When Roger and Mark have their climactic showdown, with mutual accusations filling the air, nothing they say about each other seems justified by what we’ve seen onstage.)None of this may matter to theatergoers new to “Rent,” which by now has become its own brand name. The predominantly young audience members with whom I saw this revival roared and hooted throughout, much as if they were attending a midnight performance of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.”For the record, the moments that inspired the most enthusiasm were: a) when the show’s resident lovable transvestite (M J Rodriguez) stepped into view in a stunning red sequin redingote; and b) when soloists in “Seasons of Love” held, bent and pushed single notes up into the ether. This is a generation, after all, that grew up on “Project Runway” and “American Idol,” among the many cultural phenomena that have reshaped priorities and tastes since I first saw “Rent” all those millions of minutes ago.Book, music and lyrics by Jonathan Larson; directed by Michael Greif; choreography by Larry Keigwin; sets by Mark Wendland; costumes by Angela Wendt; lighting by Kevin Adams; sound by Brian Ronan; projections by Peter Nigrini; original concept/additional lyrics by Billy Aronson; dramaturgy by Lynn M.

"'11-08-12,'1','In a disappointing ruling, a Federal District Court judge in Manhattan failed to hold the Central Intelligence Agency to account for a notorious attempt to cover up the torture and abuse of prisoners.Judge Alvin Hellerstein’s ruling came last week on a motion filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, which asked him to hold the C.I.A. in civil contempt of court for destroying videotapes made in 2002 showing the use of waterboarding and other brutal interrogation methods on high-level terrorism detainees.The tapes were destroyed in 2005, when the agency’s secret detention program was coming under Congressional and legal scrutiny. The destruction of the tapes (which The Times disclosed in 2007) flouted an order to preserve all such evidence issued by Judge Hellerstein in an A.C.L.U. lawsuit. Brought under the Freedom of Information Act, the suit sought details about prisoner mistreatment beyond Abu Ghraib.Last November, for reasons that remain unclear, the special prosecutor named to investigate the episode, John Durham, decided against prosecuting any C.I.A. officials. The civil contempt motion was a chance to achieve some real measure of accountability.Imposing civil contempt would not have interfered with the agency’s current operations or required payment of a fine or damages. But it would have provided official acknowledgement that the conduct of C.I.A. officials was grossly improper, which is crucial to preventing a recurrence by successors.The judge opted for a milder response. He sanctioned the agency by ordering it to reimburse the A.C.L.U.’s legal fees. The judge also directed the agency to publish its new document destruction policies. These are positive steps. But without a contempt citation, they fail to adequately address profoundly troubling behavior by a powerful agency and to deter that conduct in the future.'"
"'11-08-12,'1','It took a while for the news to reach New York, but lobster lovers elsewhere were tucking in their bibs and sounding like curmudgeons. On Tuesday, eight days after Mr. MacCash’s item appeared, The Bangor Daily News in — where in 2010 fishermen caught a record 93.4 million pounds of lobsters worth more than $308 million — published an editorial headlined “No Fake Lobsters Allowed.”By Wednesday, bloggers so close to Zabar’s that they could smell the Jamaican Blue Mountain Style coffee were on the case. “Zabar’s Committing Lobster Salad Fraud?” West Side Rag, which focuses on the Upper West Side, asked.But if others were troubled by what seemed like a case of misrepresentation, Saul Zabar, the 83-year-old president and co-owner of Zabar’s, was not.Selling lobsterless lobster salad, he insisted, was not dishonest.“If you go to ,” he said, “you will find that crawfish in many parts of the country is referred to as lobster.”He read aloud the beginning of the Wikipedia entry for crawfish: “Crayfish, crawfish, or crawdads — members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea — are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters, to which they are related.”By that definition, he said, he could call a product in which the main ingredient — actually, the only seafood ingredient — was crawfish, “lobster salad.”“But it seems that the general consensus is when you refer to lobster, you think of the Maine lobster, which is Homarus americanus,” he said. “I had a few customers who said, ‘This is delicious, but it’s not lobster salad.’ One or two, in all the years that we’re doing this, at least 15 or 20. Then I got a call from the Maine council.”The Maine Lobster Council, to be exact. Dane Somers, its executive director, had heard about the lobster salad that lacked any lobster. Mr. Somers said The Bangor Daily News had called, asking for his reaction.He said this kind of problem came up about a dozen times a year. “Sometimes it’s using lobster substitutes,” he said. “It might even be a different species of lobster, such as a warm-water spiny lobster. We call people up and say, ‘Gee, this just doesn’t look quite right if you realize there’s no actual lobster in the product.’ ”After he said something like that to Mr. Zabar, Mr. Somers said, Mr. Zabar told him that New Yorkers would not understand what crawfish was, but that it was in the “lobster family.” To Mr. Somers, that was like saying trout and minnows were in the fish family.But by then Mr. Zabar had had enough. “We really didn’t think that we were doing anything that was not completely up and up,” he said, “but there was an element that might be confusing, and with all this stuff going on, I decided now’s the time to clarify.” So he changed the name on the label from “lobster salad” to “seafare salad.”Seafare? “We used to make a salad that we called a seafare salad” that contained surimi, Mr. Zabar said, which he described as “a Japanese version of crab meat using pollock as the base.” (Others define surimi as a crablike product manufactured from fish. Some say it is pollock that is mixed into a paste with starch and other ingredients, and cooked and shaped to look like crab meat.)Mr. Zabar said he did not like surimi, so he had discontinued the seafare salad years ago.He thought of it this week when he needed a name — “I couldn’t think of anything,” he said.Sticklers could also challenge “seafare” because freshwater crawfish would presumably not be found in the sea.But amid the contretemps about crustaceans, Mr. Zabar said, he never considered replacing the crawfish with actual lobster. “Maine lobster is much chewier,” he said. “This is a nicer texture. It has a very nice flavor. If we used Maine lobster meat, it would be much more expensive.”Mr. MacCash, back home in New Orleans, laughed when he heard about the name change. “It tickled me to have traveled from New Orleans to New York in order to eat crawfish,” he said. “When I’m in New York, I try to get those things that we don’t readily get here.

"'11-08-12,'1','There is of course a difference between speculative bubbles caused by greed and psychological ones born of fear. But so-called safety trades can blow up much the same way as risky ones. It’s just that policy makers, rather than the invisible hand, are the more likely holders of the pin.Changing currency pegs in Switzerland, allowing the renminbi to appreciate in China or ongoing bullheadedness in Washington could make today’s emergency rafts look less seaworthy. Worse, if inflation turns out to be the real threat, investors may find themselves paddling feverishly to change course.The financial fashion is for all things 2008. Bank shares in Europe on Thursday jumped on expectations that some countries were preparing to revive short-selling bans they had introduced in the crisis. The desire to protect financial institutions from a potentially self-fulfilling loss of confidence is understandable. But changing the rules in turbulent times risks damaging markets in the longer term.Though share prices can be volatile, investors should be prepared. Any leveraged investor with a portfolio consisting entirely of French financial stocks would have been justifiably wiped out by the recent sell-off. By contrast, careful and diversified shareholders will be deterred from being prudent in the future if regulators intervene at the first sign of trouble. An unpredictable regime could in theory prompt all equity investors to demand a higher risk premium for owning stocks, inflating the cost of capital for companies.To be fair to regulators, equity investors are not their main concern. The goal is to prevent a loss of confidence that can be self-reinforcing when applied to banks. Sharp share-price drops can set off moves in the credit-default swaps of banks, which add to the equity sell-off. This in turn can prompt a strike by providers of short-term wholesale financing, potentially initiating a full-blown liquidity crisis.But it’s hard to think of examples where genuinely healthy institutions have been brought down purely by speculators hunting in packs. The short-sellers who aimed at financial institutions in 2008 were right: those firms genuinely needed large injections of capital.Though most lenders have been recapitalized, they now face questions about sovereign debt exposures, and the ability of governments to bail them out if necessary. Besides, it’s far from clear short-selling is to blame. The proportion of shares of Société Générale out on loan, for example, is less than the European average.Previous bans have arrested volatility only temporarily. And there is a natural curb to speculative shorting: a sudden turn in confidence can scar investors. Equity prices are a symptom, not a cause, of the financial contagion. Regulators should not punish the market for doing its job.'"
"'11-08-12,'1','Re “True Believers, All of Us,” by Frank Bruni (column, Aug. 7):Mr. Bruni is right that secular modes of thought and life, not just religious ones, are often characterized by simplistic, doctrinaire and magical thinking. But he betrays his own prejudice when he goes on to equate “religion” and “theology” with uncritical, merely wishful belief, thereby perpetuating the stereotype that all religious people belong to the theological tribe represented by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.We don’t. Calling ideological economics “faith based” and “more like theology than science” is cute, but it does significant disservice to both faith and theology (not to mention science!), which at their best are among humanity’s modes of fruitful intellectual rigor.Indeed, by conflating religion and ideology in this way, Mr. Bruni exemplifies a version of the very thing he means to critique: evidence-free, broad-brush generalization, a form of argument that simply asserts its presumptions.The writer is president and professor of theology at Christian Theological Seminary.'"
"'11-08-12,'1','Even Manager Terry Collins, who has kept his team competitive despite an endless series of injuries and a somewhat makeshift roster, seemed to concede the Mets were out of contention when he spoke after the game.“There’s a lot of guys playing for jobs on this team,” Collins said. “I want 25 guys next year who are willing to give me all they have 162 nights. Give me all they got — win, lose or draw.”“Next year,” of course, is a phrase managers use when the door has essentially shut on the season they are in. So Collins seemed to be tipping his hand that he thinks it is over for his club, which is 10 ½ games behind Atlanta in the wild-card race.When Collins considers next season, one of the players he will be watching closely is the 21-year-old Tejada. He could be the shortstop in 2012 if Jose Reyes departs as a free agent; he could be the second baseman; he could return to the minors to continue working on his game.Tejada is batting .253 for the Mets this season, having divided his time between Flushing and Class AAA Buffalo. Last season, he hit just .213 in the major leagues, so the 40-point jump in his average is encouraging. Still, he made blunders on Wednesday and Thursday that hurt his team.On Wednesday, it was a base-running mistake. He was tagged out at home after failing to slide, costing the Mets a run in a game in which they were trying to rally.On Thursday, he made a throwing error in the third inning. Then in the eighth Niese picked Cameron Maybin off first only to see the umpire rule that Maybin beat Tejada’s tag as he slid into second. The call angered Niese, who walked off the mound and removed his cap in disbelieving fashion. He then bore down and seemed about to escape without a run until the two-out grounder got away from Tejada.Afterward, Collins suggested that Tejada might want to learn how to stab certain grounders with his backhand, as opposed to repositioning his body to make the play on his forehand, which he did on his error.“You watch Jose make that play; he backhands that ball,” Collins said in reference to Reyes. He said Tejada had learned “to do it his way” and that it was “one of those habits he feels comfortable with.”“Everybody’s human,” Niese said. “You can’t fault anybody for errors.”Over all, Niese allowed two earned runs and seven hits over seven and two-thirds innings. He is virtually assured of being part of the Mets’ plans for 2012, which is probably more than can be said of Tejada or of Lucas Duda, who accounted for the Mets’ only two runs with a double in the third inning.But Tejada and Duda and any number of other players on the roster have a chance to strengthen their case over the final 45 games. Next season seems to be here, and the auditions are starting.'"
"'11-08-12,'1','The hope of the charities and American and European officials is that Hamas will drop its demand in the coming days so that all programs can continue. They argued that the insistence on on-site audits violated Palestinian law and American policy. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because negotiations with Hamas were continuing.But Taher al-Nounou, a spokesman for the Hamas government, rejected their argument, saying: “These organizations do not recognize and do not want to recognize the Palestinian law. We do not kneel down to any threat. Any organization that wants to operate in the Palestinian territories must respect the laws.”Aid provided by American and other foreign groups goes to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, where most of the 1.6 million residents are refugees. Like the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, Hamas has had trouble meeting its payroll recently, and foreign officials hope that the threat of losing outside financing will persuade Hamas officials to drop their demand.There may be disagreement among various ministries and officials, with some insisting on the audit and others willing to abandon it.American and some other foreign governments do not consider Hamas the legitimate government in Gaza. Although Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006, the Palestinian Authority, dominated by Fatah, is still viewed by many abroad as the legitimate government in Gaza and the West Bank.The authority was thrown out of Gaza in 2007 after a brief civil war and now governs only in the West Bank. Hamas set up its own government in Gaza after that. Relations between Hamas and Fatah have alternated between tense and vicious, although the two factions are now trying to negotiate a reconciliation.Most foreign charities submit their own audits to the Interior Ministry in Ramallah in the West Bank, under their interpretation of Palestinian law. They also publish reports on their sources and activities and believe that should suffice for Hamas.In July Norway’s government sent Hamas a letter saying it was “clear under Palestinian law that the competent authority to monitor the activities of the NGOs is the P.A. Ministry of Interior in Ramallah.” If Hamas insisted on an on-site audit, the organizations “might suspend their operations, which will affect significant parts of Gaza’s population who depend on outside assistance.” It said the Norwegian government would hold Hamas responsible for the suspension in services.'"
"'11-08-12,'1','Mr. Widenor said July was the hottest in the Corn Belt states since 1955. It was the fourth-hottest July in the prime corn-growing region in the last 117 years, he said.The irony in the new forecast was that it still called for a total corn harvest near record levels. Farmers responded to high price expectations this spring by greatly increasing corn acreage, but an extremely large crop was needed to make up for depleted stockpiles which have been reduced by high demand for corn for animal feed and ethanol production. The coming crop will not be big enough to do that, so corn prices will stay high, pushing up prices for other grains, like wheat, as well.The Agriculture Department’s reports also lowered the forecast for soybean yield and the total soybean harvest.“The extreme blowtorch of heat this summer took our yield down,” said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities, an Iowa commodities broker and consulting firm. “The wet weather we had early took our harvested acres down. Between the two of them we’re in a situation where now we have to ration supplies.”December corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade opened by jumping 30 cents, the maximum daily increase allowed, to $7.18 a bushel. Trading ended the day at $7.14. Soybean futures for the November contract opened at $13.53 a bushel, an increase of $0.52. The contract closed at $13.32. Wheat prices also rose, with the September futures contract on the Kansas City Board of Trade closing at $8.08 a bushel, a gain of $0.23.“The markets over the past couple of weeks have been trying to figure out which is dropping faster, supply or demand,” said Chad E. Hart, an assistant professor of economics at Iowa State University. He said the U.S.D.A. reports, including the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates known as Wasde, provided an answer: “What the Wasde report said is, supply.”High commodity prices will translate into higher meat prices because the cost of feeding cattle, pigs and poultry with grain will go up, forcing producers to raise fewer animals.And pasta prices will be pushed up because the crop of durum wheat, the variety used to make pasta, is forecast to be almost half as big as last year’s, because of flooding in North Dakota.The average retail pasta price is currently $1.53 a pound, according to the National Pasta Association, a trade group, and Walter N. George, president of the American Italian Pasta Company, said that may eventually increase by 10 to 20 cents.“The shopper may see slightly higher prices at retail, and over the course of the next 18 months should see those prices begin to come to more normal levels given a replenishment of the durum stocks,” he said.'"
"'11-08-12,'1','But no elected officials spoke during the service. One of his grandsons, Erich Collins Carey, performed “The Ballad of the Great Hugh Carey,” and several of his surviving children spoke toward the end of the service, mentioning, among other things, the pancakes he made (and flipped) in the shape of their initials and the Bösendorfer piano he bought from .“His life is a great example of making things work,” one of his sons, Bryan J. Carey, said. “Government worked. Faith worked.”His daughter Nancy Carey Cassidy said Mr. Carey’s commitment to a solution that included labor leaders was “well chronicled” in the book “The Man Who Saved New York,” published last year.“My father took great pride in knowing that Governor Cuomo sent copies of the book to key legislative and union leaders during his campaign,” she said, referring to the current governor. “The message was clear: Hugh Carey’s leadership brought together a concerned, motivated and unlikely coalition to do whatever was necessary to maintain the city and state’s credibility.”His daughter Marianne Carey Hayes said he was “larger than life, or as we referred to him, ‘Huge.’ ”“Time spent with him was ‘Huge duty,’ ” she continued, “and it had enormous perks.”She also recalled the holiday presents in a household that came to have 14 children. “Many a Christmas Eve, he worked to the wee hours with our mother to make sure all 14 piles were equal,” she said. Later in his life, she said, he took his grandchildren to the F. A. O. Schwarz toy store, “where he would play Santa Claus” while “he himself marveled at the Lionel train sets that he always longed for but never had as a boy in the Depression.”After the service, Police Commissioner called Mr. Carey “a hero in every sense of the word: a tremendous administrator, a tough guy when he had to be tough.” He said he remembered an encounter when Mr. Carey was governor and he was the commander of the 88th Precinct in , and another, in the 1990s, when he and Mr. Carey were waiting to shake hands with President . Mr. Carey gestured toward Mr. Kelly, and his fingernail nicked Mr. Kelly’s chin.“So I’m bleeding,” Mr. Kelly said. “I put the handkerchief on my chin and walk up like that” to shake hands with Mr. Clinton.Mr. King praised Mr. Carey, saying: “He’s an adult. He really is. That’s exactly what we need. He got the job done.”In 1982, as he prepared to leave office, Mr. Carey said, “I would like to be remembered as somebody who cared a great deal about people.” But for many at St. Patrick’s, he was remembered for charting a sensible course through the financial messes he inherited. Cardinal Egan recalled a sentence from a speech Mr. Carey gave soon after he was sworn in: “Now the times of plenty, the days of wine and roses, are over.”Cardinal Egan also described calling Mr. Carey to ask a personal favor. The cardinal did not say what it was, but Mr. Carey, he said, immediately replied: “You got it. What is it?”“For most people the ‘you got it’ would come after the ‘what is it,’ ” he said, “but not for our beloved Governor Carey.”'"
"'11-08-12,'1','The franc, which has surged more than 30 percent against the euro in the last year, hit a record 1.0075 on Aug. 9.Pegging the franc to the euro would be considered a drastic move, and the fact that policy makers are discussing it signals that Switzerland is running out of options to manage its runaway currency even as its economy shows signs of slowing.The Swiss economy, which grew 2.6 percent last year, is expected to slow in coming months as the strong franc makes Swiss-made goods less competitive, especially in Europe, its biggest exporting bloc.The strong franc is also causing havoc far away, in Hungary, Poland and other parts of Central Europe, where large numbers of borrowers took out home loans in Swiss francs or euros in recent years to take advantage of lower interest rates outside their own countries.In Hungary alone, where an economic recovery has faltered recently, about 700,000 homeowners hold mortgages and others loans that were borrowed in francs when the Swiss currency was weaker. A stronger franc makes those loan payments more expensive. Alarm is growing, and Hungary’s financial market supervisory authority warned Thursday that large numbers of foreign currency loan holders would be late with repayments.Despite Swiss authorities’ efforts to stem the franc’s surge, recent actions — including cutting interest rates close to zero last week and raising the supply of cash in the franc money market this week — have practically fallen into a black hole.A peg to another currency is considered anathema to many Swiss, who have prided themselves on not joining the European Union, not to mention the euro monetary union, which they believe would only weaken the nation over time.In any case, a peg would require changing the Swiss constitution, which has regulated the currency since 1850. And it would mean the Swiss central bank would risk ceding some of its independence to the European Central Bank, which manages the euro. It was also not immediately clear how a peg would be adopted at a technical level.A euro peg “is certainly not the easiest plan to put in place, either politically or legally,” Mr. Danthine acknowledged.Business people and Swiss citizens would also be loath to see their cherished currency linked to a European monetary union gripped by crisis.Pegging the currency would be “a big risk,” Thomas Christen, the chief executive of Reed Electronics, a Lucerne-based company, said in a recent interview. “Then you can’t move; you are not free and our reasoning in Switzerland is to be free in these decisions.”Some politicians had recently floated the idea, he added, “but a lot of Swiss people don’t want to do this step.”Still, the strong franc has already hit big industrial firms like Clariant and Lonza, two chemical makers. Swatch, the big watchmaker, recently warned about the “extremely problematic” run-up in the currency, even though it reported record half-year profit and sales.Swiss exporters like Mr. Christen have had to hedge against sharp fluctuations in the currency, and many more Swiss businesses have already been hit at the margins. Many are starting to buy cheaper materials, even to make high-caliber products, to offset the cost.OSEC, a large trade group that represents Swiss businesses, said it has been encouraging Swiss firms to sell more goods in emerging markets and the Middle East to offset the exporters’ traditional dependence on Europe and the United States.And many will simply be forced to become more innovative. “Because we’re not a big country, we can move very fast and try to use this as an opportunity to become more competitive,” Mr. Christen said.In the meantime, “the problem is the rest of the world knows Switzerland is safe,” he said. “But we don’t say, ‘be careful,’ because it will also make our economy go down.”'"

"'11-08-13,'0','“Dan McCracken was most interested in helping ordinary practitioners improve their computing skills,” said Peter J. Denning, chairman of the computer science department at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.But his books are not like the how-to computer books of more recent years written for consumers, which mainly offer tips for using personal computers and smartphones. His have been used as programming textbooks in universities around the world and as reference bibles by practicing professionals.In 1970, he earned a master of divinity degree from the Union Theological Seminary. Mr. McCracken never joined the clergy, but in 1972 he was one of four editors, with Margaret Mead, of “To Love or to Perish: The Technological Crisis and the Churches.”Mr. McCracken was born on July 23, 1930, in Hughesville, Mont., where his father, Albert Ray McCracken, was a mining engineer at the time. But the mine closed during the Depression, and the family moved back to Washington State, where Mr. McCracken’s father and mother, Blanche, a schoolteacher, had relatives.Mr. McCracken, the youngest of six children, grew up mostly in Ellensburg, Wash., and graduated from Central Washington University with degrees in mathematics and chemistry.In 1951, he went to work for General Electric, beginning in the chemical engineering department, then transferring to its computer center. He spent seven years at G.E. and also did graduate work at the New York University Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.While at G.E., Mr. McCracken began to write about computer programming, first for an in-house company publication, and later for publications like Datamation and Scientific American.“I had an urge to write,” Mr. McCracken said in an interview in 2008 with the Charles Babbage Institute at the University of Minnesota, which conducts historical research on computing. “When I saw something that I thought might be publishable, I wrote something. I just wanted to spread the word about good stuff.”In 1959, Mr. McCracken founded a computer consulting firm, and worked for years with corporate and government clients while writing his books.In 1981, he joined the computer science department of the City College of New York, where he taught until his death. “He was always current, always keeping up,” said Douglas R. Troeger, chairman of the computer science department.Mr. McCracken, he said, was typically the first professor to include new technologies in his course, like the Java programming language, introduced in 1995. Last spring, Mr. McCracken had students do projects in Android, a smartphone operating system developed by Google.“It was the latest hot thing, so Dan was teaching it,” Mr. Troeger said.Mr. McCracken’s first marriage, to Evelyn Edwards, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Helen, whom he married in 1980, as well as seven children from his previous marriage: his sons Charles, of Greenfield, Mass., and Thomas, of Grand Junction, Colo., and his daughters Judith Ann Carlin and Virginia Ruth Ballou, both of Hailey, Idaho, Cynthia Jeanne Baldwin, of Shoshone, Idaho, Rachel Elizabeth Bahrenfuss of Bellevue, Idaho, and Aliza Blanche McCracken, of Bakersfield, Calif.

"'11-08-13,'0','Officials in troubled Jefferson County, Ala., rebuffed a settlement offer with creditors on Friday but refrained from declaring bankruptcy, saying they wanted to try to reach a better deal in face-to-face negotiations with their lenders.In a public meeting, the county’s five commissioners read a list of proposed terms for refinancing about $3.2 billion of defaulted debt and found fault with almost all of them.“It looks like a burden on the people,” said Sandra Little Brown. “The only tool that we have, as a commission, to protect the people is Chapter 9.”The thing keeping her from using that tool, she said, was a call Friday morning from Gov. Robert Bentley, who urged her and the other commissioners to avoid bankruptcy because it could ripple out and hurt the credit of the whole state. The governor said that if the county kept working toward a settlement, he would push for help from the State Legislature. Until now, the statehouse has shown virtually no interest in helping the county as it sinks under the huge debt, incurred during an attempt to rebuild its failing sewer system.“The governor’s call makes me want to think it over a little bit more,” Ms. Brown said.The commissioners voted unanimously to delay a decision until Sept. 16, saying they would use the next few weeks to try to negotiate directly with the county’s creditors. The county’s relations with the debtholders are so frosty that a court-appointed receiver, John Young, has been serving as a go-between. But public opinion turned against Mr. Young this summer when he recommended a 25 percent increase in sewer rates and laid claim to a $75 million payment to the county from JPMorgan, its lead creditor. The payment was part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had accused the bank of wrongdoing in its dealings with the county.Mr. Young had said the sewer system needed the money and was legally entitled to it, provoking an outcry.'"

It declined to offer a full-year outlook because of stock market turmoil fueled by fear about the economy and the downgrade of the federal debt.“Consumer climate is clearly uncertain and the tumultuous last 10 days or so hasn’t given our core customer, the middle-income family, any reason to be more confident,” Myron E.

"'11-08-13,'0','“We have observed some public expenditure overruns, but we don’t expect these to continue in the fourth quarter,” said Jürgen Kröger, the chief negotiator for the European Commission.Analysts at Barclays Capital wrote in a note to investors that the review was “marginally positive news” and added that new spending controls would be needed eventually. Offsetting spending increases with one-time tax increases is “certainly not helpful at a time when economic activity is in the process of declining to an already large planned fiscal contraction,” they wrote in the note.The officials representing international lenders were in Lisbon this week to complete their first quarterly review of Portugal’s progress since they agreed on the terms of the bailout in May. Their favorable assessment paves the way for the government to receive another installment of financial assistance in September, of 11.5 billion euros ($16.4 billion).Portugal has already received about 20 billion euros ($28.4 billion) of the bailout financing, which the previous Socialist government requested in April to meet debt refinancing obligations and avoid a default.The international lenders also insisted that Portugal’s three-year overhaul program was not under immediate threat because of the deepening concerns about the euro debt crisis and the financial difficulties of larger European economies like Italy and Spain.“I am very confident that there will be no need for new money” for Portugal, said Poul Thomsen, who has been leading the bailout negotiations on behalf of the I.M.F.Mr. Thomsen also argued that “even if the headwinds are stronger,” Portugal’s position had been strengthened by the agreement in July among Europe’s leaders to ease financing terms for Greece and other rescued euro economies.“The decision of European leaders means that the ball is in Portugal’s court,” Mr. Thomsen said. “Europe will do whatever it takes as long as Portugal pursues the reforms.”The jump in the natural gas and electricity tax comes as Portuguese households already face a recession that the government and other institutions expect to last until the end of 2012. The decision could also raise concerns that the center-right government was relying heavily on punishing tax increases rather than on spending cuts to improve its budgetary situation.To stick to the deficit target, Pedro Passos Coelho, who was elected prime minister in June, also recently announced a one-time tax on the traditional Christmas bonus paid to Portuguese employees, to raise 800 million euros ($1.1 billion).Still, officials representing the lenders said they expected the government to put much more emphasis on spending cuts next year as more structural changes are made. Over all, they noted, Portugal is committed to delivering about two-thirds of its budgetary improvement through spending cuts.“Without comprehensive structural reforms, there is a clear risk that the program becomes all about cutting and not growth, which is what it should be about,” Mr. Thomsen warned.The international lenders also praised Portugal’s efforts to strengthen its banking sector despite unhappiness among domestic bankers about having to meet by year-end core capital requirements that are above those set under international banking rules.“The authorities are off to a good start,” said Rasmus Rüffer, an official from the European Central Bank. “It is important to continue to strengthen the capital buffers of the banks and bring about an orderly deleveraging.”'"
"'11-08-13,'0','“The package of concessions they’re seeking is so sweeping in terms of wages, benefits, pension, vacation and sick days that it would take what are good union jobs and push people into a very different economic situation,” said Pam Galpern, a Verizon field technician in New York City for 12 years. “We see this as a definite attack on the middle class, and there’s no justification for it from a company that’s so profitable.”Verizon officials show little patience with union talk about imperiled middle-class workers, “This is a well-worn negotiating and communications ploy — it’s not a statement of fact,” said Peter Thonis, Verizon’s chief spokesman.Verizon says its unionized workers average $70,000 a year before overtime and $91,000 with overtime. But union officials say only a small percentage of workers earn that much with overtime, an amount they say would require hundreds of hours of it.Company officials note that the average American worker earns $23 an hour, translating to $48,000 a year for a full-time worker. “The striking workers earn considerably more than many unionized nurses and teachers,” Mr. Thonis said. “We’re at the very top of our industry in terms of compensation.”He said the strikers were part of a rarefied group who contributed nothing toward their health insurance premiums. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, just 1 percent of American workers pay nothing toward their family coverage premiums. The unions say the workers pay 7 percent of their health coverage through copayments and deductibles.Doug Anderson, a Verizon field technician for 15 years, said he was barely in the middle class and would fall out of it if Verizon won concessions.“What we make is just a living wage in the New York area,” said Mr. Anderson, 53, a father of three who lives in Poughkeepsie. “On what I earn, my family can’t even afford to live where I work — Westchester County. And on what we earn, it’s hard to send a child through college.”Warning that the strike might be a long one, Robert Master, a union spokesman, said the workers were angry because the company seemed intent on cutting compensation costs even though it had $22 billion in profits the last four years. But Verizon officials say that nearly all the striking employees work in its landline division, which faces intense competitive pressures. Its customer base and profit margins have shrunk over the last decade, they said.Industry analysts estimate that the Verizon workers earn several dollars more an hour than workers at largely nonunion cable competitors like Cablevision and Time Warner.Roger Entner, founder of Recon Analytics, a telecommunication research firm in Dedham, Mass., said Verizon’s higher costs were making it harder to compete. “Verizon often charges $110 for a FiOS package,” including television, Internet and voice, he said, “while some of its nonunion cable competitors have a $50 package.”Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University, sees several anomalies in this showdown.“Verizon is asking for deep concessions, but it’s not offering any quid pro quo, such as more job security,” he said. “It even wants to eliminate all job security. Another anomaly is the unions are seeking to defend a benefit that is not enjoyed by many workers in the United States. The unions are insisting on something — not contributing anything toward health care premiums — that they’re almost embarrassed to say they’re insisting on.”Many industry analysts say they doubt that Verizon will get most of the dozens of concessions it is seeking. Many predict that the two sides will ultimately reach a deal resembling the ones that the landline division of a rival, AT&T, reached with the communications workers — in which the union workers have had to start to contribute toward their premiums.Verizon officials say they want the workers to pay $1,200 to $3,000 annually in premiums, depending on the plan, with an average of $1,450. But Candice Johnson, a communications workers spokeswoman, said many workers might have to pay $6,800 more toward health coverage a year, including premiums and higher deductibles. Mr. Thonis said very few workers would ever reach that level.Ms. Johnson said the pension freeze would mean far lower pensions in retirement, pressuring many workers to start setting aside several thousand dollars a year to build a nest egg. But Mr. Thonis said that under an enriched 401(k) program the company would match 6 to 9 percent of each worker’s pay.The two sides held negotiations on Friday in Rye, N.Y., and Philadelphia, even as each side filed changes with the National Labor Relation Board, accusing the other side of dragging its feet by not bargaining in good faith.'"
"'11-08-13,'0','The Rez Abbasi Acoustic Quartet began a new tune at Iridium on Thursday night with Mr. Abbasi alone on guitar, sketching a three-note pattern over a seven-beat cycle. Then, having set a groove in motion, he handed it like a spinning plate to the vibraphonist Bill Ware, who obligingly carried it onward. Bass and drums struck up a crosscurrent, clattering and oblique, as Mr. Abbasi introduced a flinty melody, darting through the stir.The tune, “Uncommon Sense,” had never been played in public before, Mr. Abbasi said from the stage. Its title had two connotations. On one level it was subtly political — a nod, he suggested, to Capitol Hill — and on another level it was suggestively metaphysical. The song had been inspired, Mr. Abbasi said, by “the sixth, seventh and eighth senses we have internally that we don’t usually utilize in life.”How those extended realms of consciousness found traction in the music was left unspoken — couldn’t be spoken, perhaps. But with his comment Mr. Abbasi succeeded in making some fairly cerebral intricacies feel intuitive and touched by a higher purpose. This was savvy of him even if, as seemed to be the case, it was also sincere.Born in Pakistan but raised in California, and a New Yorker since the early 1990s, Mr. Abbasi has fashioned a career out of contemporary fusions, with keen insight and fleet technique. The focus of his music has sharpened notably in the last five years, alongside artists of overlapping perspective, like the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa. (Both are members of the Indo-Pak Coalition, an ingenious collaborative trio that also features the percussionist Dan Weiss.)The quartet, which also bills itself as RAAQ, is Mr. Abbasi’s chamber-jazz ensemble, partly a showcase for the medium-cool blend of acoustic guitar and vibraphone. But with Stephan Crump on bass and Eric McPherson on drums, it’s also a small-scale study in volatility, chiefly in the area of rhythm.'"
"'11-08-13,'0','These emotions aren’t particularly constructive in the long term, since they can be paralyzing or lead us to make hair-trigger decisions. And if we don’t stop to confront and untangle these feelings, they can easily lead us astray. So this weekend, I’d encourage you to see if any of the visceral reactions I describe below sound anything like your own internal conversations. Then, dig into them — and deploy some countermeasures.IGNORANCE Given that the stock market seems to be sending a message of utter confusion, there is no shame in admitting that you do not understand what is happening.The relentless chatter for days on end only compounds the problem. “People do not know what all of these economic terms mean,” said Kenneth Doyle, a psychologist and former financial planner who is now a professor at the University of Minnesota. “But they do know the fear in the voice of commentators, and everything looks dismal.”When the background noise gets too aggravating, turn it off and remind yourself what you do know. After all, the last dozen years have actually hammered home a number of basic personal finance principles.In 2000, we learned an important lesson about portfolio diversification when technology stocks collapsed. When Enron declared bankruptcy, it became clear that we should not make long-term investments with our life savings in company stock if we could possibly avoid it. And in the last five years, it’s become painfully clear that housing prices do not go up forever. Small down payments, meanwhile, can leave you stuck with a bad mortgage in a home that is worth less than the balance of your loan.This time, one lesson is already clear, even if the precise implications are not. Governments at all levels cannot pay for the services we once believed that we would have coming to us forever. In the future, many of us we will get less financial help in old age, spend more of our savings to make up the difference and pay more in taxes for the privilege.My plan is to put more money away, when I can, in savings accounts that are shielded from taxes or free from them entirely, like 529 college savings plans and Roth individual retirement accounts, and hope that the tax rules don’t somehow change midstream.FEAR If you’re scared, allow yourself to imagine the worst possible outcome. For most of us, it’s running out of money. So before you make any big changes to your portfolio, follow this fear to its logical conclusion. What would have to happen for you to be truly penniless?First, your investments would need to go to zero or be utterly ravaged by inflation. Social Security would have to cease to exist. Medicare would no longer pay for much, if anything. Medicaid would no longer pay for nursing home care for people without any other assets. And your family and friends would be unwilling to take you in or pitch in to help.Once you realize how unlikely this combination is, call a timeout on any big decisions and let your rational mind settle back in. “Put some distance between impulse and action,” said Brad Klontz, a psychologist and consultant specializing in financial matters. He adds that this is particularly important for men, who tend to react more emotionally than women.Simple things like intense exercise can help. Or, focus on a couple of financial tasks that you can control, like updating a will or crossing something else off that nagging list of financial to-dos.GUILT Sometimes the most damaging feelings are less about your own financial standing and more about how you’ve failed or disappointed others.Perhaps you couldn’t persuade your parents to scale back their stock exposure. Or you were too aggressive yourself with investing any college savings money you managed to put aside and are worried about saddling your child with student loan debt.This is the worst kind of myopia, though. You are more than the sum of your family’s stock returns, and their returns are about much more than stocks.Elderly relatives, for instance, will probably not see the same cuts to Social Security and Medicare that you will. And hopefully they also have at least some bonds or other holdings they can call on while waiting for stocks to recover. If they have a home that’s at least partly paid off, a reverse mortgage can help as a last resort measure, too. You can explain all of that and help them sort through it.If you are still employed, your biggest asset is probably your future income stream. If you haven’t lost your job this week, then you still have that going for you and can put it to work helping your children when (and if) they truly need it.BRAVADO If none of the above helps, it’s easy to fall prey to the damaging tendency to take drastic action.Carl Richards, whose posts on our Bucks blog sum up complex emotions in deceptively simple sketches, refers to this as the need to do something heroic.Kathleen Gurney, chief executive of the Financial Psychology Corporation, calls it the “manic response” that therapists look for and try to counteract. It’s the idea that going all in on gold will protect you, or that your Apple stock will, or foreign currencies or something else.This sort of single-minded response has made some people rich over the years and allowed others to lead a worry-free retirement if they timed the markets right and died within a couple of decades.But the risk of being wrong and living long is just too high for most people to make big bets like that today.If you still feel the need to do something, consider this self-assessment test from Ken French, a Tuck School of Business professor and stock market expert, who offers it as a frame of reference and not as a prediction of short-term performance.“Ask yourself how you are different from the market,” he said. “If you think you are particularly risk-averse relative to everyone else, then it makes perfect sense for you to sell.” Just don’t get in and repeat the cycle when things look as if they are turning up again.“If you think you are more risk-tolerant, then maybe this is an opportunity for you to buy,” he added, noting that the market may pay a small premium to people willing to endure the gyrations. “If you’re not averse to that volatility, you are getting a higher expected return for a modest psychological burden.”'"
"'11-08-13,'0','Soccer there brings purpose to people’s lives. For better and for worse, it binds them. This intensifies, rather than goes away, now that five teams are owned by Americans, two have Russian investors, one belongs to the ruling family of Abu Dhabi, another to an exiled Egyptian and two are heavily underwritten by Indian companies.The players are hired from all cultures, and the league is a global phenomenon of branding, betting and far-off fan worship.So who will win the 2011-12 season and who will find the pace just too expensive to keep up with?The bookmakers think they know. Manchester United tops their odds, again, followed by Chelsea and Manchester City.Fourth place is less easily predicted. The Boston owners of Liverpool spent relentlessly this summer, trying to buy players to put the team back where it historically belongs, among the contenders for the European Champions League title.To get there, Liverpool needs to finish at least fourth. So does Arsenal, again predominantly American-owned though with a big Russian stake. Tottenham, a few miles down the road from Arsenal, had a magnificent fling in the Champions League last season and is desperate to repeat it.The reasons are pride, satisfying the owner and the fan base — and money, money, money. A big club is nothing if it is not in the Champions League these days. Four English teams get invitations each season, and while Barcelona’s emphatic victory over Manchester United in May showed who was the best, the money that all the teams receive for taking part is extraordinary.Take the plight of Arsenal. Its coach, the urbane Frenchman Arsène Wenger, turned it into the most pleasing team for style in England. Better on the eye than Chelsea or Manchester City, at times more fluent than United, the Gunners of Arsenal on their day can outplay them all.But after building a new stadium to double its capacity to 60,000, Arsenal somehow lost the ability to turn performance into points. Wenger, its coach for 15 years, once made the team invincible and went a season unbeaten.The last seven years eroded that. Wenger still preaches his game, still tries to buy bargains and nurture youth to his cult. But six seasons without a trophy has made the supporters and some players restless.On the eve of the new season, Wenger now concedes that two key players will leave. Cesc Fàbregas, his captain and the fulcrum of his philosophy, is wanted by Barcelona, and wants to go. Wenger calls it a tug of two loves. Fàbregas was born in Barcelona and schooled in its academy until Wenger enticed him away as a 16-year-old.The offer to go back is a no-brainer. The deal will be done once Barça agrees to pay in the region of $57 million to buy back the talent it once had for free. His salary over five years will doubtless double that sum.Meanwhile, Manchester City, the biggest predator in the Premier League since Abu Dhabi began sinking $1 billion into it, is bidding to almost double the wages that Arsenal pays its French midfield creator, Samir Nasri. With a year to run on Nasri’s contract, and with City bidding about $37 million for him, Arsenal cannot hold a player against his will.The moves will leave Arsenal with money in the bank but only three weeks to hire replacements before the Aug. 31 deadline on player transfers in Europe.Arsenal’s opening game Saturday takes it north to Newcastle, where, in February, things went horribly wrong. That day, Wenger’s team stood shoulder to shoulder with Manchester United at the top, and Arsenal was pursuing four trophies. After 26 minutes, it led Newcastle, 4-0. By the end, typical of Arsenal’s defensive frailties, it was 4-4. Arsenal never recovered.Now making the long trip to Newcastle, Arsenal may redeem itself or confirm its uncertainty. But having finished only fourth last season, Arsenal must qualify for the Champions League and, safety permitting, it has a tough qualification game against Udinese in London on Tuesday. That will be followed by Premier League encounters against Liverpool and Manchester United, and in between them the second leg in Italy.Arsenal, then, is the first litmus test of the new season. In stark contrast, Liverpool has bought half a team, Manchester City has acquired the Argentine striker Sergio Agüero, Chelsea is hoping its new, young Portuguese coach can make Fernando Torres resemble the $80 million match-winner it thought it had bought in January.And United? It should be better than last season. Alex Ferguson, the team manager for 25 years, has already bought three young, dynamic players and given them a summer to jell. He seeks one more, the Dutchman Wesley Sneijder, to run his midfield.Ruthless in rebuilding his team, his own hunger undimmed as he nears 70, Ferguson sets out to land his 13th Premier League title since the league began 20 years ago. The rest are buying to catch up. Others, including the three promoted teams, Queens Park Rangers, Norwich and Swansea, face the almighty struggle to stay solvent and stay in the elite league.'"

"'11-08-14,'0','“It’s so good to have the animals here, to see cows when you look out the window or go for a walk,” said Brother Placid, who is still sorting out the profound change looming for the monastery and, most of all, for himself. “I’ll miss it a lot,” he said, “but I know that there comes a time in life when you have to retire.”But the shortage of young ranch hands reflects a far deeper threat, a lack of new recruits into the order. Currently, 28 monks are in residence, of a total of 57 who are affiliated with the abbey, a mix of ordained priests and brothers. Thirteen are out working as parish priests or in convents or schools. The others, mainly Colombians, are running an affiliated monastery and school in Bogotá that hopes one day to operate on its own.The last new American monk was accepted in 2002, and nine have died since then. “It’s frightening,” Father Brian Wangler, the abbot, said of the downward trend. “But what it challenges is one’s faith. Who’s in charge here? Is God in charge or are we?” He said that six men joined the abbey from 1997 to 2002, most of them presenting themselves out of nowhere.One of about 40 Benedictine monasteries in the United States, Assumption Abbey was established by Swiss monks in the 1890s, located near this rail-stop town because it was populated by Roman Catholic, German-speaking immigrants from Russia and Hungary. (Many of the monks, including Brother Placid, share that heritage.)For decades, the abbey grew its own food and raised pigs, chickens and dairy cows for consumption and profit, but as these became unprofitable, beef ranching became the last vestige of a farming heritage. Brother Michael Taffe, 51, who earned a doctorate in psychology before becoming a monk at 40, said the loss of the cattle would cause “a grieving process.”Brother Michael is in charge of recruitment efforts, which include visits to Catholic schools and advertisements in Catholic magazines. He said four men had seemed like potential candidates in recent years and came for trial stays, but decided the life was not for them.Many of the monks entered in their teens or early 20s, in some cases after attending the boarding high school and two-year college the abbey ran until 1971, when the cost became prohibitive. In today’s world of vaster choices, the abbey would be wary of someone so young, Brother Michael said. Candidates must truly know, he said, that “this will make me whole.”The order harks back to St. Benedict, who in the sixth century laid out rules for monasteries that would be apart from society but not cloistered, where monks would live communally, without personal property, sharing kitchen and cleaning duties and spending most of their time in prayer or work. Nuns also draw on the tradition, in Benedictine convents.Once they join, monks are expected to spend the rest of their lives with the abbey. Each day, they attend prayer services at 6:20 a.m. and 11:40 a.m., Mass at 5 p.m. and vespers at 7 p.m., and spend more time in solitary prayer or study. Many wear street clothes during the day — Brother Placid wears blue jeans and a Western shirt — but all wear habits for the evening services.Many also pursue special interests like gardening, tending bluebird houses, keeping bees or making scented soaps to sell to visitors.It is a quiet life, but hardly a hair-shirt existence. Some monks watch the news or baseball in the evening. On Saturday nights they get popcorn, beer and a rented movie.It is all in the service of God and, Father Wangler emphasized, of the broader community as well as the inner self. “This is a place where certain values, hopefully, will radiate out,” he said. “We hope people can realize the secret — there is a God, and it’s worth dedicating your life to God.”Brother Placid, displaying the taciturn nature of the northern Plains, stumbled as he tried to explain why he joined the abbey at age 22. Growing up in a large North Dakota family, he had quit school after junior high and worked on his parents’ farm.“There was no revelation,” he said after a long pause. “God has a plan for everybody, and I feel I’m serving God.”He came alive when he drove a pickup out into the pastures, now teeming with grasshoppers, dragonflies and butterflies. Most of the cows were skittish at first, but he walked up to a friendly one, dubbed Agnes by one of the monks, and started scratching her back. “They like it when someone scratches their backs,” he said. “I’d like it, too.”“They know far more than people think they know,” he said, describing how cows recognize their own calves in a crowd by sight, sound and smell. The loud bellowing, he said, carries secret messages.For the first couple of decades, he wrangled cows while riding bareback because he never learned to use a saddle. More recently, he and another monk have herded the cattle using a noisy one-seat vehicle that does not slip through trees as easily as a horse, he said, “but doesn’t eat when it’s not being used.”Yet the work remains grueling and physical, as became clear the other day when Brother Placid spotted three cows limping from foot rot, a bacterial disease that has afflicted the herd this year. It took two monks and a neighbor most of a hot, dusty afternoon to drive the herd back to the main corrals so the afflicted cows and their calves could be separated out for a few days. Stuffing cow-size sulfa pills down the throats of thrashing 1,300-pound animals, penned in a narrow metal chute, was a feat in itself.This phase-out summer of ranching already feels strange, Brother Placid said, because for the first time they are not baling hay for the winter. And what comes next?“I might have to clean the bathrooms,” he said with a smile. “You never get to retire in the monastery.”'"
"'11-08-14,'0','In 2010, investors redeemed $152 billion from one-star, two-star and three-star funds and placed $304 billion in four-star and five-star funds. In the crisis-scarred year of 2008, even as investors withdrew $174 billion from one-star, two-star and three-star funds, they added $47 billion to four-star and five-star funds. Year in and year out, flows to four-star and five-star funds prove remarkably resilient and overshadow flows to the three bottom categories.This churning of investor portfolios hurts investor returns. First, brokers and advisers use the pointless buying and selling to increase and to justify their all-too-rich compensation.  Second, the mutual fund industry uses the star-rating system to encourage performance-chasing (selling funds that performed poorly and buying funds that performed well).  In other words, investors sell low and buy high.Ill-advised buying and selling of funds costs the investing public a substantial sum. In 2010, Morningstar found that if mutual fund investors in 2000, as a whole, had simply bought and held their funds for 10 years, their investment outcomes would have improved by an average of 1.6 percentage points per year. That 1.6 percent may not sound like much, but it adds up to tens of billions of dollars per year. Another Morningstar study, in 2005, examined 10 years of returns for 17 categories of stock funds. In each category, the actual returns — after taking into account the ill-timed buying and selling — fell short of the returns that were advertised to the public. More stable funds performed better; more volatile funds performed worse.Highly volatile technology funds, for example, generated annual returns that were a stunning 13.4 percent below the reported results, as a direct result of monumentally mistimed buying and selling. Holders of less volatile conservative allocation funds suffered only a 0.3 percent annual deficit.Even while the investing public suffers from exposure to funds with volatile performance, the mutual fund industry benefits. With a volatile set of offerings, the fund companies will always have some (temporarily) strong performers that rise to the top and earn the four or five stars needed for marketing to a gullible public. Of course, the volatility cuts both ways, ensuring that erstwhile top performers fall to the bottom and end up with one star or two stars. From a business perspective, however, all is not lost, as a number of one-star and two-star funds, with sufficiently volatile strategies, will rise phoenix-like from the ashes and join the exalted ranks of four- and five-star funds.Why isn’t there more of an outcry? Investors naïvely trust their brokers and advisers. Most understand too little about financial markets to make informed decisions, intervene too frequently in counterproductive ways and gather too little information about portfolio holdings to evaluate results. Investors like to believe they are doing well, even when they are not.Meanwhile, the mutual fund industry shouts through a megaphone, making campaign contributions to influence politicians and lobbying to avoid regulation. Without any offsetting pressure from the investing public, Wall Street crushes Main Street.What should be done? First, individual investors should take control of their financial destinies, educate themselves, avoid sales pitches and invest in a well-diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, like those offered by Vanguard, which operates on a not-for-profit basis. (Even Morningstar concludes, in a remarkably frank study, that low costs do a better job of predicting superior performance than do the firm’s own five-star ratings.) Such a strategy reduces the fees paid to the parasitic mutual fund industry, leaving more money in the hands of the investing public.Second, the Securities and Exchange Commission should employ its considerable regulatory and enforcement powers to encourage individual investors to embrace low-cost index funds and shun the broker-driven churning of high-cost, actively managed funds.The S.E.C. should think outside the box in policing the behavior of the mutual fund industry. What about a requirement that every mutual fund offering be accompanied by an index-fund alternative, with the burden of proof on the vendor to justify the sale of a high-cost product? Fund companies, brokers and advisers would have to list all fees associated with the fund offering, along with a description of the impact on expected returns. Over time, mutual fund purveyors would have to provide a head-to-head comparison of the recommended fund and the index fund alternative (including the impact of taxes), demonstrating as clearly as possible the long-term superiority of low-cost, tax-efficient index funds.Third, the S.E.C. should hold the mutual fund industry to a “fiduciary standard,” one that puts clients’ interests first. Currently, retail brokers operate under a weaker standard. As it carries out the Dodd-Frank reform act that became law last year, the S.E.C. must insist that brokers act as fiduciaries, not merely as agents who offer “suitable” investments. For all players in the mutual fund industry — brokers, advisers and fund managers — strong fiduciary standards and investor-oriented regulatory oversight would subordinate the pecuniary interests of the fund purveyors to the interests of the individual investors that the industry purports to serve.For two decades, laissez-faire attitudes toward financial markets allowed the rich and powerful to take advantage of those less well-off. In the mutual fund world, the hands-off approach must be abandoned in favor of aggressive, intelligent regulation.This is serious business. The financial security of millions of Americans hangs in the balance.'"
"'11-08-14,'0','Detained lieutenants for cartels have told the police that some act as lookouts. Other women work as drug mules, killers, or as “la gancha” (the hook), using their beauty to attract male kidnapping victims. At least one woman, Sandra Ávila Beltrán, became a major cartel leader, before her arrest in 2007 for trafficking and money laundering.Perhaps this shouldn’t be surprising. More women are working in every aspect of the economy, “including drug trafficking,” said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an assistant professor of government at the University of Texas, Brownsville. Yet, because Mexico’s justice system is so opaque, incompetent and corrupt, it is nearly impossible to know which prisoners deserve their punishment. Human rights lawyers say this is especially true for women, who are often unwittingly used by men they love. Several women at the prison, for example, said they only realized after their arrests that the cars they were caught driving had been packed full of drugs by boyfriends or brothers.And in a society as traditional as Mexico’s — where women are responsible for virtue and order, as Octavio Paz once wrote — mere involvement in crime is enough to cause outrage and fascination. Mexicans (and Hispanic telenovela viewers in the United States) simply cannot get enough of feminized crime. One of the most popular novels in Mexico today is “Queen of the South,” which follows a Mexican woman who becomes the most powerful drug trafficker in southern Spain. When Telemundo made it a telenovela this year, it became a ratings bonanza on both sides of the border.Many of the women at El Cereso have received similar notoriety. Eunice Ramírez, 19, is the most famous. She was arrested last November for luring men into places where they could be kidnapped, and immediately photos from her Facebook page appeared nationwide, mostly showing her in a bikini.American border patrol agents say that they have also been catching more attractive teenagers in short skirts with drugs taped to their inner thighs.The result, here at least, is a female prison population both gang-connected and perfume-scented. Most of the 160 women here at El Cereso — one of several prisons with women a few walls apart from male inmates — are between 18 and 26. At least a third are still awaiting trial, most are charged with drug possession or trafficking, and daily life in their shared cells looks almost juvenile. Ms. Núñez’s walls feature a poster of Disney princesses; others are decorated with heart stickers.This is nonetheless a dangerous place. Guards separate the women, as they do the men, by gang affiliation. Conflicts are common. “Every day,” said Ms. Núñez, her neck full of bruises, “there is at least one fight.” Or worse — a week after our visit, 17 inmates, including one woman, were killed in what the authorities described as a series of gang executions with automatic rifles smuggled into the complex.It only highlighted the wide gap between the sexy myth of feminized crime, as portrayed on the Web and in telenovelas, and the more complex reality. Ms. Ramírez in particular fails to live up to her sensational billing. In person, she is painfully shy, speaking with a heavy lisp, barely above a whisper. When we met, she was busy with her visiting 2-year-old daughter, who had her mother’s onyx eyes, and a face severely scarred by burns sustained when arsonists burned down the family’s house after Ms. Ramírez’s arrest.Some of the women here say they turned to crime to make money to meet their children’s needs. Other mothers, maintaining their innocence, say they are racked with guilt for being forced to abandon their families. Ms. Núñez, who arrived here three months pregnant, said her biggest regret was ever becoming friends with the group involved in the kidnapping. Although several in the group, men and women, are also inmates at El Cereso, she said: “We never talk. I have no one.”Indeed, above all else, the women seem to feel lonely and misunderstood. Karla Solorio, 26, serving time for a drug conviction, said that she often cried at night thinking of her 7-year-old son.“I’m just a reject,” she said, dabbing at her eyes to avoid ruining her makeup. “I’m not someone who works. I’m not someone with a family. I’m just a prisoner.”'"
"'11-08-14,'0','JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) — The Youth League of the governing party in South Africa apologized Saturday to the bloc’s leadership for comments in which it called for the ouster of Botswana’s democratically elected government.The governing party, the African National Congress, publicly criticized the Youth League and its leader, Julius Malema, this month for the remarks. A party spokesman, Jackson Mthembu, told eNews Channel that its leaders would discuss the matter but would not say whether Mr. Malema would be disciplined.The Youth League said in a statement that it “has never, and will never, define itself outside the policy confines and directives of the A.N.C., and will whenever expected be available to listen to political and organizational guidance from the leadership.”Mr. Malema has already been a thorn in the side for the party over his racially divisive comments and repeated calls for the nationalization of mines in South Africa, a major supplier of platinum, gold and diamonds. But he also holds a significant populist appeal for much of South Africa’s black population, and senior party leadership has often turned to courting him publicly.'"

(The president who will not be there in person will be on speakerphone.) He also said there was the issue of which university would become the 14th team, something many in college sports will monitor.“We realize if we do this, we have to have the 14th,” the SEC official said. “No name has been thrown out. This thing is much slower out of the chute than the media and blogs have made it.”The official said that three weeks ago, Texas A&M’s president, R. Bowen Loftin, called the SEC commissioner, Mike Slive, and said the Aggies regretted not joining the league last summer. Two weeks ago, Slive and the SEC counsel met with Texas A&M officials. The SEC requested that Texas A&M figure out the legal viability of leaving the Big 12 contract it signed last year.“We’re very sensitive about being part of breaking a contract,” the official said. “What we asked them to do was to go settle their issues and not have us be on the table as the agent of causing them to leave.”The SEC official said he wondered if the presidents would vote for A&M only if they were assured that a team from one of their states — Florida State, Clemson or Georgia Tech, for example — would not be added. “I’m going to try and say, don’t bring it up now,” the SEC official said. “That shouldn’t be a condition or part of the negotiation for this next issue. But it could.”'"

Why is this so important?It’s because AAA United States Treasury bonds have been the linchpin of the global financial system, and the center of myriad calculations in business, portfolio construction and capital markets.In this context, Mr. El-Erian said, the downgrade represents a wide perception of instability in the world’s financial structure. “We lived in a world in which ‘risk free’ and United States Treasuries were interchangeable terms,” he said, “a world in which it was assumed that the United States would safeguard its pristine AAA rating, and protect the dollar, the world’s reserve currency.” Now, for many around the planet, the world’s core seems much less solid.Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University, says the true rate for a “risk-free investment,” which had been assumed to be the 10-year Treasury yield, now needs to be “approximated,” a procedure heretofore required for emerging markets. “The distinction between developed and emerging markets has blurred,” he said, “and will require a fundamental rethinking.”Eugene F. Fama, a finance professor at the University of Chicago, said S.& P.’s move was “a nonevent in itself, because it merely reflected a view that was already well understood by the markets.” But, he added, it reflected “a great deal of pessimism out there, a great deal of uncertainty” over whether Western governments would resolve their fiscal dilemmas. “Capitalism itself is under duress,” he said.Mr. Fama, a leading theoretician of efficient markets, said the current volatility “is exactly what you’d expect when efficient markets are confronted by massive uncertainty.”Not that the Treasuries have been supplanted by another putative risk-free security. In the current crisis, Treasuries have been very much in demand. Their prices have soared, and yields, which move in the opposite direction, have plummeted. Thanks in part to a Federal Reserve pledge last week to keep rates low until at least 2013, the 10-year note fell on Friday to 2.25 percent.Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, predicted correctly in May that the 10-year Treasury yield would dip below 2.5 percent over the summer as the economy weakened and investors sought a haven from greater distress in Europe. Now, he says, long-term government bond yields are likely to remain very low for several years, and the Fed is likely to ease monetary conditions further.There is more risk in the global financial system, he says, but for canny investors, it has created a “phenomenally good time to buy.” He sees bargains in stocks as well as in municipal bonds. Over the long haul, he said, he’s also bullish on gold, but added that “its recent parabolic rise will lead to a correction, so this isn’t the time to buy it.”If the American economy doesn’t lurch into recession, and if corporate earnings stay strong, then stocks are far better priced than government bonds, said Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW. For a while last week, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped below the dividend yield on the S.& P. 500, a rare occurrence, according to Birinyi Associates, a research firm. It also happened in the 2008-9 financial crisis, presaging the stock market bottom of March 2009.While there will be opportunities for astute investors, Mr. El-Erian says that in addition to a “new normal” of slow economic growth and high unemployment, we must now also grapple with a weakening of the financial system’s core. “We will be living in a more volatile world,” he said.'"
"'11-08-14,'0','NO wonder they are called conveniences. Flush toilets swirl human waste down the drain quickly and neatly. But the convenience comes with a rising price for all that follows the flush — a cost that is often paid by municipal water and sewage treatment systems.Now some groups are rethinking the venerable technology of the flush toilet, particularly for regions that lack such systems or for places where waste water treatment plants, many of them aging, are overburdened by the demands of fast-growing populations.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has begun a “Reinvent the Toilet” competition and awarded $3 million to researchers at eight universities, challenging them to use recent technology to create models that needn’t be connected to sewers, or to water and electricity lines, and that cost less than pennies per person a day to use. Later prizes will include financing for one or more winning prototypes to be tested and produced commercially.“The present toilet is a 19th-century device that does not meet the needs of a vast part of the world’s population,” said Frank Rijsberman, an executive at the foundation. Instead, he said, about 2.6 billion people without access to sewer-linked systems must use simple latrines, holes in the ground or just the nearest available spot — a situation that can lead to many health problems, like acute childhood diarrhea.One of the new toilets being financed by the foundation is a compact chamber that runs on solar power from a roof panel and uses built-in electrochemical technology to process waste.“We can clean the waste water up to the same level as would come out of a treatment plant,” said Michael R. Hoffmann, a professor of environmental science at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who received $400,000 to develop this solar toilet. It uses the sun’s energy to power an electrode system in the waste water; the electrodes drive a series of cleansing chemical reactions, converting organic waste in the water into carbon dioxide and producing hydrogen that can be stored in a fuel cell for night operation.'"

"'11-08-14,'0','Tied to my fandom, as for a lot of Potterphiles, was a sense of loyalty to the series; the idea that the books I loved were not just good but Good, something to believe in even if they were a product. J. K. Rowling’s story seemed miraculous: each book was better than the last, and the later films improved significantly on the early, Chris Columbus-directed disappointments. While other franchises (like “Star Wars”) alienated their fans with subpar prequels and embarrassing characters, the Harry Potter books never abused me. (This despite the early novels’ focus on Dobby, a house-elf who threatened to be the Jar Jar Binks of the series but turned into a resonant, or at least tolerable, character all his own.) I remained loyal to Harry because he remained loyal to me.As the books became popular beyond imagining — as news reports credited them for a rebirth of reading among kids, even as critics attacked them as poorly written and simplistic — I also became a defender. In conversation and e-mail and on message boards, I took umbrage at high-culture gatekeepers, like A. S. Byatt and Harold Bloom, who dismissed the books that, to my mind, were getting darker, more interesting and more complex.That this kind of infatuation is akin to the first blush of romantic love didn’t escape me — especially when that affection began to overtake my ability to function as a grown human being. The night the fifth novel was released, for example, I had dinner with the partners of the law firm that had recently hired my wife. I spent the whole evening lost in a fever of anticipation, barely able to participate in adult conversation as I thought of the object that at that moment was sitting in a box in the receiving room of the bookstore down the street. (It made me only slightly less embarrassed to know that my wife was feeling the exact same way.) The tale that had been interrupted three years earlier was about to restart: how could Harry return to the Dursleys after barely escaping with his life? How would he and his friends respond to the death of Cedric? What did it mean that Harry and Voldemort had wands with the same phoenix-feather core? All this seemed so much more pressing than the firm’s proud history. After drinks with the associates, my wife and I raced to the bookstore in our business garb and, at the stroke of midnight, bought two copies of the fat hardcover. We ended our celebratory evening by staying up another two hours reading side by side in bed.In fact, on all of the series’s significant nights — book releases, movie premieres — my love for Harry’s story became uncomfortably public. My passion forced me to come face to face with others who were, basically, no different from me, even though they were wackos dressed up like Voldemort for a midnight screening. (I was simply an adult lined up with wackos for a midnight screening.) I’d think: Is this the kind of person I am? Am I really publicly announcing my devotion to a fictional character here at the Regal Cinemas E-Walk?We fans often snidely complain about corporations wringing these properties dry, yet we can be guilty of this, too. It’s a condition of modern fandom that, thanks to the Internet, you can now happily drown in your own devotion, sinking arm in arm with fellow devotees. You can edit Hermione tributes on YouTube, or write slash fiction about Remus and Sirius in love, or (as I did) simply devour every piece of speculation and spoilage about the books and movies that you can find. A turn-of-the-century fan might have loved “Little Women” as much as modern fans love Harry Potter. But no turn-of-the-century girl ever spent three hours creating the perfect animated GIF to use as her avatar on TeamJoAndLaurie.com.The spring before the seventh and final book was released, I got a full-time job as a culture blogger, and my own relationship with Harry became both more intense and more predatory. Suddenly the books were no longer a private passion but a subject out of which to spin endless blog posts and freelance articles. My love of Hogwarts wasn’t something that made me nerdy; it was something that made me valuable, a bucket with which my bewildered editors could pull readers from the vast ocean of other nerds out there, all as hungry as I was to read about the series.In a way I became just like the studio, seeking ancillary outlets for my product. They owned Harry Potter; I owned encyclopedic knowledge about Harry Potter. Both of us were contributing to the enormous glut of Potteralia on the market. What was the difference between my click-friendly slide shows and their half-dozen spinoff books, the theme park, video games, LEGO sets, $35 collectible wands or the obscenely vibrating broom that was, of course, discontinued? That’s not to mention the samizdat stuff: the unauthorized guides, the unofficial Web sites, the knockoff Magical Harry action figure I saw in an Inwood bodega once — a dead ringer, except that the scar on his forehead was in the wonderfully phenomenological shape of a question mark.Now it’s all coming to an end. Most likely, this is the last time I’ll ever get to write about the boy wizard, and I’m grateful that I no longer will poke and prod the characters I love to find one more way to exploit them. And like most devotees, I think, I’m grateful that the culture industry is mostly done with them, too.The movies are over. In recent years the books have even fallen off, for weeks on end, the Times Children’s Series best-seller list — the list that was created in 2004 because J. K. Rowling was hogging the Children’s Fiction list, which itself was created in 2000 because J. K. Rowling was hogging the fiction list. Presumably everyone on earth who could buy them has bought them, although Rowling’s new Web site, Pottermore, reminds us that soon we’ll need to repurchase in electronic form, like Beatles albums.Nevertheless, someday soon my interaction with Harry Potter will cease revolving around things I buy, or watch, or download, or stream, or debate over e-mail. So will yours. Soon all we crazed fans will have only those dog-eared paperbacks, spines broken from mornings on the subway or afternoons at the beach, lined up on the bookshelf.That’s where I found Harry the other night. I pulled “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” down and held it for a moment, then carried it into my older daughter’s room, where she waited in the lamplight, the sheet pulled up to her chin. “I thought we’d start reading this tonight,” I said, showing her the cover.“Harry Potter!” she exclaimed. She knows of him, of course — how could she not, after six years as my daughter — but to her he’s a stock character in the sprawling playground adventures all kindergartners have, alongside Superman and Rapunzel and Darth Vader and Buzz Lightyear and Kate Middleton.I thought about how my daughter will one day have her own story that compels her like no other. Maybe it will be Lucy Pevensie’s or Katniss Everdeen’s. Perhaps the story of Laura Ingalls Wilder or Anne Shirley. Or more likely, some as-yet-unwritten tale being dreamed up somewhere right now.Or maybe it’ll be Harry’s. If so, this is where it will start. And I’ll feel grateful that I was here — and envious, because it seems very likely that I’ll never feel that blossoming of wild fandom in myself ever again.I sat next to her on the bed and opened the book. She scooted closer.'"
"'11-08-14,'0','She was a folk singer, and I tried to sing folk songs, so we had that in common. When we first started talking, Amy was unable to record her songs, but as time and technology changed it became easier than ever, until she was able to e-mail me her songs.After years of “chatting,” I actually heard her voice: a weathered, pretty thing, seemingly encased in a bygone era, unmarred by modernity. It was Southern, lilting, traumatizing, and this was just an MP3.It’s strange how the phone is the next step in social connection these days, as if that is somehow more serious, more personal, more dangerous than, say, letting someone into your daily thoughts and photos.But Amy and I started to call each other. A blizzard had just swept through Portland, so during a bout of cabin fever I began writing songs for her. In these songs I could travel south for the winter, run away from home and feel something tangible. I distracted myself with these notions of what might be if I were there, or if she were here.At the same time, our calls grew longer. We started to tell each other secrets. She spoke with inflections that couldn’t hide behind text, sweet memories that translated only by hearing her voice, however distorted and fractured a poor signal might cause it to be.In the spring we graduated to Skype. Finally, face to face. She would sit in the computer lab at her university and we’d talk into the early morning. We brought guitars and played our songs to each other. I sang louder than I had ever sung. I hit my highs and didn’t crack at the lows. I wonder how much she actually heard and how much was garbled by my weak Wi-Fi, her beautiful face often contorted into a mess of pixels.Then it was her turn. Somehow, I heard every word. One verse in particular stood out:Sparrow, won’t you fly down south by me?Sparrow, build your home in the belly of the beast.Lay me in the sand, in the sand by the sea,There’s a devil in the land and a devil that’s in me.When she was done, we just looked at each other. We didn’t have to say anything. If we were to be together, it would be at the expense of many things in our real worlds. Still, was she singing that to me because she couldn’t say it? Or was it like that Carly Simon song, and I just thought it was about me?Vain or not, we started planning my escape.“What if she’s different in person?” my friend Matt posited one morning over breakfast in the dorms. “What if you don’t like her?” I had already assured him that she wasn’t a 400-pound man who wanted to murder me.I responded with a laugh, never actually thinking of the risks. I was giving myself a four-day weekend on the other side of the country right before finals. What could go wrong?All of my friends half-supported and half-laughed at what I was about to do. Jeremy rightfully smiled at my naïveté but gave me his blessing. When I cautiously told Beth, prefacing it with disclaimers, she reassured me: “Hey, that’s the world we live in now: no borders.” Samiat drove me to the airport, and on the way she kept gushing at how “cute” I looked.I was on air. The mere act of leaving felt almost as good as seeing Amy. This act would be my pièce de résistance, the existential proof that love was the answer, the convergence of art, romance and technology that would make everything beautiful.On the airplane, though, I was really sweaty. Just roasting. My hair was a mess, and I’d forgotten to brush my teeth. I had decided not to shave, thinking Amy might like my “beard.” But feeling my face, I realized it was a terrible idea.As the plane approached the runway, I pictured myself in a lunar module, anticipating the impact. I was a space kid, always traveling in my imagination, and old habits die hard. I exited the plane and walked down that corridor. I felt weightless; my heart was pounding and some insects entangled with my insides.Every girl looked like Amy. My heart skipped with every imitation Amy. I walked past the automatic doors. Each of them opened with another possible Amy. I half expected to find one with a trombone, and one with a banjo, like those charming pictures she used to post.It was a comedy; how many cute girls with asymmetrical bangs and perfect bone structure could exist in Georgia? I paced back and forth, walking around the baggage claim, frantically checking my cellphone.And then, there she was. Just like that, I could feel her in my arms. This was her body. This was her face. She was here. I was here. I felt enveloped; feeling her close to me was like outer space, with all its questions: Is it infinite or contained? Linear or cyclical?Now, here is where there are gaps. I know we held hands through Piedmont Park in Atlanta as a busker played “I’m Waiting for the Man,” and I know we drove to McDonough and kissed for the first time on the floor of her turquoise childhood bedroom, and I know we went to a Wal-Mart and danced for the security cameras, and I know I took a nap in her lap at a cemetery in Macon.And I know that we decided not to continue our relationship. We both knew we couldn’t move close. But we also knew, after this, that we couldn’t just go back behind our computer screens. All of these things are knowable and definable and yet obscured and opaque.The truth is, Amy feels like a ghost in static now. I have kept all the evidence: old e-mails and chats, text messages, her songs. My memory of her feels contained within servers and hard drives, locked away and inaccessible. In my mind’s eye, I keep parsing through the same remnants of my time with her, the same jpegs, the same docs, the same pieces to construct a patchwork past of those four days.WHEN I went to Georgia, we took photographs with a black-and-white disposable camera, and this is what I can remember: only the threads between these pictures. We thought we were documenting it for posterity, but there they are, haunting me with an exactness that doesn’t even scratch the surface.Then, sometimes, there will be a moment, like catching a breeze from a window, where a wisp of memory will trigger and flood: the goldenrod color of her blouse, her freckles and cheeks stretching into a smile, holding her crying face.And, of course, Amy’s voice, finally clear and finally close, a song whispered in French, a foreign tongue I never learned.When we have spoken since our last meeting, Amy has always reached out through the distortion. On one such occasion, when I was feeling quite low, she simply told me that love is a moment in time.Even in this time — because of this time — our moment was possible. Sometimes, I have to remind myself.'"

"'11-08-15,'1','The case has generated fury at a bishop who was already a polarizing figure in his diocese, and there are widespread calls for him to resign or even to be prosecuted. Parishioners started a Facebook page called “Bishop Finn Must Go” and are circulating a petition. An editorial in The Kansas City Star in June calling for the bishop to step down concluded that prosecutors must “actively pursue all relevant criminal charges” against everyone involved.Stoking much of the anger is the fact that only three years ago, Bishop Finn settled lawsuits with 47 plaintiffs in sexual abuse cases for $10 million and agreed to a long list of preventive measures, among them to immediately report anyone suspected of being a pedophile to law enforcement authorities.Michael Hunter, an abuse victim who was part of that settlement and is now the president of the Kansas City chapter of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said: “There were 19 nonmonetary agreements that the diocese signed on to, and they were things like reporting immediately to the police. And they didn’t do it. That’s really what sickens us as much as the abuse.”The bishop has apologized and released a “five-point plan” that he described as “sweeping changes.” He hired an ombudsman to field reports of suspicious behavior and appointed an investigator to conduct an independent review of the events and diocesan policies. The investigator’s report is taking longer than expected and is now due in late August or early September, said Rebecca Summers, director of communications in the diocese.The bishop also replaced the vicar general involved in the case, Msgr. Robert Murphy, after he was accused of propositioning a young man in 1984. The diocese has delayed a capital fund-raising campaign on the advice of its priests, a move first reported by The National Catholic Reporter.Bishop Finn, who was appointed in 2005, alienated many of his priests and parishioners, and won praise from others, when he remade the diocese to conform with his traditionalist theological views. He is one of few bishops affiliated with the conservative movement Opus Dei.He canceled a model program to train Catholic laypeople to be leaders and hired more staff members to recruit candidates for the priesthood. He cut the budget of the Office of Peace and Justice, which focused on poverty and human rights, and created a new Respect Life office to expand the church’s opposition to abortion and stem cell research. He set up a parish for a group of Catholics who prefer to celebrate the old Tridentine Mass in Latin.Father Ratigan, 45, was also an outspoken conservative, according to a profile in The Kansas City Star. He and a class of Catholic school students joined Bishop Finn for the bus ride to the annual March for Life rally in Washington in 2007.The diocese was first warned about Father Ratigan’s inappropriate interest in young girls as far back as 2006, according to accusations in the civil lawsuit filed Thursday. But there were also more recent warnings.In May 2010, the principal of a Catholic elementary school where Father Ratigan worked hand-delivered a letter to the vicar general reporting specific episodes that had raised alarms: the priest put a girl on his lap during a bus ride and allowed children to reach into his pants pockets for candy. When a Brownie troop visited Father Ratigan’s house, a parent reported finding a pair of girl’s panties in a planter, the letter said.Bishop Finn said at a news conference that he was given a “brief verbal summary” of the letter at the time, but did not read it until a year later.In December, a computer technician discovered the photographs on Father Ratigan’s laptop and turned it in to the diocese. The next day, the priest was discovered in his closed garage, his motorcycle running, along with a suicide note apologizing to the children, their families and the church.Father Ratigan survived, was taken to a hospital and was then sent to live at a convent in the diocese, where, the lawsuit and the indictment say, he continued to have contact with children.Parents in the school and parishioners were told only that Father Ratigan had fallen sick from carbon monoxide poisoning. They were stunned when he was arrested in May.“My daughter made cards for him,” said one parent who did not want her name used because the police said her daughter might have been a victim. “We prayed for him every single night at dinner. It was just lying to us and a complete cover-up.”A federal grand jury last Tuesday charged Father Ratigan with 13 counts of possessing, producing and attempting to produce child pornography. It accused him of taking lewd pictures of the genitalia of five girls ages 2 to 12, sometimes while they slept. If convicted, he would face a minimum of 15 years in prison.'"
"'11-08-15,'1','I telephoned Branca. Best he knew, his mother had been a Catholic all her life. He encouraged me to let him know what I found.I passed the question to Michael Miller, a close friend and a professor of Jewish history in . He contacted a Hungarian Jewish genealogy group. And now, at the country club where Branca has lived since 1977, I laid before him the records that Miller and the group had found. They included:¶ The 1884 marriage of Ignatz Berger and Antonia Gipsz, a ceremony at which Jakob Friedman, a rabbi in Sandorf, had officiated.¶ The births of the couple’s eight children over the next 12 years: Kati, the eldest, and Miksa, Sandor, Irma, Fanni, Sandor, Moricz and Jozsef. (The first Sandor died as a toddler.)¶ The mohels and sandeks who performed each bris and held each boy during the circumcisions.¶ The arrival of Kati in the United States. On Nov. 17, 1901, a gatekeeper at Ellis Island categorized her as single, Hungarian, a seamstress, white, literate and “Isr”— Israelite, signifying a Jew.And there was the death of Jozsef. On June 12, 1942, the Nazis deported him, his wife, Janka, their daughter, Helene, and their sons, Henrich and Ignatz. Jozsef was killed at the Majdanek concentration camp, his wife and children at Sobibor. Kati had two other siblings who remained in . I did not learn how Moricz died. But helped by Yad Vashem, ’s Holocaust museum, I later learned that Irma, together with her husband, Arthur Grünmandl, her daughter Paula and her son Oscar, died at Auschwitz in 1942, one year before Branca turned professional in Olean, N.Y., pitching at age 17 for Manager Jake Pitler.When I had phoned Branca and told him that his mother, Kati, was Jewish and that thus, according to traditional Jewish law, he and his 16 siblings were, too, the loud man was quiet. But when I had told him of the murder of his uncle, Branca had looked for words. “Uh, oh, boy,” he had said. “My mother never mentioned this to me.”Branca took hold of the papers, a burden of identification suddenly real. I asked how his wife had responded to his newfound past. “You’ve always practiced, you’ve always been a Catholic,” she had said. They hadn’t spoken of it since.Branca ordered a Caesar , and I asked if he was interested in learning more about Judaism. There was much to tell, starting with the fact that the worst day of his life, 60 Octobers past, had been a minor Jewish fast day.“I know enough,” he said. “I know their customs, Seder.”Kati had raised her children to be open-minded, to accept the Jews, blacks, Irish, Germans and fellow Italians who packed the 4.21 square miles that made up Mount Vernon, N.Y. Their town was teeming with new last names, with the turning over of new leaves. And as is often the case with those who take up a new religion, it was Branca’s mother and not his father who was the more devout Catholic, he said. She saw to it that the children were baptized and confirmed. She frequently went with Branca to Mass during World War II. And she gave him a medallion of St. Christopher to wear when he broke in with the in 1944. (Through three and a third innings, the Christian martyr warded off all dangers save a solo homer by Phil Weintraub — one of four Jews in the league.)Back at the country club, Branca eyed four duffers through the restaurant window. “Maybe that’s why God’s mad at me — that I didn’t practice my mother’s religion,” he said. He was smiling but sincere, a Job wondering about the root of his suffering. “He made me throw that home run pitch. He made me get injured the next year. Remember, Jesus was a Jew.”For Branca to posit that the home run, the great hinge of his life, was a curse was a striking departure for him. Hours after it flew, a Jesuit priest had put forth to the Catholic pitcher an explanation of his victimhood that rang true: God had chosen him to yield the home run because God knew his faith was strong enough to sustain him through what would follow. Yes it was, thought Branca. And so ever since, even as the goat endured public discourteousness for 60 years, he praised God, reciting every morning and night the a and a couplet of his own: “Make me worthy of your love; make my love worthy of you.”Branca paused from his lunch to let forth a burst of philosemitism — declaiming the health benefits of kashrut and , the synonymy of Judaism with charity, leadership, patriotism, brains.“When I was in school, the smartest kids were the Jewish kids,” he said. I pointed out that he was one of them. (He went to .) Branca answered, “I didn’t know that.”Branca had to find room for his Jewishness in his life story, and quite literally. His autobiography, was due out in September. He inserted two sentences.Branca’s roots may well increase sales among the People of the Book. In 1951, one of every three Brooklynites was a Jew, and many held as fast to their chosen team as to their inherited religion. But when word gets out that the great goat was doubly  chosen — that the baseballer most identified with victimhood was born to a Jewish mother — will his landsmen hold him dear?Branca swore good-naturedly when I mentioned that his 88 victories were the eighth most among Jewish hurlers. “If I didn’t get hurt, I’d be No. 1,” he said.I wondered what it was like for Kati Berger to become Katherine Branca, to leave a Jewish home in Europe at 16 and start a Christian home in America a year later. I phoned Bill Branca, Ralph’s manager and nephew, and wound up talking to his mother, Mildred. She was 86, had been married to Branca’s brother John, and told me a story.Mildred had once visited Kati’s sister Fanni, who had immigrated to the United States. Fanni was openly Jewish and lived in a Jewish nursing home in upstate New York.Fanni had told her that Kati had written their parents a letter from New York. In it, she had asked two questions. Would they allow her to marry a Catholic? Would they allow her to raise her children as Christians? Fanni told Mildred she had seen the letter and the letter her parents sent back. Yes and yes, they wrote. And so Kati had married John Branca, a trolley car conductor from .Over the years, Mildred said, Fanni shared with several of Ralph’s siblings that their mother was Jewish. She told his oldest sisters, Antoinette and Annunziata, and his youngest brother, Al.“I used to question my mother about it,” Al, 83, said last week. “ ‘Are we Jewish?’ And she never would give me a definite answer. I don’t see why she didn’t come out and say it.”Kati died in 1969, buried in a Catholic cemetery in . Ralph and Al are the last of her 17 children living.I asked Branca what he and his mother would say to each other now that her secret was out. “Ralphie, I’m glad you know,” Branca said, channeling his mother. “Thanks, Mom,” he would say. “I’m glad I know.”I have known Branca for 11 years. He is an honest man and has an astonishing . (In 1961, he won 17 straight games on “Concentration,” an game show that measured recall.)Given that Branca, like some of his siblings, also once visited Fanni, some may wonder how he never learned that his mother was Jewish. Some may wonder if, like his siblings, he had. “He should have known,” his brother Al told me.But perhaps, as he says, no one told him. Further, not everyone is eager to pursue questions that might complicate his identity. As Branca told me when I first wrote about the Giants’ cheating: “People don’t want history changed.”Our Friday lunch at the club ended. I mentioned to Branca the approaching Sabbath.“I have to get my money from Mrs. Lichtenfeld,” Branca said.What? I asked. Branca explained. He told me that as a boy in Mount Vernon, he had lighted the stove for a Jewish neighbor every Friday night. He had been a Shabbos goy, doing something that was forbidden for Jews to do on the Sabbath.Here was a memory that elevated experience over genes, that affirmed Branca’s sense of self. He was a Catholic, not a Jew.“If I was Jewish, I couldn’t have done it,” he said. He added, “I’m not going to sell my soul for a penny.”'"
"'11-08-15,'1','The Bottoms: “Private people give money to support things they’re interested in,” said Roger B. Tilles, a lawyer and longtime education administrator who has been a regent for six years.Those donors include Bill Gates ($892,000), who is leading the charge to evaluate teachers, principals and schools using students’ test scores; the National Association of Charter School Authorizers ($50,000) and the Robbins Foundation ($500,000), which finance charter expansion; and the Tortora Sillcox Family Foundation ($500,000), whose mission statement includes advancing “Mayor Bloomberg’s school reform agenda.”Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Gates are expert at using philanthropy in a way that pressures government to follow their public policy agendas.The Tops: Dr. Tisch and Dr. King emphasize the fellows’ education credentials and administrative experience. Three of the 11 named so far have doctorates; four are Ivy League graduates; two have law degrees. One worked for New York City’s Education Department overseeing the development of the 32-variable mathematical formula used to evaluate teachers. Five have worked for charters, like the commissioner.The Bottoms: Betty A. Rosa, who spent 23 years as a teacher and principal before becoming a New York City regional superintendent and a regent, said it was “absolutely wrong” that the fellows had spent what she considered to be so little time working in schools. Six of the 11 have never taught. The five others have a total of 10 years in the classroom and one as a principal.The Bottoms: Saul B. Cohen, a former president of Queens College who retired in December after 18 years as a regent, is angry that the board was not consulted about selecting the fellows. “They’re supposed to be advising us, but we had no role,” he said.Dr. Cohen was also upset that the state’s Race to the Top application — which included major policy decisions like using student test results to evaluate teachers and principals — was not shown to the Regents before it was submitted to Washington. “The board had to rubber-stamp it after the fact,” he said.Dr. Rosa said the Regents saw only “bits and pieces” of the application beforehand.Several board members said they had been marginalized under Dr. Tisch, who took over in 2009 and is widely considered to be the most powerful, controlling chancellor in memory.The Tops: Dr. King said that picking the fellows was the commissioner’s decision and that there was no legal requirement to consult the Regents. He said that the Race to the Top application was completed right at the deadline and that there was no time to show the Regents. At previous meetings they had been consulted on the main policy issues, he said.The Bottoms: After 10 months of meetings in Albany, a task force of 63 educators from all over the state concluded in April that students’ scores on state tests should count for no more than 20 percent of an evaluation of teachers and principals. Instead, the commissioner adopted the position favored by the fellows: that up to 40 percent of an evaluation could be based on state tests.John E. Bierwirth, superintendent of the Herricks School District on Long Island, said he believed the decision was preordained. At task force meetings, he said, he tried to get fellows to reveal their thinking. “I said tell us your conclusions and give us a chance to react; they wouldn’t,” he recalled.After putting in so many hours, Dr. Bierwirth said, “some of us felt used; I felt irrelevant.”The Tops: Dr. King said that people understood from the beginning that the task force was advisory, and that 80 to 90 percent of its recommendations were adopted. “Their work was of great value,” he said. He pointed out that only 20 percent of the evaluation was required to be based on state tests; each district, subject to agreement with the local union, will decide whether to use them for the other 20 percent.The Bottoms: Several regents complained that it had been hard to prepare for board meetings because in recent years, agenda items had been posted on the Internet so late. Dr. Cohen called this a bureaucratic strategy to weaken the board’s role.The Tops: Dr. Tisch said the only reason the postings had been late was a lack of staff.The Bottoms: Race to the Top requires states to develop student-data collection systems. Recently the Education Department awarded a $27 million no-bid contract to Wireless Generation, a company owned by Rupert Murdoch and overseen by a former New York City chancellor, Joel I. Klein. Mr. Klein is a good friend of Dr. Tisch.Mr. Tilles said that at a closed executive session of the Regents, he and several others told Dr. Tisch and Dr. King that they were concerned about the appearance of favoritism.“We raised it and were dismissed,” he said. Mr. Tilles and Dr. Rosa said the contract should be put out for bid.The Tops: State officials said discussions with Wireless Generation had begun long before Mr. Klein joined the company.Dr. King said the contract was not put out for bid because the state was under pressure to meet a Race to the Top deadline and the Wireless Generation system was already compatible with New York City’s data system.“At the executive session a lot of people asked a lot of detailed questions,” Dr. King said, but no action was taken.“The board doesn’t participate in the selection of vendors,” he added.The state comptroller’s office is investigating whether it was proper to award the contract without bidding.'"
"'11-08-15,'1','As his private wealth and public power have grown, so too has the overlap between his private and business lives, with at least some of the congressman’s government actions helping to make a rich man even richer and raising the potential for conflicts.He has secured millions of dollars in Congressional earmarks for road work and public works projects that promise improved traffic and other benefits to the many commercial properties he owns here north of San Diego. In one case, more than $800,000 in earmarks he arranged will help widen a busy thoroughfare in front of a medical plaza he bought for $16.6 million.His constituents cheer the prospect of easing traffic. At the same time, the value of the medical complex and other properties has soared, at least in part because of the government-sponsored road work.But beyond specific actions that appear to have clearly benefited his businesses, Mr. Issa’s interests are so varied that some of the biggest issues making their way through Congress affect him in some way.After the forced sale of in 2008, for instance, he publicly attacked the ’s handling of the deal without mentioning that Merrill had handled hundreds of millions of dollars in for him and lent him many millions more.And in an era when the auto industry’s future has been a big theme of public policy, Mr. Issa has been outspoken on regulatory issues affecting car companies, while maintaining deep ties to the industry through the auto electronics company he founded, DEI Holdings.He has a seat on its board, and his nonprofit family foundation, which seeks to encourage values like “hard work and selfless philanthropy,” has earned millions from stock in DEI, which bears his initials. Mr. Issa’s fortune, in fact, was built on his car alarm company, and to this day it is his deep voice on Viper alarms that warns potential burglars to “please step away from the car.”In recent months, has examined how some lawmakers have championed particular industries, pushing measures to protect and enrich supporters. In Mr. Issa’s case, it is sometimes difficult to separate the business of Congress from the business of Darrell Issa.Mr. Issa, 57, did not respond to repeated written requests in the last three weeks to discuss his outside interests. In the past, he has said his business background has made him a better lawmaker. In at least one Congressional matter, however, he recused himself after being advised of a potential conflict.But perhaps his clearest statement on the issue came last year amid ’s recalls of millions of automobiles with dangerous acceleration problems. Then, Mr. Issa brushed aside suggestions that his electronics company’s role as a major supplier of alarms to Toyota made him go easy on the automaker as he led an investigation into the recalls.“If anything,” the congressman said, “Toyota probably got a harder time by having an automobile supplier sitting up there on the dais saying ‘Hold it, I’m not letting you off the hook now.’ ”As the influential chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. Issa has proven both a reliable friend to business and a constant annoyance to an Obama administration that he sees as anti-business. Even before formally taking over the committee in December, he made headlines by asking 150 businesses and trade groups to identify regulations that they considered overly burdensome, and he has issued numerous subpoenas on his own authority in investigating programs he believes are harmful.His pro-business policies usually align closely with those of the firms he has worked with in his wide-ranging business career both before and after he joined Congress. Congress has historically had more than its share of millionaires from storied American fortunes, from the Rockefellers to the Kennedys. But typically, those members lower their business profiles considerably and limit their active dealings to avoid potential conflicts of interest and the political repercussions that might follow from private business decisions.Senator John D. Rockfeller IV, Democrat of , for one, has much of his money in blind trusts, run by outside trustees. And Senator , Democrat of , has a number of family and marital trusts for money generated largely through the fortune of his wife, .Mr. Issa, who grew up in a hardscrabble neighborhood near Cleveland and now owns homes north of San Diego and in Washington, has assets totaling as much as $725 million, outstripping by some measures even Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Kerry. (Because lawmakers must disclose their assets only within broad dollar ranges, public reports do not allow for precise figures.)According to his filings, Mr. Issa’s minimum wealth doubled in the last year, and he appears flush with cash: he bought dozens of in 2010 worth as much as $80 million, managed by Wall Street powerhouses, without selling off any securities.Mr. Issa’s transactions cover many pages in his annual disclosure reports, as he has traded huge volumes of stock funds and on a weekly or even daily basis. In 2008 alone, he traded some 360 securities totaling between $650 million and $2 billion.Those investments have often produced sharp profits.In one 2008 sale, months before the stock market crashed, his family foundation earned $357,000 on an initial investment of less than $19,000 — a return of nearly 1,900 percent in just seven months, the foundation reported to the . It reported acquiring the security, then known as AIM International Small Company Fund, at a cost basis representing a tiny fraction of the market value.In addition, Mr. Issa sold at least $1 million in personal holdings in the same fund that year but was not required to report what he paid.Invesco, as the AIM fund’s manager is now known, told The Times it did not provide Mr. Issa’s foundation the steep discount. That suggests the foundation may have acquired the shares from a third-party broker.A former government official said House ethics committee officials quietly inquired into Mr. Issa’s business interests last year because of possible conflicts in his electronics connections.While the exact focus of those inquiries is not known, Mr. Issa’s ties to the industry are well established: in each of his first five years in Congress, he reported accepting free trips to from the Consumer Electronics Association for its annual convention. Such corporate-sponsored trips were allowed at the time, but Congressional rules have tightened since.The inquiries did not produce sufficient evidence of ethics problems to move forward, the former official said.Standards for determining a financial conflict are murky. House members are generally restricted from using their positions “for personal gain” or on matters in which they have a direct financial interest. But a 2009 ethics committee ruling added to the ambiguity, finding there is no prohibition on the mere “appearance” of a conflict.There are also restrictions on taking salaries from certain businesses. While Mr. Issa’s wife draws a salary at their property management company, Mr. Issa — the firm’s president — does not.Lawmakers must also avoid outside work that can pose a “time conflict,” and “detract from a member’s full time and attention to his official duties,” the guidelines say. By all accounts, these rules were designed to promote the notion of a full-time legislature.Mr. Issa’s outside interests certainly appear to have kept him busy. Associates describe him as actively involved in business decisions, particularly in his auto electronics firm. His office did not discuss how he balances the time demands of Congress and his outside businesses. His management company, Greene Properties, which he runs with his wife from the office down the hall from his Congressional office in Vista, has acquired more than two dozen properties in the last five years, valued at up to a total of $80 million.In nearby Carlsbad, a new office complex he owns advertises for prospective tenants. A few miles away, a Hooters restaurant rents space in another building he owns. Nearby, his medical complex bustles with doctors and patients and has few vacancies.“Issa’s a smart businessman,” said Dean Tilton, a local real estate broker. “We haven’t seen real estate prices this low in 20 years, and he’s taking advantage of that.”The hard-hit San Diego area has also benefited from federal money Mr. Issa brought through earmarks, which allow lawmakers to award money for their own pet projects. Indeed, more than two dozen of Mr. Issa’s properties are within five miles of projects he has personally earmarked for road work, sanitation and other improvements, an analysis by The Times shows.His medical complex, for instance, sits directly along West Vista Way, a busy corridor scheduled for widening with $815,000 in funds Mr. Issa earmarked. The congressman bought the complex in 2008, soon after securing the first of two earmarks for the two-mile project and unsuccessfully seeking millions more. The assessor’s office now values the complex at $16 million, a 60 percent appreciation.Mr. Issa owns a number of commercial properties near the planned $171 million expansion of State Route 76. The project, intended to ease traffic for tens of thousands of commuters, was helped by $245,000 in his earmarks.A regional transportation official said the earmarks supplemented state financing to move the projects along.Local leaders say they are just grateful for the money, regardless of any suggestions locally in San Diego that Mr. Issa stands to benefit.“I don’t really blame the guy,” said John Aguilera, a Vista city councilman. “As a politician, that’s his job to bring a slice of the pie back home, and as a businessman, he’s going to invest in the areas that he champions.”Some ethics experts wonder, however, whether Mr. Issa’s business interests invite problems.“The idea is you’re supposed to be a full-time congressman,” said Robert M. Stern, who runs the nonprofit Center for Governmental Studies in . “There may not be a direct conflict of interest, but it creates an appearance that he is trying to influence a policy on issues where he has an investment.”In 2009, as earmarks became a damaging symbol of Congressional abuse, Mr. Issa joined other lawmakers in pledging to discontinue them. And in recent weeks, he has attacked “the culture of government overspending” in pushing for deep cuts in the .At a House hearing in 2008 on a much-debated proposal to merge the satellite radio companies Sirius and XM, despite objections on competitive grounds, Mr. Issa praised the “viable combined market” the deal would create as he questioned Sirius’s chief executive and talked of opportunities for expansion.What Mr. Issa did not mention was that his electronics firm was then in a lucrative partnership with Sirius to distribute its audio products.While Mr. Issa sold off his controlling interest in DEI soon after he was elected, he remains a board member with a half-million shares in the firm held by his family trust. His management firm also receives $2 million a year for leasing DEI its Vista plant.DEI’s partnership with Sirius, which continued after the merger, caused friction with competitors. In a lawsuit settled out of court, U.S. Electronics accused Sirius and DEI of freezing it out of the market through anticompetitive practices that relied on “a web of deception, threats and lies” aimed at “the enrichment of certain of its officers and directors.”When a watchdog group, the Center for Public Integrity, asked Mr. Issa about his role in the merger, his office said the congressman’s participation in the House hearing posed no conflict because his founding of DEI was “public knowledge.” But after advice from House ethics lawyers, Mr. Issa avoided any votes on the issue afterward.With its brand-name audio and electronics products, DEI caught the eye of an equity company, Charlesbank Capital, which bought the company in June for $305 million, or $4.45 a share — nearly three times the presale price. The premium promises a payday of at least $2 million for Mr. Issa’s foundation, which has already earned more than $10 million from sales of DEI stock. (Mr. Issa is now a defendant in a lawsuit brought by DEI shareholders; the suit claims the deal was structured to give him and other directors a “windfall not shared by other stockholders.”)The lines between Mr. Issa’s many interests have also become entangled in his frequent criticism of regulators and his frequent defense of Wall Street. At a series of hearings in 2009, Mr. Issa accused Treasury officials of a “cover-up” of their role in ’s $50 billion purchase of Merrill Lynch months earlier. Most pointedly, he accused , chairman of the , of bullying Bank of America “behind closed doors” into buying Merrill Lynch at bargain rates and then lying about it.“I for one,” Mr. Issa told the Fed chairman, “am looking at Main Street America, the stockholders who in some cases got less than they would have gotten through other means. This includes , and, of course, Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.”Mr. Issa did not mention his own extensive links to Merrill Lynch.In a television interview days later, however, he said: “I bank at Merrill Lynch. I’m very well aware that every broker there, all the people who were stockholders, were furious that they were in fact being fire-saled to them.”And Mr. Issa is no ordinary Merrill customer.His transactions there have totaled more than a billion dollars in the last decade, records show. In the aftermath of the firm’s acquisition in September 2008, in fact, he bought and sold at least $206 million in Merrill Lynch mutual funds in the next 15 days, records show.His ties to the bank deepened last year, records show, as Merrill Lynch gave him two “personal notes” for lines of worth at least $75 million.When the brought a major lawsuit charging Goldman with fraud last year, Mr. Issa fired back by opening an investigation. The timing of the lawsuit, he said, smacked of a “partisan political agenda” meant to help and bolster a bill overhauling .His charge drew nationwide attention, putting regulators on the defensive, but the S.E.C. inspector general later found “no evidence” of political meddling.Mr. Issa came to Goldman’s defense again last month in a letter to regulators complaining about restrictions on financial firms. Broker dealers “such as Goldman Sachs” faced “a substantial reduction in leverage” because of excessive capital requirements, he wrote.As with Merrill Lynch, Mr. Issa is keenly interested in Goldman’s performance.A few weeks before opening his inquiry into the Goldman lawsuit, in fact, he bought another large batch of shares in one of the firm’s high-yield mutual funds, records show. By the end of the year, his stake in Goldman’s fund was worth as much as $25 million.'"

""Move forward, challenge, pick up your weapons, go to the fight for liberating Libya inch by inch from the traitors and from NATO.""""Get ready for the fight,"" he added. ""The blood of martyrs is fuel for the battlefield.""It was not clear whether the rebel gains reported on Sunday resulted from a coordinated attack effort, from NATO bombing or simply from the mounting pressures weighing on Colonel Qaddafi’s loyalists, who are increasingly short of fuel, food and ammunition as the international effort to end the conflict has gained momentum.It was also far from certain whether the rebels could hold the ground they gained, something they have often had trouble doing in the past.On Sunday evening, there were reports that Qaddafi snipers were still operating in Zawiyah, 20 miles west of Tripoli. Reuters, quoting a rebel soldier, said that Qaddafi loyalists were still in control of the city’s oil refinery.NATO reported that on Saturday, its forces struck two tanks in the vicinity of Zawiyah. The rebels who then stormed the city said they faced little resistance, and by Sunday morning, the tricolored rebel flag was flying from a shop near the town’s central market, Reuters reported. Video images broadcast on Al Jazeera showed triumphant rebel fighters rallying in the city beneath a bridge, with artillery shelling audible in the distance. The roads through Zawiyah and Gheryan are the last overland supply routes into Tripoli that are still open. If the rebels gain control of both roads, they may find themselves in the difficult position of managing a siege of a city still filled with civilians.Rebel leaders worked over the weekend to quiet the squabbles that had flared up in their ranks after the killing of Gen. Abdul Fattah Younes, who had defected from Colonel Qaddafi’s army in February and become the rebels’ senior military leader. At the front lines in Brega on Friday, there was little sign of the most troubling rift to emerge, the one between the officers in the army that General Younes commanded and the leaders of the volunteer fighters known as the Union of Revolutionary Forces.The rebel authorities have recently allowed reporters to visit the front lines, after months of restricting such visits. In interviews, fighters there spoke of coordinated advances involving special forces soldiers and the civilian volunteers, and they seemed untroubled by the lack of a central leadership figure. They said they took orders from their brigade commanders and trusted that their leaders were speaking to one another.The rebels near Brega fired rockets from positions in a valley as their tanks, rarely seen in action, fired from the edge of a nearby hill. But at the sound of incoming rocket fire, the rebel fighters panicked, jumped in their trucks and drove away from the front lines.'"

He got a late start because of the rule that kept veteran free agents off the field in the early days after the lockout, and because the holder Sav Rocca had to wait several days for a visa to return to the United States from Australia.“I know that I’m better than I was today,” Graham said after Friday’s game. “I proved it for years, and I just didn’t do it today. I’m trying to win a job, and it just didn’t go down the way I wanted it to.”Gano was the epitome of a hit-or-miss commodity last year in his first full N.F.L. season. He made only 24 of 35 field-goal attempts for a 6-10 team that played a lot of close games — nine decided by 3 points or fewer. He made overtime game-winners against Green Bay, Tennessee and Jacksonville.A PATRIOTS EMPHASIS Patriots Coach Bill Belichick has made no secret of his intention to upgrade the team’s defensive line and, with it, the pass rush. That’s why there were 18 defensive linemen in camp as of Sunday, including four established veterans who were recently obtained through free agency or trade: Shaun Ellis, Albert Haynesworth, Mark Anderson and Andre Carter. That has led to speculation that the Patriots will employ more of a 4-3 defensive front instead of the 3-4 more commonly seen in recent seasons.COTCHERY PRACTICES The new Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery says he’s ready to win now. Cotchery, a seven-year N.F.L. veteran, signed last week with the Steelers, the defending A.F.C. champions, and participated in his first practice Sunday. Cotchery said he believed Pittsburgh was the best fit for him after he asked the Jets to release him. Cotchery caught 41 passes last year for the Jets, his lowest total since becoming a full-time starter in 2006. He will make his Steelers debut Thursday against Philadelphia.SAINTS’ PORTER RETURNS New Orleans Saints cornerback Tracy Porter has returned to practice for the first time since training camp opened and says his surgically repaired left knee is not bothering him. Porter has been recovering from off-season microfracture surgery. Also at practice were receivers Marques Colston and Robert Meachem. Colston was sidelined by swelling around his surgically repaired right knee cap, while Meachem left Friday night’s preseason opener against San Francisco with a lower back strain.BACKUPS STRUGGLE Colts Coach Jim Caldwell isn’t worried about his backup quarterbacks, despite their struggles in the preseason opener Saturday against the St. Louis Rams. With Peyton Manning out while nursing a neck injury, the reserves Curtis Painter and Dan Orlovsky got the early action in a 33-10 loss. They combined to complete 7 of 16 passes with three interceptions. Caldwell said that Painter had some good moments and that Orlovsky, a free-agent pickup, had not had much time to learn the complicated Colts offense.'"
"'11-08-15,'1','After obtaining foreign residency, they can in most cases file for divorce after six months, bypassing Italy’s mandatory three-year legal separation. Romania, in particular, has become a destination of choice for divorce tourists, according to people who work in the business, who say it is quick, inexpensive and seemingly flexible about residency formalities.“It was easy,” the husband from Bologna said. “I just signed.”The number of Italians who divorce abroad is hard to gauge. Italy keeps no running total.Gian Ettore Gassani, president of the Italian Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, said there has been a steady increase in Italians divorcing abroad in recent years, which he describes as “a defeat of the Italian justice system.” His association estimates that at least 8,000 couples have obtained a foreign divorce in the last five years, though he admitted the evidence was anecdotal.He also points out that declaring a false residency can be illegal. “It’s also a crime to bring money abroad but people do it,” he said. “It’s up to the foreign judge to verify residencies and then each country has different laws.”But Italy’s notoriously complicated divorce laws and the ease and reciprocity of divorce elsewhere in Europe have clearly created a niche industry.“It’s true that we’re seeing offices offering such services opening up,” said Diego Sabatinelli, secretary for the Italian League for Quick Divorce, an association affiliated with the Radical Party, which was instrumental in legalizing divorce in Italy in 1970. “If there is a market, there is a need.”His association has been lobbying Parliament to do away with the three-year separation period, which was originally intended as a period of forced reflection and possibly reconsideration. The period had been five years until it was shortened in 1987, but factoring in the legal process, it still usually takes at least four years.If the split is not consensual, it can easily take 10.Mr. Sabatinelli called the separation period “a crackpot compromise” to appease the Vatican, which wields considerable influence in this mostly Catholic country. The church does not recognize divorce, although it does allow annulments.Spain, France and Britain are also divorce destinations, but Romania is known as cheaper and easier. The company that arranged the Bologna couple’s divorce, Divorzio Comodo, meaning “easy divorce,” offers all-inclusive Romanian quickie divorces, including airfare, starting at about $5,000.“Prices vary depending on the country, but basically you’re buying the same eggplant,” said an agent of Divorzio Comodo, who did not want to be identified.“It’s a fast and cheap solution,” he said. In Italy, he said, “if things go well it can take a couple five years to divorce, but if things go badly a divorce suit becomes bottomless money pit, all to the advantage of lawyers.”Britain is also popular, if more expensive. Known for its thorough financial investigations, it is often chosen by the financially weaker partner who may gain more there than in other European countries.“London is called the divorce capital of the world, even for Americans,” said William Longrigg, a family law lawyer there and president of the European chapter of International Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. “In fact, rich men are nervous about moving to England because they know the consequences of getting a divorce in this country.”Once a judge in the foreign country legalizes the divorce, it is sent to the public registry in Italy, where it is formally recognized.Even without including foreign divorces, divorce has been increasing in Italy as marriage has tapered off. In 2009, the latest year for which statistics are available, 478 couples separated or divorced for every 1,000 who married, about twice the rate in 1995.Recent bills in Parliament to hasten the divorce procedure have barely made it past the preliminary commission phase. There were whispers, after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi separated from his wife two years ago, that speedy divorce might be back on the agenda but that has not been the case.Apart from time and legal bills, separation also exacts a psychological cost, some divorce lawyers say.“Once you’ve decided to split, those three years can feel very long, and often lead to more serious family crises, with continuous fights,” said Francesca Zanassi, a lawyer in Milan.Delaying the end of a marriage rarely saves it, she said. She said that she had worked on countless divorces in the past 20 years, and could only think of one case where the couple got back together.But a sociologist, Marzio Barbagli, believes that the current law fills the needs of a certain part of the Italian population, especially in the south, which sees legal obstacles to divorce as an important way of safeguarding the institution of marriage, or at least giving it a better chance.“A legal separation is seen as a less serious break,” he said, “a typically Italian compromise with the principles of a traditional vision where marriage can’t be broken.”'"
"'11-08-15,'1','HONG KONG — Municipal leaders in a northeastern Chinese port city quickly announced plans to shut down a chemical plant on Sunday after thousands of protesters confronted riot police officers and demanded that it be closed because of safety concerns, state news media reported.The decision in the port city of Dalian, in Liaoning Province, represents an uncommonly rapid response by the authorities to public anger. Local officials elsewhere in China have typically avoided announcing decisions during demonstrations out of fear that it would only encourage more protests.The chemical factory in Dalian manufactures paraxylene, a crucial ingredient in the production of polyester. Paraxylene vapor can cause eye and nose irritation and, in high concentrations, even lead to death. The chemical is widely known in China because protesters in Xiamen succeeded four years ago in persuading the municipal government there to move a planned paraxylene factory to a less densely populated area, in an early success for activists using cellphones and the Web to mobilize a community.The chemical factory in Dalian sits just about 50 yards behind a sea wall. A tropical storm pushed ocean waves, some of them topping 60 feet, against the wall a week ago, breaching the barrier and raising worries that chemicals might leak from the factory. Panicked residents reportedly fled the area, only to return later and begin demanding the closing of the factory.Xinhua, the state-run news agency, said Wednesday that Mayor Li Wancai of Dalian had announced that the sea wall had been repaired and that the chemical factory had not leaked, but would be relocated anyway.

"'11-08-15,'1','“The cushion that the city had built up during the boom years is now largely behind us,” Ms. Lowenstein said. “If we were to go back into recession this quickly, from a fiscal standpoint we wouldn’t have some of the benefits we had last time.”The concern that New York would not fare so well in another downturn stems partly from rumblings about layoffs from the big banks with headquarters in the city. They did not cut as many jobs during the downturn as city officials had been bracing for, but the worry is that a second round would make up for that.“Now we’re starting to see another round of big layoffs in the financial services industry in New York, and it looks like that is going to be ongoing for some time,” Marisa DiNatale, an economist with , said. If the national economy stops growing altogether, Ms. DiNatale said, there will be “even a bigger chance that layoffs continue for longer and are even larger.”In May and June, Wall Street already had “wiped out” all of the jobs it had added since January, Ms. DiNatale said. She added that she would not be surprised if employment in the securities industry fell nearly as low as it had at the depths of the recession. That would mean the loss of several thousand additional high-paying jobs.Last week, said the chances of a double-dip recession had risen to one in three, from one in four just two months ago.“The city almost never bucks the trend,” Ms. DiNatale said. “If the U.S. goes into recession, the city almost always goes into recession as well.”On Friday in Lower , William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that he had reduced his forecast for economic growth, but that he still did not expect another recession this year.“We’ve had a lot of turbulence in financial markets,” Mr. Dudley said at the end of a week in which the stock market swung wildly down and up, then back down and back up. But he said he doubted that the volatility signaled a reversal of the anemic recovery.Mr. Dudley described the pace of growth in the metropolitan region as “disappointing,” and he called the recent round of layoff announcements from big banks a “potentially troubling development.”Still, he said, the city is less vulnerable to a slump on Wall Street than it once was because its economy has been diversifying. As evidence, he pointed to statistics showing that in the past year the big banks and other financial companies did not lead the way in hiring.As the city’s unemployment rate declined to 8.7 percent in June from a post-crisis high of over 10 percent, the biggest job gains came in health care, education and businesses depending on a steady flow of tourists into the region.Among the higher-paying professions, services like law, accounting and management consulting added more jobs than Wall Street did.Even some of the hardest-hit industries, like construction and real estate, were on the brink of hiring again when the financial markets dived this month after downgraded the nation’s rating.“We are actually on the cusp of staffing up again,” said Jeffrey E. Levine, chairman of Levine Builders, a developer of apartment buildings based in Douglaston, . After cutting jobs and prices a few years ago, Mr. Levine said, he has kept his staff “lean and mean” through what he called a tremendous turnaround in the city’s real estate market.As an example, he cited Ohm, a building with more than 400 apartments in the northwestern part of the Manhattan neighborhood Chelsea.“At the beginning of the Great Recession, we were renting at $54, $55 a foot,” Mr. Levine said. Now, the same apartments are going for about 20 percent more, up to $65 per square foot — or as much as $2,800 a month for a studio.Mr. Levine attributed New York’s relatively strong rebound to the city’s appeal to young professionals as a place to live and work in, as well as its attractiveness to affluent foreigners for investment in times of global unrest.“In other parts of the country, my rents are unchanged in three years,” Mr. Levine said, adding that he considered talk of New York City’s falling back into recession “overblown.”At Bowery Kitchen Supplies, the owner, Howard Nourieli, chalked up the strength of his business to the weakness of the American dollar. Many of the customers buying $150 kitchen knives at his store in Chelsea Market in Manhattan are visitors from , he said. On Friday, a cooking-school operator from spent about $300 on purchases that included a knife made in , Mr. Nourieli said.The business, which started on the Bowery, once catered to professional cooks and restaurant owners. But its clientele has evolved as the city has drawn more shoppers from other cities and other continents, Mr. Nourieli said. “Tourists are coming and they’re spending money,” he said.Then, asked if he had any difficulty filling jobs, Mr. Nourieli noted the weakness of the job market. “There’s plenty of people here in New York that can work,” he said. “I haven’t had a problem finding people.”'"
"'11-08-15,'1','The risk of sudden death in a triathlon is 1.5 deaths per 100,000 participants compared with 0.8 deaths per 100,000 participants in a marathon.“So many things can go wrong in an open-water swim,” Dr. Stuart Weiss, the New York City Triathlon medical director, said last week. “There’s some combination of water, adrenaline, pushing yourself hard, and all these things somehow work together to put people into an abnormal heart rhythm.”Autopsies were inconclusive on the man and the woman who died after being pulled from the 1,500-meter swim, the first leg of the New York City Triathlon.Organizers of the race said last week that they were considering requiring open-water swim certifications for 2012 entrants, as well as certification of a recent medical checkup showing a clean bill of health. But a spokesman indicated that USA Triathlon was less far along on such considerations.“The topics of athlete certification, as well as its feasibility, and the current requirements for swim starts continue to be discussed and evaluated, and we will consider all options moving forward,” the spokesman, Chuck Menke, said.Cook said that swim certification was necessary.“You need some form of certification that says this person can swim in open water for, say, one hour,” he said. “If they don’t pass it, they shouldn’t be let in the race.”The rising numbers of untrained first-time triathletes comes as part of the sport’s phenomenal growth in recent years. USA Triathlon had fewer than 16,000 members in 1993; over the next seven years, that number grew steadily, but unspectacularly, to a little more than 21,000.But since 2000, membership has skyrocketed, hitting 58,000 by 2005 and 140,000 in 2010. In those same 10 years, the number of triathlon clubs in the United States grew to 869 from 50, and the number of officially certified coaches rose to 1,800 from 229.The surge reflects a change in perception. Not long ago, the notion of doing a long-distance swim, followed immediately by long-distance cycling and running, seemed impossible for all but the most elite endurance athletes.But now triathlons are often seen as the province of weekend warriors, albeit especially fit ones. That in turn has attracted first-time triathletes who often lack specific training. The number of one-day memberships in USA Triathlon, which one needs to compete in its sanctioned events, rose to 326,732 in 2010 from 100,000 in 2000.Cook teaches a 10-session class for triathletes. In one session, he removes the lane dividers from an Olympic-size pool and has the class — about 20 students — swim together in a circle for two 20-minute periods. That results in numerous collisions, kicks in the face and other unpleasantness.“Some people get out of the water and say, ‘I can’t do this,’ ” Cook said. “But I talk to them, and they get back in for another 20-minute swim, and they’re fine. That’s because now they’ve experienced the chaos and are better able to deal with it.”Another session takes place in the water off Brighton Beach, so students can learn to handle “not being able to see the bottom and having to sight without walls,” Cook said.Such acclimatizing is important for newcomers, said Melissa Mantak, USA Triathlon’s coach of the year for 2010.“Unfortunately, yes, I see a lot of people inadequately prepared for open-water swimming,” said Mantak, who has coached triathletes at all levels since 1998 and who said she paid special attention to swimming. “They don’t know how challenging it can be. I’ve seen fantastically gifted swimmers get into open water and freak out.”Triathlon organizers are also aware of the dangers, typically assigning more lifeguards than the USA Triathlon minimum of one per 50 participants (one per 30 for ocean swims). They also are moving away from the especially chaotic mass starts. At the New York race, swimmers started in groups of 20 every few seconds, although that change was made because of choppy water.“USA Triathlon-sanctioned events must meet the requirement of a minimum of three minutes between start waves and no more than 150 athletes per wave,” said Kathy Matejka, the event services director of USA Triathlon. “Time-trial starts, which include fewer than 20 athletes starting at shorter intervals, also are permitted.”'"

"'11-08-16,'0','HOUSTON (AP) — The Jets overcame seven sacks to put themselves in position to win their preseason opener against the Houston Texans on Monday night, only to have a potential winning pass slip through a receiver’s fingers in the end zone.Mark Sanchez looked sharp in the Jets’ 20-16 loss, completing 6 of 7 passes, including two to Santonio Holmes. Sanchez’s usual backup, Mark Brunell, did not make the trip to Houston because of a finger injury, leaving the rest of the game to the seventh-round draft pick Greg McElroy, a former Alabama star.Houston’s defense, learning a 3-4 scheme under the new coordinator Wade Phillips, produced seven sacks. But McElroy, a seventh-round draft pick, still found gaps and completed 23 of 39 passes for 208 yards and a touchdown.The Jets had a chance to win in the final minute, but the undrafted free agent Michael Campbell dropped a 32-yard pass from McElroy as he crossed the goal line.Chris Ogbonnaya caught a touchdown pass from Matt Leinart and ran for the winning score in the fourth quarter for the Texans.Matt Schaub, meanwhile, looked shaky for the Texans.

"'11-08-16,'0','Arizona would not be the first state to move away from partisan primaries. California endorsed such a system last year, following the lead of Washington State, which has had a “top-two” primary since 2008.Neither political party in Arizona has yet to weigh in officially on the plan, but an effort to create open primaries in the state was fiercely opposed by both the Democrats and Republicans when first proposed in 1998.“The two extremes have co-opted both parties, which they’ve done through low-turnout primary elections,” said Paul Johnson, a former Phoenix mayor who ran as a Democrat for governor but later changed his registration to independent. “What we’re trying to do, simply put, is to force all candidates to face as many voters as possible.”Mr. Johnson, who is spearheading the open-primary measure, is joined by Carolyn Allen, a former Republican state senator; Paulina Mooris, a former Republican candidate for Congress; and other centrist leaders.Over the years, Arizona has experimented with varying ways of keeping the politics of the state from drifting too far to the left or right. In 2000, voters endorsed the creation of an independent redistricting commission to take the drawing of political boundaries out of the hands of politicians. Two years before, a ballot measure was approved allowing independent voters to cast ballots in any party primary they choose. The latest change would go further, replacing party primaries with the kind of nonpartisan elections that currently take place in most Arizona cities.In Phoenix, for instance, where six candidates are running for mayor in an Aug. 30 primary, no party affiliations are listed on the ballots. Still, the affiliations of the candidates are well known, and Greg Stanton, the only Democrat in the race, complained recently that Republican and Tea Party activists had singled him out.In Arizona, Republicans control all of the statewide offices, both houses of the Legislature, both United States Senate seats and the bulk of the Congressional districts. Republicans’ lock on power in the Legislature gave impetus this year to proposals to toughen immigration restrictions, loosen gun regulations and require presidential candidates, President Obama among them, to prove their American citizenship.Still, disagreement among Republicans does surface.Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, vetoed some of the measures approved by Republican lawmakers, including one that would have permitted guns on college campuses, and so drew the ire of some within her party.Meanwhile, efforts by Mr. Pearce, who is president of the State Senate, to forbid illegal immigrants to drive in the state or enroll in community colleges, failed to win the support of some Republicans who feared that such restrictions would further tarnish the state’s image as well as damage its tourism industry.Some Arizona Republicans dismiss the effort to open up primaries as a not-so-veiled effort to swing the state’s political balance toward the left. But not all within the party think it is a bad idea to advocate a change to give independent voters more of a voice.“Republicans are going to say that this is an effort to wrest some control from the party by people who consider the politics of the state too conservative,” said Jason Rose, a Republican political consultant. “And of course it is. But Republicans need to remember that power shifts back and forth, and the political utopia that currently exists for Republicans is not going to last forever.”'"
"'11-08-16,'0','The revelation of Branca’s Jewish roots, nearly 60 years after he gave up the pennant-winning home run to the New York Giants’ Bobby Thomson on Oct. 3, 1951, is now being absorbed and assessed by Catholics and Jews; priests and rabbis; Brooklyn Dodgers fans and aficionados of Jewish baseball history.Where does a man long remembered for infamy fit in? Is he now a Jew? Is he still a Catholic?“Of the roughly 17,000 guys who’ve played professional baseball, precious few are Jews,” said Scott Barancik, who runs the Jewish Baseball News Web site. “Anytime you see the list grow, it’s fulfilling. It’s a heartwarming story: a guy comfortable in his Catholicism finds his past is more nuanced than he thought.”But is it more than nuance? Is there naches, or pleasure, in knowing that Branca’s mother was a Jew?Even more, is it possible that Jews could do this newfound brother a spiritual mitzvah by absorbing some of the guilt Branca felt for giving up the home run to Thomson?“We’re experts at assuming guilt,” said Barancik, a Jew. “So I’ll take responsibility for that home run.”Bill Kent, the president of the New York Baseball Giants Nostalgia Society, responded to news of Branca’s Jewishness with a wisecrack.“Well, I wouldn’t hold it against her,” said Kent, who is Jewish.If Branca belongs on a list of Jewish athletes other than Wallman’s, it might be the one at jewishmajorleaguers.org, between Lou Boudreau, the Hall of Famer, and Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers. His landsmen in Brooklyn Dodgers history would include Moe Berg, Harry Eisenstat, Goody Rosen, Cal Abrams and Sandy Koufax.Koufax and Hank Greenberg are the most famous Jews in baseball history. Branca, for all we knew until Monday, was a Catholic who asked counsel from a Jesuit priest after the Thomson home run.“Ralph Branca is not a Jew,” said Alan Dershowitz, a Brooklyn-born Dodgers fan, lawyer and Harvard professor. “Whatever the definition, it doesn’t include someone who willingly accepted a different religion. He didn’t stay home on Yom Kippur like Koufax.” (Koufax, of course, knew he was a Jew.)Dershowitz, in fact, theorized that Branca, to his eyes as a boy, did not pitch “Jewishly.”“Koufax altered strength and guile and knew that you pitch for six days and you rest on the seventh,” he said. “Branca was straight-on; you could see there was nothing Jewish about Ralph Branca.”Note: Dershowitz said he turned to atheism (at 13) after Branca’s fateful pitch to Thomson.Doris Kearns Goodwin, who turned memories of her rooting for the Dodgers as a girl from Rockville Centre on Long Island into the autobiographical “Wait Till Next Year,” said that hearing of Branca’s Jewish background prompted an immediate discussion with her husband, Richard Goodwin.“I’m Catholic and my husband is Jewish and he said, ‘Oh, we get blamed for everything; now we’ll get blamed for this!’ ” she said from Concord, Mass., referring to Thomson’s home run. “I said, ‘No, he was brought up Catholic.’ And my son Joe said, ‘I’ll get double blame!’ ”William Donohue, a Yankees fan who is the president of the Catholic League, said he was impressed to learn that Branca’s mother had instilled in her family a tolerance of Jews, blacks, Irish, Germans and Italians in the Branca family’s neighborhood in Mount Vernon, N.Y.“She sounded more open-minded at the time than some Catholics were,” he said. “At the time, Catholics were very ethnically oriented. Jews were more inclined to reach out.”David Zaslow, a rabbi in Ashland, Ore., was raised in Coney Island a devout Dodgers fan, with Branca one of his heroes. “Everybody in Brooklyn loved Ralph Branca,” he said. “All of us identified with him for his sorrow, for the heartbreak itself, when he made that pitch.”Knowing that Branca’s mother was Jewish made Zaslow think this was a new step in the old pitcher’s life. “This is a very Jewish story — even the story of not knowing you’re Jewish,” he said. “Thousands of people every year discover they have Jewish roots.”But in Flushing, Queens, Irving Aks, a child of East New York, had his doubts.The day before Branca’s fateful pitch, Aks said, he sneaked into the Polo Grounds carrying a funeral wreath his brother made that he planned to rest at home plate to celebrate the hoped-for baseball death of the Giants. He said he slept in a custodian’s closet and the next day retrieved the wreath from its hiding place in the ninth inning, with Brooklyn ahead, 4-1.Branca’s pitch undid his mission, and Aks left the wreath at his seat in foul territory in left field.Aks simply found it too much to believe that Kati Branca never celebrated a Jewish holiday or divulged to her 17 children that she was born Kati Berger.“I can’t believe there was never a hint,” said Aks, who is Jewish. “Through the years, she had to say something, observe something. I can’t believe she went through life, as a Jewish mother, and you don’t know from Rosh Hashana or Yom Kippur or Pesach? It’s hard to believe.”Branca will never, it seems, celebrate his inclusion in the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in Commack, N.Y., where the baseball inductees include Koufax, Berg, Ron Blomberg, Saul Rogovin, Art Shamsky, and Mike Epstein, who was once nicknamed Super Jew. But Branca, who was 88-68, with a 3.79 earned run average, not a bad career record, is excluded.“I, too, am from Mount Vernon and always felt an affinity for Mr. Branca,” Alan Freedman, the director of the hall of fame, wrote in an e-mail. But, he said, consideration of a nominee is not based on the parents’ or grandparents’ backgrounds, but on whether he was raised Jewish and considers himself a Jew.“Here’s a good question,” Barancik said. “If you’re a Jewish baseball fan, would you rather find out Ralph Branca had a hidden Jewish past or that Bobby Thomson did? All things being equal, give me Thomson.”'"
"'11-08-16,'0','Then there’s “cut, cap and balance,” the Tea Party-backed bill that the House passed in the midst of the debt ceiling showdown. It would have forced the elimination of a quarter of government spending, down to a share of the economy last reached in 1966.The measure would also have initiated amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget, which would impede our ability to manage economic cycles. Yes, Ronald Reagan also favored a balanced budget amendment — while supporting raising the debt ceiling 17 times.Another recent legislative proposal that won support among the hopefuls — an alternative budget proposal from Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin — would have turned Medicare into a voucher program, shifting the bulk of the cost to the elderly.But these are only the best-known of this crowd’s extreme views. In an unpublished interview, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas told Fortune magazine that if he had been president in 2008, he wouldn’t have engaged in the financial rescue effort. Without the bailout, initiated by the Bush administration, we would not have a functioning economy today.Mr. Perry also wants to repeal the 16th Amendment, thereby eliminating the income tax, which accounts for 80 percent of government revenue. Like his fellow aspirants, Mr. Perry has offered no analysis to explain how the government would function under his vision.Mr. Paul, who finished second in the Iowa straw poll on Saturday, has for decades sought to abolish the Federal Reserve, arguing that it is corrupt and unconstitutional. Eliminating our central bank is a crazy idea that would plunge the country back into an oscillating 19th-century world of panics and busts.Mrs. Bachmann’s victory in the Iowa straw poll has only encouraged her extremism. In interviews over the weekend, she proclaimed her opposition to extending unemployment insurance for the jobless and her support for repealing both the Obama health care plan and the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. And she said that Citigroup and General Motors should have been allowed to go bankrupt without government help. (Even The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page appears unnerved; it called Monday for “a candidate who can appeal across the party’s disparate factions.”)The candidates’ extreme views on economic policies reinforce the broad perception that American politics have become more polarized. Keith T. Poole, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, found that ideological divergence in Congress was the highest in at least 120 years. Interestingly, he concluded that the increased polarization resulted mostly from Republicans’ moving to the right, a conclusion that dovetails with the fact that Mr. Obama remains basically centrist even as his would-be opponents vie to outdo each other in their extreme form of conservatism.Perhaps these Republican aspirants are simply pandering to antigovernment sentiment and, if elected, would govern more sensibly. Franklin D. Roosevelt campaigned on eliminating “unnecessary functions of government” and then vastly expanded federal spending to fight the Depression. Bill Clinton did the reverse, pledging tax cuts in response to the 1990-1 recession but governing as a fiscal moderate. If any of these Republicans is elected, we can only hope that they will follow this pattern. Meantime, we have a lot to worry about.'"
"'11-08-16,'0','I am coming more and more to think that with the government essentially paralyzed for the foreseeable future, the only way we’re going to get jobs is by turning to actual job creators: business itself. With all their cash, companies shouldn’t be waiting for Congress to give them tax incentives to hire people. They should be trying to jump-start the economy — and fend off another — by making investments, and hiring workers, that will lead to renewed prosperity.The only way that’s going to happen, however, is if our society implicitly makes the kind of compact that German society makes explicitly: We have to be willing to allow companies to sacrifice short-term profits for the long-term good of the country. As the leadership expert Michael Useem wrote recently on The ’s Web site, business needs to make “people a priority, not just earnings.”What makes that hard for executives is that they’ve spent the last 30 years having it beaten into them that the only thing that matters is delivering “shareholder value.” Over time, this phrase has become code for focusing on short-term profits — and chief executives who have ignored this mantra have often found themselves kicked to the street by impatient investors like .But as Useem points out, it hasn’t always been this way — and doesn’t have to be in the future. “What might seem an idée fixe of the American way is really a moment’s artifice,” he writes, “a prescription that served a past era but less well the current one.”Indeed, it turns out that the focus on short-term profits is nowhere enshrined in the law. On the contrary: law, where many big companies are incorporated, gives directors enormous leeway to ignore short-term gain if they believe that doing so would ultimately benefit the corporation.Does it ultimately benefit American business if the country gets back on its feet again? It seems to me that you can make a pretty strong case for that. If enough companies started hiring — while wrapping their actions in the mantle of patriotism — even Carl Icahn might have trouble complaining about it.There is, of course, another reason corporate executives might be reluctant to sacrifice short-term profits by putting people to work. What if their competitors didn’t go along? Then they would find themselves at a disadvantage. Useem would tackle that by having a credible group like the Business Roundtable leading the charge, rounding up companies that would agree to start hiring.But Marc Groz, a financial risk expert I’ve gotten to know, has what I think is a more intriguing approach, which he calls a “contingent commitment facility.” “Everyone is waiting for someone else to go first,” he told me the other day. Using his facility, a company would agree to hire X number of new workers. But the commitment would only become binding if certain conditions were met — such as having other companies in the same industry agree to do likewise. Once that happened, all the companies would have to do what they’d promised.Groz’s idea is new and fresh and untested. It could fail. In other words, it is exactly the kind of out-of-the-box “job creation” idea that our stymied government no longer has the ability to come up with. The ball’s in business’s court now.'"
"'11-08-16,'0','Pope Benedict XVI is coming here on Thursday to meet hundreds of thousands of young people celebrating a World Youth Day event in this capital. Some 450,000 have already registered, and three times as many are expected, organizers say. To accommodate their activities — which will include a daylong vigil at the airport, with temperatures likely to reach nearly 100 degrees, and an all-night procession with priceless works of religious art — some of Madrid’s main avenues will be closed to traffic for up to six days.Government and church officials insist the cost to taxpayers will be minimal and the lift to local businesses substantial. Spain’s businesses community came up with $23 million to pay for various events and the pilgrims will pay $44 million themselves. Other donations should cover the rest, the officials say.“The public administration helped us in only two ways,” said Fernando Giménez Barriocanal, the financial director of World Youth Day 2011. The pilgrims will be allowed to sleep in public buildings like schools. And businesses will be able to get tax deductions for their contributions, he said.But critics are calling the claims ridiculous. Father Rodríguez and others who signed the 10-page petition say the costs are always fuzzy when the pope comes to town. They suspect that the cost of extra security, of collecting trash and of stress on health systems will add up to millions for taxpayers. For one thing, the pilgrims have been granted an 80 percent discount on public transportation, which some find particularly galling because subway fares just went up by 50 percent.The priests are not alone in making such claims. “They still can’t tell us how much the pope’s visit cost two years ago,” said Esther López Barceló, youth coordinator for the small United Left party. Ms. López initiated a Twitter campaign this month against the pope’s visit. “Every time he comes here, the figures become opaque,” she said.Spain is less solidly Catholic than it once was. A government survey released in July found that 71.7 percent of Spaniards declared themselves Catholics, compared with 82.1 percent in 2001. Of those, 13 percent attend Mass on Sundays, compared with 19 percent 10 years ago.But the church is eager to keep a spiritual hold on this country, where people can still check a box diverting up to seven-tenths of a percent of their taxes to the church.A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said at a briefing in Rome that the protests planned against Benedict’s visit were “not worrying or surprising,” particularly because “there are hundreds of thousands of young people who will be happy to welcome the pope.”“It’s part of life in a democratic country,” he added.Protest organizers said it was hard to estimate the turnout they might get because August is a time when many people are out of the city. But the protests organized by angry young people earlier this year surprised almost everyone, as tens of thousands of demonstrators, now called “indignados,” took over squares all around the country for several weeks.Earlier this month, the police moved in on the Puerta del Sol, a square here, forcing the last indignados to leave in time for the pope’s visit. But some organizers believe that the operation, shown on evening television broadcasts for several days, could spur more young people to turn out.Spain’s Interior Ministry declined to answer questions about the event. The Madrid City Council referred all questions about the visit to its civil protection agency, which said the visit posed logistical challenges the city has never had to deal with before.“More than one million outsiders will be circulating in Madrid,” said Alfonso del Álamo, the director of the agency. “A major event like winning the World Cup is only 500,000. We’ve never seen anything like this.”On Friday evening, rare works of 16th- and 17th-century art depicting the stations of the cross will be carried through the streets beginning at 8 p.m. Mr. del Álamo said that would mean that hundreds of thousands of pilgrims would be in the streets throughout the night.His agency has trained 3,000 volunteers in first aid, radio communication, evacuation and panic control, he said. Still, he said, it will be in overdrive. Instead of the usual 4,000 shifts in a week, the agency’s workers will do 10,000 shifts. He said that he had not calculated the costs.'"
"'11-08-16,'0','Union officials said they opposed all sabotage and had repeatedly told their members not to engage in such acts. They also said that Verizon was exaggerating the number of incidents.At the same time, the unions have their own complaints about Verizon, saying that several strikers have been struck by managers’ cars.Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America, said Verizon was highlighting the sabotage to turn the public against the strikers, who are members of the C.W.A. and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.“This really does take away from what is the big issue in this strike: that Verizon is refusing to bargain and instead is demanding $1 billion in concessions from workers who earn middle-class wages,” she said.Verizon is pushing the unions to accept far-reaching concessions, including a pension freeze, fewer sick days and having workers contribute far more toward their health coverage.With the negotiations barely inching forward, the sides have accused each other of refusing to bargain in good faith. Verizon’s top spokesman, Peter Thonis, said the union’s $1 billion figure for concessions was exaggerated.The communications workers union said a picketer in Massapequa, N.Y., had been hit by a private security guard leaving a Verizon facility, and another striker had been hit in the head by the side mirror of a manager’s van in Howell, N.J.Mr. Mason said he had never asserted that the unions were responsible for the sabotage, suggesting that individual strikers may have acted on their own. “What’s important is the impact isn’t to a faceless company,” he said. “The impact is to the customers we serve, to government facilities, to individuals.”Michael Ward, special agent in charge of F.B.I.’s Newark office, said the agency was “looking at this matter” because “critical infrastructure has been affected.” He said the F.B.I. was not taking sides in the strike.David Zielenziger, whose 88-year-old mother lives in the assisted living facility at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, said he was unable to reach his mother on Friday. Employees there later told him that sabotage had cut off service to many residents, although one suggested it may have been tree- cutters gone awry. Verizon officials later said it had been sabotage, providing photos of a neatly sliced three-inch-thick cable nearby.“There was no service Friday, Saturday or Sunday morning,” Mr. Zielenziger said, “It was really annoying.”Robert Varettoni, a Verizon spokesman, said the company had obtained court injunctions in New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania that set rules for picketing to make it easier and safer for managers and other workers to enter and leave Verizon facilities.Mr. Mason said Verizon had repeatedly told its managers and other employees to respect the strikers and certainly not to hurt them. He said many picketers had banged on employees’ car hoods as they approached Verizon facilities and that some picketers then pretended the vehicles had hit them.'"
"'11-08-16,'0','“Once it was happening, I could follow everything through the pictures,” said one person in Dalian, Ma Lei, who considered joining the demonstration but was deterred by the police.The protest mirrored one in mid-2007, when thousands of demonstrators in Xiamen, in southeast China, forced local officials to abandon plans for a plant making the same chemical.But more broadly, scholars speak of a revolution of rising expectations in which Chinese citizens, growing more educated and wealthier, think their government should better protect their health, safety and other interests.“People are more aware of their rights, and they are demanding more rights and better protection of their interests,” said Yiyi Lu, an scholar in Beijing with the research institute House.The government is more responsive, she said, but it is still “not reacting fast enough,” she said. “That is why there is growing discontent.”Some question whether China’s middle class is eager to assert itself. “The power of civil society is growing, but it is still very weak,” said Hu Xingdou, a professor of economics at Beijing Institute of Technology.By the last available official count, so-called mass incidents — a term that appears to cover group actions ranging from minor work stoppages to serious riots — numbered 74,000 in 2004, up from 10,000 in 1993.In a February article in Economic Observer, a Chinese weekly publication, Sun Liping, a sociologist at Tsinghua University, wrote that a government academy estimated that such cases had doubled between 2006 and 2010, reaching 180,000 last year.In one of the biggest protests, about 30,000 people demonstrated in Guizhou Province in 2008 over what the government said was a bevy of grievances with local officials. Thousands more took part in ethnic riots in the Xinjiang region in 2009.This year, at least 2,000 residents demonstrated in March against their evictions to make way for a power station. In April, 2,000 residents flipped a police car and set motorcycles afire after urban security guards beat a migrant worker and his wife.In May, Mongolians in Xilinhot and Hohhot staged widespread protests after an ethnic Han driver killed an ethnic Mongol herder. In June, a crowd said to number in the thousands rioted in Guangdong Province after a peaceful protest over a wage dispute spun out of control.Public reaction took time to build after the Fujia sea wall was breached. But the protest on Sunday showed clear signs of advance planning: demonstrators had large anti-Fujia banners, T-shirts, professionally printed placards and even face masks.Although the government said one group of demonstrators pelted police officers with plastic bottles of water and other objects, the protest appears to have been mostly peaceful. Some participants sang the national anthem.If the commitment by local leaders to move the two-year-old plant is carried out, the scale of the protesters’ victory would set a benchmark. The plant, a joint venture between a state-owned chemical company and a local real estate giant, is said to contribute more than $300 million in to the local government each year.The Chinese media reported that officials were so eager to open it that they did not wait for environmental approval, another instance in a pattern of officials’ elevating economic development over health and safety that worries many Chinese.Dalian’s compromise also points to a paradox that Communist Party leaders face as they begin — pressed by China’s top leaders — to pay more attention to local grievances.“You can find many examples of the government trying to better meet people’s demands,” said Ms. Lu, of Chatham House. “But when you improve your service, that creates more demand.”In particular, she said, the slow move toward more government transparency, in areas like official expenses, has encouraged citizen watchdogs to point out waste and abuse, further hurting trust in government.Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a nonprofit Beijing group, said the Dalian case showed that officials should be open at the start. Better, he said, to get public input and genuine environmental assessments before approving major projects. “It is high time to open up the decision-making process.”By Monday, censors were wiping the topic off microblogs. They also canceled a news show last week about dangerous projects in Dalian just before it was to be shown on CCTV, China’s government-controlled television network.When the host, Bai Yansong, complained online, his microblog on Sina Weibo was frozen. He struck back on another account. “This is the public information sphere!” he wrote. “I really don’t know what you are afraid of.”'"
"'11-08-16,'0','Shero said that Crosby’s “spirits are good” and that his workout routine this summer was the same as it had been in previous summers. But he also acknowledged that Crosby was still feeling the effects of his head injury.“I think he’s had some symptoms on and off, depending on how hard he’s pushed himself, and he’s pushed himself pretty hard this summer,” Shero said. “That’s to be expected with this injury. But he’s never had to get to the point where he had to shut himself down or anything. So that’s the good news.”Efforts to reach Crosby and his agent, Pat Brisson, were unsuccessful.Crosby went out with a concussion after collisions in consecutive games.He was shaken up at the end of the Jan. 1 Winter Classic in Pittsburgh after being sideswiped by Washington’s David Steckel. He finished that game and played the next at Tampa Bay on Jan. 5, when he was hit into the boards by the Lightning’s Victor Hedman. Crosby finished that game as well, but he did not return for the rest of the season.Despite playing only 41 games, Crosby led the Penguins with 66 points, setting a modern-era N.H.L. record for fewest games played by a team’s scoring leader.He resumed skating in noncontact drills with his teammates in early April but stopped after two days when he began having headaches. He did not start skating again until about a month ago.On Sunday, Josh Rimer, a producer for the satellite radio show “NHL Home Ice,” said in a Twitter message that “3 sources” told him that Crosby would not be ready for the season opener. That brief, unconfirmed report put Crosby’s physical condition front and center.Shero is among the minority of N.H.L. general managers seeking a full ban on head contact as a way to reduce the number of concussions. He said that four Penguins were sidelined by concussions last season, and that only Crosby’s was long term.“No two concussions are alike,” Shero said. “Some take longer, some guys come back in a week or two.”Shero added that Crosby would “not be pushed” and would return only when he was “100 percent clear and ready.”Shero noted that Patrice Bergeron needed time to recover from concussions. Bergeron, a star for the Stanley Cup-champion Boston Bruins, was sidelined for long stretches by major concussions in 2007 and 2008.Bergeron’s Bruins teammate Marc Savard is still out after sustaining a second serious concussion early last season. The status of at least four other N.H.L. players with concussions is also unknown heading into the season.Another, Paul Kariya, 36, sat out last season because of postconcussion syndrome. He announced his retirement in June because of persistent symptoms.Penguins Coach Dan Bylsma said that another sidelined Penguins star, Evgeni Malkin, was “doing really well, going strong and getting ready to come back here and get on the ice.”Malkin, a former N.H.L. scoring champion, is recovering from ligament tears in his right knee, which ended his season in February.'"
"'11-08-16,'0','Japan has granted a visa to Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister of Thailand who was ousted from power by the Thai military in 2006 and who has lived in exile since a Thai court convicted him of corruption three years ago.The decision announced Monday by the Japanese government comes less than two weeks after Mr. Thaksin’s younger sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was named Thai prime minister.Ms. Yingluck has gone out of her way to play down any influence that her brother may exert on her administration, and she has deflected questions about amnesty for him. But Mr. Thaksin is widely believed to be playing a key role as adviser and kingmaker to the new government. He was also instrumental in the election victory of Ms. Yingluck and her party in July.The visa issue threatens to detract attention from Ms. Yingluck’s economic agenda, which includes sharp rises in minimum wages and guaranteed prices for rice.Opposition politicians in Thailand criticized the issuance of the visa and described Mr. Thaksin as a fugitive from justice. Mr. Thaksin was stripped of his Thai passport by the previous government. He is believed to travel internationally with a passport issued by Montenegro, where he received citizenship last year.'"
"'11-08-16,'0','A Tibetan Buddhist monk protesting Chinese policies immolated himself publicly in a Tibetan area of Sichuan Province in southwest China on Monday, an outside advocacy group reported. It was the second such act in the area in the past five months and appeared to reflect resistance to increased Chinese repression of loyalty to Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.The monk was heard calling, “We Tibetan people want freedom,” “Long live the Dalai Lama” and “Let the Dalai Lama return to Tibet,” after he drank gasoline, doused himself with it and set himself alight on a bridge in the center of Daofu, a town in Ganzi County in Sichuan, according to the advocacy group Free Tibet. The group is based in London, but has a network of contacts in Tibet and Tibetan-populated areas elsewhere in China.Xinhua, China’s official news agency, reported the death of a monk in Daofu, but did not provide details.Ganzi, known in Tibetan as Kardze, is overwhelmingly populated by ethnic Tibetans. It has been an area of chronic tensions for the Chinese authorities, most related to the country’s Han ethnic majority.China’s government regards the vast Himalayan region of Tibet as an integral part of China and is sensitive to expressions of support for the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in 1959 and who has accused China of stifling Tibetan culture. The Chinese consider the Dalai Lama a subversive advocate of Tibetan independence, although he has said he only wants greater autonomy for Tibet.'"
"'11-08-16,'0','“For now it is clear that in essence there is a relief in the market,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. “You can feel it.”Still, given the unease that had set in even before the downgrade, stocks are still in a slump. The S.& P. 500 is more than 10 percent below where it was as recently as July 22.And even as shares climbed on Monday, Ms. Krosby and other analysts said there was plenty of new economic information in the week ahead that could upend the gains of the last three sessions, including jobless claims and the Consumer Price Index. In addition, Monday’s volumes were low.“When the buying picks up, we like to see more buying,” she said. “It is an indication of more conviction.”New deals helped propel Monday’s market. A multibillion-dollar Google deal, a rise in commodity prices and the perception that European leaders and the central bank would take measures including bond purchases to support heavily indebted member countries could be helping, analysts said, though such sovereign debt and economic problems are expected to remain a factor in the markets.Financial stocks rose, including Bank of America, which increased 7.9 percent to $7.76. It took steps on Monday to leave the international credit card business, agreeing to sell its $8.6 billion Canadian card venture to the TD Bank Group for an undisclosed amount, and putting its remaining European card portfolio on the block.Citigroup was up 4.8 percent to $31.27.Worries about the United States economy and the threat of a financial crisis in Europe had already overwhelmed traders, but the downgrade proved to be a tipping point, sending stocks reeling in what turned out to be one of the most tumultuous weeks on Wall Street.Analysts said that investors were taking a second look at some of the causes of the volatility from last week.Investors’ attention was focused on a meeting Tuesday of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.The two leaders will be addressing the threat to the euro zone posed by low growth and teetering public finances in some euro member nations, their room to maneuver circumscribed by fears that France could be next for market attacks.“People are taking a more rational view of the path ahead, that some of the problems in Europe can be addressed with additional spending restraint from some of the governments,” which will take time, said Russell Price, senior economist with Ameriprise Financial.The euro rose against the dollar, a development that Ms. Krosby of Prudential attributed to expectations for the Merkel-Sarkozy meeting.The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to 98 12/32, and the yield rose to 2.31 percent, from 2.26 percent late Friday.“Today was a day that people took a little bit of a rest to try to digest all the news that has happened and the volatility that has happened in the market recently,” said George Rusnak, national director of fixed income for Wells Fargo.Broader commodity prices were up, and investors were probably bargain hunting after last week’s declines, said Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.“It is part of the market trying to find its feet,” he said. “Despite the bounce on Friday, this market has been really beaten up.”European stocks showed modest gains. The FTSE 100 index in London was up 0.6 percent. The CAC 40 in France rose 0.8 percent and the DAX in Germany was up 0.4 percent. Asian shares rose, with the Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average gaining 1.4 percent.'"
"'11-08-16,'0','“This is a life-threatening change for them, the legal equivalent of Internet technology,” said Kenneth J. Abdo, a lawyer who leads a termination rights working group for the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and has filed claims for some of his clients, who include Kool and the Gang. As a result the four major record companies — Universal, BMG, EMI and Warner — have made it clear that they will not relinquish recordings they consider their property without a fight.“We believe the termination right doesn’t apply to most sound recordings,” said Steven Marks, general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America, a lobbying group in Washington that represents the interests of record labels. As the record companies see it, the master recordings belong to them in perpetuity, rather than to the artists who wrote and recorded the songs, because, the labels argue, the records are “works for hire,” compilations created not by independent performers but by musicians who are, in essence, their employees.Independent copyright experts, however, find that argument unconvincing. Not only have recording artists traditionally paid for the making of their records themselves, with advances from the record companies that are then charged against royalties, they are also exempted from both the obligations and benefits an employee typically expects.“This is a situation where you have to use your own common sense,” said June M. Besek, executive director of the Kernochan Center for Law, Media and the Arts at the School of Law. “Where do they work? Do you pay for them? Do you withdraw from a paycheck? Under those kinds of definitions it seems pretty clear that your standard kind of recording artist from the ’70s or ’80s is not an employee but an independent contractor.”Daryl Friedman, the Washington representative of the recording academy, which administers the and is allied with the artists’ position, expressed hope that negotiations could lead to a “broad consensus in the artistic community, so there don’t have to be 100 lawsuits.” But with no such talks under way, lawyers predict that the termination rights dispute will have to be resolved in court.“My gut feeling is that the issue could even make it to the ,” said Lita Rosario, an entertainment lawyer specializing in soul, funk and rap artists who has filed termination claims on behalf of clients, whom she declined to name. “Some lawyers and managers see this as an opportunity to go in and renegotiate a new and better deal. But I think there are going to be some artists who feel so strongly about this that they are not going to want to settle, and will insist on getting all their rights back.”So far the only significant ruling on the issue has been one in the record labels’ favor. In that suit heirs of Jamaican reggae star , who died in 1981, sued Universal Music to regain control of and collect additional royalties on five of his albums, which included hits like “Get Up, Stand Up” andBut last September a federal district court in New York ruled that “each of the agreements provided that the sound recordings were the ‘absolute property’ ” of the record company, and not Marley or his estate. That decision, however, applies only to Marley’s pre-1978 recordings, which are governed by an earlier law that envisaged termination rights only in specific circumstances after 56 years, and it is being appealed.Congress passed the copyright law in 1976, specifying that it would go into effect on Jan. 1, 1978, meaning that the earliest any recording can be reclaimed is Jan. 1, 2013. But artists must file termination notices at least two years before the date they want to recoup their work, and once a song or recording qualifies for termination, its authors have five years in which to file a claim; if they fail to act in that time, their right to reclaim the work lapses.The legislation, however, fails to address several important issues. Do record producers, session musicians and studio engineers also qualify as “authors” of a recording, entitled to a share of the rights after they revert? Can British groups like , the , , and exercise termination rights on their American recordings, even if their original contract was signed in ? These issues too are also an important part of the quiet, behind-the-scenes struggle that is now going on.Given the potentially huge amounts of money at stake and the delicacy of the issues, both record companies, and recording artists and their managers have been reticent in talking about termination rights. The four major record companies either declined to discuss the issue or did not respond to requests for comment, referring the matter to the industry association.But a recording industry executive involved in the issue, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak for the labels, said that significant differences of opinion exist not only between the majors and smaller independent companies, but also among the big four, which has prevented them from taking a unified position. Some of the major labels, he said, favor a court battle, no matter how long or costly it might be, while others worry that taking an unyielding position could backfire if the case is lost, since musicians and songwriters would be so deeply alienated that they would refuse to negotiate new deals and insist on total control of all their recordings.As for artists it is not clear how many have already filed claims to regain ownership of their recordings. Both Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Joel, who had two of the biggest hit albums of 1978, as well as their managers and legal advisers, declined to comment on their plans, and the United States Copyright Office said that, because termination rights claims are initially processed manually rather than electronically, its database is incomplete.Songwriters, who in the past typically have had to share their rights with publishing companies, some of which are owned by or affiliated with record labels, have been more outspoken on the issue. As small independent operators to whom the work for hire argument is hard to apply, the balance of power seems to have tilted in their favor, especially if they are authors of songs that still have licensing potential for use on film and television soundtracks, as ringtones, or in commercials and video games.“I’ve had the date circled in red for 35 years, and now it’s time to move,” said Rick Carnes, who is president of the Songwriters Guild of America and has written hits for country artists like Reba McEntire and . “Year after year after year you are going to see more and more songs coming back to songwriters and having more and more influence on the market. We will own that music, and it’s still valuable.”In the absence of a definitive court ruling, some recording artists and their lawyers are talking about simply exercising their rights and daring the record companies to stop them. They complain that the labels in some cases are not responding to termination rights notices and predict that once 2013 arrives, a conflict that is now mostly hidden from view is likely to erupt in public.“Right now this is kind of like a game of chicken, but with a shot clock,” said Casey Rae-Hunter, deputy director of the Future of Music Coalition, which advocates for musicians and consumers. “Everyone is adopting a wait-and-see posture. But that can only be maintained for so long, because the clock is ticking.”'"

Official figures released on Tuesday showed that growth in the zone fell to its lowest rate in two years during the second quarter, and that Germany — considered the Continent’s locomotive — came almost to a standstill, growing 0.1 percent.The German figures followed data showing that the French economy was flat in the second quarter, leaving Europe’s two largest economies stagnant. That means the two pillars of the European economy may be less willing and able to prop up their weaker counterparts, analysts warned.Across the euro zone, gross domestic product rose only 0.2 percent in the second quarter from the first, when growth had advanced by 0.8 percent, according to Eurostat, the ’s statistics agency.The joint French-German proposals were as modest as German officials had forecast. And the most ambitious idea — that all euro zone states legally bind themselves to working toward balanced budgets and reduced sovereign debt — is unlikely to be accepted by all member states. It may not even get through the French constitutional process, since Mr. Sarkozy does not have a constitutional majority in .The proposal calling for twice-yearly meetings and increased integration could formalize the “two-speed Europe” — of those in the euro zone and those outside it — that many warned of when the European Union expanded so rapidly after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.Both leaders said that France and Germany must set an example, citing their agreement to propose jointly a financial-transaction tax by 2013 as “an example of convergence” needed in the entire euro zone. But such a tax is unlikely in the larger European Union, especially if , which is outside the euro zone and contains Europe’s biggest financial center, continues to resist the idea.They also said they would work to harmonize French and German economic assessments and, in the future, corporate tax rates.“France and Germany are committed to strengthen the euro,” Mrs. Merkel said. “To that end we need to better integrate our economies” and “to see that the stability pact will be acted on.”The stability pact, a central element of the treaty that established the euro zone, commits members to keep fiscal deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product a year and total sovereign debt under 60 percent of G.D.P. Both benchmarks are regularly missed.The Sarkozy-Merkel meeting came after a dizzying week in the markets and a general gloom about the lack of European leadership on the euro. Economists said the weak data could simply reflect a pause after two years of brisk expansion. But the numbers could also signal that the sovereign debt crisis is undercutting growth outside the countries like that are most directly affected.“The longer the sovereign debt market remains stressed, the greater will be the damage to the wider economy,” Lloyd Barton, an economist, said in a note Tuesday.If there was any silver lining, it was the hope that slower growth would lead to less inflation, giving the more leeway to keep interest rates low and intervene in bond markets. Since last week, the bank has been buying Italian and debt on the open market to hold down yields so the two countries do not face ruinous borrowing costs.What impetus remains in the European economy came from countries like and . Even , with growth of 0.3 percent compared with the previous quarter, outperformed Germany. A whiff of hope came from , one of the countries at the heart of the , as the economy stopped shrinking for the first time since October 2010.Given the problems in the euro zone — sovereign debt, undercapitalized , aging populations, imbalances in trade, growth and competitiveness between northern and southern countries — many analysts and some officials have been pushing for the introduction of eurobonds, which would combine the credibility and collateral of all the members of the currency union.But that could lead to a rise in borrowing costs for Germany and France, and a considerable rise in risk, too, something that neither country is currently prepared to accept, beyond a July 21 agreement to expand a bailout fund to 440 billion euros.Mrs. Merkel in particular, cautious by nature, rules in a coalition with a weakened partner, the liberal Free Democrats. Her own Christian Democrats are largely against writing blank checks for Europe, and the German constitutional court may not find eurobonds legal. Mrs. Merkel could probably find support among the opposition Social Democrats and Greens, but that would divide her party and undermine her government.Mrs. Merkel is going to have enough trouble getting the July 21 agreement through Parliament.As the chancellor’s European-minded finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, told the newsmagazine Der Spiegel over the weekend, “I rule out eurobonds as long as member states conduct their own financial policies.”'"
"'11-08-17,'1','Despite all of the I.R.S.’s efforts, wealthy American tax cheats are still able to hide their money because Swiss banks are still eager to help them.An indictment disclosed earlier this month by the United States attorney in Manhattan noted that when the Swiss bank UBS — under strong pressure from Washington — abandoned the secret account business, one of its bankers left, taking with him several clients for whom he then opened secret accounts at five other Swiss banks. Another indictment claims that a Swiss financial adviser who managed secret funds for American clients moved accounts from UBS to two private Swiss banks.Both advisers are accused of using shady tactics, like opening phony businesses in Hong Kong and fake foundations in Liechtenstein to conceal the money from the Internal Revenue Service. The banks, which are not named in the indictments, were not accused in the fraud because the advisers gave them false documents stating that the account owners were not American. But the banks did have information that could have alerted them to the accounts’ ownership had they done better due diligence.These indictments follow the disclosure by Credit Suisse that it was the target of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department into how Swiss institutions assisted American income tax evaders. The cases underscore how deeply Swiss banks rely on tax evasion.The United States government, which fined UBS $780 million and forced it to reveal data on 4,450 American customers, is reportedly negotiating a global agreement with the Swiss government that could result in a hefty collective fine against these banks. Switzerland is again resisting demands for more information about American clients. Washington should not stop pushing until all Swiss banks hand over their files and close those accounts.'"
"'11-08-17,'1','When he heard of Rypien’s death, Mike Commodore, a Detroit defenseman, said on Twitter: “He was a warrior. Hit me so hard my eyes couldn’t focus for 30 secs.”Jason Jaffray, a road roommate of Rypien’s with Vancouver and the Canucks’ Manitoba Moose farm club, said: “He was a guy who wouldn’t back down from anyone. He was a guy that was definitely fearless.”Fearlessness was a trait that Rypien most likely acquired from his father, Wes, a former boxer.“He was a Canadian Golden Gloves champion when he was 19 or 20,” Rypien said in 2008. “He still works out to stay in shape and still shows me stuff — I’d have to give it to him on toughness.”Though undrafted, Rypien was signed by Vancouver in 2005 after a junior career in which he was captain of the Regina Pats in Saskatchewan. While he was with the Pats, his girlfriend was killed in a car accident.Peter Engelhardt, whose family Rypien was living with at the time, told The Calgary Herald that Rypien “changed a little bit, right then and there” but added that “everybody’s going to, when you have something like this happen.”During the next six years, Rypien shuttled between the Canucks and their minor league affiliate, the Winnipeg-based Manitoba Moose. The Canucks did not re-sign him when his contract expired at the end of last season. He then signed with the Jets, who were the Atlanta Thrashers until they were sold this summer.“There’s a lot I’m going to miss about him,” said Heisinger, who was the Moose’s general manager during Rypien’s six years with the Vancouver organization. “Certainly there were no drug or alcohol issues. Depression is the one word that has been used, and that’s accurate.”Rypien’s mother, Nola Rypien, reached at home in Coleman on Tuesday, said, “We’re not doing well — it’s hard.“We’re just trying to make funeral arrangements,” she said, fighting back tears. “I’m sorry, this is not a good time.”It was unclear whether an autopsy was ordered. Autopsies and their results are not public information under Alberta law, said Jane Bartlett, a senior medical investigator for the medical examiner’s office in Calgary.Rypien was injured often in his N.H.L. career, but none of the reported injuries included concussions, which experts say can trigger depression.“When players get injured and have to sit out for long stretches, it can wear on them mentally,” Allain Roy, Rypien’s agent for more than 10 years, said Tuesday. “But Rick was excited about coming to Winnipeg and was looking forward to the upcoming season.”Rypien was granted two leaves of absence by the Canucks in the last three seasons to deal with what were then referred to as personal problems. His second leave of absence followed an incident in Minnesota last Oct. 19, when he fought an opponent, pushed a linesman and then grabbed a fan on his way to the dressing room to serve a penalty.“It’s inexcusable, what I did,” Rypien said at the time.He was suspended for six games. It was a relatively lenient sentence, perhaps mitigated by league officials’ knowledge of what Rypien was going through.When he returned last March, Rypien said he had dealt with “a personal matter, a rare issue.” He added, “I missed a lot of hockey, but certain things needed to be dealt with.”'"
"'11-08-17,'1','Like many of their old-timey contemporaries, the residents of Whiskeytown, a Gold Rush garrison in the mountains of Northern California, were a bit skeptical of outsiders. Filled with prospectors and the entrepreneurs who mined them, Whiskeytown had folks who looked after one another, but also looked long and hard at anyone intruding on their claims or their community.And, indeed, Whiskeytown eventually went under as a result of an outside idea: drowned by waters captured by the federally built Whiskeytown Dam in 1963.Where there was once Whiskeytown, there is now Whiskeytown Lake, a pine-ringed, crystal-clear reservoir just west of Redding, a day-trippers’ paradise with day-trippers’ problems: drinking and smoking marijuana. Employees of the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area try to keep visitors in check, but their biggest worry lately has not been marijuana users but a newcomer with a handle almost as funny as Whiskeytown itself: the quagga mussel, whose pronunciation — qua-gah— makes it sound as if it’s from Fenway Park. In fact, the freshwater quagga mussel is native to Ukraine and has been creeping its way through United States waterways since 1989 when it was first reported in this country.Its method of invasion is sneakier than anything John le Carré might have imagined: making its way in the ballast water of boats and then slowly breeding and clogging pipes and other underwater infrastructure.Russ Weatherbee, a wildlife biologist with the National Park Service, says that if the quagga is left unchecked, its insatiable appetite for plankton could also starve the fish that draw summertime anglers.'"
"'11-08-17,'1','Manchester United, the English Premier League soccer power that is already the most valuable sports team in the world, is preparing to sell shares on the Singapore stock exchange that could raise about $1 billion, according to a person familiar with the plan who declined to be identified before the details of the sale were made public.Manchester United has been something of a paradox since the Glazer family took over the club in 2005. Fans feared that the American owners would run the club into the ground, and fretted about the tens of millions of dollars in debt they added to its balance sheet. Yet the club remains as popular and successful as ever, and revenue has continued to grow.If the Glazers get their way, their fans may be able to breathe a little easier.Manchester United officials declined to comment on the potential share sale. But sports industry advisers say that the Glazers, who also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, would sell only a minority stake in the club and use some of the proceeds to pay off debt and reduce interest expenses.The Glazers are looking to issue shares in Asia because so many of the club’s fans are there, and the team’s popularity would allow it to potentially raise more than it would if it issued shares in London. A listing in Singapore could fuel sales of merchandise, sponsorships and media rights in Asia.“The owners know that a major new investment would put them in a better place and put their relationship with their supporters in a better place,” said John Williams, the director of the Center for the Sociology of Sport at the University of Leicester in England. “I can see this killing a number of birds with one stone.”'"
"'11-08-17,'1','Some other members of the five-person board voiced doubts about the concept, however, saying that the cost of getting new auditors up to speed on large companies every few years would burden both the company being audited and the accounting firms.“I have serious doubts that mandatory rotation is a practical or cost-effective way of strengthening independence,” said Daniel L. Goelzer, who is one of the board’s two certified public accountants. While he recognizes the potential for auditor bias in favor of a client, Mr. Goelzer said, “there are already powerful forces built into public company auditing to foster and maintain independence.”The board has asked for comments on how to improve auditor independence to be submitted by Dec. 14. It also plans a public meeting to discuss the proposal in March. Any rule approved by the board also has to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission to take effect.Mandatory audit firm rotation has been considered at various times since the 1970s. Most recently, in 2002, Congress considered including it in the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, but decided instead to require a report on the topic by the General Accounting Office (now called the Government Accountability Office). The act did require auditors to rotate the partner in charge of a company’s audit every five years.The G.A.O. report, issued in 2003, found that “mandatory audit firm rotation may not be the most efficient way to enhance auditor independence and audit quality.” Firms also estimated that first-year auditing costs would rise by 20 percent as a new auditor got up to speed on a company.But the report also said that the board would need to consider the results of its reviews of audits and auditing firms to determine whether more needed to be done, particularly in cases where a company had used the same auditor for decades.Steven B. Harris, a member of the accounting oversight board, said the evidence showed that the Sarbanes-Oxley measures had failed to eliminate “the strong incentives that lead some auditors to serve the interests of the company paying the bills rather than those of investors.”Eight years of those reviews have revealed “several hundred cases” where “the firm failed to fulfill its fundamental responsibility in the audit — to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,” according to the board’s release.In the most recent reporting cycle, ended last year, the board’s inspectors “have also identified more issues than in prior years.”The board is seeking comments on whether mandatory audit rotation would enhance objectivity among auditors and make them better able to resist management pressure, and if so, what would be an appropriate term length.Also of interest to the board is whether it might require rotation only for a subset of publicly traded companies, like the largest companies; whether there are enough qualified auditors to permit giant multinational companies to change regularly; and whether the practice would lead to opinion shopping.Considering mandatory audit rotation is one of three changes in auditing practice that the board is considering. The other proposals also are still in the early stages. One of those, which has already finished its comment period, would require accounting firms to have the partner in charge of an audit sign the firm’s report, much as a company’s executives have to attest to its financial statements.Another, on which comments are due Sept. 30, would expand the scope of the auditor’s report, which now is little more than a boilerplate statement that the financial information fairly reflects the company’s economic condition.'"
"'11-08-17,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation’s automakers rebounded in July to increase factory production by the most since the crisis in Japan. But builders broke ground on fewer single-family houses, leaving home construction at depressed levels.The mixed data suggest that the economy remains fragile but is not on the cusp of another recession.Overall industrial production, which includes output by utilities, mines and factories, rose 0.9 percent last month, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday. That’s the largest gain this year.Factory output, the biggest component of industrial production, climbed 0.6 percent. It was the greatest increase since the March 11 earthquake in Japan disrupted supply chains and slowed production at some American auto plants.The auto industry accounted for nearly all of the factory production gains. Motor vehicles and parts jumped 5.2 percent. Excluding that category, factory output grew only 0.2 percent.Also driving industrial production higher was an unseasonably hot summer. That led more people to leave their air-conditioners running. Utility output jumped 2.8 percent, the most since December. Mining output also increased.The strong rise in output “suggests that the U.S. economy is not in a recession now, and it’s a fairly encouraging sign that it won’t slip into one, either,” said Paul Dales, senior United States economist with Capital Economics.'"
"'11-08-17,'1','The scandal has already swept through the upper echelons of ’s political, media and law enforcement worlds, resulting in a dozen arrests, the resignations of top officials from the News Corporation and the Metropolitan Police, the withdrawal of the News Corporation’s $12 billion takeover bid for the satellite company BskyB and the summary closing of the 168-year-old News of the World.None of those arrested in the case have yet been formally charged.The parliamentary panel, the Commons committee on culture, media and sport, said that in light of Mr. Goodman’s letter and other documents, it would re-call for further questioning at least four former employees of The News of the World. It also said it might re-call Mr. Coulson as well as Rupert Murdoch’s son , who runs the News Corporation’s European and Asian operations.Both Murdochs appeared last month before the committee in a dramatic hearing punctuated by a bizarre episode in which a self-described comedian attacked the 80-year-old Rupert Murdoch with a plate of shaving cream, only to be slapped down by Mr. Murdoch’s wife, Wendi.Meanwhile, other letters written to the committee at its request in the last few weeks — including one from an outside law firm hired briefly to advise The News of the World in 2007, a second from a former editor at the paper and a third from a former lawyer for News International, the British newspaper arm of the News Corporation — all cast doubt on previous assertions by the Murdochs and other company officials.Particularly embarrassing is the letter from the law firm, Harbottle & Lewis, which was hired by News International in 2007 in the wake of Mr. Goodman’s court case. The Murdochs and others have repeatedly said that they had relied on the firm to investigate whether the hacking was limited to Mr. Goodman and the investigator, , who was also jailed for hacking, and that the firm had assured them it was.But Harbottle & Lewis said that was a mischaracterization. For one thing, it said, News International provided it with only a limited selection of e-mails in five electronic folders on the company server; the law firm was “not given free rein to look through whatever it wanted.”Moreover, it said, its brief was extremely narrow: merely to provide advice on whether the e-mails contained evidence that “other people were aware of the phone hacking activities, or were doing the same thing themselves” that could be relied on by Mr. Goodman in the employment action he had brought against the company to get his job back.After a team of junior associates spent about 46 hours looking through about 2,500 e-mails in the folders, the firm said it had found no such evidence. But there “was absolutely no question of the firm being asked to provide News International with a clean bill of health which it could deploy years later in wholly different contexts for wholly different purposes,” Harbottle & Lewis said. In other words, it was not hired “to find out what the hell was going on,” as Rupert Murdoch asserted recently, Harbottle & Lewis said.In another letter, , a former News International lawyer, told the committee that in June 2008, he had explicitly informed James Murdoch of a damning internal e-mail about phone hacking containing the words “for Neville” — a likely reference to , The News of the World’s former chief reporter. Mr. Crone has said this before, but the letter provided new details.Mr. Crone revealed the e-mail’s existence to James Murdoch, he added, to explain why the company should settle a lawsuit in which a British soccer official, Gordon Taylor, was accusing The News of the World of hacking into his voice mail.The company subsequently paid Mr. Taylor about a million dollars to settle the case. James Murdoch, whose approval was required for the payment, says that no one told him about the e-mail and that he knew nothing about phone hacking beyond Mr. Goodman’s case.In a statement issued Tuesday, News International said that “we recognize the seriousness” of the materials disclosed to the police and Parliament and that it was “committed to working in a constructive and open way with all the relevant authorities.”As for Mr. Goodman, his letter reveals an almost poignant bewilderment at his dismissal from The News of the World since, he says, “other members of staff were carrying out the same illegal procedures” and his actions were “carried out with the full knowledge and support” of his editors.Mr. Goodman’s letter also says that The News of the World’s lawyers all knew he was planning to plead guilty to the charges and had in fact assured him that he could have his job back “if I did not implicate the paper or any of its staff” during court proceedings. But, he said, The News of the World failed to honor its promise and did not rehire him.'"
"'11-08-17,'1','The Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections, the group known as Bersih, or “clean” in Malay, which organized the rally, called the committee a “positive step forward.”“I would like to give this process a chance,” Ambiga Sreenevasan, the chairwoman of Bersih, said in an e-mail. “This is the first time we have ever had a process set up to look at electoral reform.”Bersih later released a statement calling on the committee to submit a report within three months outlining changes to be implemented before the next election. It warned the government not to use the committee as a “delay tactic to stall electoral reforms.”Malaysia holds regular national elections, but Bersih maintains that they are open to manipulation and favor the coalition that has governed Malaysia since independence from Britain in 1957. The changes the group wants to see enacted before the next election include the use of indelible ink on fingers to ensure people vote only once, an assurance that all political parties have equal access to print and broadcast media, and the introduction of a minimum 21- day campaign period before elections.Analysts questioned whether the new committee would lead to substantial reforms.Ong Kian Ming, a political science lecturer at UCSI University in Kuala Lumpur, said it would be difficult to achieve a consensus because the governing coalition representatives would be “much more conservative in proposing recommendations” than opposition members.“Past experiences of select committees and even royal commissions — on the police force, for example — have not led to concrete reform steps being taken by the government,” he said. “I don’t see how this will be any different, especially given the sensitivity of the topic at hand.”James Chin, a political scientist and director of the School of Arts and Social Sciences at Monash University Malaysia, said that there was “no way” that the panel would be able to effect legislative changes before the next election, because the legislative process usually takes 12 months.Elections are not due until mid-2013, but many analysts expect that they will be held by mid-2012.“It’s a P.R. exercise,” Mr. Chin said of the government’s announcement. “They realize that the depth of public support for Bersih was much deeper than they thought. They feel that they have to do something like this to make them look more reasonable.”The opposition alliance, known as Pakatan Rakyat, said that the decision to establish the committee validated the issues it and Bersih had raised. “We consider it a huge feat and win for democratic forces in Malaysia,” the alliance said, and it called for a member of the opposition to be appointed head of the committee.'"
"'11-08-17,'1','Agüero’s transfer fee, about $62 million, was more than the total cost to buy the entire Swansea squad. His fee was more than two dozen times the $2.4 million price Swansea paid for its new Dutch goalkeeper, Michel Vorm.Vorm made 11 saves and was twice spared by his crossbar, as Manchester tormented the plucky but outgunned Swansea. The sublime skills of Spain’s David Silva, the rampaging power of the Ivory Coast’s Yaya Touré, the industry of Bosnia’s Edin Dzeko, just kept on coming.To then introduce Agüero when Swansea wearied bordered on cruelty.With his very first touch, Agüero scored a predator’s goal. Moments later, chasing a ball that appeared to be going out of play, he flicked it over his head for Silva to score another goal. And then Agüero’s coup de grâce made the final score 4-0.He was 25 meters, or about 80 feet, out. The opponents had no energy left to close him down. The Argentine imposed his will on the ball to make it rise, dip and drop into the far corner of the net.Barcelona, I would wager, has just obtained a greater asset for a roughly similar price.On its Web site Monday, before Fàbregas had completed his medical examinations and put his signature to the five-year contract at Camp Nou stadium, Barcelona displayed a photograph of a boy, proudly wearing its burgundy and blue shirt.Those three words explain how Fàbregas, the returned prodigal, will fit in to a side that already seems to have it all. The best team in Europe has room for Fàbregas because of his versatility.He has been Arsenal’s playmaker for six seasons, since he was 18. But Barça has the world’s most exquisite playmaker, the most assured passing exponent, in its own Xavi Hernández.Xavi makes Lionel Messi and Andrés Iniesta and David Villa play like they could not play elsewhere because he intuitively knows when and how to release the ball to them. Fàbregas has done that for Arsenal for years.But Barcelona’s coach, Pep Guardiola — who was the playing idol of Fàbregas a decade ago — might almost have written that headline about versatility.Guardiola knows that Xavi has been overplayed in recent seasons. He has soldiered on, for club and country, with a slight tear in a thigh muscle. In part that was his choice, in part it was the team’s need.Now there will be times when he can relax and rest. When he is fit and bursting to go, his new colleague Fàbregas will simply adapt to any of three roles he is perfectly capable of performing.He can play the anchor role, the defensive midfield position that Sergio Busquets currently holds.He can fit right or left of Xavi, as Pedro and the immaculate Iniesta do.He can, dare one suggest it, play ahead of Xavi, finding space around the opposing penalty box the way that the best player of the modern generation, Messi, does.Something will have to give. Barcelona has also signed Alexis Sánchez, another of the world’s most coveted attacking midfielders, and it has the maturing 20-year-old Thiago Alcântara bursting through. Thiago shone, brilliantly, in the playmaker role on Barça’s preseason tour in the United States.The betting is that Guardiola, who sees Thiago as the future, will solve his problem of surplus by allowing Thiago to leave. A.C. Milan might bid to buy him, but another option is that the player will join Roma on a loan deal.Roma’s new coach, Luis Enrique, was Barcelona’s B-team coach up to two months ago. He has already taken Bojan Krkic, another of Barça’s youngsters, to Rome on a complicated deal that would allow Barcelona to buy him back after two years.One signal that Thiago might depart is that Fàbregas already has the shirt off the player’s back. For reasons both symbolic and sentimental — and no doubt with replica sales of the Nike-branded shirt in mind — Fàbregas had to be given the No. 4 jersey.It was his number at Arsenal, and the number on a shirt given to him by Guardiola at a time when Fàbregas was low after his parents divorced.In all manner of ways, coming home means more in the Fàbregas transfer than in any other transfer. He belongs to this group with Piqué and Iniesta, Xavi and Messi because he learned to play in the same academy.He was top dog at Arsenal but will be one of the boys at Barça. This will not trouble him or the established players he joins for one paramount reason. Barcelona’s credo, bred into those who pass through La Masia soccer academy, is the most beautiful thing in the game: Team first, ego second.'"

"'11-08-18,'0','Robert Carlton Breer was born on Sept. 30, 1926, in Detroit. His father, Carl, was an automotive engineer who designed the Chrysler Airflow and, in his spare time, invented a 3-D camera to film family vacations.Mr. Breer attended Stanford, where he started out as an engineering student but soon turned to art, producing figurative work but undergoing a conversion to abstraction after seeing paintings by Mondrian on a school trip. After earning a bachelor’s degree in 1949, he sailed to France.In Paris he turned out large geometric abstract paintings, which he exhibited at the Denise René Gallery. One of his flip books and several of his films were included in the gallery’s influential 1955 exhibition “Le Mouvement,” which put kinetic art on the map by showcasing the motion-conscious work of artists like Jean Tinguely, Marcel Duchamp, Alexander Calder and Victor Vasarely.Determined to introduce motion into painting, Mr. Breer had already begun making stop-action films, titled “Form Phases,” based on motifs from his paintings. He quickly began developing an idiosyncratic store of images in short animated films whose geometric forms and absurdist tendencies reflected his debt to Dadaism and Russian Constructivism.In “Un Miracle” (1954), a short film that anticipates Terry Gilliam’s work for “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” the pope appears on a balcony and begins juggling balls. Suddenly his head falls off, and he juggles that too.In a 1971 interview with Jonas Mekas, Mr. Breer said, “In all my work I tried to amaze myself with something, and the only way you can amaze yourself is to create a situation in which an accident can happen.”On returning to the United States in 1959, he encountered filmmakers like Stan Brakhage, Kenneth Anger and Mr. Mekas, who were developing a new avant-garde American cinema along lines congenial to his own. He also began collaborating with Pop artists like Claes Oldenburg, with whom he made the film “Pat’s Birthday” (1962), and the leading figures involved in happenings, multimedia art and performance art.Billy Kluver, the Bell Labs scientist who was a founder of the organization Experiments in Art and Technology to bring engineers and artists together, invited Mr. Breer to contribute work for the Pepsi Pavilion at the world’s fair in Osaka, Japan, in 1970. Mr. Breer fashioned large dome-shaped versions of the motorized sculptures he called floats, which moved slowly and randomly.Mr. Breer, who inscribed his images on 4-by-6-inch index cards, devoted considerable ingenuity to undermining traditional narrative structures and speeding up the delivery of images to the viewer’s eye. Rather than having one frame flow to the next, creating a seamless continuity, he made each frame as different as possible from the one that preceded it. A devotee of early cinema technology, he used rotoscopy, a technique devised by Max Fleischer for animating live-action scenes, in “Fuji” (1974), a quasitravelogue based on his experiences in Japan in 1970.He taught film at Cooper Union in Manhattan for 30 years, beginning in 1971.His first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, Kate, he is survived by five daughters, Sophie, of Minneapolis; Julia, of Closter, N.J.; Emily, of Garrison, N.Y.; Sabelle, of Palisades, N.Y.; and Sally, of Los Angeles; a brother, William, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; and three grandchildren.A retrospective of Mr. Breer’s career is on exhibit until Sept. 25 at the Baltic Center for Contemporary Art in Gateshead, England.'"
"'11-08-18,'0','John Fleming, a State Department spokesman, said officials were aware of the students’ protest and had sent staff members to Hershey, Pa., where the candy company is based, to investigate. “It is our job to ensure that all J-1 visa holders are accorded their rights under all provisions of the Summer Work Travel program,” Mr. Fleming said.The arrangements that brought the foreign students to work at the Eastern Distribution Center III, a vast warehouse in a trim industrial park near Hershey, the American chocolate capital, involved layers of contractors.The students said they mainly placed blame on the organization that manages the J-1 visa program for the State Department, the Council for Educational Travel, U.S.A., which is based in California.Rick Anaya, chief executive of the council, said he had brought about 6,000 J-1 visa students to the United States this summer. Mr. Anaya said he had tried to respond to the Palmyra workers’ complaints. “We are not getting any cooperation,” he said. “We are trying to work with these kids. All this negativity is hurting an excellent program. We would go out of our way to help them, but it seems like someone is stirring them up out there.”A spokesman for Hershey’s, Kirk Saville, said the chocolate company did not directly operate the Palmyra packing plant, which is managed by a company called Exel. A spokeswoman for Exel said it had found the student workers through another staffing company.The spokeswoman, Lynn Anderson, said: “We contract with a staffing agency to provide temporary employees, some from the local work force and some J-1 visa holders. We don’t have a lot of influence over some of those issues that they’ve raised.”A labor organization, the National Guestworker Alliance, which has been working with the students, presented a complaint on Wednesday to the State Department asking for the Council for Educational Travel, U.S.A. to be removed from its list of sponsoring organizations.In the protest on Wednesday, about 200 students who were scheduled to start work on an evening shift at 3 p.m. walked into the plant and presented a petition with several hundred signatures to a management representative. Then, together with some students coming off the daytime shift, they marched out.They came down the driveway to the plant, with semi-trailer trucks wheeling by, chanting, “We are the students, the mighty, mighty students!” and labor slogans in English as well as their own languages. The students said they believed that so many of them walking off their jobs would stop some production on their shifts.“We want to own our rights,” Ms. Zhao said, speaking in English. She and three other Chinese students held out their arms, pointing to bruises they said they had from moving large boxes.Representatives from two American labor unions participated in the rally at an intersection outside the plant. Three labor officials, including Rick Bloomingdale, president of the Pennsylvania State Federation of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and Neal Bisno, president of a Pennsylvania branch of the Service Employees International Union, staged a brief sit-in at the plant entrance and were arrested.Harika Duygu Ozer, 19, a second-year medical student from a university in Istanbul, said she had heard from friends that the summer exchange program would be fun and that she would earn enough money to pay for her medical school tuition.“I said, ‘Why not?’ This is America,” Ms. Ozer said.When she was offered a contract for a job at a plant with Hershey’s chocolates, she said, she was excited. “We have all seen Charlie’s chocolate factory,” she said. “We thought, ‘This is good.’ ”Like many other students, Ms. Ozer said she invested about $3,500, which included the program costs, to obtain the J-1 visa and travel to the United States.Several Chinese students, including Ms. Zhao, said they had paid more than $6,000 in the process of securing visas.Ms. Ozer said she worked an eight-hour shift that began at 11 p.m.“You stand for the entire eight hours,” she said. “It is the worst thing for your fingers and hands and your back; you are standing at an angle.”At one of the sites where she worked, she said, cameras were trained on her, and supervisors told her that if she did not want to maintain the pace of work, she should leave.Godwin Efobi, 26, a third-year medical student from Nigeria who is studying at a university in Ukraine, said his job was moving boxes. “Since I came here, I have a permanent ache in my back,” Mr. Efobi said. “Holding a pen is now a big task for me; my muscles ache.”The students said they decided to protest when they learned that neighbors in the apartments and houses where they were staying were paying significantly less rent.“The tipping point was when we found out about the rent,” Mr. Efobi said.Ms. Ozer and other students said they were paid $8.35 an hour. After fees are deducted from her paychecks as well as $400 a month for rent, she said, she often takes home less than $200 a week. “We are supposed to be here for cultural exchange and education, but we are just cheap laborers,” Ms. Ozer said.'"
"'11-08-18,'0','More than 20 percent of women using bladder protection pads report having had the pads leak, said Mr. Kuester, adding that the cause often is a pad bunching up while worn, and that is more likely with heavyset users.Still, Mr. Kuester said that in consumer testing, many slender women also preferred the pad — partly for aesthetic reasons. In what the brand says is a first for the category, the pads, which have primarily been plain white, are printed with pastel floral patterns, as is the box.“Traditionally these have been very square, very white — with some blue to convey their absorbent nature,” Mr. Kuester said. “We’re building a great deal of feminine details into this product so women can feel like this is not an institutional product, that, ‘I can have a feminine care product designed for me that makes me feel feminine.’ ”Nancy Muller, executive director of the National Association For Continence, a nonprofit educational and advocacy group, lauded the Poise Hourglass approach.“It’s brilliant in the sense that when women are leaking urine from their bladders they can feel very uncomfortable, very unclean, and they certainly don’t feel sexy,” Ms. Muller said. “What Kimberly-Clark is trying to achieve here is that you can still feel feminine, you can still feel like a woman and every bit as pretty.”While the brand, which coined the term “light bladder leakage” as a less stigmatizing alternative to “incontinence,” pitches the product to all women over 18, the primary target is women aged 45 to 55.In what the brand also says will be a first, end-of-aisle displays at retailers including Wal-Mart and Walgreens will include an actual Poise Hourglass pad that is reinforced with foam core to hold its shape.“This is a category that doesn’t get a lot of in-store support, but retailers have been supportive because of our marketing spend,” Mr. Kuester said. He described the advertising effort, which along with print will include online advertising, as a multimillion-dollar campaign, and as the biggest to date for Poise, but declined to provide the exact cost. Poise spent $12.8 million on advertising in 2010, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.The American market for adult incontinence pads and disposable garments is surging, mainly because of aging baby boomers. Euromonitor International estimated annual sales at $1.3 billion in 2010, up from $971 million in 2005.Kimberly-Clark dominates the category, with its more substantial Depend line accounting for 31 percent of the market and Poise with 25 percent, according to data for the 52 weeks ending July 10 from the SymphonyIRI Group, whose totals do not include Wal-Mart. Sales for Poise were up 6.9 percent for the period.An online campaign last year for Poise featured Whoopi Goldberg, the actress and co-host of “The View,” depicting historical figures including Helen of Troy and Joan of Arc suffering from weak bladders.Consumer shame about the issue may be one of the biggest challenges for the industry, with the trade publication Nonwovens Industry summing it up this way in a recent headline: “Incontinence, an embarrassment of riches.”Writing in the Euromonitor Global Market Research blog in 2010, Rob Walker, an analyst based in London, said both in America and internationally, “the biggest challenge for the industry is that vast numbers of sufferers are too embarrassed to raise the problem of incontinence with their health practitioner, or worse, even buy available products at a retail outlet.”To address that, Mr. Walker added, “the commercial opportunity here is for the big international hygiene players to humanize (or even Viagra-ize) incontinence, making products as accessible, consumer-friendly and embarrassment-free as, for example, women’s sanitary protection.”Asked to review the new Poise Hourglass design and advertisement, Mr. Walker, in a telephone interview from London, said that he thought the brand was on track.“If Kimberly-Clark can bring in an incontinence product geared to women and present it within the feminine care category, it makes a lot of sense,” Mr. Walker said. “It’s about breaking down barriers, and it’s taking out that whole geriatric vibe from incontinence.”'"
"'11-08-18,'0','The Panel for Educational Policy on Wednesday approved a $120 million contract with a Verizon subsidiary to provide phone and Internet services for two years at city schools, despite calls for postponing the vote and boisterous protests over Verizon’s possible role in federal theft charges against an Education Department consultant.The approval essentially legitimizes a service that has been provided since Jan. 1 and is part of a phone-and-data package shared by several city agencies, including the offices of the comptroller, John C. Liu, and the public advocate, Bill de Blasio, who joined the chorus of critics before the vote.The outcome was not unexpected, but approval was not unanimous. The vote at the advisory panel’s monthly meeting, held at Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers in Lower Manhattan, was 8 to 4. The panel replaced the old Board of Education.Complaints came from people inside and outside of the school, before and during the meeting, injecting the current strike by Verizon’s landline workers into the controversy. Mr. Liu, whose office registered the contract in May, said that a yes vote on the contract would essentially validate the company’s demands for cuts to workers’ health and benefit funds.In a letter sent to the panel’s members on Tuesday, James J. Gerace, president of Verizon’s New York region, accused the Communication Workers of America, which represents many of the striking employees, of fomenting a campaign against the contract by disseminating what he called “patently false” information about Verizon’s role in the theft charges.On Wednesday, hundreds of people, most of them wearing red, the color of shirts that Verizon workers are wearing on picket lines, packed the school’s auditorium, some holding signs that read, “While Verizon profits, kids and workers lose.”In April, federal authorities arrested Willard Lanham, a former technology consultant for the Education Department, on charges that he stole $3.6 million over six years. He is accused of using contractors for Verizon, as well as I.B.M., to hide the scheme. A report by Richard J. Condon, the special investigator for the city’s schools, accused Verizon and I.B.M. of facilitating the fraud by keeping silent.'"
"'11-08-18,'0','“A lot of folks are selling, but also a lot of people think the price will keep going up,” he said as jewelers brought small piles of gold jewelry to his counter for estimates. Mr. Velez’s men rasped the pieces on smooth test stones and then dabbed nitric acid on the rubbed-off gold to determine its purity.Outside, Ramon Barrenechea, 59, of Staten Island, was capitalizing on the rush in his own way. Mr. Barrenechea, an immigrant from Peru, makes his own flat test stones by hand and was selling them for more than $50.The diamond district does not particularly need a gold rush to invigorate its sidewalks. The block always percolates with business and energy.About $24 billion is exchanged each year in sales in and around the district, among roughly 3,000 businesses, said Michael Toback, an executive board member of the 47th Street Business Improvement District and an owner of Myron Toback, a jewelry supply and refinery business on the block.Amid all this industry, the district can be one of the strangest places in the city. Near Fifth Avenue on Tuesday, a scruffy bear of a man with no shirt on was scooping up rainwater and giving himself a cat bath as passers-by stared.Hawkers from kosher delis handed out menus. One could hear New York accents, as well as Russian and also Yiddish, spoken by the many Hasidic men who work here, in black hats and coats.Some of the most colorful characters were the hawkers: street-savvy men hired by jewelry dealers to spot potential customers on the block and coax them into their shops. The surging price of gold has cranked up the metabolism of these figures: the swaggering, smooth-talking sidewalk representatives for the many businesses.“We’ve had a lot more action the past couple weeks,” said a 51-year-old hawker named Al, who wore a “We Buy Gold” sign around his neck and courted customers by showing a piece of paper listing the latest prices for 24-karat and lesser gold. “Business has been good.”Al would not give his last name (“I got grandkids — I don’t want them to know I do this”) but said he tells customers that gold prices were so high that he was selling rings off his fingers.“I tell people, ‘I had a ring I bought for $40 back in the day, and I just sold it for $200,’ ” he said.Not all hawkers were as cheerful, complaining that sales were not brisk enough, even as they still quoted prices as high as $1,790 an ounce on Wednesday morning.“A lot of people know what they have, and they’re waiting to see if they can sit on it longer, for a better offer,” said Denis Garasimov, who said he was hawking for Diamond District Gold Buyers. “It’s a straight-out gamble right now.”Victor Velez, 38, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who held a laminated “We Buy Gold” sign, nodded as he handed out cards for the Royal Gems Corporation.“A lot of people are holding on to it because they are seeing how high it can go,” Mr. Velez said.When the Goldsteins first set foot on the block, they were approached by a hawker named Anthony Palmer, 47, of Springfield Gardens, Queens. Mr. Palmer, who works a small patch of sidewalk near Avenue of the Americas, said he earns $100 a day from the company he works for, and sometimes receives tips from customers happy with the price they get for their gold.“You see there’s no other hawkers in this spot but me — this is my fiefdom,” he said. “That’s how it works. We respect each other’s space. When you get rogue hawkers cutting in, sometimes you got to be forceful.”The surge in gold prices is attracting more traffic, he said, but when it comes to selling gold, personal needs often trump market price.“It really ebbs and flows on people’s own economics,” he said. “You get desperate people at the beginning and the end of the month, when they’re facing their bills.”'"
"'11-08-18,'0','Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London, called it “a positive step that this debate is taking place in Germany and that there is an acceptance that pooling fiscal authority is a necessary precondition of a lasting conclusion of the crisis.”“But there is a risk,” he added pointedly, “that in order to sell this to domestic opinion, Germany will extract concessions that will render the whole thing unworkable.”This is just the latest phase of a debate that has ebbed and flowed over decades of European integration. Indeed, when the rule book for introducing the euro — which came to be known as the Stability and Growth Pact — was being drafted, it was completed only after a fractious summit meeting in Dublin Castle in Ireland in 1996.The patched-together pact, put in place in advance of the introduction of the single currency in 1999, was criticized by many economists from the start. By 2002, with France complaining about the need for more flexibility to promote growth during downturns, Romano Prodi, then the president of the European Commission, described it as “stupid.”France put together a coalition, ultimately supported by Germany, that prevented the imposition of sanctions on countries that violated the rule limiting annual budget deficits to 3 percent of a nation’s gross domestic product. France and Germany themselves were among those breaching the limits.The debt crisis has now brought the debate back to its starting point.Under the emerging set of proposals being pushed by Germany and France, strict new rules would enforce discipline, including fines for sinning countries, which might also lose certain subsidies. The idea of a European finance ministry has been put forward. Debt brakes would be written into constitutions or national law.Euro zone leaders would have regular summit meetings presided over by a president who, according to talk within the corridors of power, may also lead meetings of the 17 finance ministers.That is good news for the top contender, Herman Van Rompuy, the former Belgian prime minister who is president of the European Council, which represents the 27 governments in the European Union, and who has maneuvered skillfully for a greater role in coordinating economic policy.A new bailout mechanism would grow into a sort of European version of the International Monetary Fund, with a bigger staff and powers to buy bonds on the secondary market. And despite the current opposition of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, common euro bonds — which would put the collective strength and collateral of all the euro area countries behind sovereign debt — could eventually become a reality.As usual with these deals, however, consensus is elusive.Germany most wanted the debt brakes and strict surveillance of other euro zone governments, with tough punishment for violators. Under pressure from domestic voters horrified at having to bail out a Greek government that lied about its economic data, Mrs. Merkel needs to persuade Germans that the debt crisis won’t rear its ugly head again. The message at home is that the euro zone economy will be recreated in Germany’s image.France, meanwhile, insisted on new structures to forge integration, led by the 17 prime ministers and presidents, and pressed hard on issues like harmonizing corporate tax rates.With an election looming, Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, wants to cast himself in his home country as the savior of the single currency and the driving force behind European integration. Mr. Sarkozy appropriated the notion of strict fiscal discipline to outflank his socialist opposition by making it a centerpiece of the new plans.The next few months will determine whether this hastily drawn agreement intended to satisfy multiple constituencies will actually upgrade the euro zone’s creaking, often chaotic, structures into something workable in an era of unforgiving markets.None of this will be easy. It will fall to Mr. Van Rompuy to produce a coherent set of proposals.Europe still hasn’t resolved the fundamental question it skirted back in 1996 at Dublin Castle: Is the euro more in need of Germanic fiscal stability or the growth and stimulus policies that France traditionally champions?“It is not going to help the euro zone,” said Mr. Tilford of the Center for European Reform, if “they enforce unworkable positions on the rest of the euro zone.”He added, “The markets are concerned about debt levels — but also about growth.”'"
"'11-08-18,'0','“I can’t remember the last time I had two first-round exits,” Wozniacki said. “It’s a bit different.”Before Wednesday, McHale, 19, had never defeated a player ranked higher than ninth. She pulled off the biggest upset of her career by beating Wozniacki at her own baseline game. McHale, who is from Englewood Cliffs, N.J., tracked down ball after ball and waited for Wozniacki to make a mistake. Wozniacki obliged with 37 unforced errors. McHale had 23 winners to Wozniacki’s 16.“Obviously, if you make a lot of unforced errors and you don’t make a lot of winners, it’s difficult to win,” Wozniacki said. “Just need to move forward and that’s it.”The golfer Rory McIlroy, who has been romantically linked to Wozniacki since they met last month at a boxing match in Germany on the Saturday of the women’s final at Wimbledon, watched the match from the stands. After her unceremonious exit, he rushed past reporters to catch up to her.Williams, 29, came to this tournament having won her previous two, the first time she had strung together consecutive victories since 2008. She appeared to be moving well Tuesday in her straight-sets win over Lucie Hradecka. It extended Williams’s match-victory streak to 12, her longest stretch of success in more than three years.After pulling out of the tournament, Williams walked into the interview room in sneakers. She said she felt pain in the foot during her first-round match, “and I thought, O.K., this is normal.”“But I don’t think this is a good time for me to take a big chance,” she said. “I just don’t think that would be smart.”Williams said her toe was swollen when she woke up Wednesday. She said she went to the gym to test the toe before taking the court for practice. “That definitely didn’t sit well,” Williams said.She spoke with her father, Richard, and phoned her sister Venus, who is home in Florida recovering from a viral illness, before making the decision not to play against Stosur, whom she defeated in the final in Toronto on Sunday.“If anything, this might be a blessing in disguise,” Williams said. “I might get some more rest and prepare for the rest of the year.”The injury came with a silver lining. A friend of Williams, the reality-television star Kim Kardashian, is marrying Kris Humphries of the Nets on Saturday, and now she can attend.“I hadn’t thought about it,” she said. “Now that I have time, I probably will.”In the men’s bracket, second-seeded Rafael Nadal beat the qualifier Julien Benneteau, 6-4, 7-5, despite burns on the index and middle finger of his right hand, which he uses to steady his backhand shot. Nadal said he touched a hot plate at a restaurant a few days ago. (AP)'"
"'11-08-18,'0','The school year arrives as the city continues to regain its footing after the tornado killed 160 people, the most in the in more than a half-century, and destroyed thousands of homes as it tore across a third of Joplin on May 22.The cratered landscape has been tidied somewhat since then, and there are signs of rebirth like the wood frames of replacement homes, the “opening soon” declarations on rebuilt businesses and the green shoots on the storm-stripped trees, raising the hope that at least a few of them may survive.The most anticipated indication of progress, one that led residents of a nearby home to line the street cheering for the arriving teenagers, has been the opening of the schools. It is a moment the city is celebrating not only because it delivered on a promise that seemed out of reach to many, but also because it indicated a return to a measure of normalcy.“It’s a happy day,” Monica Mihajlovic, who is working to rebuild her family home, said before picking up her daughter Mia from her first day of second grade at a temporary school. “It’s the day we’re going to stop surviving and start living again.”In the coming months, everything from shifting school enrollment numbers to the students’ will be analyzed for insight into the true toll of the storm and for what the future holds for this community. The first day brought 6,978 students, about 750 fewer than the enrollment at the end of last year. Officials said the turnout exceeded expectations and might rise.“This is one more step, and it’s a fairly big step,” said Mayor Mike Woolston, who said the schools are essential to retaining and eventually growing the city’s population, which was about 50,000 in the 2010 census but has dropped since the storm.“It shows we’re getting to be O.K., getting back to normal,” Mr. Woolston added. “We’ve got a long way to go.”The tornado struck on a Sunday, shortly after Joplin High School’s class of 2011 finished its graduation ceremony, which was held two weeks before the end of the school year at a local university. The school buildings were empty, but among those killed were seven students and one staff member, whose son began his senior year this week. An estimated 3,000 students lived in the storm’s path, and many of them were injured or lost their homes.Six of the 18 schools were so badly damaged that they will be razed. Three others, and the administration building, require serious repairs. But less than two days after the tornado, C. J. Huff, the superintendent, announced that the schools would reopen on schedule on Aug. 17.Mr. Huff held to the deadline even as it became clear the damage was worse than estimated, and despite doubts from other officials and contractors that it was even possible.“It became a rallying point for the community,” said Ashley Micklethwaite, president of the local Board of Education.With the help of state and federal financing, the district spent more than $30 million to reopen the buildings that survived, rent new space and bring in special modular classrooms. The high school’s freshmen and sophomores were moved to one building, and the juniors and seniors are taking classes at the former department store. Architects were encouraged to “Eagle it up,” adorning the new spaces with images of the school mascot.School bus routes were extended to nearby areas where many families moved after the storm.“We didn’t want to lose our community; we didn’t want to lose our families,” Mr. Huff said. “Schools are a big part of why people are in Joplin, and getting back to normal quickly was very important.”There have been plenty of memorials in Joplin since May, but there were none on Wednesday. The tension between looking back and looking forward has been an additional challenge. The district has hired extra counselors. Teachers have been instructed to look for signs of trauma and to encourage students to discuss the tornado if they want and not to press if they do not.When Alana Bell, a third-grade teacher at Irving Elementary, welcomed her students to their new classroom in a modular building, she started by asking them if they had anything they wanted to share about the tornado. Most did, talking about hiding in bathtubs and hearing lots of noise, some obviously borrowing from their parents oft-told stories.Ms. Bell teared up, but her students did not. “We’ll talk about it every time they bring it up,” she said later. “But I think it’s healthy for us to move on.”Afterward, she took her students on a tour of four new concrete storm shelters next to the playground.Parents were relieved by the start of school, too.Diane Huddleston recalled spending hours after the tornado trying to find medical care for a deep wound in her 13-year-old daughter’s leg that ultimately required an 11-day hospital stay.But this week, the girl, Emily, limped into her old elementary school with a scrapbook about her odyssey and a bandage on her left leg, accompanying her brother and sister , who were starting the third grade.Ms. Huddleston said she would make good use of the solitude provided by the first day of school: “I think I’m just going to sit in the house and cry. You hate to cry in front of your children. You’re supposed to be strong for them. When I drop them off at school it will be time to cry.”'"
"'11-08-18,'0','A range of stocks gained on Wednesday, including those in telecommunications, utilities and consumer staples. Investors took guidance on the economy and consumer spending from results.Seasonal factors appeared to help Target, which logged a higher profit aided by school-related sales. Its shares rose more than 2 percent. Staples closed slightly lower and raised its outlook, and earnings exceeded expectations.But the technology sector, after the Dell results, “cast a pall over consumer spending and business spending,” said Mark D. Luschini, the chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “Everybody is looking for any kind of signal or litmus test as to which way this is going to break.”If consumers pull back because of political, economic or equity-related uncertainties, he said, that leaves little “horsepower to drive our economic activity,” increasing “the risk of a recession.”Over all, the declines in the equities market were slight — less than 1 percent in each of the three main indexes — but a reversal from the trend in early trading.The market is recovering from volatility last week, and fell on Tuesday in the aftermath of a meeting between leaders of the euro zone’s two largest economies, France and Germany.While many say the equities markets will remain unsteady for some time, bargain-hunters are benefiting from the recent lows.“I think that the market is still reacting to a pretty oversold condition technically,” said Tom Samuels, of Palantir Capital Management. He said that through early September it might continue to be “a little bullish.” At the close, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 0.09 percent at 1,193.89. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.04 percent at 11,410.21 and the Nasdaq was down 0.47 percent to 2,511.48. The price on the 10-year Treasury note rose 16/32 to 99 20/32, and the yield fell to 2.17 percent, compared to 2.23 percent Tuesday.On Wednesday, there appeared to be an early rally leading the riskier side of the market, and some strength in the commodity sector after a relatively benign reading in an important indicator of producer prices, Mr. Samuels noted.The broadest indicator of wholesale prices edged up 0.2 percent in July, according to the Labor Department. Not counting food and energy, the indicator, the Producer Price Index, was up 0.4 percent, the most rapid increase in six months.'"
"'11-08-18,'0','“We are certainly heading for greater economic integration of the euro zone,” Mr. Sarkozy said.The much-anticipated meeting at the Élysée Palace here produced little that would seem to quell the nerves of bond traders, who are becoming increasingly worried that the economic slowdown in both Germany and France will make it harder to overcome .Both leaders ruled out issuing collective , known as eurobonds, to share responsibility for government debt across member states, and they opposed a further increase in a bailout fund that will not be put into place until late September at the earliest.Mrs. Merkel repeated that there was “no magic wand” to solve all the problems of the euro, arguing that they must be met over time with improved fiscal discipline, competitiveness and economic growth among weaker states.Even the stronger members of the euro zone have stalled. Official figures released on Tuesday showed that growth in the zone fell to its lowest rate in two years during the second quarter, and that Germany — considered the Continent’s locomotive — came almost to a standstill, growing 0.1 percent.The German figures followed data showing that the French economy was flat in the second quarter, leaving Europe’s two largest economies stagnant. That means the two pillars of the European economy may be less willing and able to prop up their weaker counterparts, analysts warned.Across the euro zone, gross domestic product rose only 0.2 percent in the second quarter from the first, when growth had advanced by 0.8 percent, according to Eurostat, the ’s statistics agency.The joint French-German proposals were as modest as German officials had forecast. And the most ambitious idea — that all euro zone states legally bind themselves to working toward balanced budgets and reduced sovereign debt — is unlikely to be accepted by all member states. It may not even get through the French constitutional process, since Mr. Sarkozy does not have a constitutional majority in .The proposal calling for twice-yearly meetings and increased integration could formalize the “two-speed Europe” — of those in the euro zone and those outside it — that many warned of when the European Union expanded so rapidly after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.Both leaders said that France and Germany must set an example, citing their agreement to propose jointly a financial-transaction tax by 2013 as “an example of convergence” needed in the entire euro zone. But such a tax is unlikely in the larger European Union, especially if Britain, which is outside the euro zone and contains Europe’s biggest financial center, continues to resist the idea.They also said they would work to harmonize French and German economic assessments and, in the future, corporate tax rates.“France and Germany are committed to strengthen the euro,” Mrs. Merkel said. “To that end we need to better integrate our economies” and “to see that the stability pact will be acted on.”The stability pact, a central element of the treaty that established the euro zone, commits members to keep fiscal deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product a year and total sovereign debt under 60 percent of G.D.P. Both benchmarks are regularly missed.The Sarkozy-Merkel meeting came after a dizzying week in the markets and a general gloom about the lack of European leadership on the euro. Economists said the weak data could simply reflect a pause after two years of brisk expansion. But the numbers could also signal that the sovereign debt crisis is undercutting growth outside the countries like that are most directly affected.“The longer the sovereign debt market remains stressed, the greater will be the damage to the wider economy,” Lloyd Barton, an economist, said in a note Tuesday.If there was any silver lining, it was the hope that slower growth would lead to less inflation, giving the more leeway to keep interest rates low and intervene in bond markets. Since last week, the bank has been buying Italian and debt on the open market to hold down yields so the two countries do not face ruinous borrowing costs.What impetus remains in the European economy came from countries like and . Even , with growth of 0.3 percent compared with the previous quarter, outperformed Germany. A whiff of hope came from , one of the countries at the heart of the , as the economy stopped shrinking for the first time since October 2010.Given the problems in the euro zone — sovereign debt, undercapitalized , aging populations, imbalances in trade, growth and competitiveness between northern and southern countries — many analysts and some officials have been pushing for the introduction of eurobonds, which would combine the credibility and collateral of all the members of the currency union.But that could lead to a rise in borrowing costs for Germany and France, and a considerable rise in risk, too, something that neither country is currently prepared to accept, beyond a July 21 agreement to expand a bailout fund to 440 billion euros.Mrs. Merkel in particular, cautious by nature, rules in a coalition with a weakened partner, the liberal Free Democrats. Her own Christian Democrats are largely against writing blank checks for Europe, and the German constitutional court may not find eurobonds legal. Mrs. Merkel could probably find support among the opposition Social Democrats and Greens, but that would divide her party and undermine her government.Mrs. Merkel is going to have enough trouble getting the July 21 agreement through Parliament.As the chancellor’s European-minded finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, told the newsmagazine Der Spiegel over the weekend, “I rule out eurobonds as long as member states conduct their own financial policies.”'"

He would have had to sit out five games had he returned to Ohio State.“We accept that voluntarily,” Pryor’s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said. “It’s a small price to pay for him to have a chance to pursue his dream of playing in the N.F.L.”A league spokesman, Greg Aiello, sent out a Twitter message saying players cannot break the rules, as Pryor did, “and get a free pass into the N.F.L.”Pryor will have a pro day on Saturday in Pittsburgh for all 32 N.F.L. teams.

"'11-08-19,'0','“While the National Archives is satisfied that the destruction has stopped, N.A.R.A. remains concerned that the S.E.C. has been slow in creating records schedules for review and approval by the Archivist of the United States that will ultimately determine how long these M.U.I. records need to be maintained,” the archives’ statement said.John Nester, an S.E.C. spokesman, confirmed that the agency was working with the archives to agree on a policy on file retention. “You have to be thorough and deliberative,” he said.“We maintain records of our inquiries and they are available to investigators across the agency,” Mr. Nester said in a separate statement. “As N.A.R.A. notes, it works with federal agencies on a regular basis to resolve allegations and we are committed to that process.”The S.E.C.’s policy had long been to dispose of documents related to a preliminary investigation if the agency’s enforcement division decided to close the inquiry. If the S.E.C. decided to upgrade an inquiry to a full investigation, all records from both the preliminary and the formal investigation were retained.The policy to dispose of documents was almost unknown outside the S.E.C. until last year, when Darcy Flynn, an employee for 13 years in the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, took the information to the National Archives, which began an investigation in July 2010.Six months earlier, Mr. Flynn began a job helping to manage records disposition for the enforcement division, and he determined that the policy appeared to violate federal law.In a letter documenting Mr. Flynn’s charges, written by his lawyer, Gary J. Aguirre, he maintains that at least 9,000 case files were destroyed over the last two decades.Two months ago, unsatisfied with the S.E.C.’s response to the National Archives investigation, Mr. Flynn hired Mr. Aguirre, of San Diego. Last month, he told his story to investigators for the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has opened an inquiry.It is not clear exactly how the document disposal policy came into practice. The S.E.C.’s formal policy guide to records retention, dated September 1997, contains no reference to files on preliminary inquiries at all, much less when they should be retained or destroyed.Mr. Nester, the S.E.C. spokesman, said that the policy of how to dispose of a case dates to at least 1992. At about that time, the enforcement division issued guidelines that documents related to preliminary inquiries should be disposed of if a file was closed without being upgraded to a formal investigation. A new tracking system installed about five years ago allowed the agency to keep more information about cases even after they were closed, he said.The document disposal is a concern, however, because it “would appear to greatly handicap the S.E.C.’s ability to create patterns in complex cases,” Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a letter to the S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro.“It doesn’t make sense that an agency responsible for investigations would want to get rid of potential evidence,” Senator Grassley said in a separate statement.Mr. Flynn, the whistle-blower, who continues to work at the S.E.C., declined an interview request through his lawyer. The lawyer, Mr. Aguirre, has significant experience with whistle-blower cases.A former staff lawyer at the agency, Mr. Aguirre was fired in 2005 during an insider-trading investigation involving a prominent hedge fund. After filing a whistle-blower wrongful termination lawsuit, he received a $755,000 settlement from the S.E.C. in June 2010.'"
"'11-08-19,'0','Time Warner, which operates in some of the East Coast markets affected by the Verizon strike, is running ads promising speedy service, and it has increased the number of field technicians so that it can do cable installations within 48 hours.“When folks are in a time when they might not be able to get service, we are emphasizing not just the price but our high level of service,” said Todd Townsend, chief marketing officer for Time Warner’s eastern region.Officials at the two unions on strike — the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — say they are certain that the walkout is causing delays in repairs and installations, but they acknowledge they do not know by how much.“Historically we know that you can’t pull out of any system 45,000 people who are the hands and minds of the company’s product and expect to provide the same level of service as before,” said George Kohl, special assistant to the president of the C.W.A. “The managers who are replacing them don’t perform these functions nearly as efficiently.”Verizon said that problems for existing customers had been minimal.“We’re seeing some minor delays on a few repairs and installations,” said Christopher M. Creager, Verizon’s senior vice president for consumer and mass business markets. “The vast majority of our customers are not seeing any impact.”Verizon officials acknowledge, however, that they decided not to take any new orders for the first two weeks of the strike so they could focus on serving their current customers.“We are seeing some delays on the installation side if it’s a brand-new installation that requires technicians to come out,” Mr. Creager said. He explained that it was a mistake to tell Mr. Kreger that his installation date would be Dec. 30, saying the date would be well before that.That has upset potential customers like Dylan Marsh, who are complaining about delays in obtaining FiOS service, which offers Internet, cable TV and phone service over high-speed fiber optic lines and competes with the services sold by cable companies like Time Warner and Comcast.Mr. Marsh, who just graduated from Buffalo State College with a degree in urban planning, wanted to order Verizon’s FiOS Internet and television services for his new apartment on West 49th Street in Manhattan.“They let me go through the whole signup and then at the end they said, ‘There are no installation dates available. Someone will contact you,’ ” Mr. Marsh said. “That was probably a week ago. They were trying to make it seem like everything is O.K., like the service is there but it’s not. I thought it would be a couple of weeks, but it might end up being a couple of months. I decided to go with Time Warner instead.”Verizon said the company’s efforts to keep up had also been set back by numerous incidents of sabotage and by the huge rainstorm that struck the East Coast last weekend.Verizon is pushing the unions to accept far-reaching concessions, including a pension freeze and fewer sick days, and asking that workers contribute far more toward their health coverage.Negotiations between the two sides are continuing, but at the same time, both are preparing for a protracted strike.In a recent move, Verizon has sought to step up pressure on the strikers by informing them that the company will cut off their medical, dental and optical benefits on Aug. 31.Since the strike began, union officials have been eager to make the case that the company’s operations were being badly hurt. Meanwhile, the company has sought to bolster its position by asserting that the strike is having little impact on service.“We have been preparing for this for months, and when the strike took place, we deployed thousands of managers from across the country to be able to handle customer service requests,” Mr. Creager said. “We made a commitment to take care of the customers we have.”Mr. Schiffer, the boutique bank’s chief executive, said most phones at his nine-person firm, Sevara Capital Markets, had not been working since Aug. 9.“This is really affecting our business,” he said. “Clients have been telling us they can’t get through.”Asked about the repair delays faced by Sevara, Mr. Creager of Verizon said, “That is not typical of the vast majority of our customers.”Richard Young, a Verizon spokesman, said the company had received hundreds of supportive e-mails from customers.In one e-mail shared by the company, John Ness, a councilman in Townsend, Del., wrote last Sunday to thank two field technicians who repaired his phone, Internet and cable service several days before a scheduled appointment.'"
"'11-08-19,'0','Re “The Revenge of the Rating Agencies,” by Jeffrey Manns (Op-Ed, Aug. 10):Inflated ratings were the primary cause of both the credit crisis of 2008 and the developing European credit crisis of 2011. Ratings artificially increased the value of securities, and subsequent downgrades left leveraged institutions with severe capital shortfalls. As a result, faith in ratings has been broken, which has heightened investor wariness and slowed capital flows.Policy makers need to restore faith in ratings to encourage capital flows and accelerate the economic recovery. We must address the inherent conflict of interest in the current system: a rating firm cannot be independent if it is paid by the very issuers it rates.A proposal to select rating agencies based on their timeliness and accuracy passed the Senate during the financial reform debate, but intense lobbying by the major rating agencies reduced this initiative to a watered-down feasibility study by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Rather than imposing costly and ineffective regulatory burdens on rating firms, policy makers need to address the issuer-pay conflict of interest. Until policy makers tackle this problem, the credibility of ratings will remain tainted, and capital markets and the larger economy will continue to struggle to gauge risks.The writer is managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings.'"
"'11-08-19,'0','LONDON — Greece’s international bailout hit a new obstacle Thursday when three euro zone countries indicated they were likely to seek collateral in exchange for their loan. Finland earlier reached a similar deal with the debt-laden government in Athens.Though the three countries — Austria, the Netherlands and Slovakia — are small or midsize economies, accounting for little more than 10 percent of the new bailout of 109 billion euros ($156 billion), their intervention presents a headache for policy makers.“If this spreads as we fear it could, it is not a minor complication,” said one European official who spoke on condition of anonymity.The effort threatens to complicate negotiations on the second package of aid agreed to by euro zone leaders in July, creating an additional problem for officials seeking to bring the Continent’s debt crisis under control.During negotiations on July’s bailout deal, Finland insisted on collateral being offered by the Greeks, and the country has negotiated a bilateral arrangement with Athens. That plan is now being discussed by officials from the other euro zone nations, whose approval is needed.In a statement, Amadeu Altafaj Tardio, a European Commission spokesman, highlighted “the importance of rapid and full implementation” of the July deal “to safeguard financial stability in Europe.”'"
"'11-08-19,'0','LONDON — The British police arrested the Hollywood reporter for the defunct tabloid The News of the World on Thursday, according to a person close to the investigation. He is the 13th person to be arrested in the scandal over phone hacking.The reporter, James Desborough, worked in Britain for the newspaper for four years before being sent to Hollywood in 2009. It is not clear when the crimes he is suspected of committing — gaining illegal access to other people’s voice mail messages — took place. Until 2005, Mr. Desborough covered celebrity culture for The People, a Sunday tabloid owned by Trinity Mirror, which also publishes The Daily Mirror and The Sunday Mirror.He was sent to Hollywood by The News of the World shortly after being named “showbiz reporter of the year” at the annual British Press Awards. The judges said Mr. Desborough had “produced a series of uncompromising scoops which mean no celebrity with secrets can sleep easy.”Among those articles was an exclusive report revealing that Fern Britton, a British television personality who claimed to have lost a large amount of weight through diet and exercise, had in fact had gastric band surgery. Mr. Desborough also appears to have been the first journalist to report that Peaches Geldof, daughter of the rock star Bob Geldof, was getting a divorce after a hurried marriage in 2008.In addition, Mr. Desborough wrote exclusive articles about Heather Mills before her divorce from Sir Paul McCartney. Ms. Mills recently said she believed that she had, at some point, been a victim of phone hacking.'"
"'11-08-19,'0','Gold rose along with Treasuries as investors sought safety. Oil prices fell on expectations that demand would be tempered in a slowdown.The S.& P. 500 has now fallen more than 16 percent from its April 29 peak. It is once again near bear market territory, defined as a fall of 20 percent.Analysts said the fear stalking markets was not going away. “We took a little break for a couple days, and it is reinstating itself and I just think that this should probably be expected,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at in New York.After the sell-offs in Asia and Europe on Thursday, stock prices opened lower in the United States on a spate of dismal economic data. Consumer prices suggested inflation was picking up, and jobless claims rose, defying hopes that the nation’s high unemployment rate might slide.The big stock plunge, though, came around 10 a.m., when the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported a sharp drop in regional manufacturing activity in its monthly survey, deepening worries that the economy may dip back into recession.That report came a day after lowered its forecasts for both worldwide and domestic economic growth, partly because it expected cuts in government spending in Europe and the United States to damp recoveries. It described the United States and the euro area as “hovering dangerously close to a recession” and said it would not take much in the form of additional shocks to tip the balance.The yield on 10-year dropped to 1.97 percent on the Fed news before recovering to close at 2.07. According to data from Bloomberg, that low during the day was the lowest yield since at least 1962. Global Financial Data, a supplier of historical financial and economic statistics, said it was the lowest since 1950.“What freaked me out today was that Philly Fed number,” said James W. Paulsen, chief strategist for Wells Capital Management. “That was the first number that says recession.”That sentiment was echoed by Eric Green, an economist at TD Securities. “When you have an economy operating at stall speed facing these headwinds, it does not take much to tip it over the edge,” he said. “You read a report like this and you think we are going over the edge.”said in a note that if the Philadelphia numbers proved a national barometer, and that was unknown, “then a recession likely began in August.”The latest worries about Europe’s banks flared after an unnamed lender tapped an emergency borrowing program, which was established by the European Central Bank to ensure that firms had ample money in dollars.The bank borrowed $500 million, a relatively modest sum. But it was the first time a bank had turned to the special program since February, and it set off worries that at least some banks might be struggling to find dollars to finance their operations.Regulators and bank executives played down the possibility that it could lead to a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when markets froze virtually around the world.But that news, combined with a report that the New York has in recent weeks been more closely monitoring the American subsidiaries of European banks, pushed down bank shares in Europe and then in the United States.The shares of Dexia, a large Belgian bank, fell 14 percent. fell 12.3 percent. Shares in two British banks, and , fell sharply. In the United States, fell 6.3 percent to $27.98, and fell 6 percent to $7.01.American banks are probably in better financial shape than they were on the eve of the 2008 crisis. But the sell-off reflects fears that the troubles brewing among European lenders could spread across the Atlantic.“It is just a measure of the whole negative sentiment in the markets,” said Mr. Green of TD Securities.Asian Pacific stock markets, which missed the worst of the selling on Thursday, fell sharply in early trading on Friday. The Nikkei 225 in was 2.15 percent lower midday. Stocks in sagged 4.3 percent, and the major index in was down 2.64 percent.Gold rose to a non-inflation adjusted record of more than $1,837 an ounce. Futures on the S.& P. 500 index were o.4 percent lower in Asia.The United States stock market began to gyrate wildly this month after Standard & Poor’s decision late on Aug. 5 to downgrade America’s long-term credit rating. There were alternating gains and losses of more than 4 percent on four subsequent trading days — which had never before happened in the history of the S.& P. index, which dates to 1928.Stocks were buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it would keep short-term interest rates close to zero for the next two years. This week, corporate profits spurred some optimism. So did a $12.5 billion deal by .On Thursday, the sell-off was broad, with all 10 sectors of the S.& P. 500 finishing lower; most rattled were industrial and material companies. So far this month, financial stocks are the worst performers.Extreme volatility is likely to continue, market analysts say, as long as there is uncertainty about how the chronic debt crisis in the euro zone will be resolved and about whether the global economy is slipping. Policy makers in Europe and the United States have yet to demonstrate the kind of forceful leadership that would instill confidence, they assert.The VIX, a measure of stock market volatility, which eased last week, snapped back by about one-third on Thursday, to a reading of 42.67, suggesting that investors had grown more fearful.So far, at least, credit markets in the United States have shown few signs of stress, bolstered by the cheap financing supported by the Federal Reserve.But the European credit markets are signaling some increased levels of strain, though still far from that experienced nearly three years ago.For example, interbank lending rates in Europe — a measure of banks’ willingness or reluctance to lend to each other — have risen. Swap rates in the foreign exchange market, which allows banks to swap euros for dollars, have doubled from a few months ago. They remain less than half the levels reached during the financial crisis.'"

"'11-08-20,'0','Many residents, fearing a bloody fight, are trying to flee. Rebels said that among them was Abdel Salam Jalloud, a leading figure in the 1969 revolution that brought Colonel Qaddafi to power. If confirmed, his would be the second high-profile defection in five days.Residents and officials of the Qaddafi government said the assault on Tripoli reached a new peak this week as bombs rained down on Colonel Qaddafi’s compound and the palatial home of his intelligence chief and brother-in-law, Abdullah Senussi.Colonel Qaddafi has not made a televised appearance in three months, though on Monday he released a low-quality audio recording exhorting Libyans to fight, saying, “The blood of the martyrs is fuel for the battlefield.”Yet some American officials cautioned on Friday that the intelligence about what was happening in Tripoli remained murky. “Clearly, the regime is feeling the pressure, and the opposition is gaining ground each day,” said one American official familiar with the intelligence about . But, he said, “How or when that translates into a tipping point or what the endgame might look like is hard to determine.“At this stage,” he added, “Qaddafi might not know what he’s going to do from one day to the next.”This is by no means the first time the rebels have seemed to have Colonel Qaddafi on the ropes. At the beginning of the uprising, Tripoli and most other cities in the country rose up against Colonel Qaddafi, before his militias reasserted control in the west and NATO stepped in to defend the rebel east.There was fierce fighting on Friday in Zawiyah and in Zlitan, a coastal city east of Tripoli, an indication that at least some elements of the well-equipped Qaddafi forces remained determined to carry on the fight. Driven out by a NATO attack overnight, the loyalists returned to Zawiyah with renewed force, lobbing mortar rounds and rockets and retaking buildings around central Martyrs Square.By the end of the day, however, rebel fighters were pouring in from other cities to counter the Qaddafi forces, and a reporter for in Zlitan said the rebels had prevailed there. And early on Saturday the rebels claimed to have finally captured the eastern oil city of Brega, which has repeatedly changed hands during the conflict, The Associated Press reported.As the fighting draws closer to Tripoli, residents are feeling the pressure. For the first time, they say, they cannot easily leave the city. Hundreds have clogged narrow back roads as they try to flee to the relative safety of the rebel-held mountains to the south.That the mountains would beckon as a refuge is a measure of their fear, since conditions there are often hardly comfortable. Electricity and many supplies are still scarce, and some towns were deserted when Qaddafi forces shelled them earlier.Officials of the Qaddafi government continued to insist that he would fight to the end. A senior Foreign Ministry official, in a conversation in which he was granted anonymity to speak about internal deliberations, said weeks ago that Qaddafi supporters would not give up even if they ran out of trucks and fuel. “We will ride camels,” he said.While Qaddafi loyalists insisted that the capital remained stable, some acknowledged feeling “bitter.”Fouad Zlitni, Colonel Qaddafi’s personal translator and a Libyan diplomat, argued in a telephone interview from Tripoli that the rebels did not deserve for their gains in Zawiyah because it was NATO bombs that made their advance possible. “They should say NATO took them to Zawiyah,” he said. “Somebody is boxing and then you raise your hand and I say, ‘I won a round.’ But it is not you.”Musa Ibrahim, the government spokesman and a member of Colonel Qaddafi’s tribe, continued to insist through the state-run news media that the government would weather the current “crisis.” But news reports also said that his younger brother, Hasan Ali Ibrahim, 25, was killed by gunfire from a NATO helicopter on a visit to Zawiyah.Zawiyah has been a pivotal marker for Colonel Qaddafi since the revolt began in late February, when it rose up along with most other cities across the country in the aftermath of the revolutions in and . When the city first raised the rebel flag in February, Colonel Qaddafi delivered a now-famous telephone address over state media, saying that had drugged Libya’s youths into rebellion, putting hallucinogens into their instant coffee. It took his militia weeks to retake the city by force.Rebels now control the eastern portion of Libya along the Egyptian border, the commercial center in Misurata along the central coast, the western mountains along the Tunisian border, and with Zawiyah a beachhead along the western coast.But Colonel Qaddafi retains his bastions of support, most notably the home cities of his tribe, the Qaddafa. One is the coastal city of Surt, which has blocked the rebels from advancing toward Tripoli from the east. The other is the southern city of Sabha, which rebels believe has enabled Colonel Qaddafi to keep supply lines open to other African countries.Many African governments are grateful for Colonel Qaddafi’s financial support over the years, and if he did choose to leave Libya the other countries of the continent are the most likely places to offer him refuge. But there is still no firm evidence that he has any such plans. In a recent interview, his son vowed that he and his family would never go anywhere.'"

Goldfarb, to three years in prison for his role in an insider trading scheme that involved a hedge fund trader and two corporate lawyers. Mr. Goldfarb, who worked at Brecher Fishman Pasternack Walsh Tilker & Ziegler, pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme with Zvi Goffer, a former trader at the Galleon Group, the hedge fund run by Raj Rajaratnam. He admitted to receiving tips about impending corporate mergers from Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, two low-level associates at the law firm Ropes & Gray, and then passing them to Mr. Goffer. During an April court appearance, Mr. Goldfarb, who earned college and law degrees from Villanova, said that Mr. Goffer, a friend, approached him shortly after his law school graduation and asked if he knew any corporate lawyers. Mr. Goldfarb said he eventually introduced Mr. Goffer to Mr. Cutillo, his college roommate. Both Mr. Cutillo and Mr. Santarlas have pleaded guilty to leaking information about takeovers involving 3Com and Axcan Pharma. Mr. Goffer took his case to trial and was convicted by a jury in June.Correction: August 23, 2011  A report in the Business Briefing column on Saturday about the sentencing of a personal injury lawyer, Jason C. Goldfarb, for his role in an insider trading scheme, misspelled the surname of the head of the Galleon Group, who was also recently convicted of insider trading.

"'11-08-20,'0','The Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian tribes in Oklahoma have filed a federal lawsuit to protect water rights they say derived from long-ago treaties and to prevent exports of water from their traditional homelands without their permission.The dispute had been simmering for more than a year, since the export of water from Sardis Lake in southeastern Oklahoma to Oklahoma City was proposed in June 2010.The lawsuit, filed late Wednesday in United States District Court in Oklahoma City, accuses the State of Oklahoma of one-sided action to deprive the tribes of water rights they have held since the 1830s. It names the governor, the state water agency, Oklahoma City and that city’s water utility as defendants.In an Aug. 18 letter to Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, the leaders of the two tribes said they were forced to act by both the drought, which has resulted in cutbacks in water use even in normally water-rich areas, and by Oklahoma City’s declared intention to pursue the export of water from Sardis, which is nearly 180 miles away.The lawsuit says that Governor Fallin and the Oklahoma Water Resources Board erroneously based their claims to the distant water on state law, but that federal law governs cases of Indian water rights. It asks the federal court to prevent exports until water rights are analyzed and allocated.Although firm water rights have been sought by tribes throughout the West, the Oklahoma situation is unusual, in part because of its geography.'"
"'11-08-20,'0','The outcome of the federal inquiries poses a significant risk to the makers of antimicrobial and antibacterial hand soaps, which represent about half of the $750 million market for liquid hand soaps in the United States, according to the market research firm Kline & Company.Many of those soaps use triclosan as the active ingredient and say so on the label. Dial Complete is the fifth-best-selling liquid hand soap in the nation, according to data collected from most major stores (except for Wal-Mart) by SymphonyIRI Group, a Chicago-based market research firm.Richard Theiler, senior vice president for research and development at Henkel, the German-based manufacturer of Dial Complete, said there was no real evidence showing that triclosan was dangerous for humans. He also said that several recent studies had proved the effectiveness of triclosan in killing germs, and that those studies had been submitted to the federal regulators.“It has been used now in products safely for decades,” Mr. Theiler said.But as consumer groups have campaigned against triclosan, some consumer product manufacturers have removed it and substituted less controversial ingredients. Reckitt Benckiser removed triclosan from three face washes, for instance. And citing “changing consumer preferences,” Colgate-Palmolive replaced triclosan with lactic acid in Palmolive Antibacterial Dish Liquid, and its Softsoap liquid hand soap has been reformulated without the chemical.Colgate, however, continues to use triclosan in its Colgate Total toothpaste because it has been proved to fight gingivitis, a claim approved by the F.D.A.“The safety and efficacy of Colgate Total toothpaste is fully supported by over 70 clinical studies in over 10,000 patients,” the company said in a statement.Scientists have raised concerns about triclosan for decades. Last year, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat from Massachusetts, pressured the F.D.A. to write regulations for antiseptic products like hand soap, including the use of triclosan. The process of creating regulations was started more than three decades ago, but has been repeatedly delayed. In the meantime, Mr. Markey has called for a ban on triclosan in hand soaps, in products that come in contact with food and in products marketed to children.The concern is based on recent studies about the possible health impacts of triclosan, which the F.D.A. said, in a Feb. 23, 2010, letter to Mr. Markey, “raise valid concerns about the effect of repetitive daily human exposure to these antiseptic ingredients.”Several have shown that triclosan disrupts the thyroid hormone in frogs and rats, while others have shown that triclosan alters the sex hormones of laboratory animals. Others studies have shown that triclosan can cause some bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.Brian Sansoni, spokesman for the American Cleaning Institute, said the evidence against triclosan was hardly convincing and that the chemical had been used safely in consumer products and in hospitals for decades. He said there was no evidence that triclosan caused antibiotic resistance.“You would think after heavy use in hospital settings over several decades it would have shown up by now,” Mr. Sansoni said. “This is one of those big urban myths that opponents of these products try to spread.”Concerning studies that showed triclosan to be an endocrine disrupter, he said that the animals used in the studies were subjected to “levels that the rat, let alone us, would never come in contact with in everyday use.”According to a lawsuit filed last year by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the F.D.A. first proposed regulating over-the-counter topical antiseptic drug products like triclosan in 1972, but the review has never been completed. In 1978, the F.D.A. proposed eliminating triclosan as an active ingredient in hospital scrubs and in hand soaps within a couple of years.The agency issued a similar order in 1994, but again, nothing final was authorized, the lawsuit says.The environmental group’s lawsuit sought to pressure the F.D.A. to complete its regulations of antiseptic soaps.Triclosan is often the active ingredient in soaps that are marketed as antibacterial or antimicrobial, even though, in 2005, an F.D.A. advisory panel said triclosan-laced soap was no better at preventing illness than other soap and water.“A lot of people mistakenly believe that if they buy something with a chemical in it that is antibacterial that it’s a plus,” said Dr. Sarah Janssen, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “I think the marketing of these far outweighs the statements on F.D.A.’s Web site, which most people don’t even go to.”Dr. Douglas Throckmorton, the F.D.A.’s deputy director for regulatory programs, said its review was primarily focused on hand soaps but could extend to other consumer products if the agency determined that triclosan raised health concerns. He said that the F.D.A. had determined that triclosan provided a benefit in Colgate Total, by fighting gingivitis, where triclosan in soap did not.“That is an important difference to us,” he said.Indeed, several lawsuits have been filed saying that Henkel is making false claims in its marketing of Dial Complete. But Mr. Theiler, at Henkel, said he was confident that recent studies would vindicate triclosan.“We note that the F.D.A. stated in their announcement on April 8, 2010, that the agency ‘does not have sufficient safety evidence to recommend changing consumer use of products that contain triclosan at this time,’ ” he said. “We concur with this position.”'"

France imposed a 35-hour workweek, with a 25 percent bonus for overtime. In addition, French workers today get 30 days of paid vacation.While the French policy was intensely criticized, both within and outside France, it was immensely popular with workers, who reported enjoying the extra time for leisure and to be with their families. And it reportedly helped create some 350,000 new jobs.It was later eased when the French economy got healthy and the focus changed to worker productivity and international competitiveness.I believe that capping the American workweek would be a solid move to create many jobs quickly. Reasonable exceptions could be made for vital workers like police and fire personnel.Two years ago our executive communications company had 17 employees. Today it has seven. We very much would prefer to have 17 employees. The primary reason we do not is that, like many small businesses, we are dependent on big businesses as customers.And the big businesses that we would ordinarily depend on to become clients are sitting on their cash, because they are deathly afraid of an Obama administration that has been hostile to business (for example, the National Labor Relations Board’s ordering Boeing to change its plans for a new South Carolina plant).'"
"'11-08-20,'0','YANGON, Myanmar (AP) — The democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi met with Myanmar’s president on Friday, state-run television reported, her highest contact with the new, nominally civilian government since her release from house arrest in November.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and President Thein Sein held “frank and friendly discussions” to “find ways and means of cooperation,” the state-run broadcast reported, showing video of them greeting each other.The meeting lasted nearly an hour and was “significant,” a government official said.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has repeatedly called for political dialogue with the government since her release from seven years of house arrest. If her party reaches an accommodation with the government, it could encourage Western nations to lift political and economic embargoes on Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.Nyan Win, the spokesman for her party, the National League for Democracy, said the meeting “could be the first step toward national reconciliation,” but declined to elaborate until details were available.In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, said the United States welcomed news of the meeting.“These are positive steps, and we continue to call for the Burmese government to follow its rhetoric with concrete action towards national reconciliation and progress on core issues of concern to the international community, including the release of political prisoners,” he said.It remains unclear if the government is committed to a dialogue with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and whether it would be willing to discuss the kinds of reforms that would restore its legitimacy with the international community.'"
"'11-08-20,'0','Give me back my Carla Gugino. That’s what I couldn’t help thinking every time Jessica Alba — lovely to look at, utterly ordinary to watch — appeared on screen in “Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D.” The fall-off in sexiness, soulfulness and wittiness from Ms. Gugino and Antonio Banderas, the parents in the first three “Spy Kids” films, to Ms. Alba and Joel McHale is whiplash steep.And that’s just one of the ways this fourth “Spy Kids” installment, written and directed, as always, by Robert Rodriguez, comes up short. Visually dreary (don’t bother paying the 3-D premium), lazily yet confusingly plotted, dominated by jokes involving vomit and an endlessly flatulent baby, “All the Time in the World” feels more like straight-to-DVD filler than a chapter in one of the last decade’s most entertaining and sophisticated family-film franchises.Ms. Alba — so luscious in her superspy cat suit that some of the family scenes start to get a little uncomfortable — plays Marissa, an aunt of the original spy kids, Carmen and Juni Cortez, who are now adults. Looking forward to her retirement from the spy game (she’s hugely pregnant when the film begins), Marissa joins forces with them to stop an evil mastermind from speeding up or stopping time (it isn’t clear which). The next generation of young agents — Marissa’s squabbling stepchildren and eventually her new baby — alternately help and hinder.Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara return, now in supporting roles, as Carmen and Juni, representing practically the only on-screen connection to the earlier films. (Danny Trejo has an amusing cameo moment as their Uncle Machete, but key players like Alan Cumming, Tony Shalhoub and Steve Buscemi are gone.) Mr. Vega and Mr. Sabara look stiff and stranded in their underwritten adult parts; the new kids, Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook, exhibit charm and spunk but don’t have much more to work with.Jeremy Piven, in several roles, tries hard to generate some comic sparks. Most of the (mildly) funny lines go to Ricky Gervais as the voice of a talking cyberdog.Mr. McHale plays the goofball husband who doesn’t know that his wife is a spy; he’s the host of a reality television show called “Spy Hunter,” the joke being that, as with “Ghost Hunters,” there’s nothing to hunt — until it turns out that there is. He’s naturally funny but disappears for long stretches.'"
"'11-08-20,'0','A person close to the investigation said it was likely that the Operation Weeting leaks at issue in Thursday’s arrest were recent ones, perhaps having to do with the disclosure of the names of people arrested so far on suspicion of phone hacking. The police typically do not name suspects until they have been formally charged, identifying them instead by gender and age.The arrest of the suspected leaker seems designed to send a signal that the leader of the investigation, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers, is angry about the disclosures and is determined to keep details of the investigation out of the public domain.“I made it very clear when I took on this investigation the need for operational and information security,” Commissioner Akers said in a statement. “It is hugely disappointing that this may not have been adhered to.”She added that the police department “takes the unauthorized disclosure of information extremely seriously and has acted swiftly in making this arrest.”A former Scotland Yard official with knowledge of the inquiry said it was both surprising and unusual that the first arrest of an officer was for reportedly leaking information to the news media about the phone hacking investigation rather than selling information to The News of the World. A separate Metropolitan Police inquiry is investigating e-mails that suggest police officers sold classified contact information about public figures, including members of the royal family, to reporters and editors at The News of the World.The police also said that a second man was arrested on Friday as part of Operation Weeting, bringing to 14 the number of people arrested so far on suspicion of phone hacking or illegally accessing voice mail messages. With the recent addition of 20 new officers, there are now 65 investigators working full time on the case.The man, 35, was named by Sky News as Dan Evans, a former reporter for The News of the World. The newspaper suspended Mr. Evans in the spring of 2010 after his name emerged as part of a civil suit brought against it by the interior designer Kelly Hoppen. Ms. Hoppen, the stepmother of the actress Sienna Miller, claimed that her phone had been hacked into.Ms. Hoppen’s case began with information seized by the police in 2006, when the first phone hacking case — involving Clive Goodman, the former royal reporter for The News of the World, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator hired by the paper — came to light. At the time, the police seized 12,000 pages of documentation from Mr. Mulcaire that included lists of cellphone numbers, PINs and names of people whose messages he might have illegally intercepted.Both Mr. Mulcaire and Mr. Goodman were convicted in 2007; each served several months in jail.But this arrest seems to stem from a more recent episode. If that is the case, it would contradict assertions at the time by the paper’s parent company, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, that after the arrests The News of the World cracked down, putting a stop to phone hacking.Until last winter, the company said that the hacking had been limited to one “rogue” reporter — Mr. Goodman.According to Sky, the detective arrested on Thursday is suspected of leaking information to the newspaper The Guardian, which has consistently revealed more details than its competitors about the hacking arrests.On its Web site, The Guardian said it would not comment on the allegations, merely saying, “We note the arrest.”The paper quoted a spokesperson as saying: “On the broader point raised by the arrest, journalists would no doubt be concerned if conversations between off-the-record sources and reporters came routinely to be regarded as criminal activity. In common with all news organizations we have no comment to make on the sources of our journalism.”News International, the British newspaper arm of the News Corporation, said it was cooperating with the investigation and would have no comment about the arrests.'"
"'11-08-20,'0','Some argue that favorable treatment for carried interest also confers a social benefit. It aligns a manager’s financial interest with that of investors, most of whom are pension funds, endowments and other nonprofit institutions like hospitals, museums and universities.Hedge funds and private equity managers don’t even make up the bulk of people who are compensated through carried interest. The fiercest lobbying against raising the tax on carried interest has come not from Wall Street but from the battered real estate industry, which often uses carried interest as compensation. “Why take down the entire real estate industry with the ship when the objective was to tax a different industry?” James V. Camp, chairman of legislative affairs in California for a real estate trade group, told me this week. “The real estate industry will be decimated if the carried interest taxation concept becomes law.”This is largely why legislative efforts to eliminate the carried interest exemption have gone nowhere, not because of any special fondness in Congress for hedge fund managers. Unless Congress is willing to say baldly that hedge fund and private equity managers are a special class who deserve to pay higher taxes — a potentially dangerous effort to use the tax code to punish a group of people who are in disfavor largely because they make a lot of money — policy makers are going to have to confront a much broader and potentially far more explosive question: why are all capital gains, not just carried interest, treated more favorably than ordinary income?The notion that low capital gains tax rates are a good thing because they promote investment, lead to job creation, encourage people to sell assets without fear of tax consequences and actually raise total tax revenue is so entrenched in both parties that the idea of equalizing capital gains and ordinary income rates is barely mentioned or, when it is, is quickly denounced. It’s become a third rail of tax policy and electoral politics. “It’s now so woven into standard thinking that it’s become a cultural norm,” a prominent hedge fund official told me this week.Proponents of lower — even zero — capital gains rates have some academic research and statistics to support their claims. Still, there’s no doubt that the root of the problem highlighted by Mr. Buffett is the disparity between tax rates on capital gains and ordinary income. Were these rates the same, the debate over how to treat carried interest would vanish, along with much of the disparity between tax rates for the rich and people like Mr. Buffett’s secretary.Is that so unthinkable? It does seem intuitive that lower taxes and thus potentially greater rewards would encourage risk-taking and investment, and surely at some rate high taxes can discourage any endeavor. But even some hedge fund and private equity officials concede that the argument for lower capital gains rates rests more on faith than science. “I’ve seen study after study that says lower capital gains rates have no impact on behavior,” the hedge fund official told me.That view is also backed by a growing amount of academic research questioning the premise that lower capital gains rates promote growth. The evidence “is murky, at best,” said Leonard E. Burman, the Daniel Patrick Moynihan professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University. Mr. Burman is also a former deputy assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy in the Clinton administration and author of “The Labyrinth of Capital Gains Tax Policy.”“It’s not the panacea for economic growth that advocates make it out to be,” he said. Mr. Buffett himself lent empirical support to this view in his column. “I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone — not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 — shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off,” he said.Whatever benefits lower capital gains rates might generate, they indisputably complicate the tax code and have spawned a multibillion-dollar industry in tax avoidance. “Every imaginable individual income tax shelter is driven by the differential,” Mr. Burman noted. He added that the tax code was needlessly complex. “Have you looked at the alternate rate schedule on the back of Schedule D? It’s so complicated. It’s insane. That alone is a really good argument for change.”But the biggest reason for equalizing capital gains rates may be that it would generate a vast amount of additional revenue for the Treasury. The Internal Revenue Service reports that for taxpayers with the top 400 adjusted gross incomes, capital gains in 2008 amounted to an eye-popping average of $154 million for each of those taxpayers, or 57 percent of their adjusted gross income, and this in a year when the stock market plunged. In 2007, it was $229 million each, or 66 percent. Much of the windfall from higher capital gains rates could be offset by cutting the rate on ordinary income. For antitax zealots who vow they won’t accept one more penny of federal tax, all of it could be offset by lower rates on ordinary income. And for advocates of reducing the government deficit at least in part through higher taxes, tax reform is an appealing approach.Though controversial, this isn’t a new idea. The most prominently successful advocate of a drastically simplified tax code that treated ordinary income and capital gains the same was Ronald Reagan, who made it a centerpiece of his successful 1986 tax reform proposal. (The lower rate reappeared as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, championed by Newt Gingrich, the former Republican speaker of the House, and signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.)In the end, the most compelling argument for equalizing tax rates on capital gains and ordinary income may not be economic efficiency, growth incentives, higher tax revenue or reducing the deficit. It’s simple fairness. It’s hard to quantify or put a dollar value on a just society. “I’ve earned both, and in my experience earning income from capital gains is a lot easier than earning ordinary income,” Mr. Burman said. “Why not tax both at the same rate? It only seems fair.”'"

But that route has now been effectively blocked by increasingly emboldened rebel forces.It is unclear whether Colonel Qaddafi, whose four-decade hold on power in Libya looks increasingly tenuous, will authorize a foreign-supervised departure of the remaining foreign nationals in Tripoli. There are still many thousands there, a large number of them Egyptians.“We don’t know how many migrants are left in Tripoli and how many in total want to leave,” said Jemini Pandya, a spokeswoman for the International Organization for Migration, said in a telephone interview. “But we can say we’re seeing an increase in the number of requests.”Ms. Pandya said that she had no firsthand information about the deprivations in Tripoli but “there seems to be an increasing concern among the migrants themselves about the developments.”The organization, which receives funding from the , , and other countries, has helped at least 30,000 migrants leave Libya during the course of the conflict, including at least 8,300 by boat from Misurata, the site of some of the most intense fighting between Qaddafi loyalists and rebel fighters.Ms. Pandya said it was unclear at this point how her organization would transport migrants out of the country but that “we’re looking at all possible options.

"'11-08-20,'0','SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said Friday that it had agreed to talks with the United States on searching for and returning the remains of American soldiers killed during the Korean War in the early 1950s.About 8,000 American service members remain unaccounted for from the war, and about 5,500 of them are believed to be buried in North Korea. The United States has no diplomatic ties with North Korea, with the two nations technically still at war after they suspended three years of fighting with a truce rather than a formal peace treaty.This month, the Pentagon said it had proposed a meeting with the government in Pyongyang to restart the search for American remains after a six-year hiatus.“In light of humanitarianism, we have positively accepted the proposal,” the North’s official Korean Central News Agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman in Pyongyang as saying. He added that work was already under way by the militaries of the two countries to arrange formal talks.Between 1996 and 2005, American experts and North Korean workers uncovered more than 220 sets of remains from battle sites in North Korea.

Biden Jr. and Chinese leaders labored on Friday to cast the American economy’s weakness as a passing phase.The day’s exchanges, first with Vice President Xi Jinping and then with Premier Wen Jiabao, only underscored the extent to which the world’s two biggest economies are inextricably linked, and the concern each side has that disruptions on one side of the Pacific might spill over to the other.In Friday’s discussions, however, the previously outspoken Chinese publicly muted their concerns, while Mr. Biden proffered repeated assurances that the United States would overcome its fiscal and economic troubles. Yet, Mr. Xi, the presumed successor to President Hu Jintao, obliquely referred to the shifting balance of fiscal power between the nations.No longer, he said, is America the sole source of money and technology, and China the source of factory labor. “More and more, Chinese businesses are going to the United States to make investments and start businesses,” he said, “contributing their part to the growth of the U.S. economy and the creation of jobs.”Mr. Biden enthusiastically endorsed more Chinese investment in the American economy, telling Mr. Xi, “It means jobs, it means American jobs.”The White House was expected to reveal later that Chinese firms had committed to $965 million in purchases of American exports and investments in American businesses, said one Obama administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deals had not been officially announced.'"

Some analysts attributed the slide to technical factors and thin volume.At the close, the S.& P. 500 was down 17.12 points, or 1.5 percent, at 1,123.53.

The steepest declines were on Thursday, when the indexes slipped more than 3 percent on persistent worries about the economy and Europe’s debt problems.Stocks of companies most susceptible to slow growth and those related to have been hit. Technology, financials and industrials were among the sectors down more than 1 percent on Friday.“You are still seeing a lot of the economically sensitive names leading us on the way down,” said Seth Setrakian, co-head of United States equities at First New York.Some of the downturn on Wall Street was attributed to technical reasons. Friday, for example, was a day when options contracts expire, an event that can fuel volatility or market moves.Analysts were also quick to point out that on a day before a summer weekend, low volumes could unfold into a “bleed” toward the end of the trading session — and indeed, what had been a relatively placid session in New York turned downward in the final hours.“Just as importantly, any important policy makers that can come up with anything constructive are on vacation,” said Mr. Setrakian. “So what good news can come over the weekend?”“So everyone is playing much lighter and much tighter,” he said. “It is very simply the data that has been coming out economically has not been constructive.”Gold continued the sharp ascent it has seen over the last months, demonstrating that nervousness remained intense. Gold futures were up $30, to $1,848.90 an ounce.Europe’s major stock indexes ended the day lower. The FTSE 100 in fell 1 percent and the Euro Stoxx 50, a  barometer of European blue-chip stocks, pulled back 2.15 percent.Asian markets were also lower.

There is not a lot of robust trading going on right now.”Mr. Rusnak and other analysts again noted that concerns had mounted about the banking sector, especially with respect to the exposure of American banks to their European counterparts.One drag on the American markets, and specifically the tech sector, on Friday was Hewlett-Packard, which is considering plans to spin off the company’s personal computer business into a separate company and is spending $10 billion on Autonomy, a business software maker. Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell 20 percent, or $5.91, to $23.60.The benchmark 10-year note was unchanged, and the yield remained at 2.07 percent. It had touched record lows below 2 percent in intraday trading on Thursday.“The growth outlook being hurt in Europe, and the ongoing sluggish data we have seen in the United States is the underlying issue the stock market is trying to grapple with,” said Robert S. Tipp, a managing director and chief strategist for Prudential Fixed Income.He said the crisis of confidence was evident as investors parked money in cash and short-term fixed-income assets.One thing to worry about next week will be whether the can continue to hold down yields on Italian and Spanish bonds. If not, Italian and Spanish borrowing costs might reach the point where they became too expensive, raising the risk of default.On Friday, Italian bonds and Spanish bonds dipped to 4.96 percent.'"

"'11-08-21,'0','In The Post, Richard Viets, a Foreign Service officer who was in India at the same time as Mr. George and who went on to become an ambassador, said Mr. George had the perfect personality for the agency. “He exudes trust and friendliness,” he said, “but in fact is duplicitous as hell.”Mr. George’s loyalty to the C.I.A., however, was unshakable — and ultimately wrecked his career. He was convicted in 1992 of lying to Congressional committees and a grand jury to keep from disclosing what he knew about the agency’s participation in the Reagan administration’s illegal scheme to sell arms to Iran and divert profits from the sales to help the contra rebels in Nicaragua.Mr. George was the highest-ranking C.I.A. officer prosecuted by the independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh in what came to be known as the Iran-contra affair. After a mistrial caused by a hung jury, Mr. George was convicted of two charges of false statements and perjury before Congress. He faced a maximum penalty of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines on each count.Mr. George said that his conscience was clear and that he felt like “a pawn in a continuous drama of political exploitation.” Earlier, he had explained that he had been “almost megalomaniacal” in striving to use his testimony to Congress to “protect the agency.”Mr. Walsh wrote that the verdict refuted the view that the illegal operation had been confined to the White House and showed that it in fact extended to various agencies, like the Defense and State Departments, as well as the C.I.A. He said that if Mr. George had told the truth to Congress, the wrongdoing could have been stopped years sooner. Suspicions had been raised in October 1986, when an American cargo plane ferrying arms to Nicaraguan rebels was shot down.“George chose to evade, mislead and lie,” Mr. Walsh said.Mr. George had been indicted in September 1991, partly on the strength of the testimony of an aide who told prosecutors that Mr. George had told him to withhold information from Congress.However, his devotion to the C.I.A. was appreciated by agency employees and retirees, who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for his defense and came to his trial to show support. Some volunteered to pore through mountains of classified material assembled for the trial in search of useful evidence. Some suggested that President Ronald Reagan should have been the one on trial, saying that in professing ignorance of Iran-contra, the president was either lying or admitting that he had been asleep at the switch. But investigations by Mr. Walsh, Congress and an independent commission could not pin responsibility on the president.Clair Elroy George was born in Pittsburgh on Aug. 3, 1930. His family moved several times, ending up in Beaver Falls, Pa., when he was 9. His father was a dairy chemist who worked for the federal Department of Agriculture. As a youth, Mr. George was a drummer in local dance bands and president of the high school student council and worked in a steel mill.He majored in political science and debated at Pennsylvania State University, graduating in 1952. He enrolled in Columbia Law School, but joined the Army instead. He learned Chinese and worked in counterintelligence in the Army in Japan. He joined the C.I.A. after being impressed by agency officers he met in the Far East.After numerous assignments, in Washington and abroad, he returned to Washington for good in 1979. He placed first out of 100 candidates in a promotions ranking and was put in charge of the agency’s African division. William J. Casey, whom Reagan had named director of central intelligence, appointed Mr. George to successively higher positions. He served as deputy director from 1984 until his retirement in 1987. He then worked as a consultant.Mr. George’s wife, the former Mary Atkinson, died in 2008. In addition to his sister, he is survived by his daughters, Leslie George and Ann Davies, and three grandchildren.During Mr. George’s trial, the defense repeatedly tried to inform the jury of his espionage achievements, which prosecutors tried to quash because they might impress jurors. Finally, Judge Royce C. Lamberth told prosecutors they could admit “something equivalent to war-hero status” and leave it at that.'"
"'11-08-21,'0','“The family back home often thinks the migrant is earning a lot and raises its expectations,” said Grace Princesa, the Philippine ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, who has made debt reduction a part of a government campaign to improve conditions for migrants. “The poor migrant goes deeper into debt just to answer. It’s a vicious cycle.”Such was the case with Ms. Naces, now 52, a single mother who left her infant son with her parents and went to Saudi Arabia to make money to support him. By the time she arrived in the Emirates in 2007, he had already grown up without her.Though she could not get a credit card in Saudi Arabia, in the Emirates she could scarcely avoid one. Salesmen stalked nurses outside hospitals and worshipers after Mass at a Filipino church.Ms. Naces bought furniture, clothes and meals for herself, but her biggest expenses involved her son, whose affection she feared she had lost. She built him a house in the Philippines and bought five cars with credit cards so he could start a rental business. “I felt guilty for being away and not raising him,” she said. “I was trying to compensate.”They both went to jail — he on drug charges and she for debt.While the government does not disclose how many debtors have been jailed, a legislative body several years ago estimated that 10,000 of them were in the courts or prison. The Dubai police chief has complained that debtors needlessly clog the jails, and employers have warned the Ministry of Labor that debt problems distract employees. About 85 percent of the country’s population — and 99 percent of the private work force — consists of foreign workers, and local officials keep watch for signs of discontent.“The employers were saying, ‘This is a priority to us,’ ” said Qassim Jamil, a senior official in the Labor Ministry.The Central Bank tightened lending rules this year, and the Labor Ministry sponsored a financial literacy program for migrant leaders.“What do we want? Freedom!” Ms. Princesa, the ambassador, chanted at a session for Filipinos. “Freedom from poverty! Freedom from credit card problems! Freedom from bank problems!”If migrants spent heavily, lenders encouraged them. Traditionally, credit card use was low (in part because of Islamic strictures against charging interest), but banks spotted a new market and moved aggressively.With foreign banks like HSBC and Citigroup fighting locals for market share, the number of cards leapt to four million in 2008, a fivefold increase in five years, according to the Lafferty Group, a London research firm. But the country lacks a reliable credit bureau, so lenders could not tell how many cards or how much debt the borrowers carried.“Banks were falling over themselves to lend, and they didn’t have proper credit checks,” said Andrew Neeson, a Lafferty analyst.Courted with gifts and teaser rates, few borrowers understood the costs. The average interest rate in the Emirates last year, at 36 percent, was more than twice the global average, and banks routinely add another 10 percent for disability and death insurance. With penalties, some workers borrowed at rates of 50 percent or more.Anyone can be tempted by easy credit, but migrants raised in poverty can find the glittering malls here especially intoxicating.“The first time I used my card, I felt amazed,” Ms. Naces said. “It’s a feeling of excitement, power — greatness even.”Rex Arcenio, a Filipino optometrist, accepted a gold card because it came with a Montblanc pen and a limousine ride to the airport for his annual leave.“It was like a status symbol,” he said.He ran up $50,000 in debt — for his children’s education, his brother’s cancer treatment and a house in Manila — and was briefly jailed.Technically, debtors go to jail for bouncing the blank “security checks” they must sign when accepting a card. If borrowers fail to pay, banks can deposit the checks for the sum owed, and bouncing a check is a crime.Whether foreign or Emirati, borrowers must repay the debt after leaving jail, though banks often accept reduced terms.Skilled workers here are generally treated better than in neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia, which can make their debt travails a shock. Jail conditions in the Emirates are described as comfortable, but the accused often appear in court in leg irons.Aisha Alambatang, 54, who served a month for one card in February, could be jailed again for others. A Filipino nurse with three grown children, Ms. Alambatang spent most of their childhood years abroad, supporting them from Saudi Arabia. When she arrived in the Emirates eight years ago, she got a raise and six credit cards.She built houses for herself and her daughter and helped the children start several failed businesses. Then she paid for two to move to Abu Dhabi to job hunt.Soon she had a monthly salary of $2,200 and debt service of more than $3,000. Her daughter was in court when Ms. Alambatang arrived. “When my daughter saw me with a chain on my foot, I felt like my heart was broken,” she said. Worried about returning to jail, Ms. Alambatang gets palpitations when she sees the police, and she sleeps with her daughter for comfort.“I’m not in jail anymore, but here,” she said, hand over her heart, “I’m more in jail.”'"
"'11-08-21,'0','Edmond Demiraj is trapped. An Albanian gangster, Bill Bedini, wants to kill him and harm his family. The United States wants to deport Mr. Demiraj’s wife and teenage son from Texas to Albania, where they will no doubt be in great danger from Mr. Bedini. Mr. Demiraj keeps pleading with the federal authorities for help, and keeps losing.The trouble started a decade ago, after Mr. Demiraj agreed to be a witness against Mr. Bedini in a human-smuggling case. Mr. Demiraj, then an illegal immigrant, thought he had a deal: testify for the government in return for its protection. But Mr. Bedini fled to Albania.The government decided it had no further use for Mr. Demiraj and deported him to Albania, where Mr. Bedini tracked him down, shot him and left him for dead. Mr. Bedini also kidnapped three of Mr. Demiraj’s nieces to force them into sexual slavery.Mr. Demiraj survived the shooting, and he and his nieces escaped to the United States. The nieces won asylum, and Mr. Demiraj was granted “withholding of removal,” which means he will not be deported. But Mr. Demiraj’s protection does not extend to his wife and son.There have been inconsistent asylum decisions before, but this one is especially awful. It involves the same family, the same persecutor, the same facts agreed upon by all sides. But an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals and two federal appeals court judges in New Orleans say Mr. Demiraj’s wife and son have not shown, as asylum law requires, that they are being persecuted because they belong to a particular social group.In this case, the social group is the Demiraj family, of which wife and son are obviously members. But the judges and the board have ruled that Mr. Bedini is persecuting them not because they belong to that group but because of his particular hatred for Mr. Demiraj.“Mrs. Demiraj is at risk because Bedini seeks to hurt Mr. Demiraj by hurting her — not because he has a generalized desire to hurt the Demiraj family as such,” the court wrote in a 2-to-1 ruling. That distorts both law and logic.'"

"'11-08-21,'0','You’re at a dinner party. Your hostess regales you with a long, meandering tale of her recent back surgery. It ends with attempted humor: she laughs and glances at you. You laugh in response, trying to convey an appreciation for her humor that you don’t actually feel. Congratulations: you are now at the level of social politeness of chimpanzees.In this study, the laughs of 59 chimps (yes, they do laugh) were recorded and the sounds analyzed. The researchers discovered that when one chimp laughed others sometimes engaged in “laugh replications” that lacked the full acoustic structure of spontaneous laughter. In other words, they were fake-laughing.This happened more often in more newly formed colonies, where, perhaps, the individuals were less familiar with one another. With your spouse of 25 years, you can simply stare at him stony-faced when he tells you his favorite “funny” story yet again.“Do sheep (Ovis aries) categorize plant species according to botanical family?” in Animal Cognition (2011).Type “Is the tom...” into Google, and the search engine, presuming that you are beset with the same burning question that has plagued so many, offers to finish your query for you: “Is the tomato a fruit or a vegetable?” Given that we humans are still puzzled by the botanical status of one of our most common vegetables, er, fruits, the performance of the 12 lambs described in this study is humbling.After learning that eating sainfoin, but not fescue, was followed by a stomachache, the lambs knew to pick cocksfoot over alfalfa when given the choice in the future. Have no idea what this means? In non-lamb terms, if a pasture legume caused indigestion (thanks to lithium chloride added by the researchers) but a grass found in pastures did not, the lambs, when facing a later choice between a different legume and a different grass, opted for the grass over the legume. In other words, the lambs demonstrated an ability to form a generalization about the relative digestibility of families of plants. (Lest sheep let these findings go to their heads, note that recent research found that some plants communicate with each other to raise defenses against herbivores.)“Are Birds Smarter Than Mathematicians? Pigeons (Columba livia) Perform Optimally on a Version of the Monty Hall Dilemma,” in the Journal of Comparative Psychology (2010).The old game show “Let’s Make a Deal” inspired a famous probability puzzle. A contestant has three doors to choose from: one hides a spectacular prize; the other two each hide something considered undesirable, like a goat. Once the contestant makes a choice, the host, Monty Hall, reveals a goat behind one of the unchosen doors, and offers the contestant the chance to switch his choice to the third door.On the show, few people switched. But famously, probability shows that it is much better to switch. We humans are reluctant to accept this: in laboratory studies, subjects switch only a third of the time. We perform only slightly better if we get a chance to play the game dozens of times or if the probability is explained to us beforehand.But pigeons that were offered a version of Monty Hall’s choice aced the test. The experiment involved pecking keys and winning “mixed grain,” instead of selecting doors hiding unknown prizes. After training in the game, the pigeons switched 96 percent of the time. The lesson? Take a pigeon with you if you’re going to be on this game show (now back on television).“Rooks Use Stones to Raise the Water Level to Reach a Floating Worm,” in Current Biology (2009).One of Aesop’s fables tells the tale of a crow who quenches his thirst by filling a nearly empty pitcher with stones until the water level rises high enough to drink. Displacement is an insightful solution — could a bird really come up with it? After all, one can easily imagine humans failing to do so (say, reality-show contestants who, faced with an immobile glass and a “no hands” rule, contort themselves futilely).In this study, four rooks (a type of bird) faced an Aesopian task: confronted with a vial partly filled with water and holding a floating worm, could they extract this bounty?Easy. After considering the problem, they collected and dropped into the tube just enough stones to bring the worm within snatching distance. Look for this challenge to be included in the next season of “Fear Factor.”There is no need to be either frightened or overly excited by these findings. The animals won’t be taking over anytime soon, and there is very little chance you can train your parrot to help your child get into the right kindergarten (even animal cognition has its limits). And there is still one notable area of behavior in which animals have shown no sign of matching us: they appear to be not at all interested in running experiments testing our cognition.'"
"'11-08-21,'0','Here in the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts, where hand-painted signs for fresh vegetables dot winding roads and eating local has long been a way of life, some farmers and market managers are uttering something once unfathomable: there are too many farmers’ markets.This summer there are 23 farmers’ markets in the area, which encompasses the Connecticut River Valley, according to the Federation of Massachusetts Farmers Markets.At the Wednesday farmers’ market in Florence, shoppers perused plum peppers, freshly cut sunflowers, jars of homemade pickles and fragrant bunches of basil, rushing them into cars before a midafternoon thunderstorm.Rick Wysk, who spent the morning pulling beets out of the eight acres he tills at River Bend Farm in nearby Hadley, says his business at farmers’ markets is half what it was five years ago.“You have a certain amount of demand, and the more you spread out the demand, you’re making less,” said Mr. Wysk, who has been selling at markets for 13 years. He believes his business is further hurt by additional markets that opened this year in Northampton and Springfield.“We’re Western Mass. We’re not New York City. We’re not Boston,” Mr. Wysk said. “We’ve got people, but not the population in the bigger markets.”More densely populated areas, however, seem to be where the problem is most acute. In Seattle, farmers have spent the last few years jumping from new market to new market. In San Francisco, there are simply “too many farmers’ markets,” said Brigitte Moran, the executive director of the Marin Markets in San Rafael, Calif.“We have this mentality of, oh, we have a Starbucks on every corner,” Ms. Moran said. “So why can’t we have a farmers’ market? The difference is these farmers actually have to grow it and drive it to the market.”Dale Davis, the owner of Stony Hill Gardens and Farm Market in Chester, N.J., cut three New Jersey markets this year because sales were down and the extra travel crimped his profit, and he blames a spate of new suburban markets.“You send out these guys with fuel and they’re picking and loading,” Mr. Davis said in a telephone interview while selling squash and other vegetables at the Hoboken Farmers’ Market, “and you can’t end up on the long end for too long.”Stacy Miller, executive director of the Farmers’ Market Coalition, a nonprofit organization that supports farmers’ markets, said that the growth had been a boon to most communities and that many places still lacked markets that connect residents with fresh, healthful food.But, she acknowledges, some markets are saturated. One reason is that more community groups want to open farmers’ markets without doing “sufficient planning to ensure the demand is keeping up with the supply,” Ms. Miller said.In some places, new or small-scale farmers who cannot get into existing markets create their own and siphon off customers. Other communities do not have enough farmers to keep up with all the new markets that are opening, Ms. Miller said. According to federal agriculture officials, there are approximately 2.2 million farms nationwide; in 2006 there were 2.09 million.To stay profitable, Ms. Miller said, farmers often sign on to a new market to hedge their bets, even if they do not know if the market will survive. Some do not. According to a study by Oregon State University, 62 farmers’ markets opened in Oregon from 1998 to 2005, and 32 failed.Trudy Toliver, executive director of the Portland Farmers Market, in Oregon, said there were signs that the city could be approaching too many markets, but she “hasn’t even heard grumblings” about it from farmers or market managers.In New York, farmers’ markets in some parts of the state have started to “cannibalize each other’s customer base,” said Diane Eggert, the executive director of the Farmers’ Market Federation of New York. The organization has started distributing feasibility surveys to communities that want to open markets so they can figure out if the location has the farmer and customer base necessary to survive, Ms. Eggert said.Jeff Cole, the executive director of Massachusetts Federation of Farmers Markets, said the organization had urged groups not to open new markets near thriving, existing ones, but could not order them not to because of state law. In one instance, a new market opened less than two miles from another, Mr. Cole said. Sales at the first one dropped by more than 30 percent.The explosion in farmers’ markets has also led some to question what exactly constitutes a farmers’ market. Cindy Tobin, who, accompanied by her dog, was selling vegetables and baked goods at the Florence market, said she thought markets where vegetables were for sale alongside stands with antiques or clothing did farmers a disservice.“People come to buy vegetables,” Ms. Tobin said. “They’re not buying earrings. That’s what I’d like farmers markets to be.”'"

"'11-08-21,'0','Union officials said they had originally called the strike because they felt they were not being taken seriously and because Verizon was insisting on so many and such sweeping concessions. Verizon was hardly budging from its original position, the unions said, another point of contention. Verizon is pushing for, among other things, a pension freeze for current workers, fewer sick days, an end to all job security provisions, far larger employee contributions toward health coverage, and freedom to do as much outsourcing as it wants.Larry Cohen, the communications workers’ president, said in an interview Saturday that under an agreement reached Friday, the bargaining was being restructured to focus on major issues, with top Verizon officials indicating that there would be real progress in bargaining. Mr. Cohen said another factor that helped persuade the unions to return to work was that Verizon had agreed to keep the expired contract in force until a settlement is reached.“Everybody knew we faced a long list of management demands and that’s why there was a strike, and we would go back into bargaining when the talks could be meaningful,” Mr. Cohen said. “We don’t consider this a victory in any way. We consider it progress toward a good process at Verizon.”In a statement issued on Saturday, Verizon said the parties had agreed on a process “for moving forward to negotiate the major issues regarding benefits, cost structure, work flexibility and job security.”Marc C. Reed, Verizon’s executive vice president for human resources, said Verizon believed that ending the strike “is in the best interest of our customers and our employees.”“The company hasn’t conceded any of its proposals,” Mr. Reed said in an interview. “At the end of the day we still have health care on the table. We still have proposals on job security and moving work on the table.”Mr. Reed said the unions had ended the strike because of “the pressure of having people not working in this tough economy.” He added, “This is a situation where the purpose of the strike may not have any need.”Mr. Cohen acknowledged that the bargaining ahead might still be lengthy. He said Verizon initially seemed so dismissive of the two unions’ position and so unwilling to budge from its original stance that union negotiators felt the company was seeking in effect to wipe out the unions’ bargaining rights.“The unions have been working with Verizon to restructure bargaining in a way that represents progress for everyone,” he said. “We believe that Verizon management shares the goal of meaningful bargaining.”Jim Spellane, chief spokesman for the electrical workers’ union, said the unions went on strike to get management’s attention and to show that the workers could not be pushed around.“The workers felt very strongly that their whole standard of living was under attack, that everything we’ve worked for for decades was under threat and wasn’t being taken seriously,” Mr. Spellane said. “They felt backed into a corner and so the strike was called.”Verizon officials have repeatedly said they needed major concessions from the landline division employees to keep that business competitive and to increase its lagging profitability. The company said its traditional landline business had declines in profits and in its customer base, even though that division was slowly rebounding thanks to growth of Verizon’s FiOS fiber-optic business.The two unions condemned Verizon’s push for large-scale concessions, saying the demands were inappropriate because the company’s overall profitability had been strong, totaling $22 billion over the last four years.While many C.W.A. members voiced relief that they were returning to work, others posted complaints that their union had knuckled under by ending the walkout without a settlement and with Verizon’s concession demands remaining on the table.Throughout the strike, a big question that union leaders faced was whether Verizon had proposed scores of concessions in the hope of narrowing them down to win just two or three major ones, or whether it was intent on winning dozens of concessions and seriously weakening the two unions.More than any other union leader in the country, Mr. Cohen has sought to promote and preserve bargaining rights, and he often said that Verizon’s truculent approach to negotiations resembled those of state governors who wanted to abolish collective bargaining.'"
"'11-08-21,'0','But the question remains: what exactly makes an elite quarterback?Is it, as Jets Coach Rex Ryan said on Wednesday in support of his quarterback Mark Sanchez, about playoff success more than statistics? If so, does that make Sanchez, who has won four road playoff games in two years, one of the league’s best? Is it more about statistics, which would catapult Philip Rivers to the top tier? Or is it a subjective combination, something Brady, Peyton Manning and Drew Brees — three Super Bowl winners with impressive numbers — all share?The passer rating, created in 1971, was the first attempt to quantify quarterback play. The statistic is based on a complex formula that, inexplicably to a lot of fans, calculates 158.3 as the optimum. This year, ESPN introduced Total Quarterback Rating (Total Q.B.R.), which factors in game situations and the quarterback’s involvement in each play. A rating over 75 is deemed “M.V.P.-worthy,” and 65-75 deserves “Pro Bowl consideration.”Eli Manning ranked 17th in passer rating and 10 spots higher in Total Q.B.R. Brady was first on both lists, but the rest of the lists’ top 10 differed. For example, Rivers ranked second in passer rating but ninth in Total Q.B.R.According to Football Outsiders’ ranking system, Manning was 10th in the N.F.L. in 2009 and ninth in 2008, but fell to 15th last season behind players like Kyle Orton and Matt Cassel despite his throwing a career-high 31 touchdown passes. His ranking, however, was weighed down by a league-leading 25 interceptions.“I think everybody kind of has a different opinion on it,” receiver Domenik Hixon said. “A lot of people they go about passing yards and that could be a bad thing because you could be down in the game and always throwing the ball.”Is any one of the three ranking systems — or any other — correct? That depends on whom you ask. Most of the conversations after Manning’s proclamation began and ended with a discussion of the interceptions last season and then something along the lines of “he must be out of his mind.” But Manning is one of six active quarterbacks with a Super Bowl ring, and he beat Brady’s New England Patriots to win it. Manning will long be remembered for leading the Giants on a game-winning drive that ended with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress.He is also reliable. Since becoming the starter during his rookie season in 2004, he has started every Giants game — 96 straight over the past six seasons.And he was also one of the toughest quarterbacks to sack last season: he was trapped only 16 times, which was tied with his brother for the fewest of a starter. Sack totals are usually attributed to offensive lines, but knowing when to get rid of the football is an attribute successful quarterbacks tend to have.In his typically reserved style, Manning later said he was not aware of the debates his statement provoked until his father, Archie, once a top N.F.L. quarterback in his own right, told him in a phone call.For a quarterback known for his bashfulness and avoiding the spotlight, there were no regrets. If anything, it was the only right answer.On Wednesday when asked if he agreed with Manning’s assessment of his elite status, Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said, “I do, but what would you expect him to say?” He then added, “He is for me.”'"

It can be too expensive to send sales representatives to make the multiple visits necessary to close a relatively modest sale to these customers. But it turns out that radio offers an economical alternative way of reaching the three or four people who might work in the I.T. department of a 300-employee company.One of Barracuda’s commercials, for its Message Archiver, refers to “e-discovery laws and government regulations,” but a 30-second spot has no room for details. The commercial’s narrator says the product is for “certain businesses,” without making clear which ones must worry about e-mail preservation.Presumably, if you haven’t heard anything about such matters, you are professionally absolved from worrying about them.Marc Wolfe, Barracuda’s senior director of marketing, says its radio ads don’t aim at people with a particular title but instead are intended to “ignite a conversation with as many influencers in a single organization as possible.”Barracuda decided to broadcast its spots not only in the largest markets (Tier 1, in radio parlance) and the midsize ones (Tier 2), but also small ones like Redding and Bend (Tier 3) — for a total of thousands of stations in North America. In the smallest markets, some radio stations may be struggling to attract even local advertisers. And the task becomes particularly difficult if a lack of commercials is already giving their programming the appearance of a nonprofit public service. Such stations “need commercials to sound like a radio station,” says Mr. Perone, who says the radio ad networks that distribute Barracuda’s spots can provide the Tier 3 markets at very little additional cost.All that is required to get “nearly 100 percent” of the attention of a prospective customer is making “ a little noise in a quiet place” like a small radio market, Mr. Wolfe says. He has learned that it’s hard to predict, however, who might be reached. He points to this example: “Someone who lives in a Tier 1 city and is traveling through a Tier 3 city hears the spot and says ‘My God, you guys are everywhere.’ ”Citrix is another software vendor that is using radio to sell products to business customers. Its videoconferencing software, GoToMeeting, and other products are featured in commercials on more than 2,000 stations, it says.Michael Guarnieri, radio media manager at Citrix, says he and his colleagues began to advertise on the radio in 2003, when they worked for Expertcity, before it was acquired by Citrix the next year. The original idea was to advertise only on programs that were about information technology, he says, but “we discovered there was a finite number of tech radio shows and the audiences were small.” So, he adds, “we started going into consumer radio.”“We identified radio hosts who were influencers who gave us an endorsement and provided third-party validation,” Mr. Guarnieri says. He supplied an example: a commercial whose script is spoken by Kim Komando, host of a syndicated talk radio show about technology.“I’ve been a fan and a customer of GoToMeeting.com for years,” Ms. Komando enthuses on the commercial. “And now GoToMeeting.com has added high-definition group videoconferencing. I’ve seen it, I’ve used it, it’s amazing.”As with many testimonials delivered by radio show hosts, the listener may understand that it has not been volunteered gratis. But with a product that’s meant for personal use, it’s relatively easy to picture the host using the product regularly — and how we might do so, too. With I.T. products, a much more specialized category, the images aren’t as direct. (A spokeswoman for GoToMeeting says its endorsers must have personal knowledge of the products.)In the ad, Ms. Komando expounds on the virtues of GoToMeeting’s high-definition video, saying that facial expressions “often speak louder than words.” But she says this on the radio. The form of her spoken testimonial undermines the scripted content. Yet GoToMeeting still benefits from the ad because radio as a medium is particularly well-suited for endorsements. On radio, spoken words can create a brief sense of personal connection with each listener, in a way newer media can’t really match.Radio is a congenial home for many advertisers in the hardware business, whether the hardware is lawn mowers or e-mail archivers. All that remains to be added are regular holiday sales for the I.T. products. Maybe the Labor Day weekend will bring a Sale-A-Bration — for load balancers.'"
"'11-08-21,'0','“The rebels are fleeing like rats, to the mountains,” Colonel Qaddafi said.But even as he described a “collapse” among rebel fighters and NATO forces, he railed at world leaders who were supporting the uprising, accusing them of giving rebels “weapons to destroy our air-conditioners!”He gave no indication of where he might be speaking from, a topic of increasing speculation in recent days as rumors have swirled of his preparing to flee, or perhaps having already left Libya.If Colonel Qaddafi’s location remained unknown, it became increasingly clear Saturday that even his most senior aides were making exits of their own.The Tunisian state news agency reported Saturday that Libya’s oil minister, Omran Abukraa, had defected to , after leaving Tripoli on what was ostensibly a business trip abroad. If confirmed, his defection would be the third of a senior government official in the past week.Abdel Salam Jalloud, a former Qaddafi deputy, was reported to have defected Friday. A senior security official, Nassr al-Mabrouk Abdullah, flew to Cairo with his family on Monday.Mustafa Abdel-Jalil, the chairman of the rebel government, the National Transitional Council, said that he hoped Colonel Qaddafi and the rest of his inner circle would follow. “That would be a good thing that will end the bloodshed and help us avoid material costs,” he said. “But I do not expect that he will do that.”After reports of the Tripoli fighting began, some residents said that a group of rebel fighters had infiltrated the city from the east and were spearheading the uprising, surprising the pro-Qaddafi forces who had fortified for an attack from the western approach guarded by Zawiyah. Residents added that in recent weeks rebels had also smuggled weapons into the city by boat to the east of Tripoli to prepare. Their claims could not be independently confirmed.Meanwhile, rebel forces closing in on the capital made important gains on Saturday. By afternoon, the rebels had driven Colonel Qaddafi’s forces out of Zawiyah, the strategic oil refinery town 30 miles west of Tripoli. After a week of heavy fighting there, residents began to celebrate in the main square.The Arab news network reported that Zlitan, a crucial Qaddafi barracks town east of Tripoli, also had fallen to the rebels. They captured Gharyan, the gateway to the south, last week.Farther east, the rebels claimed to have seized the residential areas of the oil port of Brega, a prize that has changed hands many times since the uprising began.“It is clear that the situation is moving against Qaddafi,” Jeffrey D. Feltman, an assistant secretary of state, said after meeting rebel leaders in Benghazi, the rebel capital. “The opposition continues to make substantial gains on the ground while his forces grow weaker.”Rebel leaders were optimistic. “The end is very near” for Colonel Qaddafi, said Mr. Abdel-Jalil, the leader of the rebel’s governing council. “We have contacts with people from the inner circle of Qaddafi,” he said. “All evidence is that the end is very near, with God’s grace.”Amid worries from the West and humanitarian groups that rebel fighters might seek revenge against Qaddafi supporters, the rebels’ National Transitional Council said Saturday that it was reissuing a booklet reminding its mostly novice fighters about the international laws of war.But the battle was hardly over. In the past six months, the rebels have frequently proven unable to hold captured territory, sometimes keeping it no longer than a few days. Government forces were still fighting fiercely outside Zawiyah, and in Brega they controlled the oil refinery.Tripoli, while under new pressure, remains a Qaddafi stronghold, as does Surt, a coastal city to the east, and Sabha to the south. Government officials continued to insist that they would fight to the end.Still, with rebels virtually surrounding the capital and NATO bombing the city from positions in the Mediterranean, residents were feeling increasingly under siege. The main supply routes were closed, making electricity and fuel scarce. Crime is increasing and garbage is piling up in the streets.There were also reports that Qaddafi loyalists were blocking off streets in Tripoli and setting up sniper positions in preparation for battle.In recent days, members of the so-called Tripoli Brigade, a group of rebel fighters tasked with securing the capital after the fall of the government, were seen heading to a base in Zawiyah. On Friday, a brigade commander said the unit of roughly 1,000 fighters had been training in the western city of Nalut and expected to be deployed in the coming days.In Zawiyah, even as Qaddafi forces continued to shell the city from the outskirts, residents began to emerge from their homes and took in the remains of their city, devastated by the battle for the central Martyrs’ Square.Three bodies, identified as Qaddafi soldiers, lay covered in blankets at the edge of a plaza. some residents said, but that was far from certain. The tall grass in the plaza was strewn with green and white government forms that had blown out of rocket holes in a nearby administrative building.That building, as well as a bank and a hotel, had been used by the Qaddafi soldiers as snipers’ nests, the rebels said. The white park benches and paths below were marked with their bullets. On the grounds of the buildings, piles of military gear were left in a sign of a hasty retreat: a green flak jacket, a wooden trunk full of food and a toothbrush.In a store, the Qaddafi soldiers had scrawled a message: “Libya wants Muammar el-Qaddafi.” All over the square, they left green flags.The rebels, backed by NATO warplanes, had taken almost a week to drive the snipers out. The hotel, the Jewel, was singed black from a fire on the upper floors. The top of the administrative building had collapsed under the force of a NATO bomb.In the late afternoon, young men drove into the square and spun their cars around in tight circles, their screeching tires echoing off shattered buildings.A man watching shook his head in stunned disbelief. “I swear to God,” he said, “freedom is beautiful.”'"
"'11-08-21,'0','Bike rules are a surprisingly tangled area of the law. The city’s myriad regulations have confused unsuspecting riders and have occasionally tripped up even the police officers responsible for enforcing them.Cyclists have reported being ticketed for equipment violations like riding without a bell. A bell is required by law — though an unscientific street survey indicated that, for many riders, their voices are their only warning systems. Others have been ticketed for riding without a helmet (not required for adults), and in one widely reported case, for riding with a purse hung over the handlebars. A Police Department spokesman later said the summons should not have been issued. The department did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the helmet violation.Many cyclists are confused about their rights, which is where the new breed of bike lawyers comes in. One common question: are cyclists required to ride in a bike lane if one is available?“There are 101 reasons that a cyclist might be outside of a bike lane,” said Steve Vaccaro, an avid cyclist and a lawyer at Rankin & Taylor. But aside from the obvious ones — to avoid a hazard or obstruction — it’s “highly contextual,” he added.For example, it is legal to leave the bike lane to make a turn, and cyclists are allowed to prepare to make a turn by getting to the appropriate side of the street. But just where one can move out of the lane — 50 yards away, or two blocks, perhaps — is not specified.While it is a good idea to be aware of the rules, he said, a rider would still have to explain the reason in court if ticketed.That is Peter McCormick’s plan. He said he would contest in traffic court next month a ticket for running a red light in Central Park.Bike lawyers were not optimistic about his chances. “In red-light cases, there’s not a lot you can do to get a cyclist off,” Roger Goldfinger, a lawyer at Rankin & Taylor, said. But he noted that cyclists should not pay the hefty surcharge, included in the total fine, that applies only to motor vehicles.A spokesman for the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed that the fine indicated on a red-light ticket includes $80 in surcharges and fees that do not apply to bikes. Cyclists should pay only $190.While the mundane details of traffic rules can create the most confusion, most cyclists do not need a lawyer to fight a ticket, but might need one if they are hurt by a vehicle“For those people who think it can’t happen to them — I have a file of a person it happened to,” said Scott Charnas, a personal-injury lawyer who has represented many New York cyclists. He formed a relationship a decade ago with Bob Mionske, a West Coast bike lawyer and Bicycling Magazine columnist, who recommends Mr. Charnas to New York riders.Mr. Charnas’s current clients include a delivery cyclist severely injured by a passing car. “In that case, the rider turned away to avoid the opening door and was then hit by a car,” he said. The deliveryman had a broken leg and other injuries, Mr. Charnas said, and will never be able to ride a bike again.The accident highlights what can happen in the so-called dooring zone, the area next to a vehicle where its door could hit a passing cyclist. The lawyers at Rankin & Taylor also represent bike riders in personal-injury cases. But suing the city to make it more cycling-friendly, they said, could help prevent such injuries and ensure that cyclists are treated equally on the road.“It’s not unrealistic to enforce traffic laws,” Mr. Vaccaro said. But he contends that the police have been issuing tickets based on sections of the state’s traffic law — for example, requiring riders to keep right or preventing them from riding two abreast — that he said do not apply in New York City. This is the basis of the class-action suit.Paul J. Browne, the department’s chief spokesman, disputed that tickets were handed out in error. “Police officers write summonses for observed violations,” he said. “Although some cyclists are surprised to discover it, they must comply in most instances with the same rules that apply to motorists.”Regardless of how the planned suit turns out, does taking a legalistic view of cycling sap its fun?Not for Mr. Vaccaro. He recently quit a large corporate firm after 14 years to join the firm of David Rankin and Mark C. Taylor, two former Portland, Ore., bike messengers who kept their passion for biking after moving into the law.“I’m doing it full speed ahead,” Mr. Vaccaro said of his bike work.Mr. Rankin chimed in: “Of course, we’d all rather be outside.”'"
"'11-08-21,'0','She has paid a heavy price for her joy. In time, the silicone in her body calcified and began to migrate, causing her a seemingly endless series of hospitalizations. At the beginning of July, she was hospitalized for an infection. Her body has been left scarred and misshapen. The skin on her buttocks and legs is discolored, and a lump of hardened silicone the size of a ball hangs behind her left knee.“I knew she didn’t have any training, but I couldn’t go to a doctor to get the implants,” she says of the pumper and what drove her to get the injections. “I just wanted to look beautiful.”PUMPERS and their desperate transgender clients operate in an underground world rarely glimpsed by most New Yorkers. But the practice is commonplace, especially among immigrant and poor women, according to dozens of transgender women, social-service providers and doctors interviewed in recent months. Although there are no reliable statistics on the number of transgender people in the city, a recent study prepared by the health department estimated it at 12,500. And according to the same study, 22 percent of transgender women have had silicone injections.For these women, yearning to appear more feminine, and unable to afford gender reassignment surgery, pumping can seem like a relatively cheap and easy shortcut. The names of pumpers travel by word of mouth, handed down from older women to younger ones just beginning the process of transition. Some operate in teams, renting a hotel room and holding a pumping party to inject 10 or 20 women at a time.It is a dangerous, and sometimes fatal, practice. Most plastic surgeons say silicone is safest when used as enclosed implants, but pumpers use loose silicone, which can migrate and cause disfigurement or significant scarring. Because medical-grade silicone can be hard to come by without hospital connections, some pumpers even inject cooking oil or industrial-grade silicone intended for cars and airplanes, said Dr. Anita Radix, a physician at Callen-Lorde Community Health Center in , which primarily serves the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.Cutting medical-grade silicone with baby oil, Crisco or other substances makes it cheaper. Although a number of pumpers say they have been trained as nurses, most have no medical training and are not licensed to perform surgical procedures, said Dr. Paul R. Weiss, a plastic surgeon and professor at the of . They often operate in rooms that are not sterile, increasing the risk of infection, Dr. Weiss said.If silicone is injected into the bloodstream in error, it can cause a laundry list of serious medical problems, including acute respiratory distress, severe autoimmune or connective tissue disorders, pulmonary embolism or death, Dr. Radix said. Because of the underground nature of pumping, it is impossible to know exactly how many women have died from it, though deaths have been reported across the country.Among the most recent was a case in , where in February, a 20-year-old woman who had flown in from for injections died shortly after receiving them. In July, a transgender woman named Gabrielle Aguilar died at Elmhurst Hospital Center in , days after visiting a pumper, said her cousin, Sheyla Gomez.Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city’s medical examiner’s office, said Thursday that test results to determine the cause of death were still pending, but that an investigation was under way.“Pumpers are preying on desperate people who are poor,” said Pauline Park, president of Queens Pride House, an organization that provides services to lesbian, gay and transgender people. “They’re basically killing people and profiting from it.”The process of transitioning from one gender to another is a long and complicated one that can take years and cost tens of thousands of dollars in hormones and surgical procedures; it is hard enough for people who have the money to pay for it. The majority of transgender women don’t. They are either enrolled in , which does not cover the transition process, or are uninsured, as Ms. Quispe was.Dr. Radix has been treating transgender women since 1989, and at least a quarter of her patients have had silicone injected into their breasts, buttocks and faces, she said. Most believe the trade-off is worth the risk, she added, “for all the years that they had the body they want to have.” They also feel shut out of the medical establishment, a situation that heightens the appeal of pumpers. “If folks had access to medical care, they wouldn’t have to go for the silicone,” Dr. Radix said.That was true of Ms. Quispe, who said she desperately wanted to possess curves but could not afford to see a plastic surgeon.Ms. Quispe decided to build her buttocks and hips incrementally, visiting a pumper whenever she could afford a liter of silicone. She estimated that she was injected 10 times by three pumpers from 1989 to 2000, spending close to $20,000.“If I collected all the money I used for silicone,” Ms. Quispe said, “I would have enough money to do my sex-change operation.”Six months after receiving her last two liters of silicone, in 2000, Ms. Quispe began to experience chronic stabbing pain in her legs and stomach, she said. The silicone turned hard and began to migrate down her legs and through her body.Many share her experience, said Ronica Mukerjee, a who does medical outreach in Queens with transgender women. “Silicone isn’t always deadly, but injecting free loose silicone is very dangerous in large quantities,” Ms. Mukerjee said. “Silicone drifts. I’ve seen silicone injected in their hips end up in their ankles.”In 2002, Ms. Quispe’s primary-care doctor referred her to a plastic surgeon at who, she said, told her the last injections she received had been industrial oil rather than silicone. Trying to remove it surgically could be life-threatening because the oil was embedded in the muscle tissue and the entire muscle would have to be excised from her buttocks and hips. Removing the tissue would leave her with massive cavities, altering her body weight and metabolism drastically, and increase her suffering.He advised her, she said, to take medication for the pain instead of risking surgery. Since then, she has visited several other plastic surgeons with the hope that one might have a different answer — but none have. Five of her friends were injected by the same pumper, she said, and are experiencing similar problems.Now, Ms. Quispe spends most of her time in her tiny apartment in Vinegar Hill, , in the Farragut Houses. Ms. Quispe’s home is decorated with miniature Buddhist statues and several plastic Chinese tapestries tacked on the wall for good luck. The front door opens to a small kitchen with a narrow table and two chairs squeezed next to an old refrigerator. A short corridor leads to her bedroom, most of which is dwarfed by a queen-size bed, where she spends most of her time safely removed from the jeering comments of strangers.“I’d rather be inside my place because everyone looks at me like I’m an alien,” she said, wincing and shifting uncomfortably on the chair. “I’m a human being just like everyone else.”STORIES like Ms. Quispe’s wouldn’t be possible without women like S., a pumper who agreed to be interviewed only on the condition that she be identified by her first initial because what she does is illegal. Born male, S. said, she ran away from home at 15. She met an older transgender woman at a nightclub who helped her begin her transition. The same woman also introduced her to prostitution, and S. used that money to pay for female hormones when she was 15 and for silicone injections that she began receiving at 24, in 1985, from Dr. David R. Wesser, a New York surgeon then well known in the transgender world.S. said she learned to inject silicone herself 17 years ago by informally training with an Upper East Side doctor from who performed surgical procedures without a license in New York. S. said she worked out of his office for a year but began injecting women without his supervision because she did not like having to split the profits. When he realized she was pumping on her own, the doctor agreed to sell her equipment and silicone, she said. She continues to buy supplies from medical distributors because of the relationships she developed through him and Dr. Wesser, who died in 2008.Sometimes, S. said, she buys silicone abroad; sometimes she gets it from hospital connections. She currently pays $2,700 for a half-gallon of loose-flowing medical-grade silicone, which she can use to inject 10 people, charging $400 to $1,000 for each treatment.“It could take from three to four treatments before you get a perfect image of a feminine face,” S. said. “You have to do it a little at a time because you don’t want to turn somebody into a monster.” She injects up to 20 people a week, making about $10,000 each week, she said.The evidence of her success crowds the spacious two-bedroom apartment she rents in Brooklyn. The exterior of her building fits in with the dilapidated neighborhood. The front door is missing a doorknob, and the windows are boarded up and painted a mud brown, concealing the opulent interior. Inside her apartment, gold candleholders, ceramic vases, crystal and gleaming white cherubic angels sparkle under elaborate chandeliers. Thirteen Tiffany-style lamps clutter her shelves, and dozens of porcelain plates hang in rows on her walls.One corner of her dining room contains 10 cages stacked in two columns from floor to ceiling, the sides of the cages covered in tin foil and each cage holding three to six canaries, finches and other small birds.The living room is crammed with stacks of boxes containing items that she plans to move to a house she said she recently bought in .S. sees herself as helping the women she injects. “I try to help the girls because they want to look feminine,” she said, caressing the contours of her face to demonstrate. Her overly plump apple cheeks and smooth pink lips are telltale signs of the silicone injections she has given herself over the years. They dwarf her small, sculpted nose and dark brown eyes, which gleam under the thin eyebrows she carefully draws on. “I try to guide them because the majority of these girls are young,” she continued. “They come to me with holes, dimples; they don’t have no cheeks, and their face is long.”Indeed, a majority of transgender women begin the process of transitioning, as Ms. Quispe and S. did, while teenagers: 62 percent of the transgender women surveyed by the city’s health department identified themselves as female before the age of 18.Transgender youth cannot be treated by a doctor without parental consent, and many of them are estranged from their families because of their gender identities. According to a 2011 discrimination report released by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 19 percent of transgender people experienced homelessness because of their gender identity, 57 percent were rejected by their families, and 41 percent had attempted suicide.S. estimated there were 50 pumpers injecting silicone in . While she acknowledged some dangers, she said the problem lay in bad work by other pumpers. She said all of her clients had been satisfied with her work and she had never had a complaint.“You don’t have to go to school to be a doctor,” S. said. “It’s a gift from God. Sometimes, people have that gift: how to take something and create it, make it something else.”BUT Jahaira Gonzalez, a 31-year-old transgender woman from the , said in interviews in the fall that S. had repeatedly injected her with silicone, to the point of discomfort. Ms. Gonzalez came out at 16 and left her home when she was 17 to begin her gender transition. She met S. at a club and lived with her for two years. During that time, she said, S. sold her bottles of and injected her chin, jaw line, cheeks, upper and bottom lips, calves, hips and buttocks with silicone. Ms. Gonzalez said that she regarded S. as a mother figure and that S. taught her how to be a woman.“I wanted to be just like her,” Ms. Gonzalez said. “In the beginning, she created me, something beautiful.”Ms. Gonzalez said, however, that S. injected her with too much silicone. Now, in the winter, it freezes like a bag of water placed on ice. “If it gets really, really cold, my lips become really hard and my cheekbones become really stiff,” she said. “In the summer time, it’s like I’m melting. I sweat a lot in my face and I can feel the heat heating up my sil.”Worse, she said, is the unnatural look the injections have left her with. Ms. Gonzalez’s apple cheeks and swollen lips mimic S.’s face, meant to make her nose and chin appear smaller but giving her face a round and constructed appearance. “It’s even more worse when you have all this surgery done to feminize yourself and people still know what you are,” Ms. Gonzalez said. “So it kind of messes with your head mentally ’cause it’s like, ‘Why did I do all this work for if people are still noticing that I was born biological male?’ ”IN mid-July, Ms. Quispe was released from the hospital. She returned home, although she still felt dizzy and weak. Then her hands, feet and lips began to tingle and she developed a . Days later, she was admitted to Beth Israel Medical Center, where nurses injected her with blood thinner daily to prevent blood clots from traveling to her heart. She peered wanly over her bloated stomach and swollen feet at the intravenous drip that was inserted in her vein. Her body is in a constant state of inflammation. Ms. Quispe’s doctors have told her they may have to try surgery to remove the silicone if and do not reduce the .“My life is in jeopardy,” Ms. Quispe said. She looked at the angry purple and scarlet marks that dotted her stomach from the blood-thinner injections, just above the stitches from her recent . “If I had known I would look like this, I wouldn’t have done it.”'"

"'11-08-21,'0','Despite this, brokers say, the types of apartments that had been getting 2007 and 2008 prices will probably continue to do so.Shaun Osher, the chief executive of the agency CORE, said he had seen apartments in several developments that opened in 2008 and 2009 easily selling for more than the original owners paid. “The product is the product,” he said. “Even if the markets decline, the units that will continue to fare the best are the resales in new developments.” For some people, he added, “the only thing better than buying a shiny new condo is buying one that is still pretty new but has already had any problems vetted out.” He said the strong sales were helped by a lack of new inventory coming to market.At 520 West 19th Street in Chelsea, which CORE helped sell out in 2008, a three-bedroom apartment that closed in September 2008 for $2.675 million sold this June for $3.15 million, an increase of nearly 18 percent. Similarly, Streeteasy.com shows that a two-bedroom there resold in April for $2.3 million, 10 percent more than the $2.09 million the original owner paid. The bounce clearly had not yet hit last summer, when another three-bedroom sold for $2.3 million, 13 percent below its original $2.64 million sale price.The success of 520 West 19th Street, of course, cannot be generalized for all two- to three-year-old buildings.Doug Perlson, the chief executive of the brokerage RealDirect, said strong resales were “not the rule for a lot of the developments that came on at the height of the market.” In Chelsea, he said, some buildings near Eighth Avenue are reselling at a loss, while buildings farther west or farther east are getting a premium.“There are pockets of activity in West Chelsea near the High Line that are probably going to have success in whatever market we’re in,” Mr. Perlson said. Buildings along the Avenue of the Americas have also been selling well, he added, because “this neighborhood has become much hotter in the last two years,” with the opening of a Trader Joe’s and the Eataly food court not too far away. He said he had a buyer in contract for a two-bedroom at the Lion’s Head Condominium, at Avenue of the Americas and 19th Street, for $2.15 million. The apartment originally sold in 2007 for $2 million.On the same avenue at the Chelsea Stratus, a 37-story tower at 24th Street that opened in mid-2007, at least eight apartments have resold this year with premiums of 2 to 21 percent, according to data from Streeteasy.com.Andrew Anderson, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman who led the sales team for the developer and has since resold dozens of units at the Stratus, said that after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008 , about 20 buyers pulled out of their contracts. Those units were resold at discounts of about 15 percent in 2009, he said, but prices started to bounce back in mid-2010.He said that the Stratus, which towers above its neighbors, was selling well “because it has something that you can’t replicate,” specifically stunning city views. “The quality has to be there and the floor plans have to work,” he said. “But it’s a building’s uniqueness more than anything else that will get the prices.”In general, Chelsea condos, which are primarily in new developments, are selling better than co-ops. The median sales price for condos there has already exceeded the high of $1.49 million it reached in 2008, hitting $1.65 million in the second quarter of 2011, according to data compiled by Miller Samuel. The median price for co-ops, on the other hand, is lagging at $615,000 in the second quarter; the 2008 high was $784,052.The overall market in Manhattan, however, shows the opposite trend, with co-ops faring better than condos, but both categories still down from the height.Richard Grossman, the executive director of downtown sales for Halstead Property, said prices had reached previous heights only “for certain units in certain buildings.” These tend to be renovated apartments in prime locations, he said. “It’s not happening if it’s on the far East or far West Sides of town, or if it’s far from a subway stop.” Other real estate basics will also influence sales price, he added, citing an apartment’s condition and whether “it has something special about it — view, light or something unusual.” But when these apartments sell for high prices, other apartments in the same building are likely to appreciate as well.What defines a building or an apartment as special can vary by neighborhood. In SoHo, where smaller buildings predominate, it could be a doorman or outdoor space. In Greenwich Village, where prewar buildings are common, it could be a signature building of midcentury design.Two months ago Richard Orenstein, an executive vice president of Halstead, sold a two-bedroom loft at 72 Mercer Street in SoHo a week after listing it. The full-floor apartment had sold for $3 million in early 2008, and it resold at the full asking price of $3.995 million.“Things in general take longer to sell now, but special apartments sell for special prices,” Mr. Orenstein said. The SoHo condo stood out because it had a large terrace and also was in a doorman building.In Greenwich Village in March, Sharon Held, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group, sold a two-bedroom apartment at the Butterfield House for $1.426 million. The apartment was an estate sale and needed work, but it nonetheless drew five bids and sold for a hair above the $1.425 million asking price. The price works out to about $1,200 per square foot, which Ms. Held described as exceeding the $1,100 per square foot that was the norm in 2007 and 2008.Ms. Held said that interested buyers had been drawn by the building’s design. Unlike most postwar buildings, Butterfield House has high ceilings and bay windows.On the Upper West Side, said Jill Sloane, an executive vice president of Halstead, apartments near either Central Park or Riverside Park have been selling more quickly than others.She recently helped Diana Lochridge sign a contract to sell her one-bedroom floor-through apartment in a brownstone on West 103rd Street, off of Riverside Park. Ms. Lochridge, who is a vice president at the cable channel truTV, had listed the apartment with two different brokers last year, but there were no takers. She had dropped the price to $799,000 from $895,000 by the time she took it off the market in December and decided to renovate the kitchen.“It was the only room that wasn’t quite done,” Ms. Lochridge said, “and I wanted a new kitchen anyway.” She spent about $16,000 to replace laminate counters and plywood cabinets and to install stainless-steel appliances. “It was money well spent,” she said. “Because I think it sold the place.”Another broker interviewed by Ms. Lochridge suggested pricing the apartment at $700,000, even after the renovation, but Ms. Sloane put it on the market for $839,000 and it is now in contract for $830,000, a price she believes is close to market highs. She said Ms. Lochridge’s apartment merited the high price because it has nearly 1,000 square feet and is now in turnkey condition.Marie Bianco, an agent at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that she and some of her clients routinely used to buy and renovate apartments in the hopes of reselling them at a profit, but that the practice screeched to a halt in 2009. “Nobody could make money back then,” she said, “so they just rented them out for another year.” But investors started selling their properties again earlier this year as prices improved.Ms. Bianco said she listed her two-bedroom apartment at the City Spire, a 72-story tower built on West 56th Street in the 1980s, at the beginning of the year. There was little activity at first, but she sold the place earlier this month to Italian investors for $1.625 million. She bought it for $1.48 million in 2007 and had the kitchen renovated.In Brooklyn, Jim Cornell, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group, said he was surprised when he reviewed sales data for Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights and found that prices for larger apartments had already rebounded. Family-size apartments are very popular in these areas, especially among Manhattanites seeking more space.Three-bedroom apartments in these neighborhoods sold for an average of $1.139 million in 2007, and dropped to $1.065 million in 2009. The average price to date for 2011 is $1.226 million, Mr. Cornell said.“When a seller comes to us,” he added, “they usually want to know if they can get as much as what their neighbor got when they sold in 2007. These numbers prove that the answer is yes, maybe even more.”When Paula Bordelois and her husband, Michael Kamal, bought a three-bedroom in an eight-year-old building in Park Slope a few months ago, they knew they “weren’t buying cheap,” Ms. Bordelois said. Listed at $1.425 million, the apartment received five offers and sold for $1.4 million.“A lot of our friends didn’t think it was the best financial decision,” Ms. Bordelois said. “But this was exactly what we wanted, and we were thinking we would be here for the long term, so it was the right decision.”The duplex apartment is in an elevator building, and it has two terraces and a roof deck, none of which are easy to come by in brownstone Brooklyn, she said. And, because they had been renting an apartment just a few doors down, their 3-year-old daughter already had friends on the block.John Gomes, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, described New York’s real estate recovery as erratic. He said he had seen listings in TriBeCa languish with prices of $1,000 per square foot, while others asking $2,000 per square foot had sparked bidding wars.“It all depends on the exact location and the exact product,” Mr. Gomes said. This is why he advises customers “to buy something special — get the corner apartment, get the extra bedroom.”Even now, in this newly uncertain market, he said, “if you make a smart choice and don’t buy the thing that anyone can buy, you’ll weather the storm.”'"

"'11-08-22,'1','The outcome would leave Ms. Diallo with no recourse to pursue criminal charges against the Frenchman. But she has filed a civil lawsuit seeking unspecified monetary damages from Mr. Strauss-Kahn for what the suit called a “violent and sadistic attack” that humiliated and degraded her.Mr. Vance’s office has readied a motion known as a dismissal on recommendation, which one person briefed on the matter said would detail the reasons he and his aides believe that the case cannot be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.Mr. Vance’s decision in the highly charged case, which ultimately became a credibility contest of sorts between Ms. Diallo and Mr. Strauss-Kahn, was said to have grown out of prosecutors’ assessment that her repeated lies, including multiple denials that she had given any consideration to Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s money, would open her to withering cross-examination. A day after the encounter, she and a friend who was in jail had a recorded telephone conversation about Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s wealth, a fact that the investigators would not learn until six weeks later, after Ms. Diallo had been asked repeatedly about the subject.She is the only witness who could testify to the central allegation in the case: that Mr. Strauss-Kahn forced her to perform oral sex.One law enforcement official involved in the investigation said no single problematic detail about Ms. Diallo’s background, or even all of them put together, had undermined the prosecution’s faith in its ability to present a viable case. Indeed, the official noted, it is common for witnesses and complainants who testify to be vulnerable to attacks on their credibility, either because their accounts have varied, or because they have self-interested motives for giving evidence, like avoiding jail or, occasionally, winning civil settlements.In the Strauss-Kahn case, the official said, prosecutors came to believe that Ms. Diallo seemed unwilling to take responsibility for telling the truth.“We deal with witnesses with these kinds of problems every day,” the official said. “With her, we had to drag the details of the lies out of her over weeks. It might have been different if she had let all the air out in a day or two. Every time she was confronted with her lies, she would blame someone else — someone told her to say this for asylum, someone else took advantage of her bank accounts, someone else did the .”Besides their legal and ethical responsibilities to disclose Ms. Diallo’s untruths, members of the prosecution team could have been called in a criminal trial to testify about her untrue statements to them — possibly transforming prosecutors into witnesses for the defense.Asking a jury to believe Ms. Diallo beyond a reasonable doubt had become untenable, according to a senior official involved in the case.“We couldn’t tell the jury that she kept lying to us but that they should believe her,” the senior official said.But Mr. Vance’s decision will probably draw fire on several fronts, including from black leaders and women’s groups who have urged him to allow a jury to weigh the facts and render a decision.Ms. Diallo’s lawyer, Kenneth P. Thompson, acknowledged that his client may have credibility issues, but he said that other evidence weighed the case in her favor, including other hotel workers who saw Ms. Diallo in a distraught state shortly after she said she was attacked.“You must also consider the overwhelming physical evidence that Mr. Vance and his prosecutors pointed to just weeks ago,” Mr. Thompson said. “Forensic evidence does not lie.” Even one of the controversial phone conversations with her friend in jail corroborated her account of the attack, Mr. Thompson said. Ms. Diallo described the assault to her friend just as she had the previous day to detectives and prosecutors, according to Mr. Thompson.Law enforcement officials have said, however, that though the forensic evidence in the case shows that a sexual encounter occurred, it does not prove that it was forcible.Some critics have contended that Mr. Vance’s office is to blame for some of the problems that arose in the case. They pointed to the prosecutors’ decision, shortly after Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s arrest, to reject an agreement under which Mr. Strauss-Kahn would be freed on bail — a decision that forced them to move swiftly to seek an indictment from a grand jury rather than take more time to investigate details of the case.The more deliberative course, these critics say, would have given prosecutors a chance to learn more about the housekeeper and perhaps avoid their early pronouncements that she was a powerful and “unwavering” witness.Since Mr. Strauss-Kahn was taken into custody hours after the May 14 incident at the New York, the case has played out in an almost carnival-like atmosphere, with legions of representatives of foreign news outlets camped out in front of the courthouse in Lower Manhattan. The drama has dominated the headlines in France, where his arrest and star turn in handcuffs before the cameras sparked outrage.From his first court hearing, Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers indicated that a sexual encounter did take place in the suite but suggested that whatever occurred was consensual.Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a leading figure in the Socialist Party who stepped down from his post at the I.M.F. because of his arrest, was charged with attempted , sexual abuse, criminal sexual act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching.Prosecutors were initially successful in getting a judge to order him held without bail, saying their case was strong and corroborated by physical evidence. They also said the housekeeper had given a compelling and unwavering account of what happened inside the hotel room.A State Supreme Court justice eventually granted Mr. Strauss-Kahn bail on $1 million cash and $5 million bond. But he was held under extraordinary conditions in which he remained under house arrest in a town house in TriBeCa, monitored by an armed guard. He could leave the town house only under limited circumstances.Those bail restrictions were lifted in a stunning reversal by prosecutors on July 1, about six weeks after the encounter.At a court hearing, the district attorney’s office revealed that it had uncovered several facts damaging to the housekeeper’s credibility. Ms. Diallo had lied in her asylum application to authorities and falsely told prosecutors she had been gang raped in her native country, according to a letter filed by prosecutors. She also was untruthful in her tax returns, the letter said.Another area was not aired in court, but was discussed with Ms. Diallo’s lawyer before then. On June 29, when prosecutors’ confidence in Ms. Diallo had already eroded, they received summary translations of phone conversations that she had with a man in immigration detention on May 15, the day after her encounter with Mr. Strauss-Kahn. By then, Ms. Diallo had told the authorities on several occasions that she had never given consideration to possible compensation from a man as wealthy as Mr. Strauss-Kahn.On the night of June 30, Mr. Thompson said that he was called by Mr. Vance’s chief assistant, Daniel R. Alonso, and was informed that the case had serious problems, specifying the phone conversation with the man in detention.Mr. Thompson indicated that Mr. Alonso “stated the victim said ‘words to the effect’ that ‘this guy has a lot of money. I know what I’m doing.’ ”Mr. Thompson has vehemently disputed the prosecutors’ interpretation of the recorded conversation, in which the two spoke in Fulani, a language of Guinea.Later, when he listened to the tape with a translator, Mr. Thompson said the prosecutors had mischaracterized its contents. The district attorney’s office later had several translations from Fulani prepared, and these produced different texts that covered the same subject. The official involved in the investigation said there could be “no question as to the substance of the conversation.”While prosecutors might have wanted Ms. Diallo to hold off on filing a civil suit, they had no objection to her seeking damages for injuries she might have suffered at the hands of Mr. Strauss-Kahn. But the phone call, the official said, signified another episode of Ms. Diallo’s not being forthright.During the month of June, as it became apparent to prosecutors that the case was crumbling, lawyers for Ms. Diallo and Mr. Strauss-Kahn, had some discussions about a payment that would settle any civil claims, and presumably also protect Mr. Strauss-Kahn from criminal prosecution.In late July, in a rare move for a woman who said she was sexually assaulted, Ms. Diallo went public, giving interviews to Newsweek magazine and ABC News.'"
"'11-08-22,'1','Djokovic, who has won nine tournaments, including the Australian Open and Wimbledon, was upended in his bid for a 10th title Sunday. He was trailing Andy Murray, the 2008 Open runner-up, 6-4, 3-0, when he retired with a shoulder injury, experiencing defeat for only the second time in 59 matches this year.The shoulder, Djokovic said afterward, started bothering him during his title run last week in Montreal. He said he would rest it for a few days but that he expected to be fine for the Open, which starts Aug. 29.He knows he has to be at his best because there are so many nonmajor winners, like Berdych and Murray, who are playing with great self-belief.“I think next to Roger and Rafa and myself, there are more players coming up and being confident on the court,” Djokovic said. “You know, we didn’t get to see that maybe in the last couple of years. Now players believe they can win against top players.”Djokovic and Nadal, the second-ranked men’s player, have 13 Grand Slam titles between them. The women have no such anchors. The withdrawal last week of the two-time defending Open champion Kim Clijsters leaves their draw without its surest thing.The top two women, Caroline Wozniacki and Vera Zvonareva, have combined for no major titles at all and no United States Open Series hardcourt titles this year. Serena Williams, on the comeback trail after being sidelined nearly a year with health issues, won two hardcourt events this summer. She is a three-time Open champion. Another former winner, Maria Sharapova, will be the early favorite in the wide-open women’s field, especially after she rallied to beat Jelena Jankovic, 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-3, on Sunday here.How many more chances will New Yorkers have to see Williams, who turns 30 next month, and her sister, Venus, a two-time winner, who is 31? Going into the Open, the highest-ranked American player, male or female, is a 29-year-old journeyman, Mardy Fish, who has risen to No. 7 in the world on the strength of the best year of his career.This year at Flushing Meadows represents the best chance at glory for Fish, who has lost in the first or second round in 8 of his 10 appearances there. He was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Nadal in 2008 and in the Round of 16 by Djokovic last year.For the first time, Fish will have marquee billing over his good friend Andy Roddick, the 2003 champion and the 2006 runner-up, who has been plagued by injuries as he nears his 29th birthday on Aug. 30.How the easygoing Fish will respond to being the beau of the ball figures to be one of the more compelling story lines of the Open.“It’ll be much different this time,” Fish said, “in a good way.”He had a back-seat view during the decade-long joy ride of Roddick, who has made it at least as far as the quarterfinals in 8 of 11 Open appearances. Until recently, the ride made Fish queasy.“I remember having a conversation with Andy about it,” Fish said, “and obviously it’s his favorite event. He loves it there. I was like: ‘Man, I just don’t really like it there. It’s just so loud and fast-paced.’ He was like, ‘All you need is one night match.’ ”In 2008, Fish drew another American, James Blake, who was seeded ninth, in a third-round match under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium. He defeated him in straight sets and experienced the Open as if it were the first time.“The crowd was just electric,” Fish said. “It was incredible. I’ll never forget it. That’s when I fell in love with it.”Can someone like Fish, who is so affable he is usually the one to initiate eye contact, keep his head down and his eye on the trophy with so many more people clamoring for his attention?“We’ll see,” he said. “Ask me that in the second week if I’m still there.”The men’s singles competition, especially, will be worth savoring, even for those in the heat of it. “You’re able to reflect on the incredible year that Novak is having; you’re able to reflect on, you know, we have the greatest player of all time in our era right now, 16 majors and you’ve seen every one of them,” Fish said, referring to Federer.“You have a guy who’s still 25 years old in Nadal, and there is no telling how many French Opens and Wimbledons he can win still,” Fish continued. “They’re going to be two guys that will probably go down as two of the best ever to play. Yes, I certainly know that. Those guys are walking legends.”The Open will go on after Federer and Clijsters and the Williams sisters leave the game, but it will be like attending The Producers after Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick departed: entertaining, but ineffably different.'"

The ad was part of a campaign that ran in Esquire magazine and showed well-groomed young men holding in their hands cavemen-style heads that were meant to represent their previous, badly groomed selves. The complaints were generated by an ad showing a young black man holding a head with a luxuriant Afro and beard; the headline read, “Re-civilize yourself.” After complaints on Twitter that the ad was racist, Beiersdorf USA said it would “never be used again.” There was another ad in the campaign, showing a young white man holding a head with an unkempt beard and hair; that ad carried the headline “Sin City isn’t an excuse to look like hell.” A blog post on Adage.com on Friday suggested the controversy could have been avoided had the headlines been switched between the ads.'"
"'11-08-22,'1','Patricia M. Wagner of Epstein Becker Green, one of the nation’s largest health care law firms, estimates that “50 percent to 60 percent of physicians and hospitals are exploring ways” to team up. The health care law encourages such alliances and joint ventures but provides no exemption from antitrust law, which bans mergers that may substantially “lessen competition.”Matthew J. Reilly, a senior lawyer at the trade commission, and his team of 14 lawyers have been hammering away at the Ohio merger for more than two months. Armed with thousands of confidential e-mails and dozens of depositions, Mr. Reilly said the merger would increase ProMedica’s market share and “bargaining leverage,” so it could force health insurance plans to pay higher rates to St. Luke’s and to ProMedica’s other hospitals.St. Luke’s chose to join ProMedica even though it concluded that the affiliation could “stick it to employers, that is, to continue forcing high rates on employers and insurance companies,” according to an internal document unearthed by the commission.“Soon after the acquisition was consummated,” Mr. Reilly said, “ProMedica approached certain health plans to obtain higher reimbursement rates.” The higher rates, he said, are typically passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums, co-payments and other costs.Numerous witnesses, including insurance executives and employers, have testified that Toledo has some of the highest health care costs in Ohio. In addition, they say that ProMedica’s rates are among the highest in the Toledo area, while St. Luke’s is a low-cost, high-quality provider. The government’s goal is to undo the merger and restore the competition that existed when St. Luke’s was independent.In March, a federal district judge in Toledo issued a preliminary injunction blocking ProMedica and St. Luke’s from continuing to carry out their consolidation until the trade commission could hold a full administrative trial on the merits of the case. The judge, David A. Katz, said the injunction was needed because otherwise ProMedica would be free to carry out “its plans to increase hospital rates, terminate employees at St. Luke’s and eliminate important clinical services” there.ProMedica, which has 11 hospitals in Ohio and Michigan and annual revenue of $1.7 billion, has described itself to a credit rating agency as having “market dominance” in the Toledo area. It owns and operates one of the largest commercial health plans in Lucas County, which includes Toledo, and is the largest employer of doctors there. For all these reasons, ProMedica says, it is “uniquely positioned for health care reform.”Randy Oostra, the president of ProMedica, said the merger would benefit patients in many ways. “We could coordinate care,” Mr. Oostra said. “We could improve quality at St. Luke’s by adopting electronic health records and using clinical protocols to standardize the delivery of care. But the F.T.C. has stopped us in our tracks.”ProMedica said it came to the rescue of St. Luke’s by promising to invest $35 million in the hospital, which it said was losing money and could not have survived on its own. One problem, Mr. Oostra said, was that prices charged to commercially insured patients at St. Luke’s were too low — “substantially below market rates” and, he said, below the cost of providing services.The trade commission says it is investigating at least a dozen cases in which competing groups of doctors are linking up with one another or with hospitals under a single corporate umbrella.“Such arrangements have the potential to generate cost savings and quality benefits for patients,” said Richard A. Feinstein, director of the Bureau of Competition at the F.T.C. “However, in some cases, the arrangements can create highly concentrated markets that may harm consumers through higher prices or lower quality of care.”A study issued last week by the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research institute, said hospital employment of doctors was growing rapidly, “driven largely by hospitals’ quest to increase market share and revenue.”The commission expressed “serious concerns” about plans by a hospital in Spokane, Wash., to acquire two competing groups of cardiologists. And it has challenged the merger of two hospitals in Albany, Ga.For all practical purposes, the commission said, the Georgia transaction is “a merger to monopoly” because the hospitals, Phoebe Putney Health System and Palmyra Park, are the only two competing hospitals in the Albany area.The Toledo case focuses on the market for inpatient hospital care and inpatient obstetrical services in Lucas County, where ProMedica has four hospitals, including St. Luke’s.The government says the merger will enhance ProMedica’s dominant position in the county, increasing its share of the market for general inpatient hospital services to 58 percent, from 47 percent, and raising its share of inpatient obstetrical services to 80 percent, from 71 percent.Jeffrey C. Kuhn, general counsel for ProMedica, insisted that his hospitals could not simply sharply increase prices. “If ProMedica charges too much,” Mr. Kuhn said, “health plans and employers can shift to other hospitals in the area, which have excess capacity.”'"
"'11-08-22,'1','So you think you can hack?Some 700 hackers looking to show off their talents have piled into an upstart Web site called RankMyHack.com in the last month. Emerging from the shadowy underground, they have submitted evidence of more than 1,200 Web site hacks, eager to have their feats measured against those of their peers.The site was created by a hacker nicknamed Solar to bring a little accountability to the online forums and chat rooms where hackers gather to learn tricks of the trade, buy and sell contraband and form alliances. There, eBay-style ratings systems meant to establish reputations are routinely abused, morality tends to be fluid and anonymous young people often talk big while carrying a small stick.RankMyHack offers a way to separate the skilled from the so-called script kiddies by verifying hacks using codes that participants must plant somewhere on sites they have compromised. As in a video game, RankMyHack awards points, which are based on the popularity of the hacked site and the technical difficulty of the hack. Total scores determine hackers’ ranks on the “leader board of legends.” Players can even challenge one another to duels.“So have you got what it takes to be the best?” Solar taunts on the site’s home page, which has a distinctively retro design.Participants can also win “bounties” for hacking racist sites as well as university, military and government sites, an element intended “to focus the abilities of talented hackers against political and government forces.”'"
"'11-08-22,'1','“Tonight, the momentum against the Qaddafi regime has reached a tipping point,” Mr. Obama said in a statement. “Tripoli is slipping from the grasp of a tyrant. The Qaddafi regime is showing signs of collapsing. The people of Libya are showing that the universal pursuit of dignity and freedom is far stronger than the iron fist of a dictator.”The shocking collapse of the Qaddafi forces appeared to signal the end for one of the world’s most flamboyant and mercurial political figures, the leader of an idiosyncratic government that was frequently as bizarre as it was brutal.Long a thorn in the side of the West, Colonel Qaddafi had managed an awkward reconciliation in recent years, abandoning his fledgling nuclear program and paying billions of dollars to the victims of the bombing, which was attributed to Libyan agents.While denying that he actually headed the government, Colonel Qaddafi created a cult of personality that centered on his Green Book, a volume both trivial and impenetrable. His decades of iron-fisted rule have produced a country, analysts say, that is devoid of credible institutions and any semblance of a civil society — a potential source of trouble in the months and years ahead.After six months of inconclusive fighting, the assault on the capital unfolded at a breakneck pace, with insurgents capturing a base of the vaunted Khamis Brigade, where they had expected to meet resistance, then speeding toward Tripoli and through several neighborhoods of the capital effectively unopposed.A separate group of rebels waged a fierce battle near the Rixos Hotel, a bastion of Qaddafi support near the city center. A team of rebels there captured Colonel Qaddafi’s son and one-time heir apparent, . Rebels also claimed to have accepted the surrender of a second Qaddafi son, Mohammed.Rebel spokesmen said that their fighters had surrounded the Bab al-Aziziya compound where they believed Colonel Qaddafi might still be holding out, but that they were reluctant to begin an all-out assault.Colonel Qaddafi issued a series of defiant audio statements during the night, calling on people to “save Tripoli” from a rebel offensive. He said Libyans were becoming “slaves of the imperialists” and that “all the tribes are now marching on Tripoli.”Mahmoud Hamza, a senior official of the Qaddafi Foreign Ministry, acknowledged in a phone call at 1 a.m. local time on Monday that “it is getting near the end now.” But he said that the Qaddafi forces had not given up.“Tripoli now is very dangerous. There is a lot of fighting, but there is not yet an assault on Bab al-Aziziya,” he said. “For me this is the most fearful thing. I hope it does not come to that.”television broadcast images of Libyans celebrating in central Tripoli and ripping down Qaddafi posters. Huge crowds gathered in Benghazi, the capital of the rebel-controlled eastern part of the country, as expectations grew that Colonel Qaddafi’s hold on power was crumbling.Earlier on Sunday, protesters took to the streets, and cells of rebels inside Tripoli clashed with Qaddafi loyalists, opposition leaders and refugees from the city said. Fighting had been heavy in the morning, but by midnight Colonel Qaddafi’s forces had withdrawn from many districts without a major battle.A rebel spokesman said insurgents had opened another line of attack on Tripoli by sending boats from the port city of Misurata to link up with fighters in the capital. It was not clear how many fighters were involved in that operation.Moussa Ibrahim, the government’s spokesman, issued press statements through the night, saying that more than 1,300 people had died in fighting in the city, but that government troops remained in control. Those claims could not be confirmed.But the turmoil inside Tripoli and the crumbling of defenses on its outskirts suggested a decisive shift in the revolt, the most violent of the Arab Spring uprisings.NATO troops continued close air support of the rebels all day, with multiple strikes by alliance aircraft helping clear the road to Tripoli from Zawiyah. Rebel leaders in the west credited NATO with thwarting an attempt on Sunday by Qaddafi loyalists to reclaim Zawiyah with a flank assault on the city.Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi has been a central character in the drama of the revolt. Before the uprising began he was known as Libya’s leading advocate of reform in both economic and political life. He cultivated an Anglophile persona, and often appeared to be waging a tug of war against his father’s older and more conservative allies. He was increasingly seen as the most powerful figure behind the scenes of the government as well as his father’s likely successor.When the revolt broke out it was Seif al-Islam who delivered the government’s first public response, vowing to wipe out what he called “the rats” and warning of a civil war.In his last public interview, he appeared a changed man. Sitting in a spare hotel conference room, he wore a newly grown beard and fingered prayer beads. After months of denouncing the rebels as dangerous Islamic radicals, he said that he was brokering a new alliance with the Islamist faction among the rebels to drive out the liberals.While rebels expressed hope that Colonel Qaddafi’s forces had lost their will to fight, support for the government could remain strong inside areas of Tripoli. Analysts said the crucial role played by NATO in aiding the rebel advance in the relatively unpopulated areas outside the capital could prove far less effective in an urban setting, where concerns about civilian casualties could hamper the alliance’s ability to focus on government troops.A senior American military officer who has been following the developments closely, and who has been in contact with African and Arab military leaders in recent days, expressed caution on Sunday about the prospects for Libya even if the Qaddafi government should fall. Even if Colonel Qaddafi is deposed in some way, the senior officer said, there was still no clear plan for a political succession or for maintaining security in the country.“The leaders I’ve talked to do not have a clear understanding how this will all play out,” said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.Few would have predicted that the rebels would meet so little resistance from the 32nd Brigade, a unit that NATO had considered one of the most elite in Libya and commanded by Khamis Qaddafi, one of the leader’s sons. The so-called Khamis Brigade was one of the crucial units enforcing the defense lines around the capital, extending about 17 miles outside Tripoli to the west and about 20 miles to the south.Rebels said those points had been breached by Sunday afternoon despite the expectation that Colonel Qaddafi would use armored units and artillery to defend them. It was unclear whether the government troops had staged a tactical retreat or had been dislodged by NATO strikes.After a brief gun battle, rebels took over one of the brigade’s bases along the road to Tripoli. Inside the base, rebels raised their flag and cheered wildly. They began carting away stores of weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades and mortars.While the bodies of several dead loyalist soldiers were left on the ground in the base, it appeared the troops there had retreated rather than being forced out in battle. At least one structure suffered significant damage from NATO bombs.American officials say they are preparing contingency plans if and when Colonel Qaddafi’s government falls to help prevent the vast Libyan government stockpiles of weapons, particularly portable antiaircraft missiles, from being stolen and dispersed.Untold numbers of the missiles, including SA-7s, have already been looted from government arsenals, and American officials fear they could circulate widely, including heat-seeking antiaircraft missiles that could be used against civilian airliners. “What I worry about most is the proliferation of these weapons,” the senior military officer said, noting that the had already been quietly meeting with leaders of Libya’s neighbors in ’s Sahel region to stem the flow of the missiles.The officer said that small teams of American military and other government weapons experts could be sent into Libya after the fall of the Qaddafi government to help Libyan rebel and other international forces secure the weapons.If Colonel Qaddafi himself continued to hold out in Tripoli, it became increasingly clear that even his most senior aides were making exits of their own.The Tunisian state news agency reported Saturday that Libya’s oil minister, Omran Abukraa, had sought refuge in after leaving Tripoli on what was ostensibly a business trip abroad. If confirmed, his flight would be the third of a senior government official in the past week.Amid worries from the West and rights groups that rebel fighters might seek revenge against Qaddafi supporters, the rebels’ National Transitional Council said Saturday that it was reissuing a booklet reminding its mostly novice fighters about the international laws of war.'"
"'11-08-22,'1','Mr. Kim’s train traveled to the small Bureya station in the Amur region in eastern Siberia on Sunday, according to news reports. After receiving a warm welcome from the Russian president’s envoy to the region, Viktor Ishayev, and by Russian women carrying the traditional offering of a loaf of bread and salt, Mr. Kim traveled by Mercedes to the nearby Bureiskaya hydroelectric plant.Mutual economic and political interests are bringing the leaders of Russia and North Korea together, analysts in Seoul said. Mr. Kim’s efforts to pull his country out of its economic crisis depend largely on finding access to hard currency and relatively cheap energy.For years, officials in Moscow and Seoul have urged North Korea to let the two countries build a pipeline through the North to carry Russian natural gas to meet the rising demand in South Korea and perhaps to also supply Japan. North Korea can expect to earn as much as $500 million a year in transit fees from the pipeline, according to South Korean analysts.With South Korea’s support, Russia and North Korea have also discussed the idea of extending the Trans-Siberian Railway through the North into the South and building high-voltage power lines to sell surplus Russian electricity from plants like Bureiskaya to both Koreas.Russian officials have said that such deals will help develop the country’s sparsely populated Far East.After years of hesitation, North Korea has recently shown interest in the proposals. Executives from the Russian gas firm Gazprom visited Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, in July. This month, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said that North Korea was “positive” about the pipeline project, and North Korea’s media acknowledged last week that Mr. Medvedev had called for greater cooperation involving energy and railways among Russia and the two Koreas.Even if Mr. Kim and Mr. Medvedev agree in principle on the energy deals, the dispute over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program will complicate the negotiations.South Korean analysts disagreed about whether the proposed pipeline would present an economic and security risk or whether it would help the North rebuild its economy and encourage it to be more flexible concerning its nuclear ambitions.Mr. Kim has told his people repeatedly that he will “open the door for a strong and prosperous nation” in 2012, said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor at Dongguk University in Seoul, and the North Korean leader needs to “present them with something that will give them hopes and expectations.”“Russia’s abundant oil fields and natural gas reserves,” he added, “seem to give it some of the power leverage it had lost in Northeast Asia since the cold war.” Because of international sanctions led by the United States, North Korea’s economy is dependent on China more than ever. That has spawned a fear among the North’s xenophobic elite, who harbor a deep suspicion of any big power, and may have led them to try to compensate for their weakening leverage with China by bolstering ties with Russia, analysts in Seoul said.Nuclear diplomats and economic policy makers like Pak Bong-ju — a former premier who was demoted to a factory manager after pushing for change but who was reinstated to an influential post last year — are with Mr. Kim on his trip to Russia.'"

"'11-08-23,'1','In particular, officials will look to halt deportations of longtime residents with clean police records who came here illegally when they were children, or are close family of military service members, or are parents or spouses of American citizens.“This is a great first step,” said Hector E. Sanchez, a Hispanic labor leader who oversees immigration policy for the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition of the country’s major Latino groups. “We really need to see action on a common-sense approach to immigration and not just promises.”Mr. Obama had been facing increasingly vocal protests from disappointed Latino and immigrant groups after he made no progress in Congress on his immigration overhaul agenda, and enforcement authorities set a modern record for deportations, with nearly 800,000 foreigners removed in the past two years.Homeland Security officials said Monday that their goal is to quickly identify noncriminals on swollen immigration court dockets and close those cases, clearing the way for speedier removals of gang members, drug traffickers or foreigners who repeatedly return after being deported. Wait times for a hearing in immigration courts can now be as long as 18 months.A senior Homeland Security official said that deportations would be canceled case by case. While many immigrants in those cases will be eligible for work permits, he said, employment authorization will come only after a separate process.The immigrants will remain in a sort of legal limbo, not vulnerable to deportation but with no positive immigration status, which can be conferred only by Congress.But White House officials and Congressional Democrats said they expected the measures would lead to relief during the coming year for virtually all young illegal immigrants facing deportation who might have won legal status under a bill called the Dream Act. A proposal to benefit illegal immigrant high school graduates who came to the country before they were 16, it failed in the Senate last year.Mr. Guerra, now 27 and living in Indiantown, Fla., is one of those immigrants. He said he came to this country to escape a violent gang in Mexico. His lawyer, Richard A. Hujber, said Mr. Guerra’s efforts to straighten out his legal status went wrong because they were originally mishandled by an accountant claiming falsely to be a lawyer.In recent years, even though he was undocumented, Mr. Guerra has been a Florida leader of the illegal immigrant student movement, helping to organize a protest walk by four students to Washington and a mock university held by students wearing mortarboards on Capitol Hill.“That was so big to me, all these students organizing a school so we could go without our papers,” Mr. Guerra said. If he can obtain a work permit, he and Mr. Hujber said, he could be legally eligible for the first time to apply for financial aid that would allow him to continue his religious studies.The administration’s announcement also had an immediate impact on a case in , where an immigration judge on Friday postponed the deportation of Sujey Pando, a lesbian from Mexico legally married in to an American from , Violeta Pando. Although federal law does not recognize , administration officials said they would consider same-sex spouses as “family” in their review of deportation cases.The judge, Mimi Tsankov, cited the flux in laws and policies affecting same-sex cases in delaying a decision on Sujey Pando’s deportation at least until January, said Lavi Soloway, a lawyer for the couple.Some Latino Democrats who have been deeply critical of Mr. Obama on immigration issues praised the policy shift.“This is the I have been waiting for, that Latino and immigrant voters helped put in office to fight for sensible immigration policies,” said Representative Luis V. Gutierrez of , a Latino leader on immigration issues who has been arrested twice in protests in front of the White House.However, the announcement appeared to signal an end to efforts by the White House to court some of its Republican opponents, with administration officials acknowledging those efforts have failed and there is little chance for broad immigration legislation to pass before elections next year.Republican leaders reacted to Mr. Obama’s new policy by stepping up their rejection of his approach. Representative Peter T. King of New York, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in the House, said the president was making “a blatant attempt to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal aliens in this country,” which he called “totally unacceptable.”'"
"'11-08-23,'1','A new contract mandates that the cooperative’s members carry the Tennis Channel on digital basic or not at all.Solomon is hoping that Cablevision will comply with the new contract. “But I’m not confident it will happen,” he said.He is still stung by what he calls Cablevision’s use of a loophole — joining the cable cooperative to avoid broadly distributing the Tennis Channel and shifting it to the sports tier that he said attracted 100,000 to 135,000 of Cablevision’s subscribers.“It would be the height of hypocrisy to opt out of the N.C.T.C. contract because it’s no longer a loophole,” Solomon said.Opting out is any member’s option, said Dan Mulvenon, a spokesman for the cooperative.“I’m sure every member will take a hard look at new requirements and decide if they’re in or out,” he said, adding that he did not know how many members would expand the way they carry the Tennis Channel.Cablevision said in a statement that it was “hopeful that there will be a new agreement or an extended one” with the Tennis Channel. But, it added, “Under any scenario, Cablevision customers will see every important U.S. Open match on ESPN2, CBS and through the considerable online offerings of the U.S.T.A.”ESPN2 and the Tennis Channel share cable coverage of the tournament.The Tennis Channel’s schedule features eight days of action from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern and the weekend of Sept. 3 and 4 from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.Cablevision is not the only major cable operator in the New York City area that carries the Tennis Channel on a sports tier; Time Warner Cable and Comcast also do, which severely limits how many people can see the channel.But the enforcement bureau of the Federal Communications Commission last month gave the Tennis Channel reason to be hopeful by recommending that Comcast give the Tennis Channel much wider carriage that would equal what it gives to the two networks it owns, the Golf Channel and Versus. Comcast objected.Solomon said he was certain that his independent network would have many more subscribers if it were owned by Comcast or Cablevision.'"
"'11-08-23,'1','And Ms. Quinn raises golden truckloads of contributions from the plastic surgeon, hedge fund and real estate set.But there are questions to be asked about her leadership, and not all cheery. She wields money as a cudgel, and — like past speakers — tolerates dissent best when expressed behind closed doors. (The spending analysis comes from a report by the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, who may run for mayor.)Ms. Quinn talks of practicality; discipline ensures that the Council is taken seriously. There is truth here. The Council has 51 members, running a gamut from razor-sharp to clueless, droll to unintentionally hilarious. Some days you can watch the Council and yearn to apply for asylum in Montclair.Years ago, Ms. Quinn was an aide to Thomas K. Duane, the first openly gay councilman. He once voted against the budget, and the speaker took revenge by slashing his entire allocation. She recounted this last week to indicate that it’s been worse.But money can induce silence. Ydanis Rodriguez, a councilman from working-class Upper Manhattan who is a touch independent, received a vanishingly small allocation compared with, say, the Quinn ally Jessica S. Lappin, on the wealthy Upper East Side. Mr. Rodriguez sounds as if he is tiptoeing through a minefield. No, no, he says, he is not angry at the speaker.“I hope,” he says carefully, “to work with her.”Ms. Quinn has considerable virtues. A former tenant advocate, she won a battle to preserve thousands of subsidized middle-class apartments in Manhattan and passed a law to strengthen the city’s hand in policing negligent landlords. She worked with the mayor to set aside a budgetary surplus, which tided the city through recessionary storms.Ms. Quinn is no naïf. She used a masterstroke to ascend to speaker. While her rival wooed individual members, she charmed the Queens, Bronx and Brooklyn Democratic bosses, and a bushel of votes fell her way. At her swearing-in, the former Village Voice columnist Tom Robbins noted, bosses sat in the front row. Vito J. Lopez of Brooklyn wore a red sweater vest, lest anyone overlook him.The fates have smiled on Mr. Lopez’s social-service empire, the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council; this year the Council sent more than $4 million its way.Ms. Quinn’s predecessor, Gifford Miller, dueled often with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. That didn’t work out too well; Mr. Miller is now in real estate.Ms. Quinn drew a lesson: Tread carefully around mogul mayors. When Mr. Bloomberg wanted term limits lifted, she tossed aside previous promises and rammed the measure through without a referendum. When he wanted state approval of an unqualified candidate for schools chief, she raised no peep.Last year, a Council majority favored mandatory sick days for New Yorkers with less than a week of vacation. The mayor opposed it. Ms. Quinn killed it.Some suggest that she has gotten lost in the game, that she can no longer recall the questions she once asked as an advocate. That sounds too definitive. Her arc is not done.She affects nonchalance when described as a mayoral puppet: “You can call me Mini-Me. I don’t really care.”The rub is that voters might care a lot.'"
"'11-08-23,'1','John Swofford, the commissioner of the Atlantic Coast Conference, said that college athletics needed a major overhaul and tweaking the status quo was not going to get the job done.“What’s happened is you try to put in a rule that keeps those that would cheat from cheating, and you end up trying to close every little loophole,” Swofford said. “I think we need to be addressing the felons, if you will, as opposed to the jaywalkers and get ourselves out of this maze of rules that are unenforceable. Although well-intended, I’m not sure whether somebody got a text on a day they weren’t supposed to get a text is a huge problem, in reality.”A quarter of the universities in the A.C.C. are dealing with N.C.A.A. difficulties. Swofford said league officials have talked with Miami, where a former booster claims he provided cash, gifts and other improper benefits to athletes over an eight-year period. North Carolina has spent the past year coping with an N.C.A.A. investigation of improper benefits and academic misconduct. Georgia Tech recently was forced to give back its 2009 conference football championship trophy because of rules violations.“The last thing I want to see in our league are N.C.A.A. problems,” Swofford said. “So yes, whether it’s one or two or three, anytime they’re there, it’s disappointing.”'"
"'11-08-23,'1','The endgame in Libya could herald a slump in oil prices. As with the rebel advance into Tripoli, Libyan supplies to the global market could come sooner than expected. Brent crude prices slipped by as much as $3 to almost $106 a barrel at one point on Monday, before rebounding later in the day. A resolution in Libya, coupled with concerns over global growth, means tight markets could soon look oversupplied.A return of Libyan oil production to levels before the unrest, 1.7 million barrels a day, or 2 percent of global supply, would take until 2015, according to a June estimate from the International Energy Agency. The forecast may now look too pessimistic, with the rebel-controlled Arabian Gulf Oil Company, Repsol of Spain, and Eni of Italy all suggesting that normal supply could resume much faster once the crisis is resolved. Analysts estimate that daily production could reach up to a million barrels within a year.Oil prices have eased almost $20 a barrel in four months. A supply increase, just as the American and European economies look vulnerable to a new recession, will further weigh on prices. And Saudi Arabia’s recent effort to offset the disruption from Libya, taking production to a record high of almost 10 million barrels a day, will act to compound any supply glut, as will the International Energy Agency’s release of reserves.Yet any price slump is likely to be less severe than in 2008, when oil prices crashed by more than $100 a barrel in six months. This time around, credit lines remain open to businesses. And oil demand remains strong from certain rapidly growing countries like China, which account for almost 50 percent of total global consumption, compared with 44 percent in 2008, according to Barclays Capital.Politics will further support prices. Investors remain alert for signs that the protest movement could spread to larger oil producers like Iran. And even if prices do continue to fall, high-spending gulf countries have an incentive to cut production quickly. Saudi Arabia’s budget needs roughly $84 a barrel to break even, compared with around $50 a barrel three years ago. But with Brent prices some way off the pain threshold for producers, there’s still room for adjustment.'"
"'11-08-23,'1','Even with Libya’s ragged rebellion still troubled by internal divisions, several days traveling with rebel troops — along with interviews with rebel leaders, NATO diplomats and officials in Washington — reveal that rebel forces were able to devise a careful plan for the final assault on Tripoli that unfolded with a swiftness few had predicted.They were aided by steady supplies of weapons, fuel, medicine and food from British, French and Qatari troops and an escalated bombing campaign by NATO jets and American Predator drones. Hundreds of rebels took part in secret military training inside Qatar.Rebel forces even advanced on Tripoli by boat, arranging a flotilla from the town of Misurata in an operation the rebels called Mermaid Dawn.With the regime collapsing, American officials said that aides close to Colonel Qaddafi called several Obama administration officials, including the American ambassador, Gene Cretz, and Jeffrey Feltman, assistant secretary of state, to try to hastily broker a truce. Yet the Libyans never promised that Colonel Qaddafi would cede power, the American officials said, and the calls were not taken seriously.American officials said that even as fighting in eastern Libya bogged down in a stalemate, guerrillas operating in the rugged Nafusah Mountains in the west were steadily gaining ground against Qaddafi forces and cutting off supplies to the capital.The rebels operating in the west made steady progress over the past month, driving north toward the Mediterranean Coast and seizing a sprawling oil refinery in Zawiyah, just 30 miles west of Tripoli. Along the way, according to a senior NATO official, the rebels battled mercenary fighters from Chad and other African countries whom Colonel Qaddafi had enlisted to bolster his overstretched military.Several American officials said the fall of Zawiyah may have been the campaign’s real turning point, as it choked nearly all of the remaining fuel supplies to the government in Tripoli.“That signaled the end might be near,” a senior defense official said on Monday.The rebels had been resupplied with weapons from Qatari special forces and given satellite photographs by their British and French military advisers. To boost morale, the United States passed along snippets of intercepted telephone conversations in which Libyan commanders were complaining about desperate shortages of food, water and ammunition.The western offensive by the rebels galvanized opposition fighters in other parts of the country. American and NATO officials described a carefully coordinated three-pronged push on Tripoli, to drive fighters loyal to Colonel Qaddafi on the roads back toward the capital where NATO planes could bomb them.That push, concentrated to the west of Tripoli, was coordinated with the uprising on Saturday within Tripoli itself.“It all came together more quickly than many anticipated, but it was not exactly a coincidence,” the diplomat said.Rebel groups broke through long-stagnant front lines and approached Tripoli from the south and east. The surge forced Libyan government troops into the open, allowing allied warplanes to strike them repeatedly, a senior NATO official said on Monday.The rebel push on Tripoli inspired some residents of the capital to go ahead with the planned uprising, according to interviews with some rebel leaders on Monday.Over the weekend, residents “came to the point where they wanted to go for it,” said Yusuf Muhammed, who advises an elite rebel brigade made up of fighters from Tripoli.There was another reason for the protests, according to several rebel leaders. The rebels hoped that Libyan government troops would try to put down the uprising using large weapons like antiaircraft guns — making it easier for NATO warplanes to spot the muzzle flashes of Colonel Qaddafi’s troops.Sure enough, when the protests began Saturday evening, Colonel Qaddafi’s troops were waiting outside the mosques and began firing on protesters, according to several residents who said they saw the violence.By Sunday morning, some 600 rebel fighters from Tripoli were sent to bolster the group advancing on the capital from the west, according to rebel leaders. About 100 members of the unit had received specialized training in Qatar, according to Mr. Mohammed, the rebel adviser.But the rebel advance on Tripoli was nearly thwarted on Sunday morning, when a column of Libyan government forces tried to outflank the rebels and re-enter Zawiyah. As Colonel Qaddafi’s troops approached Zawiyah, however, NATO warplanes bombed the convoy before it could reach the strategic city.It was part of an intense NATO aerial bombardment that continued throughout the day on Sunday. NATO warplanes carried out about 50 attack missions that day.  Among the most sensitive were on command-and-control bunkers in Tripoli that the government had set up in civilian buildings in an effort to ward off allied attacks.With American Predator drones providing round-the-clock surveillance to monitor the “pattern of life” in the buildings for days or weeks, allied warplanes attacked the structures only after it was determined that the military was using them, the senior NATO  officials said.One of the NATO targets was a base used by the feared 32nd Brigade, an urban assault unit commanded by Khamis al-Qaddafi, one of the colonel’s sons.Rebel leaders had expected the Khamis brigade to form a “ring of steel” around Tripoli — the last defense of Colonel Qaddafi’s embattled regime.But rebel fighters said that when the weekend came, there were only about 50 soldiers defending the base. It left rebel leaders to wonder whether the feared group of Qaddafi loyalists had been defeated, or whether they had merely dispersed so they could fight another day.'"
"'11-08-23,'1','When Roger Cohen suggests that the lesson Jews should take from British class consciousness and anti-Semitism is for Israel to end the “colonization” of the West Bank, he mimics the bigotry he is trying to expose. Does Mr. Cohen believe that the British will stop whispering when the Israelis stop building settlements?Anti-Semitism, like other forms of bigotry, is based not on what people do, but on who they are. To suggest otherwise is to blame the victim and ignore history.The writer is communications director of Joint Action Committee for Political Affairs, a bipartisan political action committee dedicated to, among others, the United States-Israel relationship.Roger Cohen says Jews should know better: “The lesson is clear: Jews, with their history, cannot become the systematic oppressors of another people.” His reference to the plight of the Palestinians is offensive: blaming Israel. He should know better!In 1993, Israel gave the Palestinians a chance to have their own country with the Oslo Accords. The Palestinians responded with suicide bombings and terror. Israel followed with offers in 2000 and 2008. Palestinians walked away without a counteroffer.Since Israel won the West Bank from Jordan, the Palestinians’ life expectancy has increased, their infant mortality has been reduced, and their economy has prospered. If any fingers need to be pointed, they should be at the Palestinian leadership.While I applaud Roger Cohen’s call for diaspora Jews to “be vociferous in their insistence that continued colonization of Palestinians in the West Bank” must end, I take issue with his opposition to “those who, ignoring sinister historical echoes, propose ostracizing Israeli academics and embrace an anti-Zionism that flirts with anti-Semitism.” The movement for boycott, divestment and sanctions as a means to press Israel to respect human rights and international law is very specific in not targeting individual Israeli academics, but rather institutions that collaborate with the Israeli colonial enterprise in the occupied Palestinian territories.The conflation of criticism of Israel, or Zionism, with anti-Semitism is the first refuge of the defenders of Israel right or wrong, and is belied by the active involvement of Jews in the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement.The writer is a member of the steering committee of American Jews for a Just Peace, Boston.'"
"'11-08-23,'1','WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is working to find ways to provide financial assistance to the rebels in Libya, officials said Monday, but the administration intends to maintain a freeze on $37 billion in Libyan assets until it is clear that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and his supporters no longer have access to the country’s financial system.President Obama, speaking in Vineyard Haven, Mass., said that the efforts to unfreeze and return the assets are part of the administration’s work with allies to prepare for a post-Qaddafi Libya. Last month, the United States joined more than 30 other countries in recognizing the Transitional National Council, the main opposition group, as Libya’s legitimate government.As the transition proceeds, Mr. Obama said, “our diplomats will work with the T.N.C. as they ensure that the institutions of the Libyan state are protected, and we will support them with the assets of the Qaddafi regime that were frozen earlier this year.”Several legal issues remain to be solved before the United States can release the assets it froze in February, money and property of the Libyan government and the Qaddafi family. Among the concerns is who will have access to the returned money and property, administration officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect diplomatic discussions.The administration must also consider United Nations sanctions, imposed a day after the American sanctions, the officials said. Officials at the United Nations were meeting Monday to discuss whether member countries could provide financial assistance to the transitional council without violating the asset freeze, as well as when to lift its sanctions.'"
"'11-08-23,'1','The monument is the first on the Mall and its adjoining memorial parks to honor an African-American, said Harry E. Johnson Sr., the president of the foundation in charge of erecting it. That made it an emotional occasion for many who came to see it.“This is important as a black American,” said Jerome McNeil, who was there on Monday taking photographs for his grandchildren. “It’s not just a statue, it’s a symbol of what we can do if we put our minds to it.”In 1996, Congress authorized the memorial’s establishment, and Alpha Phi Alpha, an African-American fraternity, set up a foundation to accomplish that. A Chinese sculptor, Lei Yixin, was selected to create the 30-foot sculpture, and ROMA Design Group, a company in San Francisco, designed the layout, which includes a bookstore, a wall with Dr. King’s quotations and nearly 200 cherry trees. The cost was $120 million, and organizers said they are still trying to raise the last $5 million.The design gave form to a line from Dr. King’s “Dream” speech — “With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope,” said Mr. Jackson. In the memorial, he noted, Dr. King is seen emerging from the stone of hope. The two towering mounds set slightly behind him, forming a sort of passageway to the statue, are mountains of despair.Some visitors said they did not like the fact that Dr. King was facing the Jefferson Memorial, not the Lincoln Memorial, but Mr. McNeil said he did not mind.“The only thing I don’t like is that I have to wait until 11 a.m. to get in,” he said.During a press briefing on Monday, Mr. Johnson chose to emphasize Dr. King’s focus on poverty and justice, steering away from questions about race. It was more a gesture of hope, he said, than a tactic of avoiding an inevitably difficult conversation.“We hope that in the next 100 years, that won’t be important,” he said, referring to race relations. He sought to emphasize universal themes. “What’s important is that you have food in your belly.”For Mr. Wilson, race is still very much present, but he did not expect the monument to do much to change that.“I don’t think this will resolve a lot of things,” he said. But, glancing up toward the statue of Dr. King, he added: “He definitely earned it.”'"
"'11-08-23,'1','“The fall of the Libyan regime is a victory for the Arab world,” said Samir Nashar, an opposition figure who took part in earlier acts of opposition to Mr. Assad.He recalled the scene Sunday night at a cafe in Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city and, until now, relatively quiescent. When the television announced the arrest of Seif al-Islam, Colonel Qaddafi’s son often described as the heir apparent, many in the mostly intellectual crowd of about 70 jumped out of the chairs, congratulated each other and exchanged kisses.“This is going to give a push to the Syrian people to continue,” he said.Some regional analysts suggested that it might also push Mr. Assad to continue with his crackdown. Of the three leaders toppled so far, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia is in exile in Saudi Arabia; an ailing Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is on trial, appearing in court in a humiliating cage; and Colonel Qaddafi and his son face war crimes charges that will complicate any exile. They all believed that they could quell the uprisings, until it was too late.On Sunday, Mr. Assad dismissed Western calls for his resignation as meaningless and signaled that a crackdown the United Nations now estimates has killed 2,200 people, 350 this month alone, would go on. That was the case Monday, when security forces killed three protesters in Homs, at the very time that a United Nations fact-finding team was visiting the city, Syria’s third largest, activists said.“The lesson next time is to leave early,” said Nadim Shehadi, a scholar at Chatham House, a research organization in London. Mr. Assad “needs to understand first that it’s over. He probably does but hasn’t shown it. Then he needs an exit strategy.”Since the beginning of the uprising, Mr. Assad’s leadership, having squandered its traditional support in a now-restive countryside, has relied almost solely on an argument that resonates in Syria, bordered by Iraq in the east and Lebanon in the west. Both neighbors fought civil wars that now serve as a basis for the Syrian government’s warning that only it can stave off chaos, even if Syria is in more tumult these days than any time in a generation.The aftermath in Libya may bolster or undermine the Syrian government’s contention. Colonel Qaddafi’s rule was remarkable for wiping out the very institutions that could unite the expansive North African country, and divides between clans, cities, regions and armed factions of rebels are unresolved. Despite the best efforts of the rebel leadership, Libya’s future remains more opaque than any other country in the Arab world, save Yemen, whose leader remains in Saudi Arabia after a hospital stay for wounds suffered in a bombing attack. But he has pledged to return.“The Libyans will pay the price for this war,” said Dia Azmeh, a 28-year-old resident of Damascus, the Syrian capital. “The Iraqi case will repeat itself.”Tunisia and Egypt stand as a romantic chapter of the Arab revolts. Libya’s uprising always seemed to have an asterisk, by virtue of NATO’s intervention. In a region with deep suspicions of foreign intentions, columnists, analysts and residents wondered what Libya’s rebels might owe the countries that intervened on their behalf. Others went further, suggesting that Colonel Qaddafi’s greatest crime was to surrender Libya to foreign states he once ostensibly defied.“The return of colonial powers dressed as liberators is more dangerous than anyone can imagine,” wrote Talal Salman, the editor of As-Safir, a leftist Lebanese newspaper. “What a miserable choice it is that the dictators impose on the people of the Arab world: Either they lose their voice and give up their rights in their countries and agree to live without dignity, or they live under colonialism that comes this time under new slogans of liberation, ending oppression and giving the land back to its people.”Fear of a new imperialism was an argument that Mr. Assad deployed on Sunday night. He never mentioned Libya in the interview. He did not have to.“No matter what you do, they will still tell you it is not enough,” he said. “They don’t want to introduce reforms because they want your country to remain backward and unable to progress. We will not allow any country to interfere in Syria’s decisions.”'"
"'11-08-23,'1','“There still is that component of our culture that very much likes to hold on to how things have been in the past,” he said. “That group, however, doesn’t represent the broader cross section of people who are good and honest but perhaps too naïve, perhaps too quiet, too complacent in looking at racism.”Although they lived just 15 miles apart and spent Sundays in church, Mr. Anderson, 48, and Mr. Dedmon, 19, could not have led more different lives.Mr. Dedmon liked his high school agriculture classes, but not as much as he loved hanging out with friends at a drive-in restaurant in the largely white suburban county where he lived, his friends say. He was the joker among a group for whom country , Bible verses, Bud Light and pickup trucks serve as the cultural markers.Mr. Anderson was a good country cook, a gifted gardener and always genial, his family said. He liked his job on the assembly line at the Nissan plant north of Jackson, where he had worked for about seven years.“If you met him, the first thing you were going to see was that grand piano smile,” said his eldest sister, Barbara Anderson Young.He made a point of taking care of old people and children and was helping his partner of 17 years, James Bradfield, raise the 4-year-old relative for whom Mr. Bradfield has legal guardianship. He sang tenor in the choir at the First Hyde Park Missionary Baptist Church and was so good “he’d have you falling out,” Mr. Bradfield, 44, said.And if friends or relatives were not dressed well enough for an event, he would tease them into changing into something nicer.No one is sure why Mr. Anderson was in the parking lot at the Metro Inn at 5 a.m. on June 26. He might have been at a party, Mr. Bradfield said. He was by his truck when two carloads of teenagers pulled off the interstate, according to prosecutors, who cited video from a motel security camera and statements from witnesses. Family members say he might have lost his keys, which have not been returned to them.The video shows some of the teenagers, who prosecutors said had been at a party earlier that night, running back and forth between their cars and Mr. Anderson. He was beaten repeatedly and robbed, the district attorney said. Items like a cellphone, a ring and his wallet were taken, according to interviews with family members.Then, one car drove off. But an F-250 pick-up — driven by Mr. Dedmon, the prosecutor said — pulled out of the parking lot and ran over Mr. Anderson as he staggered along the lot’s edge. The murder charge against Mr. Dedmon was raised to capital murder after District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith of Hinds County said he had evidence that Mr. Dedmon had robbed Mr. Anderson.Why the teenagers drove across the Pearl River to that tough section of Jackson is at the heart of the case, which will be presented to a grand jury in a few weeks as a racially motivated crime, Mr. Smith said. There was no indication that Mr. Anderson’s sexual orientation was a factor in the crime.John Rice, 18, is the only other person charged, his accusation one of simple assault. Mr. Smith and national civil rights groups believe they were seeking out a black person to harm. Witnesses told the police that one teenager yelled “white power” and that Mr. Dedmon, using a racial slur, later bragged about hitting Mr. Anderson.Morris Dees, founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, is working with the family and their lawyer, Winston J. Thompson III. Mr. Dees said his group was investigating whether some of the teenagers involved may have loose ties to a gang with white-supremacist leanings. Mr. Smith is taking a more cautious approach.“I don’t think there are aggressive gangs out there beating up black people,” Mr. Smith said. “I do think because of the political and economic structure and the re-engineering of society, it appears that certain parts of the country and Mississippi feel their culture is under attack.”The Rev. Brian Richardson of Castlewood Baptist Church in Brandon, Miss., who went to Mr. Anderson’s funeral and has become close to the family, believes Mr. Dedmon is a product of his upbringing and a culture that does not do enough to stop bullying.In an interview at his church in a nicely kept section of the county where Mr. Dedmon was raised, Mr. Richardson, who is white, said Mr. Dedmon had called his son, , 18, derogatory words for homosexual and mocked his friendship with black students when they were in high school together.Mr. Richardson said he had raised the issue with school officials, and once had to deal with the police when Mr. Dedmon and some other boys drove to the family home.The Richardsons point out that while racism is not unique to the Deep South, a deep streak of “us and them” exists.“There is a subgroup that takes the Southern country-boy thing to another level,” Jordan Richardson said.Mr. Dedmon’s lawyer did not respond to requests for an interview, but friends and family of some of the young people involved say the death was an accident.At the Sonic Drive-In in Rankin County, where redneck can be a term of pride among the young whites who hang out nightly, the young people do not see Mr. Anderson’s death as a hate crime. And they say they are not racists.“They don’t know how bad this hurts us,” said Shanna Brenemen, who attends Brandon High School and was close to Mr. Dedmon.Although a conversation with them might be laced with racial slurs, they point to black friends, including some running Tater Tots and limeades to the cars parked at the drive-in. The way people are portraying them is simply wrong, they said.“We’re just country, and whoever comes here, we welcome everybody,” said Mr. Dedmon’s younger sister, Tiffany, who will be a junior at Brandon High School. “This whole thing is getting blown out of proportion.”In a letter he sent her from his jail cell, Mr. Dedmon said he had committed himself to Jesus. He warned his sister away from trouble. “I want you to get in the Bible for real,” he wrote. “I don’t want you to end up like this. I thought drinking was fun but look where it got me. And seriously choose your friends wisely, Tiff. My so-called friends got me in here.”For Mr. Bradfield and Mr. Anderson’s siblings, the case is nothing but a hate crime. Jackson, for its part, has been slow to publicly address the case. Mayor Harvey Johnson, who is black, issued his first public statement on the matter last week. A public vigil was held on Aug. 14. A few hundred people marched from a nearby church to the motel parking lot and placed a wreath on the grassy spot near the curb where Mr. Anderson was hit.Perhaps interest in the case was muted, people close to the family and in the community said, because Mr. Anderson’s family had been slow to come forward.Although the family has created the James Craig Anderson Foundation for Racial Tolerance, they wanted to protect themselves from the media scrum and political opportunism that would surely come from a fist-pounding demand for justice, said Mr. Thompson, the lawyer. Mr. Anderson’s family and others wonder why only two of the seven teenagers were charged. And perhaps the toughest question of all: Could such a potent strain of racism exist in a city that has worked for decades to overcome it?“The Help,” a film that explores the relationships between black maids and their white employers in the 1960s, sold out several shows during its debut weekend here.People walking out of a theater an hour after the vigil last week said that although Jackson has changed in some ways, racism remains.“It’s still here,” said B. J. Quick, 50, a black man who saw the movie with his girlfriend, who is white. “It’s just under the surface more.”'"

But the main event will be Mr. Bernanke’s assessment Friday of the economy.Some Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to take some action — perhaps the lengthening in maturity of the bonds it holds — to depress longer-term interest rates.“We do not expect Bernanke in his Aug. 26 address to unilaterally announce the start of a bold new easing initiative,” Neal Soss, the chief economist at Credit Suisse, wrote in a report. “But we are looking for the chairman to hint strongly that further monetary policy accommodation is on its way.”It was in Jackson Hole last year that, faced with similar signs of an economic slowdown, Mr. Bernanke signaled a second round of large-scale bond purchases, or quantitative easing, called QE2 for short. After the program was announced, stocks rose about 28 percent between August and February this year.Still, many investors remain nervous about Europe and its debt problems. Even after Monday’s rise, the S.& P. 500 was down 17.4 percent from its recent peak on April 29, close to bear market territory, which is defined as a drop of 20 percent.In Europe, where losses in recent sessions have been as severe as in the United States, stocks were mixed. In Britain, the FTSE 100 closed up 1.1 percent. In Germany, the DAX was down 0.1 percent.Some analysts warned it would not take much to push the markets back into negative territory.“We’re just seeing a natural reaction after the sharp falls at the end of last week,” said Elisabeth Afseth, a fixed-income analyst at Evolution Securities in London. “But the situation is still very uncertain and fragile.”'"
"'11-08-23,'1','In a brief address from his vacation home on the island of , Mass., recognized both the historic nature of the rebels’ accomplishment and the troubles they face. Saying that the future of Libya “is in the hands of its people,” he cautioned that “there will be huge challenges ahead.” He pledged that the would seek to help Libya in its attempt to establish democracy.There was speculation that Colonel Qaddafi may have retreated to his fortified compound, Bab al-Aziziya, in Tripoli, which rebels said was heavily defended by snipers and tanks.Mahmud Nacua, a Libyan rebel representative in , told reporters that the insurgents would “look under every stone” for Colonel Qaddafi so that he could be brought to trial. This was presumably a reference to charges by the in The Hague, which in June issued arrest warrants for Colonel Qaddafi, Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi and Libya’s intelligence chief, Abdullah Senussi, accusing them of crimes against humanity.The struggle to a impose a new order on the capital presents a crucial test of the rebel leadership’s many pledges to replace Colonel Qaddafi’s bizarre autocracy with the democratic rule of law, and it could have consequences across the country and throughout the Arab world.Unlike the swift and largely peaceful revolutions in and , the Libyan insurrection was the first revolt of the Arab Spring to devolve into a protracted armed struggle, and at times threatened to descend into a civil war of factions and tribes.A rebel failure to deliver on their promises of justice and reconciliation here in the capital could spur Qaddafi loyalists around Libya to fight on. And an ugly outcome here might discourage strong foreign support for democracy movements elsewhere.For now, governments throughout the West and the welcomed the rebels’ victory and pledged to assist them in the transition. The said Monday that it had begun planning for a post-Qaddafi era, and ’s foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said he would fly to Benghazi on Tuesday to meet with the rebel leader, Mustafa Abdel-Jalil, the semiofficial Anatolian Agency reported.Egypt formally recognized the rebel Libyan government on Monday, calling the the “new regime.” Mohammed Amr, Egypt’s foreign minister, said that the council would take over the Libyan Embassy in , and would assume Libya’s seat on the , which is based in Cairo.said Monday that it wanted to call a top-level meeting in next week of the so-called Contact Group of nations supporting the Libyan rebels: the United States, , several Arab states, the and the Arab League. But the French foreign minister, Alain Juppé, said, “It’s up to the Libyans and the Libyans alone to choose their future and to build a new Libya, which will be a democratic Libya.”At the United Nations, , the secretary general, said he was trying to organize a meeting by Thursday or Friday with regional actors, including the and the Arab League, to help smooth the transition to a new government. He said the United Nations was prepared to help with any request from the Libyans, from writing a new constitution to coordinating humanitarian assistance, he said.Some rebels speculated that certain tribes who had benefited from Qaddafi patronage, like the Warfalla and the Warshafana, remained hostile to the rebels.The tenuous nature of the rebels’ grip on the capital was clear at the makeshift headquarters of the “Tripoli Brigade,” described as a hand-picked team assigned to secure the city.Emhemmed Ghula, who identified himself as a deputy chief of the Tripoli underground, was telling journalists the city was “90 percent under control,” aside from some number of snipers. “They have some roofs, but they can’t move in the streets.”Moments later, one such sniper atop a tall building nearby began firing down on the courtyard and windows of the headquarters, housed in a former women’s school. Then as the fighters huddled against the walls, two groups of armed men in trucks — one mounted with artillery — attacked the front gate. Artillery shells burst through the compound.The attackers’ aim and organization suggested the gunmen were experienced Qaddafi militiamen. But the fighters inside showed little discipline. Instead of firing back at the start of the fight, a dozen armed men near the gate raced to the floor of a small anteroom. There was no one either giving or following orders.“It is nothing, just a few guys,” one rebel officer said to a group of journalists, playing down the significance of what became a three-hour firefight. “But for you guys, it is safer inside.”After a conference behind closed doors, the Tripoli Brigade assigned to police the city ultimately decided to relocate its headquarters to safer ground. “Call , please! 911!” one rebel joked when he saw a visitor’s satellite phone.At roughly the same time, as many as 10 injured people were brought to a makeshift rebel clinic in a house in the city, according to several foreign journalists visiting at the time. (Tripoli Central Hospital is in an area that remains controlled by Qaddafi loyalists.) It is unclear whether any of them were injured at the Tripoli Brigade headquarters or in other fighting in the city. But moments later, the journalists said, a gunfight broke out in front of the clinic as well.'"

"'11-08-24,'1','But during recent settlement negotiations with a judge, which a reporter observed, lawyers for the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation said they would not offer $1 million. So high a price, they said, would have a “huge impact on the office” by encouraging demands for similar amounts.While it was impossible to determine how many such cases are winding through the system, and requests for such numbers were not answered, future payouts could be large if $1 million was established as the norm.The Bronx mother, Vivian Acevedo, 24, who works in a clothing store, fought back tears recently as she said she had turned down the $500,000 offer. She had held the body of her baby boy in the hospital, she said.“I want to go to trial and finish this the right way,” she said, “because I don’t ever want this to happen to someone else.”Matthew Gaier, a personal-injury lawyer who is not involved in either of the cases, said New York’s new stillbirth suits were “trying to cull the essence of the suffering the person has experienced: What is a mother’s misery worth?”American courts have long resisted awards for nonfinancial injuries like emotional suffering, because fixing a value is subjective. Some legislatures have set limits on such awards. But there have been exceptions, and for years many states, including , and , allowed mothers to sue claiming stillbirths were caused by malpractice.New York courts long prohibited such suits unless the mother was physically injured. But in its 2004 ruling, the state’s Court of Appeals overruled precedent and said it was unfair to leave a devastated woman who lost a baby with no legal recourse, even if she suffered no physical harm.The case at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center that ended with the $1 million award, from 1997, was among the first to go to trial. The Brooklyn mother, Lucia Ferreira, now 39, said in an interview that at the hospital she had felt she did not matter as her spiraled toward its horrifying end.“The case helped me have a voice,” she said. “If it wasn’t for that, things would have been pushed under the rug.”Her lawyer, Robert F. Danzi, said the trial centered on “an epidemic of error” that included failing to properly examine Ms. Ferreira at all on her final visit before the stillbirth.Wyckoff’s general counsel, David N. Hoffman, said in an interview that Ms. Ferreira “perhaps should have been handled differently,” adding that it was unclear whether the hospital or a doctor was at fault.The $1 million verdict was in 2005. The hospital’s appeals lasted until February, and the award stood.Appeals in injury cases can be ghoulish. Over time, the process sets ranges of values — severed legs are “worth” one sum, paraplegia another — as courts approve some verdicts and slash others as excessive.Because the lawyers agreed that Ms. Ferreira’s case was the first stillbirth suit to reach a New York appeals court since the law was changed, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, the battle was critical. Lawyers for the hospital argued that the $1 million award for past suffering had been “fueled by compassion and sympathy” and was “markedly excessive.”With no precedents in New York, the hospital lawyers said, appeals judges should compare the $1 million with awards for other types of emotional injuries and with stillbirth cases in other states.In a New York case of a 16-year-old who had been chased and bitten by two dogs, the hospital’s lawyers pointed out, an appeals court had approved $200,000 for suffering. In a case where the mother had been “wanting to die” after a stillbirth, the award had been $200,000; in , just $100,000.Ms. Ferreira’s appeals lawyer, Arnold E. DiJoseph III, offered different computations. The hospital, he argued, had offered irrelevant comparisons with the stillbirth awards in distant places and with dog-bite cases. he argued. “And we are dealing with apples.”Mr. DiJoseph’s idea of comparable cases: $3 million for the suffering of a woman who had been mistakenly shot and $1 million for a passenger’s nine minutes of terror in a plane before it crashed, killing her.When the Brooklyn appeals court settled on $1 million for Ms. Ferreira in February, it found that the amount was “reasonable compensation” for her past anguish.In June in Bronx Supreme Court, Mr. Korek met with lawyers for Lincoln in Ms. Acevedo’s case. He made his argument that the Brooklyn ruling had set a $1 million benchmark.Mr. Korek said later that one goal was to put a high price on medical carelessness that could lead to heartache. “The only way to do that,” he said, “is not to take cheap money so they can write it off as a cost of doing business.”Officials at the Health and Hospitals Corporation declined to be interviewed. During the negotiations, their lawyers said the Bronx court and the appeals court in that reviews Bronx cases would not necessarily agree that the suffering of one mother was worth the same as that of another.The hospital lawyers suggested they might eventually increase their offer to $750,000. But they told Mr. Korek they were willing to take the chance that $1 million was not the price of a stillbirth in the Bronx. “We will see you in court,” one of the hospital’s lawyers said.'"

"'11-08-24,'1','But beyond such potential options, the announcement of a clear monetary policy road map seems unlikely. Fed speeches are constructed to cause minimal market excitement — either good or bad — and there are reasons to think Mr. Bernanke’s speech may be especially noncommittal.First, only two weeks ago the board’s Federal Open Market Committee, which sets benchmarks on interest rates, severely dimmed its economic forecasts and took the unusual step of pledging to keep short-term interest rates near zero through at least mid-2013. It seems unlikely that the Fed would make major news so soon after that announcement, economists say.“I don’t think the picture has changed all that much from two weeks ago,” said Paul Dales, senior economist at Capital Economics. “Suggesting more is in the pipeline already would smack of panic.”Moreover, Mr. Bernanke could not unilaterally make a major policy change; he would need to seek approval from other Fed officials. Such consensus has become more challenging, since the composition of voting members on the Federal Open Market Committee has changed since last year.Last year there was one steady dissenter, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City president, Thomas M. Hoenig. Mr. Hoenig consistently voted against keeping short-term interest rates near zero for so long, and voted against the second round of quantitative easing begun by the Fed last November.The voting members of the committee rotate each year, and now there is not one but three strongly hawkish voices: Narayana Kocherlakota, Charles I. Plosser and Richard W. Fisher, who are the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of , and , respectively. These three voted against the Aug. 9 announcement keeping short-term interest rates low through mid-2013, and so seem unlikely to endorse further easing measures.There is also mounting political pressure from outside the Fed — on Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign trail — against expanding the central bank’s balance sheet.Another reason Mr. Bernanke may be especially reluctant to signal commitment to further monetary stimulus is that inflation has picked up. Monetary stimulus, after all, generally increases inflation since it pumps more money into the economy and chases prices higher.Last year, when economists gathered at Jackson Hole, the most recent consumer price index report had shown prices to have risen over the previous year by 1.2 percent. With inflation so low — and below the Fed’s target rate of inflation — many economists worried that the country could descend into a deflationary spiral akin to the one seen during , and more recently in . With the threat of , another round of quantitative easing seemed prudent, or at least less risky.Today, though, consumer prices are 3.6 percent higher than a year ago, softening the case for further monetary stimulus. The Fed has a dual mandate, maximum employment and stable prices; even if Fed policy makers believe further easing might help employment, they may be reluctant to compromise the other half of their mandate.The final reason Mr. Bernanke may be reluctant to go further is that it is not clear how powerful more monetary stimulus would be. And it is not just anti-Fed types like the presidential candidate Rick Perry who doubt the usefulness of more easing; Ph.D. economists are skeptical too.“At this point you’re really pushing on a string,” said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight.Economists are still debating the effectiveness of the quantitative easing program begun last November, raising questions about the potency of yet more asset purchases.Quantitative easing is supposed to help lending (and thereby growth) by pushing down long-term interest rates, which are already quite low. It is not clear that lowering them further would do much to encourage lending, especially since many companies do not see a need to borrow primarily because demand is so weak, and not because is expensive.The other way that quantitative easing is intended to help spur growth is by encouraging in riskier assets, like , because the return is so low on long-term Treasuries. If investors flee to these assets — as they did last year, following the Jackson Hole speech — that could raise the price of these assets, causing consumers to feel richer and so more comfortable with spending.Commodity prices are higher today than they were a year ago, though, and policy makers may worry about pushing them even further up. If energy and rise again, that would actually discourage consumers from spending.For these reasons, many economists say they believe that, should the Fed engage in more stimulus, it will be unlikely to select quantitative easing as its weapon. But the other options, too, present their own hurdles, and many are still untested.In the end, economists say, any additional Fed action may depend on what seems most politically palatable, even though the central bank is officially an independent entity. And that logic seems to point to changing the maturity of the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet.'"
"'11-08-24,'1','In March, another license scam aimed at immigrants from South resulted in four arrests. That was the sixth fraudulent-license arrest in seven months, state officials said, with others involving illegal immigrants from , , and .By issuing licenses to foreigners, a policy adopted in 2003, state officials had sought to reduce the problem of unlicensed and uninsured drivers on the road and increase cooperation between immigrants and law enforcement personnel. The extent to which the policy has worked is in dispute as data show that New Mexico continues to have one of the largest percentages of uninsured motorists in the country.Ms. Martinez, a Republican who campaigned on the licensing issue, tried but failed in her initial months in office to push an end to the licensing of illegal immigrants through the Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats. She says she will try again in September at a special session she has called.In the meantime, her administration has sent letters to 10,000 citizens of foreign countries across New Mexico in an effort to gauge the extent of the fraud problem.Those who received the letters were told that they must appear at a motor vehicles office in Albuquerque within 30 days to prove to an auditor that they actually reside in the state or face cancellation of their licenses.About a third of the 10,000 letters were returned to the state, which the governor’s office says shows a serious fraud problem. Of the 2,000 or so face-to-face meetings that have been held, about half the people have been able to prove they are in-state residents, state officials say.The governor’s office has insisted that the audit was not intended to facilitate deporting illegal immigrants, but fear still remains high.“I’m afraid to go,” said Luz, a mother of three from who received one of the letters but has not yet responded. “Will they deport me once I get there? Or will I get stopped on the way?”Even with licenses, illegal immigrants say they must tread carefully in the state. They are aware of the location of the various federal checkpoints set up on New Mexican roads and steer well away from them.After hearing that many who received the letters were afraid to travel to Albuquerque, the governor’s office agreed to schedule meetings as well in , in the southern part of the state.Still, the letters have been criticized by immigrant rights groups. “This program doesn’t prove anything,” said Marcela Diaz, an activist with Somos Un Pueblo Unido. “People move around and change their addresses. We knew that already. This is just blatantly inconveniencing those who followed the rules.”On Wednesday, four Democratic legislators and Marisela Morales, a legal permanent resident who received one of the letters, intend to file suit in state court accusing the governor’s office of acting without legislative authority in issuing the letters and also of discriminating against people on the basis of their legal status.The suit will ask a judge to order Demesia Padilla, who as the governor’s secretary of taxation and revenue oversees the motor vehicles division, to end the verification program immediately. The legal team behind the suit includes , who was chief legal counsel to former Gov. , who approved the current licensing policy. David H. Urias, a civil rights lawyer, and Martha Gomez of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, are also involved.New Mexico has traditionally had a welcoming approach toward illegal immigrants, especially compared with , its neighbor to the west. But calls for a tougher approach have been growing, which is reflected by Ms. Martinez’s victory in November as well as the heated nature of the driver’s license debate.Gerald Ortiz y Pino, a Democratic state senator and a plaintiff in the suit, said there might be a need for tighter controls in licensing, although he dismissed as exaggerated the talk of terrorists and drug bosses getting licenses. Mr. Ortiz y Pino said revoking licenses for illegal immigrants would end up prompting more people to live in the shadows.“One of the tactics the governor has used is to encourage people to send us angry, vituperative letters questioning our patriotism and fealty to the U.S.,” he said. “That leaves every one very raw.”Ms. Martinez said that the vast majority of residents were in her corner on ending the policy and that legislators needed to get that message. “It’s important to me because it’s important to New Mexico,” she said.The issue has far less urgency in Washington State, where officials have tightened residency requirements to cut down on fraud while still allowing illegal immigrants to receive licenses. Gov. Chris Gregoire, a Democrat, said she would sign a bill restricting licenses to legal residents if the Legislature were to pass one.issues special licenses to people who cannot prove their citizenship. These licenses are good only for driving but not for other uses, like boarding airplanes. That dual-license approach has not won support in New Mexico.As the standoff continues, some of those who can legally drive now but may be in danger of losing their licenses are contemplating how their lives might change.“How will I take my children to school?” asked Luz, who did not want her full name used given the continuing debate. “How can I go to to get medicine? If you take away our licenses, you take away our lives.”'"
"'11-08-24,'1','On the line, in addition to $1.44 million for this week’s winner, and a spot in all four of next year’s major championships for the 30 players who make it to the playoff finale at the Tour Championship, is a $10 million cash bonus to the winner of the FedEx Cup.With that much at stake, the 18th at Plainfield becomes the essence of a risk-reward hole. Although drivable par-4 holes shorter than 300 yards are not unique on the tour, PGA officials said it was believed to be without precedent for a finishing hole.“It will be interesting to see how guys in different positions play the hole,” said Hanse, whose extensive portfolio of well-received course redesigns includes the TPC of Boston, the site of the Deutsche. “If you’re leading, you might play it one way; if you’re trying to make up a couple shots, play it another.“I think it will be fascinating to watch the guys, to see what their mind-set is based on their position when they come to that hole, and also to see how the decision-making differs through the week.”The decision-making on Tuesday was pretty much seeing if you could bust a driver up over the oak trees on the left and hit the green — a shot that most caddies had pegged as 288 yards total to the front right edge — 279 yards with 9 yards added for elevation. Andrés Romero of Argentina, ranked 62nd on the FedEx points list, who is a longer hitter than generally thought, smashed a penetrating drive that barely fell to the right at the end of its flight, into the green.Romero grinned broadly and said something in Spanish to his caddie about the yardage as the two fist-bumped after the drive.Jhonattan Vegas of Venezuela followed Romero with a high-cut that landed in the rough to the right of the green. Chris Kirk, a rookie who is 33rd in Cup points, lashed a couple of drives left of the green, as did Aaron Baddeley, the Australian who won at Riviera Country Club this year and is 22nd in the FedEx Cup.With a large gallery in tow, Keegan Bradley, the St. John’s product and P.G.A. Championship winner, came to the tee and blasted a towering drive that looked, from the tee, perfect. It wound up in a grass finger in the left bunker, a position from which Bradley pitched to about 8 feet from the hole.“I think it’s great,” Bradley said. “I think 70 percent of the field’s going to have a chance to go at it and drive it. I hate when they do drivable par 4s that are like an island green. You can legitimately go at this thing.”Bradley’s line off the tee: driver over the trees right at the green.“Right at it,” he enthused. “The cool thing is you can definitely make a 2 there if you hit a good drive.”Other than the obvious risks of missing the deep, heavily-sloping green short and left in a deep bunker near the false front or missing it long into an area of long pampas grass to the right, are the perils of finding oneself in deep rough close to one of the hole placements near the edges of the green.“You just don’t want to short-side yourself on this course,” Bradley said. “If you do, you could have 50 feet, or even worse, coming back.”This is what risk-reward is all about. There will be plenty of both on display at the finishing hole at Plainfield this week.'"
"'11-08-24,'1','Allied targeting experts and fighter pilots do not have that option with the rapidly shifting battle lines in block-by-block combat carried on by fighters on both sides dressed in civilian clothing.“It could be difficult, because the use of air power, to a large degree, is negated when you get into this kind of urban warfare,” Senator John McCain said Tuesday on “The Early Show” on CBS. “It’s hard to identify targets and hard to be effective.  But I don’t think there’s any doubt of the eventual outcome.”This is hardly the first time that the United States or NATO has dealt with the challenge of rooting out foes in urban environments. American troops, in particular, learned many lessons combating the insurgency in Baghdad. While the United States and NATO do not have major armies on the ground in Libya, the allies have passed on these lessons to the rebel fighters. Applying them, they think, will allow rebels who had been dependent on strong NATO air support for many of their past gains to drive Qaddafi loyalists out of Tripoli completely.A NATO military official said Tuesday, for instance, that British and French commandos were on the ground with the rebels in Tripoli offering “fairly extensive” help. “They’re doing a lot of coordination with some of the air assets that we have to bring specific targeting on the remnants of the pro-Qaddafi regime,” the official said, describing a traditional role of commandos in calling in airstrikes on precise targets, or instructing the rebels on how to do it themselves.The military official said he did not know if Central Intelligence Agency operatives in Libya were also working with the rebels in Tripoli, but he said “they certainly should be.”Outside Tripoli, fighting continued on Tuesday in government strongholds like Surt and Sabha, and Colonel Lavoie said allied warplanes would continue to use precision weapons to enforce the United Nations mandate to protect civilians. “It might not be on the front line,” he said. “It might be in the approaches of Tripoli if there are movements of vehicles.”NATO dropped little ordnance in the last 24 hours — the French bombed some small mobile rocket launchers in Brega — and the United States dropped none.“This is not a situation where there’s a whole lot of kinetic targeting taking place from the air,” an American defense official said. “There is an abundance of caution being exercised when you’re working in a confined urban environment. Operations are obviously moving in favor of the rebels every day, so you don’t want to do things that would be counterproductive to that progress.”Pentagon officials said that by Tuesday the rebels controlled large portions of Tripoli, but they said there remained pockets where Qaddafi forces continued to fight back. “It’s still a pretty unclear picture, but for the most part the rebels appear to have control of most areas,” the senior defense official said.A senior NATO diplomat said that by late Tuesday there were four or five main pockets of resistance from fighters loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and that the limitations on allied air power put more of an onus on rebel fighters to combat loyalist troops still fighting throughout the capital.Moreover, NATO officials acknowledged they did not have reliable estimates on the number of soldiers fighting a last-ditch campaign to back Colonel Qaddafi, which makes it hard to judge when the rebels might establish firm control over the capital.The official also said that Colonel Qaddafi appeared not to be in his compound, stormed by the rebels on Tuesday, but that he remained in Libya although “probably” not in Tripoli.The official said that a compound wall that was broken down so the rebels could enter the area appeared to have been blasted through on the ground and was not caused by an airstrike.Pentagon officials said that the United States continued to fly Predator drones over Tripoli and had sent more in recent weeks at the request of NATO. The United States also continued to provide refueling planes and additional surveillance aircraft.One Libya expert cautioned against the notion that NATO and rebel forces may face a protracted urban conflict, saying that many remaining Libyan troops had hastily retreated into the capital in recent days; had not prepared elaborate defenses; are short on fuel, water and ammunition; and have little experience fighting an urban guerrilla war.“They don’t have the practice of defending a city or carrying out an insurgency, and soldier for soldier they’re being outfought by the rebels,” said Frederic Wehrey, a senior policy analyst with the RAND Corporation who follows Libya closely.'"

"'11-08-24,'1','Of Mr. Leiber’s many lyrics for Presley, “Jailhouse Rock” stands out as especially clever, right down to its sly intimation of prison sex: “Number 47 said to Number 3, ‘You’re the cutest jailbird I ever did see.’ ” The prisoners are having such great time rocking and rolling that two of them, Shifty Henry and Bugsy, decide they’re having too much fun to make a break for it.Leiber and Stoller’s slangy vignettes for the Coasters captured teenage exuberance with the same acute ear for slang that Chuck Berry had. The youth chafing under his mother’s discipline in “Yakety Yak” could be any 1950s kid ordered to “Take out the papers and the trash/Or you don’t get no spendin’ cash.”As one of the first independent producing teams in the late 1950s, Leiber and Stoller changed the sound of pop records with the Drifters’ 1959 hit “There Goes My Baby,” belted by Ben E. King, one of several collaborators on the song. For this, the most operatic rock ’n’ roll ballad of its time, they added strings. The hit had a profound influence on their protégé Phil Spector and was a prototype of his wall-of-sound style, as applied to the Righteous Brothers’ hits.It was Mr. King who in 1961 helped give Leiber and Stoller their perfect moment with “Stand By Me,” that infinitely adaptable, inspirational ballad for all seasons, with a Brazilian baion beat, adapted from an older gospel song Mr. King had brought to the songwriters. This plea (or prayer) for loyalty and support in fearful times transcends genre and is so strong and direct that it resists all attempts to mash it into kitsch.But as Leiber and Stoller well knew, you can’t be a teenager forever, and woe to the songwriter who tries to fake it. Their abrupt detour in the late ’60s to a world-weary, European-style art song with “Is That All There Is?” that Peggy Lee recorded after Marlene Dietrich turned it down, didn’t endear them to rock critics. “Mirrors,” their 1975 song cycle for Lee, found them writing in a full-blown post-Brecht-Weill mode, but scant attention was paid.The narrator of its opening song, “Ready to Begin Again,” is certainly not young:When my teeth are rinsed in a glass by my bed,and my hair lies somewhere in a drawer,you know, the world doesn’t seemlike a very nice place,not a very nice place anymoreThus begins this powerful and mordant expression of resilience. Once her teeth are secure and her hair in place, the narrator, “looking fresh and bright I trust,” insists that she is “ready to begin again, as everybody must.”The song is neither sexy nor hip, but it is truthful and gets under your skin in a slightly creepy way. What more can we ask of art?'"
"'11-08-24,'1','The number of banks on the government’s list of institutions most at risk for failure fell in the second quarter, the first drop since before the financial crisis began.Twenty-three lenders came off the list of so-called problem banks during the second quarter, bringing the total to 865, according to data released Tuesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Not all the troubled lenders will inevitably fail, but the F.D.I.C. considers them most at risk, making the quarterly update one of the clearest measures of the banking industry’s health.It was the first decrease in the number of problem banks since the third quarter of 2006.The report also contained other signs of improvement. There were 48 bank failures in the first half of 2011, far fewer than the 86 failures in the first six months of 2010. Last year’s total of 157 collapsed banks was the highest since the last severe recession, in the early 1990s.And the F.D.I.C. insurance fund that protects the nation’s depositors showed a surplus for the first time in two years. It stood at $3.9 billion, compared with a negative $1 billion balance at the end of the first quarter.Still, the magnitude of problem banks — roughly one of every nine lenders — remains relatively high. And the number could rise again if the economy suffered another downturn, a prospect that seems increasingly likely amid all the grim data that has surfaced in the weeks since the list was compiled at the end of the June.'"
"'11-08-24,'1','In recent weeks, the stock market in the United States has been swept with turmoil, swinging from gains to losses in increments of hundreds of points. Analysts have attributed as influences recent soft economic data, downward revisions of growth estimates, the impact of the S.& P. credit rating downgrade on United States debt, and growing uncertainty over the euro zone sovereign debt crisis.Many analysts say investors are waiting for policy makers to lay out plans for their response to the European sovereign debt issues and the economic headwinds in the United States.One development occurred Aug. 9, when the Federal Reserve made a rare promise to hold short-term interest rates near zero through at least the middle of 2013, and said it would continue to consider other measures to support the economy. Some analysts said investors were now trading on that possibility before Mr. Bernanke’s speech at the central bank’s symposium in Jackson Hole.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial, said the markets appeared to have interpreted recent weak economic data as presenting an opportunity for the Fed chairman to clarify his options and expand on the Aug. 9 statement.“Right now expectations are going up,” Ms. Krosby said. “What they want to hear from him is we want to be there.”Still, with the recent unpredictability, many analysts questioned whether the bargain-hunting and surge in stocks would last. The main indexes are still down significantly for the month. The Dow, for instance, is still nearly 8 percent lower in August and more than 3 percent for the year.“One thing about these markets right now is you get oversold conditions the same way you get overbought conditions,” Ms. Krosby said.Stocks had been trading solidly higher for most of the day but lost momentum over a sudden shock of a different kind: shortly after the East Coast earthquake around 2 p.m., the Dow lost about 50 points, but traders shook off their jitters quickly.Markets in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region also rose as new economic data helped support a feeling that those economies were not as badly off as believed. Major European stock markets were up about 1 percent, after a survey of purchasing managers’ expectations for output in the euro area showed no change, at a nearly two-year low.In addition, a survey of manufacturers in China showed factory activity had probably contracted slightly in August. The findings underpin the widely held perception that the giant Chinese economy is growing at a more moderate, yet still robust, pace than many other places.Expectations grew that the fighting in Libya could last longer than expected, setting back hope for a recovery of oil output there. Oil settled more than 1 percent higher at $85.44.The energy index on the S.& P. was up more than 4.5 percent. Shares of Halliburton rose 7.8 percent, to $40.20, and Exxon Mobil shares rose nearly 5 percent, to $73.66.Tuesday heralded both good and bad reports. Sales of new homes fell for the fourth consecutive month in July, according to Census Bureau data, showing a bigger-than-forecast drop. And a Federal Reserve survey of manufacturing activity in the Richmond, Va., region showed its overall index declined in August, along with optimism about future activity.Gary R. Thayer, the chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said he believed that the markets rose anyway because it was likely they had discounted, or priced in, the already weak economy.“What we are seeing is a little bit of a relief rally, and for a lot of very negative news,” Mr. Thayer said. “Traders were starting to buy after a few days of consolidation, and it started to attract other people into the market. A lot of people are starting to look at later in the week, when we could hear positive news from the Fed.”'"

"'11-08-25,'0','After the earthquake in Haiti destroyed much of the country’s higher-education infrastructure, the University of the People decided to set up three computer centers there, inviting English-speaking students from nearby tent cities to come and work for four hours a day.“They don’t have electricity, they don’t have computers, there are university students who have to carry water on their head from another mountain,” said Shai Reshef, the Israeli entrepreneur who spent $1 million to create the free university two years ago. “They come in two shifts, for four hours a day, to study. Their need was to the point that we began a feeding program.”Mr. Reshef sees his project as a way to use the Internet to bring higher education to poor students around the world. It uses free software and has enlisted hundreds of volunteer professors — more, he said, than he has been able to use — to teach 10-week online courses to 1,000 students from more than 100 countries. Starting this fall, students will have to pay $10 to $50 for admission.In each class, 20 to 40 students are assigned weekly reading material and are required to post their responses and comment on others’ responses. The course materials are deliberately low-tech, with no audio or video, so that students can use them anywhere.“It’s based on peer learning, so just like at the gym, what you get out of it depends on what you put in,” said Shay David, a software entrepreneur with a Ph.D. from Cornell who taught introductory computer programming.For Joe Jean, a 23-year-old Haitian from a poor family, the University of the People was the only option for college. “When I heard it was tuition-free, I didn’t think it would be very good,” said Mr. Jean, who hopes to be a computer entrepreneur. “But I’ve learned a lot, and I like the way the instructors support the students and the students support each other.”'"

"'11-08-25,'0','Exactly how a refinancing plan might work is still under discussion. It is unclear, for example, whether people who are delinquent on their mortgages would be eligible or whether lenders would administer it. Federal officials have consistently overestimated the number of households that would be helped by their various housing assistance programs.A working group of housing experts across several federal agencies could recommend one or both proposals, or come up with new ones. Or it might decide to do nothing.Investors may suspect a plan is in the works. Fannie and Freddie mortgage bonds had been trading well above their face value because so few people were refinancing, keeping returns on the bonds high. But those bond prices dropped sharply this week.Administration discussions about housing proposals have taken on added urgency this summer because the housing market is continuing to deteriorate. On Wednesday, the government said that prices of homes with government-backed mortgages fell 5.9 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the biggest decline since 2009. More than one in five homeowners with mortgages owe more than their homes are worth. Some analysts are now predicting waves of foreclosures and a continuing slide in home prices.There is not much time to help the market before the 2012 election, and given Congressional resistance to other types of stimulus, housing may be the only economic fix in reach. Federal programs to assist homeowners have been regarded as ineffective so far, and they are complex.“We are looking at trying to encourage more participation in all of the programs, including those that help with refinancing,” said Phyllis Caldwell, who oversees housing policy at the .Some economists say that with housing prices and interest rates at affordable levels, only fear is keeping consumers out of the market. Frank E. Nothaft, the chief economist at Freddie Mac, said the federal action could instill confidence.“It almost seems to me you want to have some type of announcement or policy, program or something from the federal government that provides that clear signal that we are here supporting the housing market and this is indeed a good time to really consider buying,” Mr. Nothaft said.The refinancing idea has been around since at least 2008, but proponents say the recent drop in interest rates to below 4 percent may breathe new life into the plan.“This is the best stimulus out there because it doesn’t increase the deficit, it accomplishes monetary policy, and it reduces defaults in housing,”  said Christopher J. Mayer, an economist at the Columbia Business School. “So I think this is low-hanging fruit.” Mr. Mayer and a colleague, Glenn Hubbard,  who was chairman of the under President , proposed an early version of the plan.The idea is appealing because it would not necessarily require Congressional action. It also would not tap any of the $45.6 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Funds that was set aside to help struggling homeowners. Only $22.9 billion of that pool has been spent or pledged so far, and fewer than 1.7 million loans have been modified under federal programs. But Andrea Risotto, a Treasury spokeswoman, said whatever was left would be used to reduce the federal deficit.A mass refinancing plan would spread the benefits of the Federal Reserve’s most important economic policy response, low interest rates, to more people. As of July, an estimated $2.4 trillion in mortgages backed by Fannie and Freddie carried interest rates of 4.5 percent or higher.The two prevailing ideas, lowering rates on mortgages and converting houses owned by government entities like Freddie and Fannie into rentals and other uses, have somewhat different pockets of support. Investment firms would like to participate in the rental program, especially if the government lends them money to participate. For the most part, prefer the refinancing plan. There are many high-ranking proponents of the refinancing plan. Joseph Tracy, a senior adviser to the chairman of the New York Federal Reserve, has circulated a presentation in support of the plan. And Richard B. Berner, who recently joined the Treasury Department as counselor to Secretary , argued in favor of a blanket refinancing in his previous job as chief economist for . The proponents say the plan carries little risk because the mortgages are already guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They also say it makes those loans less likely to go into default and ultimately foreclosure.But the plan has some drawbacks. Some officials fear that promoting mass refinancings today could spook investors and make borrowing more expensive, for both homeowners and the federal government, in the future.The government has already encouraged some refinancing through the and through Fannie and Freddie, but participation is limited. For example, the Home Affordable Refinance Program excludes homeowners who owe more than 125 percent of the value of their house. To spur more refinancing, the government may decide to encourage Fannie and Freddie to lift such restrictions.But government officials cautioned that Fannie and Freddie do not do the administration’s bidding, even though they are essentially owned by taxpayers. Edward J. DeMarco, who oversees the companies as acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has voiced concerns about any plan that might cost the companies money, according to the two people briefed on the discussions. “F.H.F.A. remains open to all ideas that provide needed assistance to borrowers” while minimizing the cost to taxpayers, Mr. DeMarco said in a written statement.A broader criticism of a refinancing expansion is that it would not do enough to address the two main drivers of foreclosures: homes worth less than their mortgages, and a sudden loss of income, like unemployment. American homeowners currently owe some $700 billion more than their homes are worth.'"
"'11-08-25,'0','At Pixar, with a solid leadership team in place, the studio never missed a beat, and it continued to generate one critically acclaimed and commercially successful hit after another, including “Finding Nemo” and “Wall-E,” long after Mr. Jobs had gone back to Apple.It is by no means certain, analysts say, that things will go that smoothly for Apple. Mr. Jobs, they note, was far more in the background at Pixar, where creative decisions were guided by John Lasseter. Pixar was sold to Disney for $7.4 billion in 2006.At Apple, Mr. Jobs’s influence is far more direct. He makes final decisions on product design, if not in detail. No immediate changes, analysts say, will likely be discernible.“The good news for Apple is that the product road map in this industry is pretty much in place two and three years out,” said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “So 80 percent to 90 percent of what would happen in that time would be the same, even without Steve.”“The real challenge for Apple,” Mr. Yoffie continued, “will be what happens beyond that road map. Apple is going to need a new leader with a new way of recreating and managing the business in the future.”Mr. Jobs’s hand-picked successor, Timothy Cook, who has been the company’s chief operating officer, has guided the company impressively during Mr. Jobs’s medical leaves. But his greatest skill is as an operations expert rather than a product-design team leader — Mr. Jobs’s particular talent.At Apple, Mr. Jobs has been the ultimate arbiter on products. For example, three iPhone prototypes were completed over the course of a year. The first two failed to meet Mr. Jobs’s exacting standards. The third prototype got his nod, and the iPhone shipped in June 2007.His design decisions, Mr. Jobs explained, were shaped by his understanding of both technology and popular culture. His own study and intuition, not focus groups, were his guide. When a reporter asked what market research went into the iPad, Mr. Jobs replied: “None. It’s not the consumers’ job to know what they want.”The notion of “taste” — he uses the word frequently — looms large in Mr. Jobs’s business philosophy. His has been honed by a breadth of experience and by the popular culture of his time. When he graduated from high school in Cupertino, Calif., in 1972, he said, “the very strong scent of the 1960s was still there.” He attended Reed College, a progressive liberal arts school in Portland, Ore., but dropped out after a semester.When discussing Silicon Valley’s lasting contributions to humanity, he mentioned the invention of the microchip and “The Whole Earth Catalog,” a kind of hippie Wikipedia, in the same breath.Great products, Mr. Jobs once explained, were a triumph of taste, of “trying to expose yourself to the best things humans have done and then trying to bring those things into what you are doing.”Mr. Yoffie said Mr. Jobs “had a unique combination of visionary creativity and decisiveness,” adding: “No one will replace him.”'"
"'11-08-25,'0','“The big thing about Steve Jobs is not his genius or his charisma but his extraordinary risk-taking,” said Alan Deutschman, who wrote a biography of Mr. Jobs. “Apple has been so innovative because Jobs takes major risks, which is rare in corporate America. He doesn’t market-test anything. It’s all his own judgment and perfectionism and gut.”Mr. Cook, an expert in logistics, has been instrumental in locking up contracts in advance for critical parts in the company’s devices. It has had the effect of securing favorable prices, keeping Apple’s profit margins high. But it also has prevented rival companies from producing competing products at significantly lower prices.While Mr. Cook is well respected in the industry, he is little known outside of it. Analysts and Silicon Valley experts said new Apple products were in the pipeline for the next few years, but the company’s success beyond that was already being debated.Tim Bajarin, president of the technology research firm Creative Strategies, said the news about Mr. Jobs was “a shock because it’s abrupt.” But Mr. Bajarin said that “while there’s definitely concern for Steve as a person,” he had little concern for the company.“Steve has built a very deep bench of managers, including the leadership of Tim Cook, who clearly understands Steve’s vision, goals and direction,” said Mr. Bajarin, who has followed Apple for 30 years.Others were not so sure.“You could make the case that Steve has injected so much of his DNA into Apple that Apple will continue,” said Guy Kawasaki, who was an Apple executive in the late 1980s. “Or you can make the case that without Steve, Apple will flounder. But you cannot make the case that Apple without Steve Jobs will be better. Hard to conceive of that.”The technology world has never been short of strong-willed leaders (think Bill Gates at Microsoft or Larry Ellison at Oracle). But even in this select group, Mr. Jobs was noted for the control he exerted and the loyalty he commanded. Without him, his devoted team might soon fracture.“I think the key question is whether the Apple team will continue to work as effectively as a collaborative without the single person to rely on for the final decision,” said Charles Golvin, a Forrester Research analyst.Mr. Cook, 50, joined Apple in 1998. He was promoted to chief operating officer in 2007, overseeing the day-to-day operations.  Wall Street had long assumed the soft-spoken Mr. Cook, who was raised in Alabama and is an Auburn University graduate, would be the successor to Mr. Jobs.  While Mr. Jobs convalesced, Apple thrived with the continuing rise in iPhone sales and huge growth in the iPad, the dominant tablet computer.The company and Mr. Jobs had been criticized in the past for revealing little information about his health to investors. The news of Mr. Jobs’s resignation came after the market closed Wednesday. In after-hours trading, the stock fell 5 percent.The early years of Apple long ago passed into legend: the two young hippie-ish founders, Mr. Jobs and Steve Wozniak; the introduction of the first Macintosh computer in 1984, which stretched the boundaries of what these devices could do; Mr. Jobs’s abrupt exit the next year in a power struggle. But it was his return to Apple in 1996 that started a winning streak that raised the company from the near dead to its current position.More than 314 million iPods, 129 million iPhones and 29 million iPads have been sold, according to A.M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Bernstein Research. This summer, Apple briefly exceeded Exxon Mobil as the most valuable United States company.Apple does not announce or even telegraph its product pipeline. But there has been strong indication that it is very close to revealing a new iPhone, which would probably include a more powerful processor to handle the expanding multimedia demands.The new iPhone is also likely to be thinner and lighter, as every new version has been since the original’s release in 2007. A higher-resolution rear camera has also been expected. Another possibility is more powerful voice recognition, borne out of Apple’s purchase of Siri, a small voice recognition company, in April 2010.Twitter, the instant messaging service, filled with an outpouring of grief and gratitude Wednesday night. The few ill-spirited comments or wisecracks were met with immediate retorts.“Steve Jobs is the greatest leader our industry has ever known,” wrote Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com. “It’s the end of an era.”“Funny how much emotion you can feel about a stranger,” wrote Susan Orlean, the author. “And yet every phone call I make, every time I’m on a computer, he’s part of it.”“Very sad news about Steve Jobs at $AAPL,” wrote Jim Cramer, the CNBC host. “He is America’s greatest industrialist. Perhaps the greatest ever.”Andy Baio, a tech entrepreneur in Portland, Ore., may have put it most directly and effectively: “We’ll miss you, Steve.”'"
"'11-08-25,'0','The former commander of the U.S.S. Enterprise who produced raunchy videos aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier can remain in the Navy despite a finding of misconduct, a Navy panel ruled Wednesday. The former commander, Capt. Owen P. Honors, sighed with relief after the board of inquiry read its decision, then embraced his wife as months of uncertainty about his career largely came to a close. The board was deciding whether to recommend to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus that Captain Honors should be kicked out of the Navy after nearly three decades of service because of the videos. Among other things, the videos included simulated same-sex shower scenes, anti-gay slurs and references to prostitution in foreign ports. Captain Honors also faced the possibility of losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement benefits if he had been forced out under a different pay grade. He was removed as the carrier’s top officer in January, days before a scheduled deployment, after the videos were leaked to the news media. “O.P. is pleased,” his lawyer, Charles Gittins, told reporters after the hearing. “Retention is a big deal.

"'11-08-25,'0','A controversy had begun to build, bringing the vociferous passions of sports fans into conflict with the financial logic of a multinational company. For Adidas, it became a lesson in the risks of associating a corporate brand with a national obsession.It is not uncommon for companies to charge different rates for the same product in different countries, but Mike Lee, a senior marketing lecturer at Auckland University who specializes in consumer attitudes toward brands, said the Adidas situation was different because the All Blacks were seen by many in New Zealand as a sacrosanct national treasure.A few days after the initial outcry, the furor escalated when news outlets reported that Adidas had told Internet retailers selling to international markets to remove New Zealand from their delivery options.“At that point I think the whole thing took sort of a nasty turn,” Dr. Lee said. “It went from simply a question of economics and costs to an ethical issue of corporate hegemony.”Adidas has since apologized for that decision and withdrawn the instruction, saying it had intended only to protect New Zealand retailers.Still, the level of national outrage rose further. Adidas met with retailers but refused to reduce its wholesale price. So the retailers took action themselves.The country’s largest sporting goods chain, Rebel Sport, announced on Aug. 9 that it would cut the retail price in its shops to 170 New Zealand dollars, leaving itself only a “very, very slim” margin, according to its managing director, Rod Duke.The price reduction, also carried out by some smaller retailers, was welcomed by many fans, and Rebel Sport’s stock of the jerseys has nearly sold out, Mr. Duke said. He said he thought that although his company was bearing the financial burden of the price cut, Adidas would suffer in the long term from damage to its brand, which would hurt future sales.“We’ve had a number of customers come into the stores, throw Adidas products on the floor and say, ‘Look, you might as well burn this,’ ” Mr. Duke said.The value of Adidas’s sponsorship deal for the All Blacks shirts has never been made public. When it was signed in 2008, The National Business Review reported that it was similar in size to the company’s contract with the German soccer club Bayern Munich and Nike’s deal with the Inter Milan soccer club. The newspaper said that would place the contract’s value at 21 million to 28 million New Zealand dollars a year.Juli Clausen, a spokeswoman for the New Zealand Rugby Union, declined to disclose the size of Adidas’s investment in the sport in New Zealand, citing commercial sensitivity, but said the 11-year deal was worth “hundreds of millions of dollars.”Despite the discontent among fans and retailers, the controversy does not appear to have hurt Adidas’s revenue in the short term. The company said the jerseys had been selling well, with “very strong” orders from New Zealand retailers.However, Mr. Duke said that many customers had said they were planning to cover up the Adidas logos on their All Blacks jerseys.One disgruntled fan, Reece Palmer, appeared on “Campbell Live,” a current-affairs television program, handing his Adidas shirt to a reporter who symbolically returned it to the company’s head office.Even the prime minister, John Key, stepped into the fracas. “I’d like to believe that New Zealand consumers get a fair deal and that they’re not taken advantage of just because they’re here in New Zealand,” Mr. Key said.After being accused of trying to avoid the issue, Adidas representatives gave television interviews, apologizing for the “distraction” and insisting that the prices were in line with similar products. The representatives also emphasized the company’s investment in rugby in New Zealand, but their arguments did not quell public anger.Adidas said it had canceled a corporate event scheduled for Aug. 11 in light of the public relations predicament and removed branding from six company vehicles after staff members received threats and gestures from members of the public.The company apologized for letting down fans and acknowledged that it had “underestimated public attention on accessibility to fans of the jersey in a World Cup year,” Mr. Huggett, the country manager for New Zealand, said in an e-mail response to questions.“We poorly handled the outpouring of concern from fans about the price,” he said. “We will have to win back the trust of fans that were angered by our behavior, but we are committed to doing that and our support to the All Blacks and to sport in New Zealand in general will not be compromised.”Dr. Lee, the marketing lecturer, said the remaining question was how much long-term damage this would do to the brand and its sales.“Part of the brand personality now is probably seen as slightly aloof and arrogant, detached from the local market which it supposedly supports,” he said, although he added that, in time, people might forget the furor.Adidas has sponsored the All Blacks since 1999, and in 2008 the company signed a deal with the New Zealand Rugby Union to remain the principal sponsor until 2019.“By then, I don’t think anyone will even remember this, to be honest,” Dr. Lee said.'"

It was down $104.20 to $1,754.10 an ounce for the August contract. The metal had been used as a safe haven in recent market volatility and risen to record nominal highs, and some analysts saw Wednesday’s decline as a technical reversal.Jeffrey Nichols, the managing director of the American Precious Metals Advisors, said that the recent run-up in gold had been “so large in magnitude and fast” that “to have a significant correction here really makes sense.”“Some of the rally was a function of speculative demand by short-term-oriented institutional traders,” he said, adding that the consequence would be for them to sell, take profits and move on to other instruments. But he said that the long-term economic outlook was basically unchanged.On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that overall orders for durable goods rose 4 percent last month, the biggest increase since March. But a category that tracks business investment plans fell 1.5 percent, the biggest drop in six months.Analysts noted that, considering recent talk of another recession, it would take more than one economic data point to convince investors that the economy was on solid footing. But Abigail Huffman, director of research at Russell Investments, added that some of Wednesday’s early gains may have been a result of the durable goods numbers and the market’s momentum from the previous day.Stocks in Europe rose as some investors bet that the Federal Reserve would act soon to strengthen the economy and that the sharp stock market drops earlier this month were overdone.The Euro Stoxx 50 index closed 1.8 percent higher in Europe, while Germany’s DAX index increased 2.7 percent and France’s CAC 40 index rose 1.8 percent.Stock markets in Asia slipped as investors took in the downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service of its rating on Japanese government debt.The Nikkei 225-stock index ended down 1.1 percent at 8,629.61 points.

"'11-08-26,'1','A 21-member Secure Communities task force was established in June by John Morton, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency running the program, in response to resistance from states and cities. Mr. Morton assigned the group to examine narrow issues concerning the program’s impact that had drawn complaints from immigrant leaders.But the task force soon decided to hold hearings, concluding they needed to hear directly about the groundswell of discontent stirred by the program. The task force includes local law enforcement officers, immigration lawyers and representatives of immigration agents’ unions.In a letter Thursday, more than 160 immigrant rights organizations said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was a “rogue agency,” and they called on the members of the task force to resign.Under Secure Communities, the fingerprints of everyone booked into jail are checked against the F.B.I.’s criminal databases — long a routine police practice — and also against Department of Homeland Security databases, which record immigration violations.“This program at its heart is about serious offenders,” Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum and the task force’s chairman, said Thursday. “I don’t think there is any question that a number of people being caught up in the system don’t fit the criteria of serious offender.”He said the hearings had revealed many episodes when detention of immigrants who were not dangerous criminals had led to mistrust of the local police, even though immigration enforcement is handled by federal authorities.Mr. Wexler said the hearings had shown that “every time someone who is not considered a serious offender is picked up and put into deportation proceedings, it undermines the credibility of the program.”Most people who spoke at the hearings opposed the program, Mr. Wexler said, but many local law enforcement and government officials had expressed support. The task force will issue a final report in September.In Arlington, about 150 protesters marched to the hearing on the campus of George Mason University, chanting, “Hey, Obama, don’t deport my mama.”During the hearing, Maria Bolaños, 28, an immigrant from El Salvador, approached an immigration official sitting in the audience to confront him directly. She said she had been detained after calling the police following a fight with her partner. She has been charged with illegal sale of phone cards, she said, a charge she denied.""I wouldn’t call the police again, and I know many people that wouldn’t do the same,” said Ms. Bolaños, who spoke in Spanish through an interpreter.Paul Showalter, 51, an American who spoke in favor of the program, said a young illegal immigrant had been murdered in his Arlington neighborhood by another immigrant. “So I, as a taxpayer in the State of Virginia, get to pay to house that individual for 20 years to life,” said Mr. Showalter. “One young man is dead, another is behind bars, because no one checked.”A senior official from the immigration agency at the hearing said they had been surprised by the strong criticism. “In spite of what we’ve been trying to do to get the word out about what Secure Communities is, we clearly are not making ourselves clear,” said Gary Mead, a top official in charge of deportations. He said that the local police generally avoid arresting victims or witnesses of crimes.“If you don’t get arrested, you don’t get your fingerprints submitted to the F.B.I., you will never become a subject of Secure Communities,” Mr. Mead said.'"

"'11-08-26,'1','But at a certain point, if Apple wants to retain or even extend its $350 billion stock market valuation, the Apple executives must channel Mr. Jobs and think up a new product — like the iPod, iPhone or iPad — that is in a different category altogether. They will have to see the future and make it real.Silicon Valley is founded on this notion, that kids in a garage can build something that will topple the existing order. Indeed, that is Apple’s own story. But it is much harder to take huge risks when you’re no longer in a garage but running a 50,000-employee company.Mr. Cook knows this. At Apple, he once said, “we take risks knowing that risk will sometimes result in failure, but without the possibility of failure there is no possibility of success.”Now he will have the chance — probably many chances — to take those risks. Many who watch Apple closely say they think he is up to the challenge.“I would lean toward an optimistic view,” said Michael Maccoby, a management consultant and author of the book “The Productive Narcissist: The Promise and Peril of Visionary Leadership.” “Steve Jobs is a hard act to follow but not an impossible one. I see so many positive factors here. Apple has created a platform, a technology, patents, processes. It’s created the Apple stores. It’s created attitudes among customers.”Still, genius on the Jobs level is not exactly plentiful.“Steve could build something beautiful and take all of the fright out of it. What the early Macs did was say a computer is just a tool, anyone can use it,” said Jay Elliot, an early Apple executive.“He’s leaving Apple with a long-term vision that his successors will implement,” said Mr. Elliot, who has written a book on Mr. Jobs’s leadership style. “But in three or five years they’re going to have to find some other visionaries.”Investors seem not to be looking that far ahead. Apple’s stock, which slid in after-hours trading Wednesday when the news was first released, fell only modestly Thursday even as the overall market stumbled, closing down 0.7 percent, at $373.72. They may be drawing comfort from the fact that Mr. Jobs is still around as chairman. He was on the Apple campus Wednesday for a board meeting, according to a person with knowledge of his whereabouts.Mr. Cook, with his soft-spoken demeanor, is at an advantage because his personality is the opposite of Mr. Jobs’s, who was mercurial, said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford. They would otherwise be compared, and Mr. Cook would inevitably be described as “Steve Light.”“It’s better to be different than a second-rate version of what the last person was,” Mr. Pfeffer said. He compared the situation to that of Southwest Airlines, whose colorful co-founder, Herbert D. Kelleher, eventually stepped down and was replaced by a more sedate executive, Gary C. Kelly.Apple, continuing its tradition of being close-mouthed, did not make Mr. Cook, 50, available for an interview. In a commencement address at Auburn University last year, Mr. Cook, who graduated from the school, described his decision to join Apple in 1998 as the most significant of his life and one that allowed him to engage in “truly meaningful work.”Joining Apple was not obvious at the time, he said, because of its precarious state, which made many people think it was on the road to bankruptcy.A chief executive whom he did not name told Mr. Cook that he’d be a fool to leave Compaq, where he was vice president of corporate materials. His ultimate decision was not an obvious one, he conceded, adding that engineers are taught to make decisions analytically and without emotion.But Mr. Cook, who speaks with remnants of a Southern drawl, said: “There are times in all of our lives when a reliance on gut or intuition just seems more appropriate — when a particular course of action just feels right.”Compaq, which seemed so solid to that friend issuing the warning, no longer exists. In 2002 it was bought by Hewlett-Packard — itself a troubled company these days. There are no sure things in technology for longer than about a month.Fortunately for Mr. Cook, Apple has a number of top executives in place who can help him carry on the Jobs legacy — as long as they stick around.“Steve was smart enough to surround himself with very strong talent to do things that he wasn’t as good at or to execute the vision he had,” said Shaw Wu, an analyst with Sterne Agee. “That team is intact. The challenge is to keep it in place.”Jonathan Ive, Apple’s senior vice president of design, plays a critical role at the company in perfecting the look and feel of its products. British by birth, he joined Apple in 1996 and has led the team that designed the iPhone, iPad and iMac.“He is responsible for everything down to the look and feel,” Mr. Wu said. “Steve helped him sculpt it to the end product.”Philip W. Schiller, senior vice president of marketing, is another important executive who helped lift Apple from near bankruptcy in the late 1990s. Apple has turned its image and sales around during his 14-year tenure.One top Apple executive has already announced his departure. Ron Johnson, who has been in charge of Apple’s thriving retail stores, said in June that he would be leaving to join J. C. Penney as its chief executive.The spotlight for better or worse will be on Mr. Cook and his willingness to take a risk on what could be the company’s next big thing.“The path between the iPad and iPhone can carry them a long way,” said A.M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “But at the same time, you have to ask, is there something beyond the iPhone? Is it in the living room or a blend of the PC and the tablet? Do they have that next defining great product?”'"
"'11-08-26,'1','Pitched somewhere between after-hours cable soft-core and an overambitious student art film, “Stripped Down” is bad in so many ways I can’t help but feel a slightly tender affection for it.The film’s writer and director, Elana Krausz, stars as Lily, the unhappily aging wife of a low-rent entrepreneur who owns the strip joint where she also works. A retired practitioner of the topless arts, Lily now acts as manager and den mother to the younger girls: a hard-drinking, hot mess played by Lisa Arturo, whose breasts-forward filmography includes no less than three characters named Candy; and a giggling ingénue played by Bre Blair, best remembered as one of the heroines in the 1995 film “The Baby-Sitter’s Club.” (Kids grow up so slowly these days).Ian Ziering enters the fray as a no-nonsense I.R.S. agent sent to audit the books — a duty he officiates entirely from the showroom floor. Defying social realism and internal logic, his Francis drives a Jaguar but brown-bags his lunch. “Bologna on white,” Lily accurately guesses, in a moment meant to reveal her deep grasp of human nature. “You can tell a lot about a person by the kind of sandwich he eats.”Though Ms. Krausz’s feminist spin on the sexploitation genre is not nearly as revisionist as she seems to think, her direction is almost accidentally avant-garde. Obliquely focalized flashbacks and dream sequences push an already confused chronology into the art-house territory of Alain Resnais. The onslaught of optical effects and deafeningly expressive foley suggest a voyage through a pinball machine piloted by the director Tony Scott.The more-is-less formalism culminates in a mind-grinding final twist that’s at once groaningly familiar and gobsmackingly out of left field. Bizarrely baroque, “Stripped Down” is anything but.Written and directed by Elana Krausz; director of photography, Zoran Poppvic; edited by Aaron I. Yamamoto; music by Erik Godal and Mark Fontana; production design by Deren Abram; produced by Ms. Krausz, Bobby Leigh, Steven Adams, Christo Dimassis and Alex Norberg; released by Cinema Epoch. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes. This film is not rated.'"
"'11-08-26,'1','The road was littered with the detritus of the fall of a dictator that was long in the making but never felt imminent until the coastal town of Zawiyah fell a week ago. Tanks incinerated by NATO airstrikes testified to already forgotten skirmishes. An abandoned armored truck drew the curious and the awe-struck. A mosque was burned, its white walls scorched by flames. So were carcasses of vehicles, an ambulance among them.Checkpoints and barricades looked like their equivalents in all the other uprisings that have swept the Arab world this year, in Hama in Syria, Sitra in Bahrain, and Cairo. There was utility in everything — chairs, bricks, traffic pylons and scrap metal. At one, an orange trash can read simply, “The house of the brother leader,” Colonel Qaddafi’s preferred title.Town after town declared its freedom: Yafran, Nalut and so on.“Let Qaddafi leave us, and let us go on,” said Fathi Omar, a father of seven who was returning to Nallout after four months away. “That would be his gift to us. After 40 years, that’s all we ask from him.”Mr. Omar predicted 8 months, maybe 10, before life returned to normal, as far as normal goes in a country that has been subjected to one of the world’s most mercurial brands of rule.The task before Libya’s rebel leadership is admittedly huge, building a state in a country where one man embodied authority. There is no army, as there was in Egypt and Tunisia. There is foreign intervention, but no occupying power. The title of the Qaddafi state still adorns some buildings: the Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab State of the Masses.The road offered a window on the challenges that will almost certainly proliferate. One traveler demanded that Tamazight, the tongue of the Berber minority, be made an official language. Another spoke of women’s rights. Others offered a litany of the demands heard so often these days in the Arab revolts: a constitution, pluralism, civil society, individual rights, and some way, somehow, to prevent the return of dictatorship.A message broadcast on a Libyan radio station pleaded against revenge killings of those loyal to Colonel Qaddafi, who have yet to surrender in Sabha, Surt and parts of Tripoli.“They are Libyan like you,” the message said.From Zintan on, the streets of towns and cities had the look and feel of Baghdad at its most anarchic. Salam Salah, a 15-year-old, carted a brand-new assault rifle, fixed with a bayonet. The scars of fighting mingled with the graffiti of the battle. “We are coming for you,” one slogan read. The new offices of authority felt makeshift and hasty.“It’s still a mess,” said Col. Jumaa Ibrahim, rushing from room to room in one of those places, which still bore a map of the Arab world Colonel Qaddafi thought he should lead. “I can’t say anything about the future. I’m so busy, I can’t even think about tomorrow.”The parallels with Iraq went only so far, though.The fall of Saddam Hussein never had the narrative of a revolution, with all the slogans attributed to Omar Mukhtar, the Libyan resistance leader hanged in 1931. It had little of the jubilation captured in the smiles of children and the elderly, as they passed trucks ferrying opposition fighters flashing V-for-victory signs. Nor did Iraq have the sense of solidarity seen here that offers perhaps the greatest hope for an Arab world saddled with the smaller identities of sect, ethnicity, clan and history.“The Street of the Martyrs of Benghazi,” read a wall in Zintan, 600 miles away.He stood in a circle of traffic, blowing his whistle relentlessly, as he motioned for cars to pass, some of them still smeared with mud for camouflage.His perch was a soapbox of sorts, and he seized the moment to deliver a poem.“We are Misurata!” he shouted, his voice booming. For a moment, it was audible over the horns. “We are the strength of Zintan! Get out of them, you coward!”The road beyond barreled through squat settlements of cinderblock, their shoddiness as damning an indictment as any of a state that squandered its resources. It passed bulldozers trying to remove battle-tested barriers of sand, and volunteers cleaning streets of accumulating bags of trash. A few shoveled garbage with pieces of cardboard.The graffiti was still fresh in the capital. In the citadel of his power, Colonel Qaddafi had become the tyrant, the Guy with the Crazy Hair and, in a play on his own words, the biggest rat. One of his attempts at propaganda remained standing. “Forty-one years of permanent joy,” the sign read. Someone had crossed out the number, scrawling an alternative in red.'"
"'11-08-26,'1','Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and friends busted New York City’s ghosts. Prosecutors like Rudolph W. Giuliani busted the mob, or tried to. Trustbusters, gangbusters, chartbusters, mythbusters — pretty much everything the city harbors has been busted by someone. But rats continue to thrive.Now, though, comes “Rat Busters NYC,” the latest addition to the growing genre of animal-control television. This new reality show, which has its premiere on Friday on Animal Planet, will no doubt be eagerly watched by anyone who has ever seen a rat in a subway tunnel or on the street or in the kitchen cupboard (and especially anyone who lives on the Upper East Side, where rats are apparently out of control at the moment). Can Jimmy Tallman and Michael Morales of Magic Exterminating, the show’s main rat killers, do what no one has been able to do since Colonial days and rid the city of these vermin? And, just as important, can they entertain us in the process?Well, yes and no. Quite a number of rats buy the farm, or whatever it is that rats buy, at the hands of the Magic men in the opening episode. But these two guys are not telegenic or charismatic enough to make rodent removal interesting.They lack the chemistry that can make such shows work, and Mr. Tallman, who is supposed to be providing comic relief with his sarcastic asides, instead comes across like a past-his-prime Don Rickles. Both he and Mr. Morales make the reality-genre mistake (now common) of trying too hard to be TV stars. Just kill the rats, boys; if we deem you worthy of stardom, we’ll bestow it on you.With the frontmen not very compelling, it falls to the vermin to try to grab our interest. Mr. Tallman and Mr. Morales deal with more than rats; the premiere actually begins with a bedbug call in Brooklyn. They do get to some rats later — lots of rats at a convenience store in Queens — but here’s the thing: Bedbugs are old news, and rats are so familiar that they don’t hold much mystery.'"
"'11-08-26,'1','Novak Djokovic enters his first major as a No. 1 seed with a few concerns. The first is a shoulder injury that forced him to retire in his last tournament, in the final Sunday against Andy Murray in Mason, Ohio. The second is a potential semifinal match against Roger Federer, who has fallen to No. 3. Federer handed Djokovic his first loss of the season in the French Open semifinals.But Djokovic insists that he will be ready for the Open, that the shoulder injury is merely inflammation resulting from a long and arduous season. His season has been overwhelmingly successful, the retirement against Murray counting as only his second loss. He has 59 match victories and 2 titles in Slams: the Australian Open and Wimbledon.“I mean, it’s kind of expected,” Djokovic said. “I’ve played so many matches this year. Considering the schedule that is very busy in tennis, it’s kind of normal to expect that at some stage you are exhausted.“I am confident that I can recover and be ready.”Federer has a worrisome streak of his own. He has lost early in two warm-up hardcourts tournaments and he has not won a major this year. He is in danger of going a year without a major title for the first time since 2002.The other side of the men’s bracket is led by No. 2 Rafael Nadal, the defending champion, and No. 4 Murray, who John McEnroe has said will have his best chance here to win his first Grand Slam title.The first round begins Monday. Among the intriguing first-round matches on the men’s side, the American teenager Ryan Harrison will face No. 27 Marin Cilic, a talented but inconsistent player from Croatia. And the winner could face the up-and-coming 18-year-old Bernard Tomic of Australia in the second round.No. 28 John Isner will play Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in the first round (Isner beat Baghdatis on Thursday in the quarterfinals of the Winston-Salem Open), and potentially the American Robby Ginepri in the second and No. 6 Robin Soderling of Sweden in the third. Andy Roddick, who has fallen to No. 21, will play the American Michael Russell in the first round and could play 18-year-old Jack Sock of Lincoln, Neb., in the second.'"
"'11-08-26,'1','But those who travel to Queens to see the tennis in person have it pretty good as well, at least if they take the time and effort to look beyond the food offered at the stadium itself, or to send a letter to The New York Times asking me to do so for them. And many did. I am letting your letter stand in for all, in part because in matters of U.S. Open eating, my answer remains the same, regardless of sender, regardless of dietary restriction, regardless of party size.It is: Take the subway to the Open, stop often along the way and witness northern Queens in all of its leafy, delicious glory.From Manhattan on the 7 train, the first stop into the borough is Vernon Boulevard and Jackson Avenue, in Long Island City. You could hop off there and have a decent bistro meal at Tournesol, or pizza and red-sauce pasta at tough old Manetta’s, almost under the Pulaski Bridge. These are neighborhood gems.Newer (and therefore of great interest to the food-obsessed) is the John Brown Smokehouse on 37th Avenue, where you can load up on burnt ends and beans, brisket and spare ribs, before returning your body to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for movement east.But we have time, no? (No need to watch people volley when you can eat.) Sadly, the M. Wells diner near the Hunters Point stop is shuttering at the end of the month. But you might head on to Sunnyside for oxtail terrine, fried chicken or chili shrimp at Daniel Yi’s well-regarded neighborhood spot Salt & Fat, near the 40th Street stop, or to Woodside for the crazy flavors and long lines of SriPraPhai Thai on 39th Avenue, near the 69th Street station.There is also Jackson Heights, where the Jackson Diner, on 74th Street north of the train tracks there, offers an extensive, jolly and relatively low-cost tour through the foods of the Indian subcontinent. It doesn’t look like much. But lamb vindaloo can do much to improve your worldview.Still on the train? Exit at Corona Plaza, particularly if you are traveling in search of lunch. Leo’s Latticini is just down 104th Street from the station. A hero at this Queens landmark delivers a doctoral thesis in Italian-American pride and excellence. And you can take it with you if you like. Then visit Tortilleria Nixtamal, a few steps farther south on 47th Avenue, for tacos and Coronas (and in Corona, to boot).Alternatively, you might follow the lead of the invaluable food sleuth Joe DiStefano, who edits the World’s Fare blog for Edible Queens. In an interview he advised continuing past the Open stop at Willets Point to end up at Main Street in Flushing, where nearby Asian riches await. I wrote recently about the Grand Restaurant in the New World Mall there, but Mr. DiStefano advised a trip to the food court below it, with stalls hawking regional Chinese specialties, as well as food from Vietnam and Korea, and a hamburger outfit that has a sideline in Peruvian rotisserie chicken.As ever, his advice proved solid and fair, down to a terrific Taiwanese shaved-ice-cotton-candy mango dessert from Snopo. (You can find World’s Fare at ediblecommunities.com/queens.)Now return to the train and head to Willets Point: game, set, match, championship.Culinary Points in Queens for Hungry Tennis Fans Before the Matches.

"'11-08-26,'1','New claims for unemployment benefits in the United States rose more than expected last week, lifted by striking Verizon Communications workers, a government report showed on Thursday.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 417,000, the Labor Department said. Analysts see 400,000 as the level where the economy is creating net new jobs.Striking Verizon workers filed 8,500 claims for jobless benefits last week, after submitting 12,500 applications the previous week, which covered the period for the August nonfarm payrolls survey.That suggests that the strike would reduce the monthly payroll count, which will be reported on Sept. 2. The strike against Verizon ended on Monday.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be 405,000 last week.

"'11-08-26,'1','Like prisoners, they pass the time playing cards and checkers, which are made out of water bottle caps. Packs of are consumed daily. “We’re not doing good,” said one of the workers, who, like many others interviewed at the site, asked that his name not be disclosed because he feared for his safety.In the mornings, the workers are awakened by the noise of rats running through the building. Their only hot meal is delivered every day around 3 p.m. by the International Organization for Migration. At night, some workers sleep outside because it is cooler. All of them listen for rockets and mortar shells aimed at the Green Zone, the highly protected area that houses the Embassy and many important Iraqi government buildings and that is a favorite target of insurgents. Unlike the embassy and the government buildings, the construction site does not have duck-and-cover bunkers.Several weeks ago, one of the workers tried to commit suicide.The annual meeting of the Arab League, which Iraqi leaders hoped would showcase the progress they claimed their country had made, was postponed because, with the Arab world boiling, many leaders did not want to leave their countries, in part out of fear they would never return.For the laborers, the work initially sounded so appealing that they took out to pay recruiters in their native countries for the jobs. They were told that they would make $2,500 a month and live in an air-conditioned room with electricity and an Internet connection. But when they arrived, the company in charge of the construction told them they would be paid $1,500 a month and gave them the abandoned building to live in. The company was supposed to pay the workers on a monthly basis and give them proper visas, but neither of those things happened.In April, the laborers were told to stop working because the money for the project had dried up. The construction, they were told, would resume in a few days.But that did not happen, either.The laborers do not want to leave without being paid the money they say they are owed. But even if they wanted to leave, they could not, because they have little money and could be arrested if Iraqi officials found they were living in the country without visas. So they have waited.“We’re not leaving until they shoot us,” one of the workers said, repeating the vow to hold out until getting the money owed them. A few seconds later, he added, “But we don’t even have an exit.”It is unclear who owes the laborers their wages. One company, the Salar Group, signed the initial multimillion-dollar contract with the minister of foreign affairs to build the villas. Then Salar apparently subcontracted the work to another company, Noblehaus. But Fawzi Abdullah, the owner of Noblehaus, said in a telephone interview that his company had nothing to do with construction and that he had only sold Salar the right to use his company’s name because Salar was not registered in .Mr. Fawzi said that the Iraqi government shut down the construction project because Salar was behind schedule and not using proper materials. He said that Salar did not specialize in construction projects and that he did not know why the government gave it the contract. “Those workers have nothing to do with all of that,” he said. “Salar should resolve the issue and pay the workers their salaries.”An employee for Salar told a reporter on Wednesday that he should call back to speak with the head of the company. Three subsequent phone calls to the company were not answered.Employees from one of the companies offered the workers $1,000 each to leave. But they refused, according to the laborers, saying that it would not cover their costs to get home and was far less than they were owed.The laborers said those employees told them that Iraqi security forces would come the next morning and drop those who did not accept the money outside the Green Zone, where they were likely to be killed. The migration organization pressured the security forces to stand down. Ultimately, they never showed up.“The company that contracted with the employees lied to them about their salaries and the working conditions,” said Livia Styp-Rekowska, a program officer for the International Organization for Migration. “You can say it’s trafficking for labor exploitation. It’s quite close to human trafficking.” By the beginning of August, the migration group began providing them with aid.Ms. Styp-Rekowska said that four of the workers — one had damaged his kidneys by drinking nonpotable water — had to be taken to the compound to see a doctor.“When we took them to the U.N. compound, they looked unsettled,” she said, adding that she asked them, “Is everything O.K.?” She said they relied, “ ‘It’s cool. To be in an air-conditioned room is a treat.’ ”She said the migration group had been pressuring the Iraqi government to force the companies to pay the workers the money due them — about $285,000 total — and provide them with proper visas, so they can return home. Ms. Styp-Rekowska said the labor minister planned to raise the issue before Prime Minister at a meeting on Thursday.One of the laborers said his young children back in did not understand his quandary.“They ask their mother, ‘Where’s my father?’ ” he said. “I tell them, ‘Just wait. Just wait.’ ”'"

"'11-08-27,'0','The latest swings came Friday when the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 2 percent in the morning, but climbed back up in the afternoon to finish 1.5 percent higher, as investors digested remarks by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, that left the door open to further support for the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average swung about 363 points during the day, closing up 1.2 percent, to 11,284.54.Across United States stock markets — including the big electronic exchanges like Nasdaq, BATS and Direct Edge — trading volumes so far in the latest quarter are 17 percent ahead of the same period last year, according to figures from Credit Suisse. Volumes have been hitting levels almost double what they normally are at this usually quiet time of year, Mr. Mecane said.Markets have been sent wild this summer amid a number of exceptional events, like the showdown over the debt ceiling in Washington, the downgrade by the credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s of the United States’ long-term debt on Aug. 5, the global fallout from Europe’s debt crisis and a raft of data pointing to a stalling United States economy.On a couple of days earlier in August, stock market volumes touched about 15 billion daily trades, although volumes are now back to about eight billion or nine billion daily.The stock exchanges on average charge 3.5 cents for every 100 shares traded, according to Credit Suisse. That has declined in recent years with greater competition between the exchanges, so the pop in volumes is not delivering as much to them in increased profits as it would have just a few years ago. The exchanges have also diversified into other business like providing trading technology to banks. That means revenue from stock and derivatives trading accounts for a smaller proportion of overall income. In the case of Nasdaq, for example, it makes up a third of overall sales.The exchanges, most of which are public companies, generally will not comment on the effect these increased volumes will have on profits.But analysts like Howard Chen, a financial analyst at Credit Suisse who watches the exchanges, said that because volumes were already tracking 15 to 20 percent above what he had been expecting, earnings should be up a similar amount.It’s not just the stock market that is experiencing a lift.Traders have been busily betting on interest rates, commodities, currencies and even volatility itself.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange where these and other products like United States Treasury futures are in large part traded has recorded a big pick-up in trading volumes recently.Aug. 9, for example, was a record day for the Chicago exchange, when nearly 25.7 million contracts were traded, beating the last record, which was during the so-called flash crash on May 6 last year, when 25.3 million contracts were traded, the exchange said.So far during the third quarter, volumes on the Chicago exchange are up 39 percent compared with the same period a year ago, Credit Suisse said.Futures in gold, oil and the broad stock market index, the S.& P. E-Mini, are all up.In an era when volatility has become the new norm, another instrument that has had a surge in volumes is the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. The VIX, as it is known, measures the short-term implied volatility of options on the S.& P. 500. Financial instruments based on the VIX are traded both electronically and in the exchange’s trading pits in Chicago — where there is a special VIX pit, and 60 dedicated VIX traders.It is also called the fear index, and as the S.& P. 500 has spiraled down and up, VIX futures and options have become a popular tool for all sorts of fearful investors to protect themselves against the swings — and maybe even make a little money.“Volatility in itself is becoming a more popular and investable asset class for institutions and also for retail investors,” Mr. Chen said.Volume in VIX options is up 79 percent and trading in futures on the index soared 290 percent through Aug. 19.Futures trading this month is already a record, surpassing July, which was the next highest. The single busiest day on record was Friday, Aug. 5, when 1,194,468 options contracts were traded.“When volumes are up we do well,” said William J. Brodsky, chairman and chief executive of CBOE Holdings.Mr. Brodsky said the VIX was created with professional investors in mind but is increasingly being embraced by retail investors to protect against volatility.The VIX generally moves in a range of 15 to 50, although it reached 80 during the financial crisis in 2008. Investors worried that their stock holdings were vulnerable to a sell-off in the market, for example, might buy the VIX as protection because the VIX would most likely rise.Mr. Brodsky said a couple of dozen VIX exchange-traded notes are now offered by banks like Barclays. They were linked to the VIX and aimed at providing easier access for ordinary investors.The strange thing is the heightened market volatility has not been particularly good for the exchanges’ own share prices.Even as their volumes have rocketed, their own stock prices have languished. While CBOE’s shares are up 7 percent this year, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s stock price is down 22 percent. NYSE Euronext’s share price is down 9 percent for the year, and stock in Nasdaq is down 4 percent.One reason might be that even though volumes have been picking up in recent years, the rates the exchanges charge at least for stock trading have come under pressure.Another reason, according to Mr. Chen, is the possibility — however distant — of a financial transaction tax raised by European policy makers, which would depress trading volumes.But perhaps the biggest reason is that the markets really think this is the “storm before the calm,” he said — that soon all this volatility will go away and trading will be becalmed, perhaps even more so than before. That won’t be good news for the exchanges.Other industry analysts agree. They fear that the big swings will hurt investors’ confidence in the markets and keep them away in the future.The same thing happened last year in the stock market. After the flash crash on May 6 — another time when Europe’s debt crisis was roiling world markets — May and June were busy months, but then volumes slowed markedly, partly because ordinary investors were frightened away, he said.Stock market volumes increased for six consecutive years between 2004 and 2009 but then fell 13 percent between 2009 and 2010.This year, despite the latest bounce, volumes across the entire stock market are 7 percent lower compared with last year.'"
"'11-08-27,'0','Nearly a year after Apple persuaded the television networks to try out a television episode rental service through its iTunes store, it has quietly taken the service down. Customers, it seems, did not want to rent TV episodes through an online store.“iTunes customers have shown they overwhelmingly prefer buying TV shows,” an Apple spokesman said Friday, confirming the take-down.The slight retreat by Apple comes two days after Tim Cook was named the chief executive of Apple, replacing Steve Jobs, who was named chairman. And it comes at a time when the company is widely believed to have its industry-disrupting sights set on the television industry.The company has sold episodes of TV shows through iTunes for years for $1.99 to $2.99. The sales have been beneficial for Apple and for television networks, but have not had major effects on consumer behavior. The rental service, announced last fall, was an experiment of sorts to see if a lower price point and a short viewing window would entice consumers and encourage sales of the Apple TV product.But as Apple’s statement indicated, rentals did not take off. The News Corporation, which owns the Fox network, said in a statement that after studying the results of the experiment, “it became clear that content ownership is a more attractive long-term value proposition both for iTunes customers and for our business.”News Corp. said it was working with Apple to make TV shows available within iTunes in the Cloud, a new online service that makes content more portable by securely storing it online. In its statement Friday, Apple promoted the new service, saying that it lets users “enjoy their programming whenever and however they choose.”'"
"'11-08-27,'0','For which Britain has great need. A net exporter of energy for many years, thanks to North Sea oil, Britain became a net importer in 2004 and now relies on imports for 28 percent of its energy. Its 18 nuclear reactors are aging — all but one will have to be shut by 2023. With renewable sources like wind and solar accounting for just 3.3 percent of energy consumption in 2010, Britain is a long way from its target — mandated by the — of 15 percent by 2020.In theory, green-organic Brits get all this. The Cardiff survey found that 81 percent of people are concerned that Britain will become too dependent on imported energy. Even if fewer people now say there are risks to Britain from — 66 percent today against 77 percent in 2005 (an economic crisis does focus the mind on the present) — they support using a mix of energy sources (74 percent), and 82 percent claim they would “probably or definitely vote in favor of building new wind farms in Britain,” against 41 percent for nuclear power stations.But that’s before nimbyism kicks in. We live in a nimbyfying world: idealism abounds, propelled by planet shrinkage, but so does ego, inflated by solipsistic online universes. Where they converge is in hypocrisy and humbug.People, always conservative, want change less than ever — and certainly not on their bucolic patch — even if they acknowledge it’s needed. In the pretty village of Clare in Suffolk, where British Telecom has proposed all of three wind turbines, people are up in arms. Huge signs line the road with slogans like “Stop BT’s turbines.” Opponents summon visions of a Britain so carpeted in windmills there’d be nowhere left for aircraft to make emergency landings or TV signals to penetrate spinning blades.True, wind power is erratic and no panacea, but nor is it the trumpet of doom.So, at about twice the price, Britain is now being forced to build most new wind farms offshore. In 2010, onshore installations dropped 38 percent compared with 2009, while offshore ones tripled. All the added cost of that undersea cabling will one day be billed to someone.Britain is not alone in its inconsistencies. Liberals in Park Slope, , love until an irksome new bike lane beside Prospect Park riles them. Liberals in think wind power’s all right until a wind farm is proposed for Nantucket Sound. Liberal gets exercised over a proposed 427-foot wind turbine.Some objections make sense. As a paid-up Park Sloper, I think it is nuts to have built a bike lane that fouls traffic right next to a park full of roads for bikers.Could it be then that I oppose all nimbyism except my own? The horror! I refuse to believe it. Weaning the West of oil dependency is going to take the sacrifice of a few pristine views. Windy Britain should be as pro-wind as it claims — not only out at sea, but in its backyards.'"

"'11-08-27,'0','NAIROBI, Kenya — South Sudanese police officers beat up the head of the United Nations human rights division in South Sudan, leaving him in the hospital and drawing a sharp rebuke from the United Nations.According to a United Nations statement released on Friday, Benedict Sannoh, the United Nations’ human rights chief in the newly independent Republic of South Sudan, was assaulted by more than 10 police officers, “who beat, kicked and punched him in a sustained fashion while he was in a fetal position on the floor.”The attack happened on Aug. 20, after Mr. Sannoh refused to let police officers search his luggage at a hotel in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, which declared its independence from northern Sudan in July. Mr. Sannoh was cut and bruised and hospitalized for five days before being sent abroad for further medical treatment.“The High Commissioner considers this incident to be totally unacceptable,” said the statement from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. “Unless those responsible are held to account, this will send a chilling message to all those working in the defense of human rights in South Sudan.”South Sudan is one of the poorest, least developed nations in the world, the legacy of decades of civil war and intentional marginalization by Arab rulers in northern Sudan. The country has been plagued by fighting between an array of armed factions — both before and after formal independence — and its security forces are widely known to be undisciplined and violent. Aid groups have recently complained about government security personnel hijacking humanitarian convoys.This is not the first time police officers have been accused of serious abuses. United Nations officials and witnesses said that police commanders and soldiers beat and raped police recruits at a training center outside Juba last year. The recruits were also subjected to harsh training exercises, leading to the deaths of as many as 100 people.'"
"'11-08-27,'0','BEIJING — The main Chinese state television network has deleted from the Internet a video that some foreign military and Internet security analysts say implies China has engaged in hacking attacks on Web sites in the West.The video was the July 16 episode of a program on China Central Television 7 called “Military Science and Technology.” The episode, called “The Internet Storm is Coming,” was about cyberwarfare.This week Western analysts began publicly scrutinizing a sequence that a narrator on the program says shows “many Internet attack methods.” There is then a demonstration of one method: on the screen, what appears to be a human-operated cursor chooses a target Web site address, then hits a button that says “attack.”Using a software application on screen, the cursor chooses a target Web site under a pull-down menu for “Falun Gong Web sites in North America.”  Falun Gong is a spiritual group that underwent persecution in the late 1990s in China and is now outlawed in the country.In the CCTV program, the cursor selects an IP address of 138.26.72.17 as a target. It is a defunct IP address at the University of Alabama. But a screenshot of the page linked to that address that was archived on the Internet in 2000 shows an informational page associated with the Falun Gong. It is unclear who set up the page.An online article published on China SignPost on Wednesday by two military analysts, Andrew Erickson and Gabe Collins, said there were questions as to whether the television program was using a mock-up to demonstrate cyberwarfare, or whether it revealed real hacking software and an actual attack. The technology shown was at least a decade old, the authors wrote. But “it is significant that an official Chinese state television channel showed even a symbolic representation of a cyberattack, particularly one on entities clearly located in a foreign sovereign nation,” they wrote.'"
"'11-08-27,'0','The commission was created under a bill passed last year to try to resolve one of the most contentious and long-stalled issues in state government. “This is a start at correcting the injustice that has been done to New York State’s judiciary over more than a decade of neglect,” said the commission’s chairman, , the former .But Mr. Thompson and other members of the commission also said that the fragile state economy required restraint. Under the commission’s decision, the highest level of trial judges in the state, the justices of the State Supreme Court, would receive an increase to $174,000 from the current $136,700, phased in over three years. That would match the salary of District Court judges. The raises for all the judges would cost the state about $50 million a year when they are fully implemented.The creation of the commission was an effort to minimize political fallout from what was likely to be an unpopular decision in a time of budget cutbacks.The three commission members appointed by Gov. were joined in voting for the proposal by the appointee of the Assembly speaker, , who, like the governor, is a Democrat. The two appointees of the state’s chief judge, , opposed it as inadequate, as did the appointee of the leader of the State Senate, , a Republican. The Cuomo administration had expressed concern about a large judicial pay raise, so it was not unexpected that the governor’s appointees would limit the increase.The raises will go into effect next spring unless they are overruled or modified by legislation passed by both houses of the Legislature and signed by the governor. Mr. Thompson said he hoped the size of the increase would dissuade the Legislature and the governor from seeking to overturn the decision, which he said would be “disastrous” for the judiciary.The commission’s decision would govern judicial pay for four years, after which time another commission would revisit the issue. The pay increase would apply to judges from low-level courts like New York City Civil Court and Criminal Court to the members of the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals.The salary of Supreme Court justices had been viewed as a benchmark, with the commission agreeing to keep in place the relative differences in pay across a complex state court system with many pay levels.The salary of judges in Criminal Court who earn $125,600, for example, would increase proportionally over the next three years, to $160,100. The salary of the chief judge of the state would go from $156,000 to $198,600.Judges have argued that the pay stagnation forced some judges to leave the bench. On Friday, some judges said the decision would amplify dissatisfaction in the judiciary. “I think it’s very demoralizing,” said Judge Margaret Parisi McGowan of Family Court.Phillip R. Rumsey, president of the state association of Supreme Court justices, said the salary levels in New York “will continue to reflect the low regard that other branches of state government apparently have for the judiciary.”Judge Lippman said that he was disappointed that the raise was not larger and that it would be phased in over three years.Judge Lippman was deeply involved in the plan to create the commission and said at the time that it was the “holy grail” to remove negotiations over judicial salaries from the political process. Asked Friday if the decision was a setback, Judge Lippman said the commission had been successful because it ended with a pay increase at a time of economic crisis.“We live in the real world,” he said. “We see what’s happening in Washington and in our own state. We see what’s happening in the stock market.”The commission had always appeared divided 3 to 3 over how generous an increase would be, with Mr. Silver’s appointee, James Tallon Jr., a former Democratic member of the Assembly, holding the decisive seventh vote. The increase that was approved, Mr. Tallon said Friday, “balances all of the factors that are out there, including an economy that has tanked.”But in a switch of usual roles, in which Republicans criticize Democrats for spending, Mark S. Mulholland, Mr. Skelos’s appointee, criticized Mr. Tallon.Mr. Mulholland said the Republican-controlled Senate stood with the judges in seeking higher pay. He said that by bringing the salaries of State Supreme Court justices to $174,000 instead of $190,000 or higher, the state would be continuing what he called its neglect of the judiciary. He said he was “disappointed” that Mr. Tallon had “not seen fit to close ranks with me.” One of Mr. Cuomo’s appointees, Richard B. Cotton, criticized Mr. Mulholland, a lawyer, saying it was “highly unfortunate to inject scoring political points into this discussion.”Asked about the comments, Mr. Silver said he had not spoken to Mr. Tallon about his vote, adding that “an independent commission was created to take the decision away from the Legislature and away from political finger-pointing.”'"
"'11-08-27,'0','Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, described Mr. Bernanke’s remarks as “an emergency intervention.”“It was great to hear him weigh in so strongly,” said Ms. MacGuineas. “He’s saying what needs to be said, and hopefully people will listen because of the messenger.”But the Fed chairman has no authority over fiscal policy. While he has advised Congress and the administration to make hard choices to bring down spending and deficits, his comments have held little sway in the deliberations.A deal reached earlier this month to raise the amount the government can borrow, in exchange for spending cuts of at least $2.1 trillion, would not reduce the debt to a level most economists consider sustainable, and the political brinksmanship preceding the deal led Standard & Poor’s to remove long-term from its list of risk-free .The battle now is shifting to a special Congressional committee that will negotiate the details of those cuts. plans to deliver a speech after Labor Day detailing proposals for job creation and spending cuts intended to influence the work of that committee.On Capitol Hill, Democrats seized on the Fed chairman’s remarks to criticize Republicans for what they described as intransigence during the negotiations.Representative of , the Democratic whip, said in a statement, “I believe that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke was correct today when he observed that partisan brinksmanship over the debt limit damaged financial markets and the American economy.”The White House, while declining to address Mr. Bernanke’s remarks specifically, chimed in. “The president has repeatedly expressed in his own right his frustration with the dysfunction and the partisan rancor that we’ve seen on Capitol Hill that has interfered with the government’s ability to address these challenges,” said Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman.Republicans, however, offered little response. And market reaction was muted. Stocks fell in early trading, then gradually recovered. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.5 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.2 percent to close at 11,284.54. Friday’s speech was eagerly anticipated because Mr. Bernanke and his predecessors have made a habit of coming to this conference, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, to clarify their views on the economy and monetary policy.The Fed announced earlier this month that it intended to hold short-term interest rates near zero until at least the middle of 2013, a reflection of its forecast that growth will not be fast enough during that period to drive up wages and prices. Many investors had viewed that announcement as a potential prelude to further steps. More than 25 million Americans cannot find full-time jobs, and the government said Friday that the economy expanded at an annual pace of 0.7 percent during the first half of the year, down from an earlier estimate of 0.8 percent.But Mr. Bernanke, while noting those economic challenges, returned to the language of speeches he gave earlier this year, arguing that the Fed had largely exhausted the power of its monetary policy. “Most of the economic policies that support robust economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank,” he said.While offering his standard disclaimer that the Fed would take any steps necessary, he notably omitted his usual description of those possible measures. He did say, however, that a scheduled meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in late September would be extended to two days from one day “to allow a fuller discussion.”Instead, Mr. Bernanke focused on fiscal policy, reiterating his frequent call for fiscal measures that focus on long-term reductions in the federal debt, while avoiding short-term cuts or increases that might impede recovery. He also said the government could help to speed recovery through steps that include “good, proactive housing policy.”“Notwithstanding the severe difficulties we currently face, I do not expect the long-run growth potential of the U.S. economy to be materially affected by the crisis and the if — and I stress if — our country takes the necessary steps to secure that outcome,” he said.Mr. Bernanke did not lay blame for the debt ceiling battle on either political party. But his recommendations for future fiscal policy— particularly the emphasis on the need for continued investment and reducing unemployment — generally hews closer to Mr. Obama’s position than to the views of Congressional Republicans.Mr. Bernanke elaborated only briefly on his suggestion for a different process to address these issues, suggesting that politicians should consider the establishment of “clear and transparent budget goals, together with budget mechanisms to establish the credibility of these goals.”Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues remain more optimistic about the health of the American economy than forecasters like the , one important reason the Fed is reluctant to consider additional measures.The central bank also maintains an overriding focus on inflation, aiming to keep wages and prices rising no more than about 2 percent a year. The Fed expects inflation to exceed that pace in 2011, then to settle around that level. Additional stimulus could increase the pace above its comfort level.A growing chorus of economists argues that the Fed should allow higher inflation. Some say that doing so would help to reduce unemployment. Others say that the inflation itself would be beneficial by easing the burden of household debt. Borrowers benefit from inflation because their can be repaid with cheaper dollars. But the Fed’s leaders so far have not given any indication that they find these arguments compelling.Concern about inflation contributed to the decisions by three members of the policy-making committee to dissent from the August announcement that rates would likely remain low for at least two more years. The central bank also has become a popular punching bag in the early stages of the Republican presidential primary. Mr. Bernanke opened the conference Thursday night with a brief speech, during which he mentioned that he had attended a rodeo with his wife earlier this week. The announcer, he said, asked the crowd to sing the national anthem even though many were angry about decisions made in Washington.'"
"'11-08-27,'0','While Mr. Bernanke “did not close the door to anything,” she said, it appeared that the Fed wanted to give itself more time to assess the economy. “They continue to say they expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year. At least that is a non-negative.” Friday’s five-day gain lifted the markets out of a streak of weekly losses, and the volatility receded slightly on Friday.The S. & P. and the Dow closed off the week with a gain of more than 4 percent, while the Nasdaq rose nearly 6 percent in the period. But all three indexes are still down in the month to date.The VIX, an index used to gauge volatility, ended at 35.59, the second-lowest reading on the index this week. Analysts said that while new stimulus or specific measures were not in the cards on Friday, the speech itself ended whatever guesswork still remained in the markets and restored some certainty.“I think the market is continuing to bounce in a range,” said Paul Ballew, Nationwide’s chief economist. “I think the market early in the week got a little worked up that he would do something and then came to their senses.”The Fed chairman made his standard announcement that the Fed would take any steps necessary to help the economy, and he said the issue would be discussed at the next meeting of the Fed’s policy-making board, in late September. But he made no mention of the measures the Fed might take, something he has provided on several occasions earlier this year. Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said the initial equity market reaction to the Fed statement was negative since there was no mention of new action, but the market probably turned around in the hope that action would still come in September. “Unfortunately, the Fed doesn’t have any rabbits to pull out of the hat to magically re-ignite economic growth,” said Mr. Gault.Mr. Bernanke also said the political battle this summer over the federal government’s borrowing and spending had disrupted financial markets “and probably the economy as well,” and that the country would be well served by a better process for making fiscal decisions.Mr. Ballew said that comments on the fiscal policy decision-making were more of a “wish than a reality” and so had little apparent impact on the markets.Still, there were other factors at work on the markets on Friday. Technology shares pulled up the broader market, and on the Nasdaq, Aruba Network rose about 20 percent to $20.55. It reported on Thursday that fiscal fourth-quarter revenue was up 47 percent year over year, and the company said it was confident it would increase market share in the 2012 fiscal year.Aside from corporate results, there were economic data points to contend with. After taking in disappointing jobs data on Thursday, the markets heard that gross domestic product for the second quarter rose at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, a downward revision in the Commerce Department’s report, of a previous estimate of 1.3 percent. Economists had expected growth to be revised down to 1.1 percent. In the first quarter, the economy advanced just 0.4 percent.Clark Yingst, the chief market analyst at Joseph Gunnar, said the markets had already sent out signals before the speech that investors did not appear to be expecting anything new, but he also said they could be reacting to the new G.D.P. number. Stocks and the dollar were lower, and gold firmed slightly.“The slight weakness in the dollar might be a knee-jerk reaction to that,” Mr. Yingst said of the new data. Gold, which is typically a safe-haven asset, has been declining in recent days as many analysts said it was overpriced. On Friday Comex futures rose to $1,822 an ounce.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 99 14/32, and the yield fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent late Thursday.'"

"'11-08-28,'0','Djokovic retired from his last match, against Andy Murray in the final at Mason, Ohio, with a sore shoulder. Murray struggled before winning that tournament. And Roger Federer recently turned 30, with his last Grand Slam triumph in January 2010.All are capable of winning in New York, as are a few longer shots, like the American Mardy Fish. But in an earlier news conference Saturday, Fish said the hardcourts at the Open would play slower this year, which, he said, favored Djokovic.Fish was not alone in his prediction. The analyst Cliff Drysdale said on a recent ESPN conference call: “I would not call it wide open on the men’s side, no. Djokovic, notwithstanding his shoulder issues, he’s going to be ready, and he’s going to be the clear favorite.”Perhaps, but this time last year, analysts heaped the same praise on Nadal. He won Wimbledon in 2010 and arrived in New York in a position similar to Djokovic’s, with an improved serve and an aggressive baseline game, clearly the most dangerous player in the field.Nadal’s draw appears relatively unthreatening, at least early on. He could face Andy Roddick or David Ferrer in the quarterfinals, or Murray in the semifinals, but Nadal noted Saturday his recent improvement in practice, and he could gain rhythm in the early rounds.Nadal spent part of the week before the Open promoting his book, chatting with David Letterman and unveiling an Armani underwear ad at Macy’s in Manhattan. He said that the skin on his burned fingers remained thin but that he could practice without incident, bandages notwithstanding. He told reporters he planned to watch movies while Hurricane Irene swept through New York.“The emotions are a little different, because when you come back after the victory last year, the emotions are higher,” Nadal said. “Of course, it was the last Grand Slam for me to complete all four. Was very, very nice moment of my career, one of the biggest moments of my career. That makes the comeback a little more special.”His rivalry with Djokovic, so one-sided this season, will be one of this tournament’s intriguing subplots. Drysdale said Djokovic’s season, all the victories and the nine tournaments titles, had sent a message throughout the locker room: that Nadal and Federer were beatable, that Djokovic’s flat ground strokes from the baseline presented a mystery that Nadal had yet to solve.“To explain his problems, it can be summed up in one word, and that is the man from Serbia,” Drysdale said. “Nadal has over the years adapted his game to his competition. He wants to figure him out. But it’s going to be very difficult as long as Djokovic stays healthy, because this kid has got the flat ball.”In one stretch earlier this season, Djokovic topped Nadal in the finals at Miami, Rome and Madrid. That stretch, Fish said, was what first placed Djokovic in potentially historic territory and was the point when he first sensed Djokovic was on a “pretty incredible run.”On the ESPN conference call, the analyst Chris Evert said Nadal’s heavy topspin ground strokes do not bother Djokovic as much as they do other players. “I think Djokovic has really nothing to be threatened by Nadal’s game right now,” she said.Nadal will find out soon enough. He recently intimated that it could take him until next season to figure out Djokovic, to challenge for No. 1 again. But he will surely want to challenge immediately — just like Federer, just like Murray — when the United States Open begins this week.'"
"'11-08-28,'0','Price Berkley, the founder, editor and longtime publisher of Theatrical Index, the weekly trade publication that for nearly half a century has been consulted by anyone wanting to produce, finance, write about or possibly avoid a Broadway show, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 92.His niece, Linda Berman, confirmed the death. She and a nephew, Michael Golden, are his only survivors.Mr. Berkley founded Theatrical Index in 1964 with a typewriter, a stapler and 16 subscribers. Minus the typewriter, and plus thousands of subscribers, it has changed little since then, and retains its original, humble form: a slim sheaf secured at the top with staples.“People used to put it on a clipboard on their bulletin board, and they still do,” said Steve Bebout, who succeeded Mr. Berkley as editor in chief after his retirement in 2007. “That’s why it’s still stapled the way it is.”Mr. Berkley’s first issue, dated Nov. 9, 1964, has apparently not survived, but his niece recalled it cost about a dollar. Today, an issue sells for $15.95, a year’s subscription for $425. An online edition, at theatricalindex.com, is scheduled to make its debut in about a month, Mr. Bebout said.'"
"'11-08-28,'0','The advocacy group said it had documented three other mass executions as well. In the first case, at least 17 detainees’ bodies were found in a Libyan internal security building in the neighborhood of Gargur on Monday as the rebels prepared their assault on his compound nearby.In the second case, another 18 bodies were found decaying in a dry riverbed between the internal security building and Colonel Qaddafi’s compound; witnesses and relatives told Human Rights Watch that the victims had died three to five days ago, before rebels took the area on Friday morning. Among the 18, two were found with hands bound behind them, and two others wore green medical scrubs.The third case was more ambiguous. Another 29 bodies were found in and around a makeshift field clinic outside Bab al-Aziziya, Colonel Qaddafi’s main residence compound. Researchers for Human Rights Watch said they found four on hospital beds, several others on cushions in military tents, one with an apparent execution-style gunshot to the head, and another with wrists tied behind his back. A volunteer removing the bodies said at least three others were bound as well. But others were in uniform and wore Qaddafi belt buckles, or green ribbons on their wrists.The rebels who unseated Colonel Qaddafi were still fighting his loyalists Saturday in areas around the airport road south of the city, and rebel leaders gave unconfirmed reports of still other massacres.The leadership of the transitional government, meanwhile, was increasingly focused on meeting the most basic needs of Tripoli’s residents. Government officials acknowledged that most of the city lacked running water or electrical power for a second day as temperatures hovered around 90 degrees. Hospitals, overcrowded with patients wounded in the fighting, were running short on crucial medicine. Gas shortages have driven the price of filling a tank as high as $150. And many residents said they were increasingly worried about how the provisional government might regain control of the weapons stockpile that was looted from Qaddafi armories.To many, though, the lack of running water was an especially pressing concern. Libya is a desert country without a river, and Tripoli residents get their water from desert wells through a vast system of reservoirs and ducts known as the Great Man-Made River. Its operation requires electrical power, and the electrical power relies on fuel, so both problems may be related to the fuel shortages from the civil war and blockade.Rebel leaders, however, sought to link the shortages to fears about sniper fire and sabotage from retreating Qaddafi loyalists. Farage Sayeh, minister for capacity building in the rebels’ , said in an interview that the rebels had turned off the city’s water supply because of concerns that Qaddafi loyalists had poisoned it.“Water is the priority No. 1 for us,” Mr. Sayeh said. “The first meeting this morning was about providing a fresh water supply to the people.” He acknowledged that the concerns about poison amounted to “rumors.”The problem with the electrical power supply, he said, is that technicians approaching a central control room had come under gunfire. “We are hoping that within 48 hours it will be back,” he said.In other ways, however, the rebel leadership appeared to be making progress.Rebels said they had taken control of the main coastal border crossing into , reopening the main supply lines into Tripoli.But security remained tenuous on Saturday. At one of the two main hotels housing foreign journalists, a gunshot wounded a television correspondent broadcasting from the roof. It was unclear whether the shot had come from a gunman firing deliberately or a rebel cleaning his gun.Rebel leaders also acknowledged that they had little intelligence on the whereabouts of Colonel Qaddafi. Mr. Sayeh said that apprehending him was an issue for the world, not just Libya. “This is a humanitarian issue,” he said. “For the sake of justice, not revenge.”'"
"'11-08-28,'0','Re “The Sad Statistic That Trumps the Others” (Economic View, Aug. 21), which described the decline in economic growth:Although labor productivity is an important indicator of an economy’s long-term health, Tyler Cowen should be more cautious in his analysis of a short-term slowdown.Quarterly labor productivity statistics are historically highly volatile, and often move in the opposite direction to the rest of the economy.For example, in the second quarter of 2009, while still in the grip of the Great Recession, nonfarm business labor productivity was 8.0 percent, a five-year high. It was negative for two consecutive quarters in both 1993 and in 1994, which was a period of robust economic growth.One could take the view of the author that the recent slowdown is an indication of more malaise ahead, or one could argue that it’s an indication that economic conditions are starting to improve. Hungry for some silver linings, I’ll choose the latter.The writer is an associate professor of economics at Youngstown State University.'"
"'11-08-28,'0','SINCE Steven P. Jobs resigned as chief executive of Apple last Wednesday, much has been said about him as a peerless corporate leader who has created immense wealth for shareholders, and guided the design of hit products that are transforming entire industries, like music and mobile communications.All true, but let’s think different, to borrow the Apple marketing slogan of years back. Let’s look at Mr. Jobs as a role model.Above all, he is an innovator. His creative force is seen in products like the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and in new business models for pricing and distributing music and mobile software online. Studies of innovation come to the same conclusion: you can’t engineer innovation, but you can increase the odds of it occurring. And Mr. Jobs’s career can be viewed as a consistent pursuit of improving those odds, both for himself and the companies he has led.Mr. Jobs, of course, has enjoyed singular success. But innovation, broadly defined, is the crucial ingredient in all economic progress — higher growth for nations, more competitive products for companies, and more prosperous careers for individuals. And Mr. Jobs, experts say, personifies what works in the innovation game.“We can look at and learn from Steve Jobs what the essence of American innovation is,” says John Kao, an innovation consultant to corporations and governments.Many other nations, Mr. Kao notes, are now ahead of the United States in producing what are considered the raw materials of innovation. These include government financing for scientific research, national policies to support emerging industries, educational achievement, engineers and scientists graduated, even the speeds of Internet broadband service.Yet what other nations typically lack, Mr. Kao adds, is a social environment that encourages diversity, experimentation, risk-taking, and combining skills from many fields into products that he calls “recombinant mash-ups,” like the iPhone, which redefined the smartphone category.“The culture of other countries doesn’t support the kind of innovation that Steve Jobs exemplifies, as America does,” Mr. Kao says.Workers of every rank are told these days that wide-ranging curiosity and continuous learning are vital to thriving in the modern economy. Formal education matters, career counselors say, but real-life experience is often even more valuable.An adopted child, growing up in Silicon Valley, Mr. Jobs displayed those traits early on. He was fascinated by electronics as a child, building Heathkit do-it-yourself projects, like radios.Mr. Jobs dropped out of Reed College after a semester and trekked around India in search of spiritual enlightenment, before returning to Silicon Valley to found Apple with his friend, Stephen Wozniak, an engineering wizard. Mr. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, went off and founded two other companies, Next and Pixar, before returning to Apple in 1996 and becoming chief executive in 1997.His path was unique, but innovation experts say the pattern of exploration is not unusual. “It’s often people like Steve Jobs who can draw from a deep reservoir of diverse experience that generate breakthrough ideas and insights,” says Hal B. Gregersen, a professor at the European Institute of Business Administration, or Insead.Mr. Gregersen is a co-author of a new book, “The Innovator’s DNA” (Harvard Business School Press), based on an eight-year study of 5,000 entrepreneurs and executives worldwide. His two collaborators and co-authors are Jeff Dyer, a professor at Brigham Young University, and Clayton M. Christensen, a professor at the Harvard Business School, whose 1997 book “The Innovator’s Dilemma” popularized the concept of “disruptive innovation.”The academics identify five traits that are common to the disruptive innovators: questioning, experimenting, observing, associating and networking. Their bundle of characteristics echoes the ceaseless curiosity and willingness to take risks noted by other experts. Networking, Mr. Gregersen explains, is less about career-building relationships than a search for new ideas. Associating, he adds, is the ability to make idea-producing connections by linking concepts from different disciplines — intellectual mash-ups.“Innovators engage in these mental activities regularly,” Mr. Gregersen says. “It’s a habit.”'"
"'11-08-28,'0','Despite this shift, DealBook’s reporting is about deals, hedge fund news and the doings of people on the Street. We read about George Soros’s problems with his girlfriend, elevator conversations overheard at Goldman Sachs, and prospects for a “Wall Street Wives” reality TV show.Leon D. Black, the superrich head of Apollo Global Management, staged an over-the-top 60th birthday party for himself in the Hamptons, and on Aug. 18 DealBook chronicled it microscopically. The article included an element of finger-wagging about the excesses involved but still made sure that no detail-hungry, celebrity-starved reader was left behind.It’s true that, within DealBook’s range of targeted topics, it delivers some hard-hitting material. And when big news in the deal world breaks, DealBook serves as a “real-time SWAT team,” in Mr. Sorkin’s words. Its coverage Aug. 15 of Google’s bid to acquire Motorola was wall to wall and, no question, served a broad readership’s desire to understand what this might mean for Google and its quest to exploit mobile technology.A week before that, though, when the world economic system shuddered and stock markets dropped, I was left wondering whether The Times should have spent its money not on expanding DealBook but on enlarging its stable of journalists aimed at the wider subjects of international and sovereign debt.New signs of systemic disease emerged that week, particularly in , where the European Central Bank rushed to shore up Italian sovereign debt. Although DealBook ran a couple of columns calling attention to this threat, the developments made clearer that this subject requires in-depth investigating of a complex ecosystem whose inner workings may be just as opaque as the -larded American banking network that imploded in 2008.Dean Starkman, a former reporter who runs the blog The Audit for The Columbia Journalism Review, shares my concerns that DealBook, while it helps The Times build a niche audience online, isn’t designed to address broader issues like this.“DealBook is a symptom of, as well as a cause of, narrowing of the frames of business news,” he said. “What DealBook does is approach business and finance strictly from an investor’s perspective. This is useful, of course, and has deep roots in business press DNA. But it is not public interest journalism.”Rather, he added, this kind of journalism is good at scoops and incremental news developments. What readers require to understand deep crises like European debt is something else. “Somebody is going to have to step up and look at things systemically,” he said. “If the financial crisis has taught us anything it is that the investor’s perspective of looking at finance is too narrow.”The Times’s DealBook expansion is a strategy for capturing digital readers interested in this narrowly defined perspective. Larry Ingrassia, the Business Day editor, told me that while in print The Times can succeed by broadly addressing “the five or 10 most important things you need to know,” the Web demands narrower and deeper offerings.“If we don’t provide readers with some specialized content that informs them in an area where they might have a narrower and high interest,” he said, “somebody else is going to do it.”The Times sacrificed no existing resources when it decided to enlarge DealBook, Mr. Ingrassia emphasized. Granting that, I worry that the investment meant forgoing an opportunity to strengthen reporting elsewhere.One area in need now, in the business news category, is clearly the deepening hole in Europe. In slow motion, the weaker states of the are sliding toward insolvency and the European banks, which hold their debt, are being pulled along.Mr. Ingrassia said he didn’t think The Times’s coverage “has wanted from the lack of people,” and I would agree that Business Day, with support from foreign desk and International Herald Tribune reporters, has done a creditable job of covering developments in the crisis, especially the political angles relating to Europe’s leaders. Yet much remains invisible to interested readers.Just as the 2008 crisis was largely explained after the fact by The Times and other publications, the current situation feels like a replay in which we may learn only later how the tumbling dominoes were arrayed. Perhaps most important to Times readers, little is being written about the consequences that a catastrophic event in Europe could have on the and the world economy.Perhaps The Times will yet jump in and expose the linkages between Europe’s institutions and the American economy and markets — before the other shoe drops. But the focus of DealBook, tied as it is to The Times’s online strategy, isn’t pointed in that direction. And I have to wonder whether investing in this kind of journalism, even if it had meant forgoing DealBook’s granular devotion to its niche, wouldn’t have better served the public.'"
"'11-08-28,'0','Last week’s annual Fed retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyo. offered the latest illustration of the debate’s contours. After months of disappointing recent economic data, the Fed chose not to take major action. Instead, Mr. Bernanke defended the Fed’s modest Aug. 9 announcement that it planned to hold down short-term interest rates until mid-2013.The only public criticism of that move from within the Fed came from three hawks who voted against it, which made for the most dissents on its policy-setting committee in almost 20 years. No Fed official, by contrast, has recently dissented out of the belief that the Fed has been too timid, and no one presented a paper in Jackson Hole making that case either. For now, the Fed debate — at least the open debate — is one between inflation hawks and moderates, with nary a true dove in sight.It is obviously impossible to know precisely which policy would be the best one for the struggling American economy. A dovelike injection of money into the economy would have the potential to increase incomes and inflation in a benign way, effectively reducing household debt burdens, giving people more confidence to spend money and eventually spurring hiring. But further action also brings some risk of setting off uncontrollable inflation, which, while very low historically, has been rising lately.No doubt, some of this richer hawk-dove debate is occurring behind closed doors at the Fed and in Jackson Hole. But the public conversation still matters. It affects nothing less than the Fed’s credibility. Mr. Bernanke knows that if he errs on the side of passivity — worrying more about inflation risks than unemployment — he risks only a modest flogging from colleagues and politicians. If he leans the other way, he risks being accused of, well, treason.That difference has almost certainly affected Fed policy, causing it to be less aggressive on policy and more optimistic about economic growth than it otherwise would be. As Mr. Thoma, an economics professor at the University of Oregon, recently wrote, Fed officials are “in a more precarious political position than they ever expected to be in.” With the benefit of hindsight, we also know that the Fed has been too optimistic during the past two years, forecasting stronger growth than ultimately occurred.Why does the Fed skew more hawkish than the economics profession as a whole? Part of the answer lies in the way the 12 voting members of the policy-setting committee are chosen. They are a mix of presidential nominees subject to Senate approval, with 14-year terms, and regional Fed presidents, who are chosen by outside boards that are made up partly of private-sector finance executives.David Levey, a former managing director at Moody’s and another critic of Fed inaction, points out that banks often have more to lose from inflation than from unemployment. Inflation reduces the future value of the money that their debtors — homeowners, car buyers, small businesses and the like — will repay them.“The Fed regional banks represent, in essence, the banking community, which tends to be very conservative and hawkish,” Mr. Levey says. “Creditors don’t like inflation — it’s good for debtors.” Indeed, the three recent dissents all came from regional bank presidents: Richard W. Fisher of Dallas, Narayana R. Kocherlakota of Minneapolis and Charles I. Plosser of Philadelphia.Mr. Obama, for his part, has chosen to nominate mostly moderates, rather than strong inflation doves. Most significantly, he re-nominated Mr. Bernanke, originally a George W. Bush adviser and appointee, to a second four-year term as chairman, based largely on Mr. Bernanke’s aggressive steps in 2008 and 2009 to prevent another depression. The Obama administration has also been slow to fill some Fed openings. At least one of the 12 seats has been vacant since Mr. Obama took office, and two are now.The doves outside the Fed do not all favor the same steps — or even the label dove. Indeed, they have some significant disagreements.Some want a more aggressive round of quantitative easing, a policy the Fed enacted in 2009 and 2010 to try to bring down long-term interest rates. Some want significantly faster near-term inflation, to make up for the low inflation of the past few years and give people an incentive to spend more money now. Some want the Fed to commit to buying up financial assets — the functional equivalent of printing money — until the nation’s gross domestic product has recovered from the crisis. In Sweden, the central bank has engaged in more aggressive asset buying, which appears to be one reason the economy there has recovered from the crisis much better than in most other rich countries, notes Mr. Sumner, a conservative-leaning monetary-policy economist at Bentley University.But the doves do want the Fed to move in the same direction: toward making a more energetic attack on unemployment. Mr. Sumner has become so dispirited by the Fed that, before leaving on a trip for Italy last week, he left a post on his well-read blog, The Money Illusion, under the headline, “Not enough.” The headline, he wrote, “refers to my reaction if the Fed does something while I’m gone.”Whatever one thinks of his prescription, his prediction was spot on. Mr. Bernanke concluded his Jackson Hole speech by urging other branches of government to improve their economic policies. The one Fed change he announced was a lengthening of next month’s monetary-policy meeting to two days, up from the usual one, “to allow a fuller discussion” of the issues.Outside the Fed’s walls, of course, that fuller discussion has already been under way for a long time.'"
"'11-08-28,'0','“It’s easier to fool us when you animate a dragon or another mythical or fairy tale creature,” Dr. Bregler said of characters created in earlier movies using the technology, called performance capture. “But humans or their closest relatives, chimps — that’s more difficult to do. Our human eyes are finely tuned to detecting problems with those depictions, and the illusion breaks down.”If the illusion holds in “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” he said, it is because of several small but significant engineering steps that can take audiences past what is called the “uncanny valley,” the spot at which an animation loses credibility.In particular, “Rise” uses a video system that analyzes the facial expressions of the actors playing the apes. “The system can capture every subtle nuance of expression down to the pixel,” Dr. Bregler said, “and every wrinkle. The wrinkles are especially important.”Performance capture technology, as its name suggests, is based on actual performances by human actors. But In “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” actors playing chimps do not wear heavy makeup and wigs, as Roddy McDowall did in the 1968 “Planet of the Apes.”Instead, they wear special electronic gear. In “Rise,” the actor Andy Serkis, who plays the chimp protagonist Caesar, wears a lightweight helmet with a video camera mounted directly in front of his face to record every nuance of expression, outdoors as well as indoors.These cameras were also employed in “Avatar,” but were used outside for the first time in “Rise,” said Mark Sagar, special projects supervisor at Weta Digital Ltd. and an Oscar winner for his facial motion capture techniques. Weta, a visual effects studio in New Zealand, provided the performance capture technology for “Rise” as well as for “Avatar” and earlier films including the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy.The technology of performance capture was well on its way when Mr. Serkis played the mythical character Gollum in “Lord of the Rings,” but facial capture then was at lower resolution and more rudimentary. “The burden was much more on an animator to craft the facial expressions frame by frame,” Dr. Bregler said. “You couldn’t track every pixel in Gollum’s face.”Moving the technology outside for filming has been another improvement in the evolution of motion capture."" You need to do a lot of new engineering to make this work outside, Dr. Bregler said, but the effect is striking. “The actors are set in a natural environment. It’s much more realistic.”All of the motion capture footage is analyzed and modeled, becoming the basis for computer animation of the ape characters.For example, when Caesar is called upon to frown — and Caesar does a lot of frowning as the plot thickens — the camera pointing at his face tracks the motion of his skin.Software analyzes how the underlying human muscles move, and then translates the movement to a chimp counterpart. “For example, an ape’s brow moves in a different way than an actor’s human brow,” Dr. Sagar said.Software may do most of the animating, but human artists still apply their skills, adjusting the rendering if Mr. Serkis’s protruding human nose is not squashed exactly as it should be to become a chimp’s nose, or if the emotional intent of the performance is not conveyed properly.“The process is not completely mathematical,” said Joe Letteri, a four-time Oscar winner and senior visual effects supervisor for Weta.Weta worked closely with Standard Deviation, a motion capture hardware company in Santa Monica, Calif., to design and build many of the cameras used in “Rise,” said Dejan Momcilovic, head of performance capture at Weta. Cameras from the Motion Analysis Corporation in Santa Rosa, Calif., were also used, he said.The live action shots, combined with the convincing computerized faces of the chimps, work to increase realism, said Steven R. Quartz, a professor of philosophy at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. “Caesar really seems to be interacting with the other actors. It really does seem to capture subtle nuances in the interaction and the exchanges,” Dr. Quartz said, even though Caesar is artificial.HOWEVER plausible the animation, movie audiences are not actually seeing a true representation of a chimp’s brow, or eyes either, when they look at Caesar, Dr. De Waal of Emory said. There is plenty of digital fine-tuning to humanize the apes, making them a bit more like us and a bit less like them.“The head and shoulders of an actual chimp are more massive than Caesar’s,” he said. And Caesar’s eyes have been altered, too, for example, to add white to them.But Dr. De Waal is glad the filmmakers used actors rather than chimps that are dressed up to play parts. The animals “have miserable lives dancing to our tune,” he said. We are very pleased there is a movie that has been able to circumvent this.”'"
"'11-08-28,'0','Maybe another time. That weekend, those tasks seemed too decadent. Of course, all my hyperproductivity came at a cost. Fancy Hands, which requires a subscription, starts at $25 a month. And errands on TaskRabbit vary in price, but average about $25 a task. In total, I spent close to $100 getting my deeds done.Although most of these networks are in their early stages, several have already attracted venture capitalists. Zaarly and TaskRabbit recently raised $1 million each in financing.Ted Roden, a former technologist for The New York Times, developed Fancy Hands in June 2009 not long after his wife gave birth to their first child. He said he needed help with day-to-day minutiae like scheduling baby sitters and resolving problems with his cable bill.“I never intended it to be a product other than something for myself, but I needed to keep the assistants working, so I opened it up,” he said.Fancy Hands is good for time-consuming, research-oriented Web queries like figuring out which restaurants along the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica are vegan-friendly or finding a grief counseling group within walking distance of your job, as I asked the service to do.On the other hand, Leah Busque, the chief executive of TaskRabbit, which is based in San Francisco, says her service encourages people to connect with others in their own neighborhoods. Thousands of tasks are posted on the site each month, and 1,500 active helpers — or TaskRabbits — fulfill them, mainly in densely populated urban areas, she said.“We call the concept service networking, rather than social networking,” she said. “We’re enabling people to share their free time and specialized skills and services with other people in their community.”James Levine, whom I hired through TaskRabbit to organize my closet, said that he preferred tasks that revolved around organizational skills or devising personal routines, but would occasionally accept errands to fetch cat food or deliver a sandwich for neighbors in Chelsea.“It’s not that I think doing a chore for $10 is worth it, but it makes sense for me to get to know my neighbors, considering what I do,” he said. In addition to helping cover his living expenses while he hunts for a full-time job, he hopes these assignments provide word-of-mouth support for a music podcast that he records in rehearsal space at the Chelsea Arts Building in Manhattan.Customers of these services often say they reduce stress in their lives.“For a nominal fee, I can free up my time and mental space,” said Whitney Hess, a design consultant in Manhattan. “I don’t have to think about it or make the time to do it.”Ms. Hess said that in the last few weeks she outsourced tasks like finding reliable a car service to take her to the airport, transcribing interviews, having a necklace repaired, transferring compact discs onto a hard drive and selecting a bathroom scale.“Once I got started, I was on a roll,” she said.She considered hiring a full-time personal assistant, but said use of online networks seemed more economical.“There’s always a fear with a full-time hire that you won’t have enough to fill up their whole time,” she said. “It could be a huge waste of money.”Farming out personal tasks, like dinner invitations, intimate e-mails and such is daunting, she said. “There is a certain fear of opening up your personal and professional life to a stranger,” she said.I found it unnerving to invite someone into my home to help unsnarl the chaos contained inside. But after spending several hours with Mr. Levine, who grappled with my overflowing closet, I began to see him as a welcome interloper, helping bridge the chasm between disaster and order in my life.After he disappeared through my front door, I looked around at my newly ordered belongings and felt a flood of relief. Then, I cracked open my laptop to see what other help I might find to remove clutter from my life.'"
"'11-08-28,'0','Such a move does not appear imminent; on Friday Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, told attendees at the Jackson Hole, Wyo., conference that the Fed would take necessary steps to help the economy, but didn’t outline any possibilities as he has done previously.If the Fed reprises some of its emergency lending programs, we will at least know what they will involve and who will be on the receiving end, thanks to Bloomberg.For instance, its report detailed the surprisingly sketchy collateral — stocks and junk bonds — accepted by the Fed to back its loans. And who will be surprised if foreign institutions, which our central bank has no duty to help, receive bushels of money from the Fed in the coming months? In 2008, the Royal Bank of Scotland received $84.5 billion, and Dexia, a Belgian lender, borrowed $58.5 billion from the Fed at its peak.Walker F. Todd, a research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research and a former assistant general counsel and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said these details from 2008 confirm that institutions, not citizens, were aided most by the bailouts.“What is the benefit to the American taxpayer of propping up a Belgian bank with a single New York banking office to the tune of tens of billions of dollars?” he asked. “It seems inconsistent ultimately to have provided this much assistance to the biggest institutions for so long, and then to have done in effect nothing for the homeowner, nothing for credit card relief.”Mr. Todd also questioned the Fed’s decision to accept stock as collateral backing a loan to a bank. “If you make a loan in an emergency secured by equities, how is that different in substance from the Fed walking into the New York Stock Exchange and buying across the board tomorrow?” he asked. “And yet this, the Fed has steadfastly denied ever doing.”If these rescues were intended to benefit everyday Americans, as Mr. Paulson contended, they have failed. Main Street is in a world of hurt, facing high unemployment, rampant foreclosures and ravaged retirement accounts.This important topic of bailout inequities came up in Congress earlier this month. Edward J. Kane, professor of finance at Boston College, addressed a Senate banking panel convened on Aug. 3 by Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat. “Our representative democracy espouses the principle that all men and women are equal under the law,” Mr. Kane said. “During the housing bubble and the economic meltdown that the bursting bubble brought about, the interests of domestic and foreign financial institutions were much better represented than the interests of society as a whole.”THIS inequity must be eliminated, Mr. Kane said, especially since taxpayers will be billed for future bailouts of large and troubled institutions. Such rescues are not really loans, but the equivalent of equity investments by taxpayers, he said.As such, regulators who have a duty to protect taxpayers should require these institutions to provide them with true and comprehensive reports about their financial positions and the potential risks they involve. These reports would counter companies’ tendencies to hide their risk exposures through accounting tricks and innovation and would carry penalties for deception.“Examiners would have to challenge this work, make the companies defend it and protect taxpayers from the misstatements we get today,” Mr. Kane said in an interview last week. “The banks really feel entitled to hide their deteriorating positions until they require life support. That’s what we have to change. We must put them in position to be punished for an intent to deceive.”Given the degree to which financial regulators are captured by the companies they oversee, prescriptions like Mr. Kane’s are going to be fought hard. But the battle could not be more important; if we do nothing to protect taxpayers from the symbiotic relationship between the industry and their federal minders, we are in for many more episodes like the one we are still digging out of.EVALUATING bailout programs like the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the facilities extended by the Fed against “the senseless standard of doing nothing at all,” Mr. Kane testified, government officials tell taxpayers that these actions were “necessary to save us from worldwide depression and made money for the taxpayer.” Both contentions are false, he said.“Bailing out firms indiscriminately hampered rather than promoted economic recovery,” Mr. Kane continued. “It evoked reckless gambles for resurrection among rescued firms and created uncertainty about who would finally bear the extravagant costs of these programs. Both effects continue to disrupt the flow of credit and real investment necessary to trigger and sustain economic recovery.”As for making money on the deals? Only half-true, Mr. Kane said. “Thanks to the vastly subsidized terms these programs offered, most institutions were eventually able to repay the formal obligations they incurred.” But taxpayers were inadequately compensated for the help they provided, he said. We should have received returns of 15 percent to 20 percent on our money, given the nature of these rescues.Government officials rewarded imprudent institutions with stupefying amounts of free money. Even so, we are still in economically stormy seas. Doesn’t that indicate that it’s time to try a different tack?'"

"'11-08-28,'0','IS a celebrity imprimatur on a handbag worth as much as a new car?When Victoria Beckham announced this month that her fashion line was releasing an alligator-skin handbag costing nearly $30,000, the price tag might have seemed shocking, if not, perhaps, for the $34,000 alligator-skin backpack revealed in July by The Row, the design outfit of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.In the past, celebrity branding has targeted a decidedly more down-market clientele: teenagers, the movie-star-obsessed and shoppers seeking some affordable piece of Hollywood glamour. Jeans by Jessica Simpson and athletic shoes by Kim Kardashian have been inexpensive and accessible, to say nothing of clothing lines for Kmart and Wal-Mart by teenage idols like Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus, respectively.Ms. Beckham and the Olsens are not the first celebrities put their names on more serious, and expensive, pieces. Chloë Sevigny has $400 shoes for Opening Ceremony, and Katie Holmes-branded suit jackets are $2,950 at Barneys, for instance.But until now, celebrity brands have mostly stayed away from five-figure fashion. Indeed, do women who are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a designer bag really care about (or even want) pop celebrity branding? Why not a Hermès, Delvaux or Balenciaga, luxury bags with impeccable sophisticated reputations?If the difficulty in getting one of the new Beckham or Olsen bags is any indication, the answer to the first question may be “yes.” Colin T. McDonald, a professional stylist based in New York, is trying to buy one of the Olsen Row backpacks on behalf of a client who is, he said, marrying into “a very prominent and affluent Russian family” in New York. So far, he’s stuck on the waiting list.The Row bag is available only at Barneys; Ms. Beckham’s bag is made to order. Such scarcity, combined with the celebrity seal, Mr. McDonald said, was enough to drive demand among buyers for whom money is no object. “It’s a luxury market, and it’s not about the price tag,” Mr. McDonald added. “It’s about what they can’t have that they must have.”'"
"'11-08-28,'0','JEFFERSON FRIEDMAN is a tough composer to pigeonhole, given his high-energy eclecticism and his penchant for free appropriation of both rock and classical conventions. He has an original, compelling voice as well as ideas that draw you in and make you want to see where he will take them; yet if you listen closely, his basic materials are essentially the same as those that his predecessors have used, only juxtaposed in different, often daring ways.If you think of the two string quartets here, Mr. Friedman’s Second (1999) and Third (2005), as neo-Romantic works, you won’t be wrong, at least most of the time. Both begin with vigorous, hard-driven movements in a tonal if purposefully brash style, and they sound surprisingly conventional until Mr. Friedman veers off toward unusual byways of rhythm or timbre.One odd turn in the Second Quartet is a slow movement that sounds oddly medieval at first, then melts into a lush, Romantic section that gives way in turn to a choralelike chordal section. Near the end of the Third Quartet’s second movement, the players are asked to slide into their notes, creating an odd, spacey effect in dense passages. Yet from within that weird, slippery texture, a set of solid, repeating, consonant chords emerge, bringing the movement to an unusually eerie, slow finale.The Chiara String Quartet has made these works centerpieces of its live repertory in recent seasons, and the vital performances reflect the players’ devotion to Mr. Friedman’s work. In an original touch, New Amsterdam has included two remixes by Matmos, an electronic music group, which took passages from the quartet recordings and reconfigured them imaginatively by weaving in beats, drones and computer timbres, and making them into virtually new works.

"'11-08-29,'1','After focusing on the pill, Dr. Edwards acted more forcefully than any previous commissioner by removing a host of products from the shelves, at least temporarily. These included highly publicized cases of vichyssoise suspected of carrying botulism and mercury-tainted swordfish and tuna.Dr. Edwards also oversaw the introduction of nutrition labels on foods, a consumer-protection campaign that was originally voluntary, though many food processors followed the guidelines. After 1990, expanded nutritional information on labels was required.Dr. Edwards’s flurry of activity followed a period of disarray at the agency, which had three commissioners in the three years before he arrived. He successfully lobbied to double the budget and reorganized its management structure.He also struggled to maintain a regulatory balance between protecting consumers’ health and guarding against hurting the economic health of industry, a juggling act prescribed by law. He worried that “we can with a stroke of a pen wipe out an industry.” Consumer advocates said that despite his toughness he could have done more to enforce the new laws in the public’s interest.After three years of leading the F.D.A., Dr. Edwards was promoted in March 1973 to assistant secretary of health in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, making him, in effect, the medical czar of the Nixon administration. He supervised the Public Health Service, the surgeon general, the National Institutes of Health and the F.D.A.At H.E.W., as it was commonly known, he gave greater independence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and folded the semi-autonomous National Institute of Mental Health into the National Institutes of Health. In 1975, however, having stayed on to serve under President Gerald R. Ford after Nixon’s resignation, Dr. Edwards quit in protest over budget cuts to health programs that would especially hurt the poor and unemployed. He said the Ford administration’s plans to shift costs to the states were particularly damaging.Charles Cornell Edwards was born on Sept. 16, 1923, in Overton, Neb., and grew up in Kearney, Neb., where his father was a country doctor. He attended Princeton before transferring to the University of Colorado, where he earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees. After a medical internship in Minneapolis, he worked at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.He was later a Marine medical officer in Korea and earned a master’s degree in surgery from the University of Minnesota before taking up a general surgical practice in Des Moines. In the 1960s he was a manager for the American Medical Association and a vice president of Booz Allen Hamilton, the management consulting firm. He also taught at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington.After leaving government in 1975, Dr. Edwards worked for private companies, including Becton, Dickinson & Company, a New Jersey medical device maker. Two years later he moved to the La Jolla area of San Diego to become president and chief executive of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, a predecessor of the Scripps Research Institute, a leader in biomedical research.He ultimately led the Scripps Institutions of Medicine and Science, building it into a large regional health care concern with 1,600 physicians and 6,200 employees.After retiring from Scripps in 1993, he was president and chief executive of the California Healthcare Institute, a research and advocacy organization for California’s biomedical industry, until 1995.Dr. Edwards is survived by his wife of 66 years, the former Sue Cowles Kruidenier; three sons, Timothy, Charles Jr. and David; a daughter, Nancy Edwards Schned; and eight grandchildren.'"
"'11-08-29,'1','Despite his vocal opposition to what he has called “the unprecedented and massive federal overreach” of ’s health care overhaul, Mr. Perry accepted a $1 million federal grant last October for planning to carry out one of its key provisions. (Other Republican governors, including of , have refused to use the grants.)Although his 2010 book, “Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington,” describes his outrage that federal bureaucrats distributed more than $245 billion in farm subsidies from 1995 to 2009, the governor received some of that money. Mr. Perry, a former West Texas cotton farmer, received at least $83,000 in federal farm subsidies between 1987 and 1998, during the time he was in elected office, according to his returns.At the Republican Leadership Conference in June, Mr. Perry said that while government plays an important role in helping a city recover from a disaster, “the real recovery” stems from hard-working individuals. Unfortunately, he added, Mr. Obama believed government was the answer to every need, a sign of the “arrogance and audacity” of the White House.Three weeks earlier, in a letter to Mr. Obama, Mr. Perry struck a different tone as wildfires ravaged Texas. The had approved grants to reimburse some of the local and state costs of fighting the fires, but Mr. Perry was seeking the additional federal aid that comes from a presidential disaster declaration. “Your favorable consideration of this appeal would be greatly appreciated,” the governor wrote to the president, who ultimately granted Mr. Perry’s request.Mr. Perry’s aides and supporters defend the governor’s record, praising him for taking bold stands to strengthen state autonomy and fight federal overregulation. In 2009, Mr. Perry rejected $556 million in federal stimulus dollars for the state’s unemployment program, saying that the money came with too many strings attached that would require Texas to broaden its rules on who is eligible to receive benefits. Days before he announced his presidential candidacy, Mr. Perry formally requested that the federal government reimburse Texas $350 million — the estimated cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants in county jails and state prisons in 2009 and 2010.When asked whether the governor saw any of these examples as inconsistent with his states’ rights stance, Mr. Perry’s spokesman, Mark Miner, said absolutely not. If anything, he said, Texas — a so-called donor state that pays more in federal taxes than it receives — has done more than its part, stepping in when the federal government has shirked its responsibilities.“The governor is a strong advocate of the 10th Amendment, of giving more power to states to make decisions on these issues,” Mr. Miner said. “Whether it’s transportation or border security, which are federal issues, the State of Texas has had to step up to the plate where the federal government has failed at its responsibilities.”Mr. Perry began embracing states’ rights as a major part of his political identity after Mr. Obama was elected president. It was a time when issues like government bailouts and the federal debt made the concept resonate among conservatives nationwide and helped fuel the rise of the Tea Party movement.Bill Ratliff, a Republican who served alongside Mr. Perry as lieutenant governor from late 2000 to early 2003, said that states’ rights were not a priority for Mr. Perry in those years.“He probably always had a level of skepticism about federal intervention and federal programs, but then when the Tea Party movement began, he sensed that this was going to be the place where he could participate,” said Mr. Ratliff, 75, now a lobbyist for public education. “I think he’s the best I’ve ever seen at picking up on a trend, a movement, and getting out in front of it very early.”Critics say that there are inconsistencies between Mr. Perry’s message and his record and that this has eroded his support among some of those in Texas who share the same limited-government beliefs, including libertarians, moderate Republicans and Tea Party activists. “What he says in the book and what he does are not the same,” said Dave Nalle, national chairman of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a group of libertarian Republicans whose Texas chapter has never endorsed Mr. Perry for governor. “He’s a good salesman, no question about it. But he’s selling something that’s mostly a fiction, I think.”But even as some conservatives say he does not go far enough in adhering to a states’ rights philosophy, Democrats are already using his stated positions to portray him as an extremist who would gut popular government functions like and .Mr. Perry has described the defense of the 10th Amendment as the battle for the soul of America. In his book, he called Social Security a failure that was “set up like an illegal ” and described Congress as “arguably one of the most incompetent regimes with one of the worst track records of mismanagement in the history of mankind.” In two statements in 2009, he suggested that frustrated Texans might consider secession.“We’ve got a great union,” Mr. Perry said at a Tea Party rally in Austin in April 2009. “There’s absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what might come out of that.”In his book, he sets out a view that the founders intended a federal system that allowed “people of like mind” in the states to make their own decisions about how to live, while the national government’s role was properly focused on national security. “From marriage to prayer, from zoning laws to tax policy, from our school systems to health care, and everything in between,” he wrote, “it is essential to our liberty that we be allowed to live as we see fit through the democratic process at the local and state level.”The history of Mr. Perry’s anti-Washington beliefs is complicated by the fact that over much of his time in office during the last decade he had little interest in publicly challenging his predecessor as governor, President , alongside whom Mr. Perry served as lieutenant governor. Mr. Bush oversaw a substantial increase in the size and scope of the federal government, both in post-9/11 security programs and in social programs like the creation of a prescription drug benefit for Medicare.Though in his book he criticizes Mr. Bush’s and suggests it is unconstitutional, Mr. Perry accepted financing for the education program as governor. This fiscal year, Texas received $2.03 billion.'"
"'11-08-29,'1','SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) — California returned the Little League World Series championship to the United States with the type of victory even big leaguers dream about.Nick Pratto singled in the winning run with two outs and the bases loaded in the bottom of the sixth inning to give the boys from Huntington Beach a 2-1 victory Sunday over Hamamatsu City, Japan, and a World Series championship.With runners on first and second, an error by Japan’s shortstop on what could have been an inning-ending double play loaded the bases for California. After a force play at the plate, the 12-year-old Pratto came to the plate.“I was just thinking, Oh God, Oh God, before I was getting in the box,” Pratto said. “But once I got into the box, I calmed myself by telling myself to just look for a good pitch.”He smacked a solid liner to center off reliever Kazuto Takakura that brought home pinch-runner Eric Anderson with the winning run. Pratto tossed his helmet into the air after rounding first before his teammates mobbed him in the infield.A United States team has now won six out of the last seven World Series; Japan won last year.The teams exchanged handshakes at the plate before California’s giddy players posed at the mound with the championship banner.'"
"'11-08-29,'1','“Record Industry Braces for Artists’ Battles Over Song Rights” (Arts pages, Aug. 16) tells only part of the story.Recording artists generally aren’t employees of the label. But recordings can be “works made for hire” (and therefore exempt from termination by artists) if (1) there was a signed agreement between the artist and the label that the recording would be a “work made for hire”; and (2) the recording falls into one of the categories that can qualify as commissioned works for hire under copyright law (for example, if it was created as a contribution to a collective work).Since most recording agreements provide that the recordings are “works made for hire,” future litigation will likely revolve around whether the recordings in dispute were created as contributions to collective works (and it will likely be argued that albums are such collective works), or otherwise fall into one of the specified categories.JUNE M.

The motorcyclist who was headed in his direction, a trainee just learning to operate his bike, rolled past Mr. Feldaverd, a veteran instructor.In Mr. Feldaverd’s view, that was the equivalent of an accident, a fatal one. He let the student have it for not heeding his signal to stop.“You went right into that car,” he said with a grimace, even though there was no actual car around. “It’s over.”Mr. Feldaverd teaches at TEAM Arizona, a school for would-be motorcyclists with its own test track and a paramount mission of safety.

"'11-08-29,'1','THE OFFENSE Hewitt’s left foot turns ever-so-slightly on his serve, which has led to disputed calls over the years, but none like this. In a five-set victory over James Blake in the second round in 2001, Hewitt was heard on Australian television saying to the tournament referee, “Mate, look at him, and you tell me what the similarity is.” Blake is African-American. So was the line judge in question.QUOTABLE “I don’t think I said anything racial out there,” Hewitt later told reporters.THE OFFENSE In the first round in 2008, Safin was whistled for crossing the imaginary center line, a rare foot-fault call, late in the fourth set of a match against Vince Spadea in which Safin ultimately prevailed. Safin said the linesperson who made the call did so “in sunglasses” and “from 35 meters away.”QUOTABLE “It’s difficult and almost impossible to make a foot fault on a second serve. Especially in important moments, you shouldn’t make it,” Safin said.THE OFFENSE In the women’s semifinals in 2009, Williams erupted after a foot-fault call. Her ensuing tantrum, filled with threats and four-letter words, cost Williams a point for unsportsmanlike conduct and gave Kim Clijsters the match.QUOTABLE “Now that I have had time to gain my composure I can see that while I don’t agree with the unfair line call, in the heat of battle I let my passion and emotion get the better of me and as a result handled the situation poorly,” Williams said in a news release.THE OFFENSE Penalized against Janko Tipsarevic in the second round last year, Roddick went into defense lawyer mode. He queried the line judge as to which foot, and when the judge answered incorrectly, Roddick exploded in anger. He later acknowledged he “went too far.”'"
"'11-08-29,'1','Viewers can visit a Chase microsite for the show, follow the series on Facebook, watch it on their mobile phones and get text messages prompting them to tune in to the show or to go online. They can also download music from the Chase commercials and enter a contest to win a behind-the-scenes tour of the Telemundo studios. Mr. Lovinger described the strategy as “organic, but pervasive.”Telemundo’s biggest competitor, Univision Communications, also has ramped up its product placements with advertisers like General Motors and Domino’s pizza incorporated directly into story lines for its show “Eva Luna,” about an advertising agency.For a promotion involving the Buick Regal last season, the show’s lead character wins the account and shows the Buick team a commercial the agency created. That same commercial aired on the network and its affiliates apart from the show. In other episodes, the characters were shown ordering pizza from Domino’s for a late-night work session.“It can’t be contrived, it has to be real,” said Steve Tihanyi, the director of branded entertainment and marketing alliances at General Motors. “In a way it was art imitating life, or life imitating art.”General Motors will also feature its cars in a new Univision telenovela called “Talisman.”“As integration has become more and more important for our advertising partners we keep raising the bar on what solutions we can offer,” said David Lawenda, president of advertising sales and marketing for Univision.Until January, the network carried programming created by the Mexican TV giant Televisa, which limited options for brand integration since the shows were already filmed before being distributed through Univision. Because of the partnership with Televisa, Univision can now work on product placement in Televisa-produced content.In this year’s upfront presentation, Univision reported commercial sales between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. “There’s no question that our dollar-volume growth was largely due to some of these major branded entertainment sponsorships that we sold,” Mr. Lawenda said.“I think the ultimate possibility is actually to create an entire novela with an advertising partner,” said Mr. Lovinger, of Telemundo. According to Adweek, Telemundo reported a 20 percent increase in upfront sales from last year, to around $400 million.'"
"'11-08-29,'1','“After coming out of the ’09 recession,” he said, luxury travelers “are psychologically prepared to take the wild gyrations of the stock market in stride. We don’t expect there to be an impact on high-end leisure and business travelers because of short-term stock market changes.”Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, said now was a “great time” for Starwood to promote the Luxury Collection, because luxury lodging demand in the United States would increase more than 5 percent this year.“Volatility in the stock market has become the new norm among higher-income travelers. Their underlying wealth has not changed to the point where it would affect their lifestyle issues,” he added.The five full-page executions of the new campaign, by the photographer David Prince, feature different hotels in the Luxury Collection, including beach and golf resorts and others with old-world European or contemporary design.The ad for the golf resorts contains framed photographs of the Equinox in Vermont, the Al Maha Desert Resort and Spa in Dubai, and the Turnberry Resort in Scotland, as well as golf clubs, a golf trophy and a small wooden boat model representing activities available at the resorts.Another ad, meant to promote the brand in general, features all types of hotels in Mexico, Italy, India, the United States and Peru. Souvenirs and decorative items in this ad include coral, a starfish, a clock, a small statue, a glass of wine and golf tees.All ads also feature a selection of books whose spines face outward; instead of titles, these show the names of the hotels in the ads’ framed snapshots. Mr. Prince said the campaign “is about the trigger points that stimulate your emotions and your memories, and the moments that inspire us when we travel.”Most luxury hotel advertising, he added, tries “to present the big picture, your room, your bedding, where you’re going to eat,” but the new Luxury Collection campaign is “about the personal touches that make a hotel great, the elements that resonate and inspire you.”Starwood ran a full-page teaser version of the new advertising in the May issue of The Financial Times’s “How to Spend It” magazine and in the July issue of Departures. The ads will run this fall in both publications, and this fall and winter in Condé Nast Traveller UK, ForbesLife, Robb Report, Bentley Magazine and Luxury Travel Advisor, a trade publication.In addition, banner versions of the advertising will run on the Web site of the Five Star Alliance, an online travel agency specializing in luxury hotels, and on the tablet version of the 40th anniversary edition of Travel & Leisure.Individual hotels within the Luxury Collection also have the option to customize the advertising, inserting photographs of their choice into the frames in the brand advertising. So far, hotels in Mauritius, Portugal, Argentina and Greece have opted to do this.The budget for the global print campaign is $400,000, while the budget for online advertising, both for the brand globally and for its North American hotels, is $300,000. Neither figure includes advertising by individual hotels.Promoting hotel collections like the Luxury Collection can be challenging, Mr. Hanson said, because they lack consistency in features, like design. “Therefore, themes become one of the core messages to establish the image of collections. The idea that life is a collection of experiences at the luxury level is a good theme,” he said.Henry Harteveldt, travel analyst for Forrester Research, said the advertising was “unimpressive because it’s not distinctive. You could cover up the logo, and it could be advertising for almost any high-end luxury hotel.”“They talk about experience, but there are no pictures of people, no experiences shown. It’s too obtuse. This is not the kind of ad campaign that will cause Web sites to hum and phones to ring,” he added.Similarly, Andrew Sacks, president of AgencySacks, a New York branding and marketing agency for the affluent market, said that although “the strategy certainly makes sense, they’ve made the ads a little unemotional. It gives me a taste of what a Luxury Collection hotel looks like, but it doesn’t necessarily help me understand what the experience of staying there would be.”'"

"'11-08-29,'1','Unfortunately, the moral of Sampras’s 6-7 (7), 7-6 (2), 7-6 (2), 7-6 (5) victory was lost, especially to the next generation of Americans now struggling for traction in a sport dominated by Europeans.Sampras, 30, wore baggy white shorts. Agassi, 31, was dressed in black. The clothing amplified the personalities that were as different as Roger Federer’s and Rafael Nadal’s. But it was disparate playing styles that defined their careers relative to the list of all-timers.“Two great players playing great at the same time,” Sampras said, recalling the match in a recent telephone interview. “That doesn’t often happen.”Under breezy conditions, Sampras reminded everyone of what usually happened when the great serve-and-volley player brought his A game to a match against the classic counterpuncher. Sampras — who finished 20-14 against Agassi for his career, 6-3 in Grand Slam events and 4-1 in Slam finals — won it by knocking off three straight tie breakers after dropping the first.“You’ve got to do more than hold your serve, I guess, huh?” Agassi said after doing so in 24 straight games.“Andre wasn’t a big server, but he was an unbelievably smart server,” said Paul Annacone, then Sampras’s coach and now Federer’s. “He was similar to Roger in that sense, though not as big, but Andre may have been the best at the combination of first serve and strike. If you didn’t do something with the return, he hit the ball so cleanly and then you were never going to be in the point.”That night, Sampras served 25 aces to Agassi’s 18, not a terribly relevant statistic in an all-tie-breaker match that was decided by a winner here, an unforced error there. As the players rose for the fourth-set tie breaker after three and a half magnificent hours, the crowd of 23,033 at Arthur Ashe Stadium rose for an ovation that almost moved Sampras to tears.“That was the first time I was ever affected by a crowd to the point where it got me out of a match mentally,” he said.Not for long, though. Struggling with his conditioning at that point in his career, Sampras was exhausted and knew that a fifth set would favor Agassi, a fitness freak. But leading by 3-1, Agassi put a makeable forehand into the net, and Sampras the opportunist ran off five straight points before sending everyone home after midnight on his third match point.“Win the thing,” Agassi whispered in Sampras’s ear when they shook hands at the net. Sampras didn’t, losing in the final to Hewitt, but he came back the next year to beat Agassi in the final for his 14th career major, again in four sets. Agassi won the 2003 Australian Open for the eighth Grand Slam title of his career. Roddick won his first and only Grand Slam event in New York that summer, and no American man has won one since.In Sampras’s informed opinion, the country has lost its collective nerve, given in to the belief that technology has made serve-and-volley an impractical and antiquated tactic.“You hear it over and over — the rackets are too strong, the guys hit the ball from the baseline too hard, the Wimbledon grass is too slow — and I get tired of hearing it,” he said. “If there is a problem with serve-and-volley, it’s that it takes time to develop. It’s a progression. It takes patience. It takes a willingness to sacrifice matches in the juniors that parents don’t want to make.“But when they say you can’t play serve-and-volley in today’s era, I think that’s a lot of malarkey. I look at Nadal standing 10 feet behind the baseline, and as great as he is getting to balls, I’d take my chances kicking him out wide and coming in behind it.”Alas, Sampras is resigned to serve-and-volley being “pretty much extinct, basically gone,” along with the opportunity for young Americans to play to their fast hardcourt strength and create their own tour niche.In his 2001 match against Agassi, one of the game’s greatest returners, the acrobatic Sampras went to the net behind not only his first serve, but also his second. If his first serve was not enough of a weapon, his second was a well-disguised mix of power, placement, guile and guts.If there is going to be another Sampras, he had better have great athleticism to match his grand ambition.“What I always try to explain to my friends who don’t know tennis that well is that it’s a lot like pitching and hitting,” Annacone said. “In baseball you’re a really good hitter if you hit .300. Roll that over to tennis and to Pete and Andre. If they both play well, do their thing, Pete is the pitcher and Andre is the catcher, who has to react. It makes sense that the guy with the ball in his hand would have the advantage.”Not by much on that memorable quarterfinal night in 2001. But enough to send a message about the breaks and basics of the game that few of his countrymen apparently wanted to hear.'"
"'11-08-29,'1','The Yankees hit three home runs in succession in the sixth inning as they broke the game open, providing Ivan Nova (14-4) the cushion he needed to cruise to a well-deserved victory.Robinson Cano hit a two-run homer, his 23rd, Nick Swisher followed with his fifth home run in his last six games, and Andruw Jones capped the outburst with his 11th homer of the season.It was the first time since May 20, 2009, that the Yankees had hit three homers in a row. On that day it was Swisher, Cano and Melky Cabrera, and it also came against the Orioles.The power surge was a welcome return to form for the Yankees, who were shutout in the first game to lose for the fourth time in five games. They failed to get a runner to second base, and their inability to score meant an undeserved loss for Bartolo Colon, who pitched very well to counter the argument that he is fatigued from the increase in innings he has pitched this season.Colon could not have pitched much better through the first six innings, when he allowed only two hits and faced just one batter over the minimum. With impeccable command of his fastball, and a sinker he threw more often and with more authority, as the Yankees had asked him to do, Colon pitched as well as he had in a month.“He was able to throw the fastball wherever I put the glove,” Francisco Cervelli said.He allowed one run in the seventh and another in the eighth. In seven and two-thirds innings, he allowed two runs and seven hits. He also struck out four, but walked no one.In the seventh Nick Markakis doubled and Vladimir Guerrero hit a backdoor sinker to right field to drive in the first run of the game. The Orioles scored again in the eighth with the benefit of two softly hit singles.The loss was Colon’s first this season in an afternoon start. His record in daytime starts is 6-1 with a 1.88 earned run average, which was why Girardi switched him with Nova.Girardi said before Sunday’s first game that he had hoped to reduce the starting rotation to five from six after A. J. Burnett’s next start Thursday against the Boston Red Sox, but gave no indication who might get the demotion. Burnett would be a likely candidate, considering his E.R.A. in August is 11.91 and he has looked terrible his last two outings.""We need him to pitch better, that’s the bottom line,” Girardi said, “So Thursday, or whatever day it is, is a big start.”Before Sunday there had also been some concern that Colon might be tiring as the season progressed considering he had already thrown more innings, 131, than he had in any season since 2005. Fatigue did not appear to be a problem Sunday.“I really don’t feel tired,” he said. “Every time I pitch I won’t pitch the same. Sometimes I’m going to get hit and sometimes I’m going to pitch the way I did today.”Nova pitched well, also, allowing three runs and seven hits over seven innings. But perhaps the best performance of the night belonged to relief pitcher David Robertson, who masterfully pitched his way out of a jam with the bases loaded and nobody out in the eighth.Robertson struck out Vladimir Guerrero, Mark Reynolds and Ryan Adams to get out of what could have been a game-altering inning. Robertson has now struck out 23 batters in his career in 45 at-bats with the bases loaded.Even in a game where power carried the Yankees to victory, it was a vital example of clutch pitching by Robertson to preserve a needed victory.After fouling a ball off his right knee in the first game Sunday, Derek Jeter sat out of the second game with a contusion of the knee. He had X-rays, which were negative, and Joe Girardi said the knee was really sore and Jeter would be questionable for Monday’s game against the Orioles. By playing in the first game Jeter passed Mickey Mantle for most games played by a Yankee, with 2,402.  “I’ve always taken pride in doing my job,” said Jeter, who played his first game for the Yankees in 1995. “I think that’s probably the best way to put it. My job is obviously to come and play games, try to stay on the field and try to stay healthy. I’ve done it for a long time.” Earlier this season Jeter became the first Yankee to collect 3,000 hits. ... Alex Rodriguez also did not play the second game because his sore left thumb was acting up. “Today it got a lot more sore than it necessarily had been in the last few days,” Girardi said. He was also questionable for Monday.'"
"'11-08-29,'1','With Pistorius advancing, reporters were soon questioning his competitors on how they felt about his presence, which was not without irony, considering that one of those being interviewed was LaShawn Merritt, the defending world champion in the 400 from the United States, who recently returned from a 21-month doping suspension.“I really don’t know what has been studied, what has been going on with that whole thing,” Merritt said of Pistorius’s prosthetics. “I’ve seen him run. He’s getting better every time he runs, and he’s been working. I’m all about somebody who’s working and slowly progressing, and that’s what he’s doing. And I wish all the best for him.”He should not, however, consider him a threat for the title at this stage. Merritt has run only twice since returning to the sport last month in Stockholm. But he has been familiarly fast on both occasions, running 44.74 in Stockholm and then recording the year’s fastest time — 44.35 seconds — to win his heat Sunday.“It was pretty hard,” he said of his nearly two-year suspension. “I had some athletes come in from time to time to help me on different things. Mentally, I knew I was going to run eventually one day, so I just had to continue with training, and I guess if you put my mental toughness with the training I’ve been doing, I feel pretty confident.”Merritt had taken clear command of the 400 before his suspension, surpassing his longtime rival Jeremy Wariner and winning the 2009 world championship in Berlin. Merritt attributed his positive test to a steroid found in a male enhancement product, and his two-year ban was eventually reduced after a ruling that his doping was not a deliberate attempt to cheat.For now, Merritt is still not eligible according to International Olympic Committee rules to compete in the Olympics next year in London. That is because of the I.O.C. rule that bars athletes from competing in the next Games if they have received a drug ban of longer than six months in the previous Olympic cycle.But that I.O.C. rule is now under review by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.“Big case,” Merritt said on Sunday before downplaying its immediate import. “It ain’t in my mind at all; I have to get past this first,” he said. “If I start thinking about that now, I won’t be able to run tomorrow.”It was a much more discouraging day for another defending champion as Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia lost the first 10,000-meter race of his phenomenal career. But Bekele, who had not raced in 19 months, could not even manage to complete this one. After losing touch with the lead pack shortly past the midway point — a slightly surreal sight for those who have followed Bekele through the years — he slowly came to a halt, reached down and rubbed his leg and then walked off the track.Bekele, now 29, had won four straight world championships in the 10,000, but like his Ethiopian role model, Haile Gebrselassie, he failed to win the fifth. Leg injuries played a role in both streaks’ ending. Gebrselassie had not raced in more than a year when he lost in Edmonton, Alberta, in 2001. Bekele had not raced since January of last year because of a calf problem but still decided to try to defend his title here. It appears unlikely that he will try to run the 5,000, scheduled for Thursday, and with the marathon in his long-range plans, it is uncertain when (or if) he will run another 10,000.Even with Bekele faltering, it was still a resurgent evening for Ethiopia after Kenya’s clean sweep of the medals on Saturday in the women’s marathon and women’s 10,000. Bekele’s Ethiopian compatriot Ibrahim Jeilan ended up winning the race that Bekele could not, surging past Mo Farah of Britain with 50 meters to go to win in 27 minutes, 13.81 seconds. Farah, much improved under the tutelage of new American coach Alberto Salazar, took the silver in 27:14.07 and another Ethiopian, Imane Merga, took the bronze in 27:19.14.China won its first gold here when Li Yanfeng won the women’s discus over Nadine Muller of Germany with a second throw that sailed 66.52 meters. Muller could throw no farther than 65.97, and Yarelys Barrios of Cuba was third at 65.73.The United States won two gold medals on Sunday as Brittney Reese defended her title in the women’s long jump with a jump of 6.82 meters and Trey Hardee defended his title in the decathlon with a 10-event total of 8607 points. Ashton Eaton, Hardee’s rising 23-year-old American teammate, took the silver with 8,505 points after a gutsy run in the last event, the 1,500 meters, that allowed him — barely — to pass Leonel Suárez of Cuba. Eaton needed to be five seconds faster than Suárez in the 1,500, and he managed it with about two tenths of a second and four points to spare. It was the first time that decathletes from the same nation finished 1-2 at the world championships.Yet, that first in the late evening was not quite as momentous as Pistorius’s first much earlier in the day, but then Pistorius, whose lower legs were amputated when he was an infant, has been testing himself against able-bodied athletes in everything from tennis to water polo to rugby union since he was a boy growing up in South Africa.“I feel like any other athlete here,” he said. “I know each person here works extremely hard to do what they do. They sacrifice time away from their families. They put their bodies through things that sometimes you would think you’d feel like giving up, and they just go forward. There are thousands of them. I don’t really feel like a pioneer, but I’m very honored to be in the position I’m in.”'"
"'11-08-29,'1','Exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and Nasdaq, BATS Trading and Direct Edge, the nation’s big electronic exchanges, have their computer centers based in New Jersey, where they also have robust backup centers that survived the storm.Nasdaq said it had moved some staff members to alternative sites ahead of the storm but was now ready to open its market as usual Monday. Rather than force employees to commute into Manhattan, however, it would start by operating its exchange from one of its parallel centers in an undisclosed location.The New York Stock Exchange was last closed for a weather-related reason in 1996 because of a snow storm. It was also closed for a day in 1985 during Hurricane Gloria.Before the weekend, Wall Street’s banks were putting in place contingency plans, talking to regulators and asking employees to check systems they could use for trading from home.

"'11-08-29,'1','TOKYO — In the brief race to choose Japan’s next prime minister, five candidates vied Sunday for support within the governing Democratic Party, but none of them appeared to have a decisive lead going into Monday’s vote.The campaign began on Friday after Prime Minister Naoto Kan announced his resignation. It has so far failed to grip the nation, which has had five prime ministers since Junichiro Koizumi stepped down in September 2006. Most of the current candidates are relative unknowns and seem to be short on concrete ideas for directing this rudderless country.The winner of the party vote will face a host of daunting tasks. Foremost among them: rebuilding the earthquake- and tsunami-devastated northeast, mitigating the damage caused by the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, and finding ways to pay for those efforts while halting the rise of the yen, reining in the ballooning national debt and ending two decades of economic malaise.It could also be the last chance for the Democrats, who ended a half-century of virtual one-party rule by the Liberal Democrats two years ago with promises to revitalize Japan, only to flounder under the indecisive leadership of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama. His successor, Mr. Kan, was forced out over his perceived failure to lead an effective response to the triple disaster in March.The policy debates ahead of the vote have focused on whether to eliminate nuclear power and how to finance a reconstruction that could cost a quarter of a trillion dollars. But the most divisive issue has been whether to rehabilitate the party’s fallen kingmaker, Ichiro Ozawa, who controls more than 100 lawmakers, the party’s largest faction.Mr. Ozawa is a skilled political operator who could help the often hapless Democrats get things done, but whose style of backroom deal-making has made him intensely unpopular by the Japanese public. A political financing scandal forced the party to revoke Mr. Ozawa’s voting rights, and Mr. Kan for the most part excluded him and his faction from the government.'"

They can also download music from the Chase commercials and enter a contest to win a behind-the-scenes tour of the Telemundo studios. Mr. Lovinger described the strategy as “organic, but pervasive.”Telemundo’s biggest competitor, Univision Communications, also has ramped up its product placements with advertisers like General Motors and Domino’s pizza incorporated directly into story lines for its show “Eva Luna,” about an advertising agency.For a promotion involving the Buick Regal last season, the show’s lead character wins the account and shows the Buick team a commercial the agency created. That same commercial aired on the network and its affiliates apart from the show. In other episodes, the characters were shown ordering pizza from Domino’s for a late-night work session.“It can’t be contrived, it has to be real,” said Steve Tihanyi, the director of branded entertainment and marketing alliances at General Motors. “In a way it was art imitating life, or life imitating art.”General Motors will also feature its cars in a new Univision telenovela called “Talisman.”“As integration has become more and more important for our advertising partners we keep raising the bar on what solutions we can offer,” said David Lawenda, president of advertising sales and marketing for Univision.Until January, the network carried programming created by the Mexican TV giant Televisa, which limited options for brand integration since the shows were already filmed before being distributed through Univision. Because of the partnership with Televisa, Univision can now work on product placement in Televisa-produced content.In this year’s upfront presentation, Univision reported commercial sales between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. “There’s no question that our dollar-volume growth was largely due to some of these major branded entertainment sponsorships that we sold,” Mr. Lawenda said.“I think the ultimate possibility is actually to create an entire novela with an advertising partner,” said Mr. Lovinger, of Telemundo. According to Adweek, Telemundo reported a 20 percent increase in upfront sales from last year, to around $400 million.'"

Rather than force employees to commute into Manhattan, however, it would start by operating its exchange from one of its parallel centers in an undisclosed location.The New York Stock Exchange was last closed for a weather-related reason in 1996 because of a snow storm.

"'11-08-29,'1','The new visa rules were announced in a speech to Parliament in March by Home Secretary Theresa May, in which she said the government was “cracking down on bogus colleges” and “bogus students.” The first of the changes went into effect in April, with more restrictions to be imposed through April 2012.Reducing immigration has been a major policy issue for David Cameron’s Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government since it came to power in 2010. In a speech made in September of that year, Immigration Minister Damian Green said that although Britain benefited from immigration, “unsustainable levels of net migration seen in recent years must be brought down.”But the British Home Office subsequently released a report in June saying that the British economy stood to lose £1.3 billion to £3.6 billion, or $2.1 billion to $5.8 billion, over the next four years, largely as a result of lost productivity from foreign students, graduates and their dependents.Universities also stand to lose £170 million from tuition fees, while the UK Border Agency would lose £160 million in visa processing fees, the report said.A spokeswoman for the UK Border Agency, which is responsible for carrying out the government’s immigration policy, said in a statement that the estimate focused only on student and graduate jobs, which could be filled by British workers, and explained the need for visa reform.“A significant proportion of the impact is due to less work being done by students, poststudy workers, and their dependants,” said the spokeswoman, who declined to give her name, following agency policy. “This is a worse-case scenario dependent on this work not being filled by the U.K. labor market.”“The old student visa regime,” she added, “was open to widespread abuse and failed to protect legitimate students from being exploited by poor quality colleges.”Gina Hobson, chief executive of the British Accreditation Council, an independent accreditation body for independent colleges, said the changes could have an effect the institutions in the future.“We’re aware of a couple of other institutions that have decided that it’s no longer viable to run,” she said this month in a telephone interview.“Given the impact the immigration policies will have on the sector, I expect to see further closures in the private education sector, which may include institutions with partnerships with U.K. universities,” Ms. Hobson said.Under the new, more stringent framework of “educational oversight,” all higher education institutions will be required to obtain so-called Highly Trusted Sponsor status from a much smaller list of official accreditation bodies before they can sponsor prospective foreign students for their visa applications.Highly Trusted Sponsor status requires institutions to satisfy criteria like minimum enrollment rates and course completion rates, as well as being subject to periodic inspections by the British Home Office.The British Accreditation Council is one of several independent bodies that will lose their power to accredit higher education institutions.Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, a body representing Britain’s public universities, said the further impact would be unclear.“It remains to be seen what long-term impact these changes will have on the numbers of international students applying to come to study at U.K. universities,” she said this month in a statement.According to the British Home Office, the education industry is worth £40 billion annually to the British economy, of which international students contribute £12.5 billion.In 2010, a total of 334,815 student visas were issued by the British government, but the British Home Office has predicted that the new measures will result in 67,000 fewer per year.'"
"'11-08-29,'1','“I didn’t really think they were going to kick him out; I mean, they have him on every poster,” said Walter Dix of the United States, who was in the adjacent Lane 4. “It was kind of surreal, but I had to refocus and get back in there.”Jamaica still ended up with the gold medal. With Lane 5 empty, Bolt’s 21-year-old training partner, Yohan Blake, won the gold by a clear margin in 9.92 seconds. Dix managed to catch the fast-starting Collins at the finish line to take the silver by one-hundredth of a second in 10.08 seconds, a time that was — perhaps appropriately on this Bolt-free night — from another, less fast and flamboyant era.“It was shocking that Usain jumped,” Dix said. “I’m satisfied that I put U.S.A. back on the medal stand, but it was a sloppy race for me.”At least he got to race. Bolt has been track’s essential figure since the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, where he swept the 100 and 200 in world-record times, then broke another record with his Jamaican teammates in the 4x100 relay. One year later at the world championships in Berlin, Bolt kept mugging for the crowd and broke the 100 and 200 records again on his way to three more gold medals. He ended up celebrating until the wee hours in a Berlin disco.“My goal is to become a legend,” he said, hardly for the first time, before this meet.For Bolt, becoming a legend means consistent domination, meant defending his titles from Beijing and Berlin.As his sport debates anew the merits of the draconian false-start rule that came into force in 2010, Bolt will now have to settle for trying to defend his 200 title this week.Not that he was in any mood to share his revised hopes and dreams Sunday.Hardly reticent in general, he chose to skip a meeting with the news media. Instead, he headed into the muggy night and out of Daegu Stadium, most of whose occupants had come to watch him be the Bolt they had seen on television and in the flesh (he ran and won in Daegu in a meet before these championships).“Looking for tears? Not going to happen,” Bolt said later, according to The Associated Press.But even without tears, there was no mistaking Bolt’s angst.“I wouldn’t be happy if I was defending champion and lose like that,” said Collins, the 2003 world champion in the 100. “You want to lose like a man. You don’t want to go out like that, so I don’t think he’s very happy, and I think he’s going to have a lot to prove in that 200 meters.”Collins certainly proved something Sunday. This is his ninth world championship, and he is now the oldest men’s 100-meter medalist in meet history. It required quite a set of circumstances, including Asafa Powell’s withdrawal with a groin injury before the meet and Bolt’s false start.When Bolt went out, did Collins start thinking about a medal? “Hell, yes,” he practically shouted, covering his mouth as he laughed.But as delighted as he was with his surprising prize, Collins said he was also against the relatively new rule that helped make it happen.“I mean come on, one simple mistake and he’s out?” Collins said. “The fans all over the world, not just in Korea, they’re sad. They want to see Usain Bolt win because that’s the man that’s been doing it and doing it and doing it, and they want to see him do it again. That’s the way it goes, but we’ll see what happens. Maybe they’ll change the rule because of him.”“Not because of him,” Collins said. “But because of what it’s doing to the sport.”Until 2003, athletes were disqualified after making a second false start, which is how the defending Olympic champion Linford Christie was eliminated from the final of the 1996 Games in Atlanta, which until now ranked as track’s highest-profile false start.But a revised rule, approved in 2001 and put in for 2003, allowed the field one false start. Any subsequent false start would immediately disqualify the athlete in question. That caused almost immediate controversy at the 2003 world championships, when Powell and the American Jon Drummond were disqualified from a quarterfinal heat for false-starting. Drummond protested by lying down on the track, and was later disqualified from the entire meet by track’s governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations.The revised rule stood until 2010, when the current rule came into effect. It requires any athlete in any race who false-starts to be disqualified. There have been several in two days of competition here. Christine Ohuruogu of Britain was eliminated in the heats of the women’s 400, and her British teammate Dwain Chambers went out the same way in the semifinals of the men’s 100.Then came Bolt, whose start has been his relative weakness and who was perhaps overeager to do something special in a season when his best time, 9.88 seconds, is only the sixth fastest in the world and three-tenths of a second slower than his world record.“We always hated the one-false-start rule,” said Grace Jackson, the former runner and team leader for Jamaica in Daegu, “and now we hate it even more.”'"
"'11-08-29,'1','“Record Industry Braces for Artists’ Battles Over Song Rights” (Arts pages, Aug. 16) tells only part of the story.Recording artists generally aren’t employees of the label. But recordings can be “works made for hire” (and therefore exempt from termination by artists) if (1) there was a signed agreement between the artist and the label that the recording would be a “work made for hire”; and (2) the recording falls into one of the categories that can qualify as commissioned works for hire under copyright law (for example, if it was created as a contribution to a collective work).Since most recording agreements provide that the recordings are “works made for hire,” future litigation will likely revolve around whether the recordings in dispute were created as contributions to collective works (and it will likely be argued that albums are such collective works), or otherwise fall into one of the specified categories.JUNE M.

"'11-08-29,'1','“After coming out of the ’09 recession,” he said, luxury travelers “are psychologically prepared to take the wild gyrations of the stock market in stride. We don’t expect there to be an impact on high-end leisure and business travelers because of short-term stock market changes.”Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, said now was a “great time” for Starwood to promote the Luxury Collection, because luxury lodging demand in the United States would increase more than 5 percent this year.“Volatility in the stock market has become the new norm among higher-income travelers. Their underlying wealth has not changed to the point where it would affect their lifestyle issues,” he added.The five full-page executions of the new campaign, by the photographer David Prince, feature different hotels in the Luxury Collection, including beach and golf resorts and others with old-world European or contemporary design.The ad for the golf resorts contains framed photographs of the Equinox in Vermont, the Al Maha Desert Resort and Spa in Dubai, and the Turnberry Resort in Scotland, as well as golf clubs, a golf trophy and a small wooden boat model representing activities available at the resorts.Another ad, meant to promote the brand in general, features all types of hotels in Mexico, Italy, India, the United States and Peru. Souvenirs and decorative items in this ad include coral, a starfish, a clock, a small statue, a glass of wine and golf tees.All ads also feature a selection of books whose spines face outward; instead of titles, these show the names of the hotels in the ads’ framed snapshots. Mr. Prince said the campaign “is about the trigger points that stimulate your emotions and your memories, and the moments that inspire us when we travel.”Most luxury hotel advertising, he added, tries “to present the big picture, your room, your bedding, where you’re going to eat,” but the new Luxury Collection campaign is “about the personal touches that make a hotel great, the elements that resonate and inspire you.”Starwood ran a full-page teaser version of the new advertising in the May issue of The Financial Times’s “How to Spend It” magazine and in the July issue of Departures. The ads will run this fall in both publications, and this fall and winter in Condé Nast Traveller UK, ForbesLife, Robb Report, Bentley Magazine and Luxury Travel Advisor, a trade publication.In addition, banner versions of the advertising will run on the Web site of the Five Star Alliance, an online travel agency specializing in luxury hotels, and on the tablet version of the 40th anniversary edition of Travel & Leisure.Individual hotels within the Luxury Collection also have the option to customize the advertising, inserting photographs of their choice into the frames in the brand advertising. So far, hotels in Mauritius, Portugal, Argentina and Greece have opted to do this.The budget for the global print campaign is $400,000, while the budget for online advertising, both for the brand globally and for its North American hotels, is $300,000. Neither figure includes advertising by individual hotels.Promoting hotel collections like the Luxury Collection can be challenging, Mr. Hanson said, because they lack consistency in features, like design. “Therefore, themes become one of the core messages to establish the image of collections. The idea that life is a collection of experiences at the luxury level is a good theme,” he said.Henry Harteveldt, travel analyst for Forrester Research, said the advertising was “unimpressive because it’s not distinctive. You could cover up the logo, and it could be advertising for almost any high-end luxury hotel.”“They talk about experience, but there are no pictures of people, no experiences shown. It’s too obtuse. This is not the kind of ad campaign that will cause Web sites to hum and phones to ring,” he added.Similarly, Andrew Sacks, president of AgencySacks, a New York branding and marketing agency for the affluent market, said that although “the strategy certainly makes sense, they’ve made the ads a little unemotional. It gives me a taste of what a Luxury Collection hotel looks like, but it doesn’t necessarily help me understand what the experience of staying there would be.”'"
"'11-08-29,'1','With Pistorius advancing, reporters were soon questioning his competitors on how they felt about his presence, which was not without irony, considering that one of those being interviewed was LaShawn Merritt, the defending world champion in the 400 from the United States, who recently returned from a 21-month doping suspension.“I really don’t know what has been studied, what has been going on with that whole thing,” Merritt said of Pistorius’s prosthetics. “I’ve seen him run. He’s getting better every time he runs, and he’s been working. I’m all about somebody who’s working and slowly progressing, and that’s what he’s doing. And I wish all the best for him.”He should not, however, consider him a threat for the title at this stage. Merritt has run only twice since returning to the sport last month in Stockholm. But he has been familiarly fast on both occasions, running 44.74 in Stockholm and then recording the year’s fastest time — 44.35 seconds — to win his heat Sunday.“It was pretty hard,” he said of his nearly two-year suspension. “I had some athletes come in from time to time to help me on different things. Mentally, I knew I was going to run eventually one day, so I just had to continue with training, and I guess if you put my mental toughness with the training I’ve been doing, I feel pretty confident.”Merritt had taken clear command of the 400 before his suspension, surpassing his longtime rival Jeremy Wariner and winning the 2009 world championship in Berlin. Merritt attributed his positive test to a steroid found in a male enhancement product, and his two-year ban was eventually reduced after a ruling that his doping was not a deliberate attempt to cheat.For now, Merritt is still not eligible according to International Olympic Committee rules to compete in the Olympics next year in London. That is because of the I.O.C. rule that bars athletes from competing in the next Games if they have received a drug ban of longer than six months in the previous Olympic cycle.But that I.O.C. rule is now under review by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.“Big case,” Merritt said on Sunday before downplaying its immediate import. “It ain’t in my mind at all; I have to get past this first,” he said. “If I start thinking about that now, I won’t be able to run tomorrow.”It was a much more discouraging day for another defending champion as Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia lost the first 10,000-meter race of his phenomenal career. But Bekele, who had not raced in 19 months, could not even manage to complete this one. After losing touch with the lead pack shortly past the midway point — a slightly surreal sight for those who have followed Bekele through the years — he slowly came to a halt, reached down and rubbed his leg and then walked off the track.Bekele, now 29, had won four straight world championships in the 10,000, but like his Ethiopian role model, Haile Gebrselassie, he failed to win the fifth. Leg injuries played a role in both streaks’ ending. Gebrselassie had not raced in more than a year when he lost in Edmonton, Alberta, in 2001. Bekele had not raced since January of last year because of a calf problem but still decided to try to defend his title here. It appears unlikely that he will try to run the 5,000, scheduled for Thursday, and with the marathon in his long-range plans, it is uncertain when (or if) he will run another 10,000.Even with Bekele faltering, it was still a resurgent evening for Ethiopia after Kenya’s clean sweep of the medals on Saturday in the women’s marathon and women’s 10,000. Bekele’s Ethiopian compatriot Ibrahim Jeilan ended up winning the race that Bekele could not, surging past Mo Farah of Britain with 50 meters to go to win in 27 minutes, 13.81 seconds. Farah, much improved under the tutelage of new American coach Alberto Salazar, took the silver in 27:14.07 and another Ethiopian, Imane Merga, took the bronze in 27:19.14.China won its first gold here when Li Yanfeng won the women’s discus over Nadine Muller of Germany with a second throw that sailed 66.52 meters. Muller could throw no farther than 65.97, and Yarelys Barrios of Cuba was third at 65.73.The United States won two gold medals on Sunday as Brittney Reese defended her title in the women’s long jump with a jump of 6.82 meters and Trey Hardee defended his title in the decathlon with a 10-event total of 8607 points. Ashton Eaton, Hardee’s rising 23-year-old American teammate, took the silver with 8,505 points after a gutsy run in the last event, the 1,500 meters, that allowed him — barely — to pass Leonel Suárez of Cuba. Eaton needed to be five seconds faster than Suárez in the 1,500, and he managed it with about two tenths of a second and four points to spare. It was the first time that decathletes from the same nation finished 1-2 at the world championships.Yet, that first in the late evening was not quite as momentous as Pistorius’s first much earlier in the day, but then Pistorius, whose lower legs were amputated when he was an infant, has been testing himself against able-bodied athletes in everything from tennis to water polo to rugby union since he was a boy growing up in South Africa.“I feel like any other athlete here,” he said. “I know each person here works extremely hard to do what they do. They sacrifice time away from their families. They put their bodies through things that sometimes you would think you’d feel like giving up, and they just go forward. There are thousands of them. I don’t really feel like a pioneer, but I’m very honored to be in the position I’m in.”'"
"'11-08-29,'1','The Yankees hit three home runs in succession in the sixth inning as they broke the game open, providing Ivan Nova (14-4) the cushion he needed to cruise to a well-deserved victory.Robinson Cano hit a two-run homer, his 23rd, Nick Swisher followed with his fifth home run in his last six games, and Andruw Jones capped the outburst with his 11th homer of the season.It was the first time since May 20, 2009, that the Yankees had hit three homers in a row. On that day it was Swisher, Cano and Melky Cabrera, and it also came against the Orioles.The power surge was a welcome return to form for the Yankees, who were shutout in the first game to lose for the fourth time in five games. They failed to get a runner to second base, and their inability to score meant an undeserved loss for Bartolo Colon, who pitched very well to counter the argument that he is fatigued from the increase in innings he has pitched this season.Colon could not have pitched much better through the first six innings, when he allowed only two hits and faced just one batter over the minimum. With impeccable command of his fastball, and a sinker he threw more often and with more authority, as the Yankees had asked him to do, Colon pitched as well as he had in a month.“He was able to throw the fastball wherever I put the glove,” Francisco Cervelli said.He allowed one run in the seventh and another in the eighth. In seven and two-thirds innings, he allowed two runs and seven hits. He also struck out four, but walked no one.In the seventh Nick Markakis doubled and Vladimir Guerrero hit a backdoor sinker to right field to drive in the first run of the game. The Orioles scored again in the eighth with the benefit of two softly hit singles.The loss was Colon’s first this season in an afternoon start. His record in daytime starts is 6-1 with a 1.88 earned run average, which was why Girardi switched him with Nova.Girardi said before Sunday’s first game that he had hoped to reduce the starting rotation to five from six after A. J. Burnett’s next start Thursday against the Boston Red Sox, but gave no indication who might get the demotion. Burnett would be a likely candidate, considering his E.R.A. in August is 11.91 and he has looked terrible his last two outings.""We need him to pitch better, that’s the bottom line,” Girardi said, “So Thursday, or whatever day it is, is a big start.”Before Sunday there had also been some concern that Colon might be tiring as the season progressed considering he had already thrown more innings, 131, than he had in any season since 2005. Fatigue did not appear to be a problem Sunday.“I really don’t feel tired,” he said. “Every time I pitch I won’t pitch the same. Sometimes I’m going to get hit and sometimes I’m going to pitch the way I did today.”Nova pitched well, also, allowing three runs and seven hits over seven innings. But perhaps the best performance of the night belonged to relief pitcher David Robertson, who masterfully pitched his way out of a jam with the bases loaded and nobody out in the eighth.Robertson struck out Vladimir Guerrero, Mark Reynolds and Ryan Adams to get out of what could have been a game-altering inning. Robertson has now struck out 23 batters in his career in 45 at-bats with the bases loaded.Even in a game where power carried the Yankees to victory, it was a vital example of clutch pitching by Robertson to preserve a needed victory.After fouling a ball off his right knee in the first game Sunday, Derek Jeter sat out of the second game with a contusion of the knee. He had X-rays, which were negative, and Joe Girardi said the knee was really sore and Jeter would be questionable for Monday’s game against the Orioles. By playing in the first game Jeter passed Mickey Mantle for most games played by a Yankee, with 2,402.  “I’ve always taken pride in doing my job,” said Jeter, who played his first game for the Yankees in 1995. “I think that’s probably the best way to put it. My job is obviously to come and play games, try to stay on the field and try to stay healthy. I’ve done it for a long time.” Earlier this season Jeter became the first Yankee to collect 3,000 hits. ... Alex Rodriguez also did not play the second game because his sore left thumb was acting up. “Today it got a lot more sore than it necessarily had been in the last few days,” Girardi said. He was also questionable for Monday.'"
"'11-08-29,'1','After focusing on the pill, Dr. Edwards acted more forcefully than any previous commissioner by removing a host of products from the shelves, at least temporarily. These included highly publicized cases of vichyssoise suspected of carrying botulism and mercury-tainted swordfish and tuna.Dr. Edwards also oversaw the introduction of nutrition labels on foods, a consumer-protection campaign that was originally voluntary, though many food processors followed the guidelines. After 1990, expanded nutritional information on labels was required.Dr. Edwards’s flurry of activity followed a period of disarray at the agency, which had three commissioners in the three years before he arrived. He successfully lobbied to double the budget and reorganized its management structure.He also struggled to maintain a regulatory balance between protecting consumers’ health and guarding against hurting the economic health of industry, a juggling act prescribed by law. He worried that “we can with a stroke of a pen wipe out an industry.” Consumer advocates said that despite his toughness he could have done more to enforce the new laws in the public’s interest.After three years of leading the F.D.A., Dr. Edwards was promoted in March 1973 to assistant secretary of health in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, making him, in effect, the medical czar of the Nixon administration. He supervised the Public Health Service, the surgeon general, the National Institutes of Health and the F.D.A.At H.E.W., as it was commonly known, he gave greater independence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and folded the semi-autonomous National Institute of Mental Health into the National Institutes of Health. In 1975, however, having stayed on to serve under President Gerald R. Ford after Nixon’s resignation, Dr. Edwards quit in protest over budget cuts to health programs that would especially hurt the poor and unemployed. He said the Ford administration’s plans to shift costs to the states were particularly damaging.Charles Cornell Edwards was born on Sept. 16, 1923, in Overton, Neb., and grew up in Kearney, Neb., where his father was a country doctor. He attended Princeton before transferring to the University of Colorado, where he earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees. After a medical internship in Minneapolis, he worked at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.He was later a Marine medical officer in Korea and earned a master’s degree in surgery from the University of Minnesota before taking up a general surgical practice in Des Moines. In the 1960s he was a manager for the American Medical Association and a vice president of Booz Allen Hamilton, the management consulting firm. He also taught at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington.After leaving government in 1975, Dr. Edwards worked for private companies, including Becton, Dickinson & Company, a New Jersey medical device maker. Two years later he moved to the La Jolla area of San Diego to become president and chief executive of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, a predecessor of the Scripps Research Institute, a leader in biomedical research.He ultimately led the Scripps Institutions of Medicine and Science, building it into a large regional health care concern with 1,600 physicians and 6,200 employees.After retiring from Scripps in 1993, he was president and chief executive of the California Healthcare Institute, a research and advocacy organization for California’s biomedical industry, until 1995.Dr. Edwards is survived by his wife of 66 years, the former Sue Cowles Kruidenier; three sons, Timothy, Charles Jr. and David; a daughter, Nancy Edwards Schned; and eight grandchildren.'"
"'11-08-29,'1','TOKYO — In the brief race to choose Japan’s next prime minister, five candidates vied Sunday for support within the governing Democratic Party, but none of them appeared to have a decisive lead going into Monday’s vote.The campaign began on Friday after Prime Minister Naoto Kan announced his resignation. It has so far failed to grip the nation, which has had five prime ministers since Junichiro Koizumi stepped down in September 2006. Most of the current candidates are relative unknowns and seem to be short on concrete ideas for directing this rudderless country.The winner of the party vote will face a host of daunting tasks. Foremost among them: rebuilding the earthquake- and tsunami-devastated northeast, mitigating the damage caused by the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, and finding ways to pay for those efforts while halting the rise of the yen, reining in the ballooning national debt and ending two decades of economic malaise.It could also be the last chance for the Democrats, who ended a half-century of virtual one-party rule by the Liberal Democrats two years ago with promises to revitalize Japan, only to flounder under the indecisive leadership of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama. His successor, Mr. Kan, was forced out over his perceived failure to lead an effective response to the triple disaster in March.The policy debates ahead of the vote have focused on whether to eliminate nuclear power and how to finance a reconstruction that could cost a quarter of a trillion dollars. But the most divisive issue has been whether to rehabilitate the party’s fallen kingmaker, Ichiro Ozawa, who controls more than 100 lawmakers, the party’s largest faction.Mr. Ozawa is a skilled political operator who could help the often hapless Democrats get things done, but whose style of backroom deal-making has made him intensely unpopular by the Japanese public. A political financing scandal forced the party to revoke Mr. Ozawa’s voting rights, and Mr. Kan for the most part excluded him and his faction from the government.'"
"'11-08-29,'1','THE OFFENSE Hewitt’s left foot turns ever-so-slightly on his serve, which has led to disputed calls over the years, but none like this. In a five-set victory over James Blake in the second round in 2001, Hewitt was heard on Australian television saying to the tournament referee, “Mate, look at him, and you tell me what the similarity is.” Blake is African-American. So was the line judge in question.QUOTABLE “I don’t think I said anything racial out there,” Hewitt later told reporters.THE OFFENSE In the first round in 2008, Safin was whistled for crossing the imaginary center line, a rare foot-fault call, late in the fourth set of a match against Vince Spadea in which Safin ultimately prevailed. Safin said the linesperson who made the call did so “in sunglasses” and “from 35 meters away.”QUOTABLE “It’s difficult and almost impossible to make a foot fault on a second serve. Especially in important moments, you shouldn’t make it,” Safin said.THE OFFENSE In the women’s semifinals in 2009, Williams erupted after a foot-fault call. Her ensuing tantrum, filled with threats and four-letter words, cost Williams a point for unsportsmanlike conduct and gave Kim Clijsters the match.QUOTABLE “Now that I have had time to gain my composure I can see that while I don’t agree with the unfair line call, in the heat of battle I let my passion and emotion get the better of me and as a result handled the situation poorly,” Williams said in a news release.THE OFFENSE Penalized against Janko Tipsarevic in the second round last year, Roddick went into defense lawyer mode. He queried the line judge as to which foot, and when the judge answered incorrectly, Roddick exploded in anger. He later acknowledged he “went too far.”'"

"'11-08-30,'1','Copies of the internal documents were provided to by officials in several agencies involved in planning the anniversary commemorations. “The important theme is to show the world how much we realize that 9/11 — the attacks themselves and violent extremism writ large — is not ‘just about us,’ ” said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal White House planning.Some senior Obama administration leaders had advocated a lengthy program of speeches and events to mark the anniversary, but the final decision was for lower-key appearances by Mr. Obama and other senior leaders only on the days leading up to the anniversary and on Sept. 11 itself.Mr. Obama in his weekly address on Saturday said that this year’s anniversary will be one of “service and remembrance.”“We need to make sure we’re speaking to a very broad set of audiences who will be affected by the anniversary,” Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, said in a telephone interview on Friday.That may be, but some American counterterrorism and intelligence officials are complaining that the White House missed out on tying together the 10th anniversary with recently announced strategies to combat terrorism and violent extremism into a more coherent, longer-term plan. “They don’t do that kind of long-term planning,” said a senior counterterrorism official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid disciplinary measures from the White House. Mr. Rhodes rejected that criticism, saying these themes have threaded through many of Mr. Obama’s speeches in recent months.As the White House sharpens its messages for the commemorations, officials say they have also stepped up efforts to spot signs of foreign or domestic terrorist plots timed around the anniversary. So far, they said, they had not detected any specific plots or an increase in threats.Officials interviewed at several federal departments said they would consult the White House guidelines, but had been given broad leeway to hold commemorative events at their agencies.One significant new theme is in both sets of documents: Government officials are to warn that Americans must be prepared for another attack — and must, in response, be resilient in recovering from the loss.“Resilience takes many forms, including the dedication and courage to move forward,” according to the guidelines for foreign audiences. “While we must never forget those who we lost, we must do more than simply remember them —we must sustain our resilience and remain united to prevent new attacks and new victims.”At the same time, Obama administration officials caution that public commemorations here should not cast the United States as the sole victim of terrorism, an argument underscored by killings and maimings from extremist attacks overseas.Some senior administration officials involved in the discussions noted that the tone set on this Sept. 11 should be shaped by a recognition that the outpouring of worldwide support for the United States in the weeks after the attacks turned to anger at some American policies adopted in the name of fighting terror — on detention, on interrogation, and the decision to invade .So the guidelines aimed at foreign audiences also call on American officials to praise overseas partners and their citizens, who have joined the worldwide effort to combat violent extremism.“As we commemorate the citizens of over 90 countries who perished in the 9/11 attacks, we honor all victims of terrorism, in every nation around the world,” the overseas guidelines state. “We honor and celebrate the resilience of individuals, families, and communities on every continent, whether in New York or , or , Mumbai or Manila, or Lahore or .”The death of was viewed as reason for officials to “minimize references to Al Qaeda.” While terrorists affiliated with Bin Laden’s network “still have the ability to inflict harm,” the guidelines say, officials are to make the point that “Al Qaeda and its adherents have become increasingly irrelevant.”The guidelines say the absence of Al Qaeda playing any significant role in the “Arab Spring” uprisings against longtime autocrats in the and North Africa should be cited as evidence that Bin Laden’s organization “represents the past,” while peaceful street protesters in and “represent the future.” Left unsaid was that many of the deposed leaders were close American allies and partners in counterterrorism operations.Resilience is a repeated theme of the communications. “We celebrate the resilience of communities across the globe,” the foreign guidelines state.Or, as Mr. Rhodes put it in the interview: “It’s a statement of strength that the United States can outlast our adversaries. We’re stronger than the terrorists’ ability to frighten us.”The domestic guidelines, entitled “9/11 Anniversary Planning,” are shorter and less prescriptive than the talking points created for overseas audiences. For example, they note that the ceremonies will honor Americans killed in the Sept. 11 attacks but also “all victims of terrorism, including those who had been targeted by Al Qaeda and other groups around the globe.”But these guidelines also acknowledge that Americans will expect government leaders to explain what steps have been taken to prevent another 9/11-style attack and to encourage Americans to volunteer in their communities this Sept. 11.The domestic guidelines also ask something of Americans that has been lacking in Washington: “We will also draw on the spirit of unity that prevailed in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.”'"
"'11-08-30,'1','New York’s governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, said the toll on the state’s economy would be significant but could not yet be determined. He cited damage to both private and state-maintained property, saying that “these economic consequences are going to be very difficult.”In the city, the medical examiner’s office confirmed that the storm had a human cost: the first New York City death linked to it, that of Jose Serra, 68, who drowned in a City Island marina while checking on his boat.At the city’s Economic Development Corporation, analysts had just begun tallying the impact on the economy, but Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg described it as “a mixed bag.” With the airports closed and no trains or buses running for most of the weekend, he said, “there were tourists who couldn’t get here, but there were tourists who couldn’t get out and still spent money.”Still, from the time the subways stopped running at noon on Saturday, visitors and residents could not partake of many of the city’s attractions. Broadway theaters canceled shows, reducing sales for the week by more than one-third, or as much as $8 million. Halting travel to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island for three days cost the vendors that transport and feed the throngs almost $1 million in revenue, they estimated.While city residents did not face the kind of heavy flooding and other catastrophic damage that occurred in upstate New York and other parts of the Northeast, some found their basements flooded. In some neighborhoods, trees fell on houses, cars and power lines.At Aqua House, a Japanese restaurant on Jamaica Bay, rising water damaged a wooden deck. Raymond Lai, the restaurant’s manager, estimated that repairs would cost nearly $150,000, in addition to about $25,000 to fix the flooded floor in the dining area.Mr. Lai said he hoped to start serving takeout again on Wednesday or Thursday and put his lost revenue at $50,000 or more. But he said he was thankful that the restaurant did not lose power, spoiling its meat and fish, which could have cost another $10,000.Thousands of residents remained without electricity on Monday. Consolidated Edison had restored power for most of the 187,800 customers who lost it in the city and in Westchester County, but more than 17,000 in Queens still had none. An additional 2,000 customers in the Bronx were advised that they might be without power until Thursday.Dan Andrews, a spokesman for the Queens borough president, Helen M. Marshall, said the power failures were the worst problem in the borough. But he said all small businesses in Broad Channel, an area that was flooded on Sunday, had reopened.Of course, the losses were bound to yield gains for others, like Joe Kielbasa.Mr. Kielbasa, who runs a flood-response service on Staten Island, said he had received hundreds of calls since Saturday night, when the storm began battering the city. His half a dozen employees were on call all weekend and have been working nonstop since the storm hit.“It’s unfortunate, but a lot of people are not covered for the damages that the storm created,” Mr. Kielbasa said. “And a lot of people are in very dire straits.”John Plotke, who owns a roofing company on Long Island, was busy boarding up windows for clients before the storm struck and knocked out his phone service. When it was restored on Monday morning, his Web site had logged twice as many requests for service in a day as it would in a normal week, he said.Mr. Bloomberg said businesses might recoup some losses through insurance or through aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.“It’s built into most people’s business plans, and we’ll try to get as much federal monies as we can,” the mayor said. “There will be some who are badly hurt, and we’ll have to try to find some ways to help them.”'"
"'11-08-30,'1','“I told him that kids like that were a dime a dozen,” Rodriguez said from Maryville, Tenn., where he is now retired. “Then I started hitting with her.”Rodriguez said he helped Tatishvili with her technique, and she was a quick study.“I changed her grip and her stance,” he said. “And by the end of the day, she was doing it. That, I had never seen before.”Rodriguez volunteered to be her coach for the next four years, and Kroll became an adviser, mentor and family friend.That summer, Tatishvili played in her first United States tournament, in Central Park, reaching the semifinals of a 12-and-under event.She would periodically return to the country of Georgia, where her mother lived, but always came back to Juniper to improve her game and follow her tennis dreams. By the time she was 10, she was spending half the year in the United States and half in Georgia because of visa restrictions.Kroll said he determined that for her game to advance to the top level, he had to find a way to have her train full time in the United States. He began trying to get Tatishvili a scholarship to a tennis academy. They toured the top programs in Florida, and she eventually received a four-year scholarship to the Chris Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton.“I was thrilled,” Tatishvili said. “I was hitting balls with Chris Evert, an 18-time Grand Slam champion, and she was giving me advice.”Tatishvili rose through the juniors and eventually turned pro, when the differences between juniors and the top level of the game showed in her results.“She would call me right away after every loss,” Kroll said.Tatishvili lost four years in a row in the United States Open qualifying tournament before putting together her most successful year in 2011.It started with her first victory over a top-20 player, against Maria Kirilenko in April in Charleston, S.C. She then took the first set against Marion Bartoli, the 11th seed at the French Open, before losing in her first match on a main stadium court at a Grand Slam tournament.“I was nervous before the match, but once it got started, I was fine,” Tatishvili said. “She just played better as the match went on.”She won a round at Wimbledon before losing to Yanina Wickmayer, the 19th seed. This summer, she lost in three sets — in a match that lasted 3 hours 15 minutes — to Vera Zvonareva, the second-ranked player in the world, in the quarterfinals of a tournament in Baku, Azerbaijan.“I lost, but I gained a lot,” Tatishvili said. “I was right with her.”Her ranking has climbed to as high as 82, and that earned her a spot in the main draw at the Open — about three miles from Juniper Valley Park.Kroll recorded a recent match by Tatishvili’s first-round opponent, Pavlyuchenkova, in New Haven so Tatishvili’s coach, Ean Mayer, could examine it when he arrived in New York. Kroll also picked up Tatishvili and her father at the airport when they arrived in New York last Tuesday.“She is like my tennis daughter,” Kroll said, adding that he helped her learn English using Backstreet Boys songs.Rosemarie Gannascoli, Kroll’s wife, said she remembered when Kroll first encountered Tatishvili.“I came home from work, and Fred told me he had seen a champion on the court today,” she said. “I thought he had seen Andre Agassi or John McEnroe. No. He said it was a 7-year-old girl. I laughed. From that day, she has been a part of the family.”Tatishvili is clearly proud of her New York roots, and showed off her local knowledge when asked why she is staying in a hotel in Queens while many players stay in Manhattan.'"
"'11-08-30,'1','The climb symbolized the protest during which it happened. Egypt’s anger was directed at Israel because of a series of cross-border killings on the Sinai frontier between the two countries. On Aug. 18, Palestinian militants carried out an attack in southern Israel, near the Egyptian border, and eight Israelis were killed.Israeli security forces chasing the militants fired into Egypt, killing at least three Egyptian soldiers in circumstances that are being investigated.There was confusion over whether the Egyptian government intended to respond by withdrawing its ambassador from Tel Aviv — it later said it did not — and a general recognition that the crisis marked the beginning of a new era in relations between Israel and Egypt after the departure of Mr. Mubarak, who had bottled up Egyptian public anger toward Israel.The rival for the Flagman title, Moustafa Kamel, claimed that both he and Mr. Shahat started to climb the building in a joint endeavor, but that Mr. Shahat failed to reach the top and waited for him while he ascended.As he was descending, Mr. Kamel said, he threw the Israeli flag down to Mr. Shahat only to reach the ground and find Mr. Shahat already receiving acclaim. Mr. Shahat maintains that he acted alone.On Sunday, the men appeared together on El Mehwar television channel to give their own version of events, trying to prove the other man wrong by quizzing each other on the details of the climb and comparing wounds.During the angry face-off, Mr. Shahat said: “We are not here today to fight or to say who put the Egyptian flag up and who didn’t. Whether I put the flag up or Moustafa did, the goal was realized.”Mr. Kamel said, “I didn’t climb the building for any personal gain, and if Ahmed thinks that I climbed it for fame, he is wrong.”The dispute has also spread to social media. On Facebook, contributors to the page “Ahmed el-Shahat lovers” trade barbs with supporters of Mr. Kamel, each going through the details of the accounts to find flaws and inconsistencies.Others regard it as an unwelcome distraction. Mohamed Nabil, who writes as Kekyaxe on Twitter, sent the dismissive message: “Who brought the Israeli flag down? This is the epic question that will determine the success of the revolution, will solve unemployment and will achieve social justice.”'"

"'11-08-30,'1','The number of implantable cardiac devices in use has doubled since 1993, and the number of infections associated with them has more than tripled, a new study has found.Use of implanted defibrillators, which prevent irregular heartbeats, increased by more than 500 percent from 1993 to 2008, while use of implanted pacemakers, which speed up a slowly beating heart, increased by 45 percent, the report said. More than 4.2 million of these devices were implanted during the 16-year period.The study, in the Aug. 30 issue of The Journal of the American College of Cardiology, used a representative sample of hospital discharge records to estimate the number of infections caused by the devices. The incidence of infection in 2008 increased to 2.4 percent from less than 1.5 percent in 2004. Treating one infection costs, on average, $146,000.The reasons for the increase are not clear, but the recipients’ age and poorer health may be factors. And defibrillators require frequent replacement, with each procedure providing another opportunity for infection.“I don’t want people to think that doctors are using these devices needlessly,” said Dr. Arnold J. Greenspon, the lead author and a professor of medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. “They save lives and improve the quality of life. But the population is getting older, with more co-morbid conditions.”Several authors of the study have received payments from medical device manufacturers.'"
"'11-08-30,'1','Green, also English, was asked about the damage in Connecticut. “A branch came off,” he said. “I have no power.” He added, “It’s nice to be where there is something to do.”Not knowing what to expect, Bernadine Hoffman of East Meadow, N.Y., cast her fate to the reawakened Long Island Rail Road, which whisked her from Hicksville to Jamaica to Woodside, where she caught the revitalized No. 7 elevated train to the station known as Mets-Willets Point.In this modern age, the municipalities around the region had prepared for a hurricane, calling in a flotilla of electric and tree maintenance trucks and stationing them about, with hard-hat workers waiting for Hurricane Irene to do her thing. Government doing what government should do — think ahead, spend money to protect people. Bravo.With the roads better than anybody had the right to expect, Denise Crump drove to the Open from the Bronx with her 9-year-old son, Caleb, who said his favorite player was Rafael Nadal. Drivers discovered that branches had been cleared from the highways, more easily than last September when a rogue tornado blasted through Brooklyn and Queens, leveling trees and damaging the tennis center.Still remembering the destruction from the tornado, Open officials planned. In charge of preparation was Daniel Zausner, the managing director of the center (no relation to the Zausner family, of the prominent Port Washington Tennis Academy). Zausner had the Arthur Ashe Kids’ Day scheduled for Saturday but was leery about asking people to throng to Queens with highways and public transit in jeopardy. And hey, he did not look forward to dismantling after Kids’ Day.“I could see having a soundstage on center court on Monday afternoon,” Zausner said. So they called off Kids’ Day on Friday afternoon and began battening down the hatches.One little item nobody might connect with tennis was a fleet of 125 cars (Mercedes-Benzes, to be precise) that are available to chauffeur players, officials and guests during the Open. It did not make sense to have the autos sitting in the groves surrounding the center, so a friendly dealer found room for them in his showroom and garage.Then the workers began securing the grounds — taking down 1,000 green screens from the fences around the courts, putting sandbags around the premises, moving thousands of flower pots indoors, protecting the machines and wiring for various broadcasting, statistics and electronic eye companies. Zausner counted 250 workers under seven team leaders, and he and about 25 assistants (“a few plumbers, a few electricians”) stayed Saturday night, with Zausner catching a few naps on his couch.The accurate storm predictions from CompuWeather helped him prepare, and as soon as the storm passed Sunday at midday, they began putting everything back. To their relief, the thousands of honey locust trees, which have grown so handsomely over the years, were safe. So was the expensive hardware.For those who could not make it because their rail service or flights were canceled, the Open will exchange tickets for Tuesday or Wednesday, or next year.By Monday morning, it seemed as if the storm had never existed. A duo billed as Jay and Elysa Rumba Flamenco was greeting the fans in the midway. Ryan Harrison, the American, was pitching the first but not the last tantrum of this Open.Out on the main pathway, Leslie Allen, the former tour player who runs the Arthur Ashe Endowment Fund, was setting up the booth for another year. And look, there was Martina Navratilova, fresh from broadcasting a match for the Tennis Channel, walking through the crowd, a visible link to other great eras. The Open was back. All was right with the world.'"
"'11-08-30,'1','Mr. Kan failed to galvanize Japan after the disaster in March or point a new direction for this seemingly rudderless nation. It remained unclear whether the relatively inexperienced Mr. Noda, who has held only one cabinet-level position but is seen as quietly competent, will fare any better in ending Japan’s drift.“Can we do what is best for Japan, protect the livelihood of the Japanese people, revive the Japanese economy?” Mr. Noda, 54, asked in a speech. “This is what we are being called on to do.”Mr. Noda defeated the trade minister, Banri Kaieda, by 215 to 177 votes in a runoff election on Monday, after a first ballot failed to produce a clear victor from a field of five candidates. Mr. Noda will be formally elected prime minister by the full Parliament as early as Tuesday; the Democrats control the more powerful lower house.Political analysts are divided on Mr. Noda’s chances of overcoming the political paralysis in Japan, which has gone through six prime ministers in five years. They said that while the choice of the relatively youthful Mr. Noda represents a much-needed changing of the guard in the governing party, he will face the same fiscal constraints and resistance to change that had stymied his predecessors.“Mr. Noda’s biggest battle will be overcoming the vested interests that have made it so hard to bring change in Japan,” said Norihiko Narita, a political scientist and president of Surugadai University outside Tokyo. “It will be extremely difficult for him to fare any better than those who came before him, to say the least.”One of his biggest challenges will be a divided Parliament, where opposition parties like the Liberal Democrats have used control of the upper house to block the Democrats, in hopes of forcing an early general election. During the campaign, Mr. Noda signaled a greater willingness to compromise with the opposition than did the other candidates, or Mr. Kan.He also appears to mark a departure from Mr. Kan on the crucial question of the future of nuclear energy.While Mr. Kan called for ending what he called Japan’s dependence on nuclear power, Mr. Noda has followed the business community in saying that the nation needs nuclear power to prevent electricity shortages that could further cripple the economy.In foreign affairs, he has said he will maintain close ties with Washington and support an existing deal to keep the Futenma air base on Okinawa.However, he is a social conservative who, analysts warn, might provoke neighbors like China with comments like one he recently made, saying that Japan’s wartime leaders were not war criminals.During the brief campaign, Mr. Noda tried to set himself apart by displaying a sense of humor in an otherwise drab race, comparing himself to a loach, a less than attractive fish that scours the mud for food.“I will stink of mud and work until I sweat on behalf of the people,” he said.Whether his self-depreciating style will charm voters remains to be seen. Analysts said his lack of recognition could work in his favor by not building up expectations in the beginning that he cannot fulfill.“He won’t start with strong approval ratings, which will put less pressure on him to deliver right away,” said Hirotada Asakawa, an independent political analyst.“Let us end the politics of resentment,” Mr. Noda said. “Let’s make a more stable and reliable political leadership.”'"

"'11-08-31,'1','With so many recent children’s books built around unruly creatures going to school, it’s a relief to find a picture book in which the animal in question is reasonably well behaved and well intentioned. Starting school is scary enough for preschoolers and kindergarteners; why unnerve them with the added threat of an aggressive classmate?In this case, the amiable creature is Bailey, a big-eared mutt whose presence at school is both welcome and unquestioned. Like any child, with only slight modifications, he gets ready in the morning: He washes up (licks his fur), gets dressed (picks out a dog collar) and catches – or chases – the school bus. He has his favorite subjects, proudly gives presentations and eagerly participates in art class.He’s also awfully sweet, as drawn by Harry Bliss, a cartoonist and cover artist for The New Yorker who has illustrated a number of children’s books, including “Diary of a Worm,” by Doreen Cronin, and “Countdown to Kindergarten” by Alison McGhee. Like a milder-mannered Snoopy, though with more accepting human companions, Bailey is considered part of the community. “I wish I could dance like that,” an admiring classmate thinks when Bailey shows off his moves, in contrast to the withering reception from Lucy and company when Snoopy lets loose.“Bailey” is the kind of large-size picture book that feels instantly appropriate both for both preschool jitters at home and circle time in class come September. There’s plenty of humor, but the book is free of the snark that has been insinuating itself into school-related stories, even those aimed at very young children. And while “Bailey” includes lots of comics-style thought- and speech-bubbles, the pages remain uncluttered and easy to follow.Bailey may lick the occasional classmate and eat his homework, but he is always eager to please and improve – and he’s fun. Altogether, the kind of classmate a child will want to have around.'"

"'11-08-31,'1','That task is easiest when it comes to the economy, which is beset by persistently high unemployment, concern about the stock market and a deep, partisan divide about how to deal with the nation’s growing debt and deficits.But the Republican candidates are also eager to describe Mr. Obama’s foreign policy as a failure — a task made more difficult by the president’s recent success in killing Osama bin Laden and driving Muammar el-Qaddafi from power in Libya.Mr. Romney largely ignored those events on Tuesday as he criticized the administration’s proposal to cut military spending. He also took aim at the president over “mission muddle” during the revolution in Libya and his plan for the reduction of American troops in Afghanistan.“America must lead with clarity of intent, a commitment of purpose and unlimited resolve,” he said. “Unfortunately, when we look around the world today, we see a muddled picture of American policy and our power.”He added: “In Afghanistan, the president has chosen to disregard the counsel of the generals on the ground. I don’t know of a single military adviser to President Obama who recommended the withdrawal plan that he’s chosen.”The approach differs somewhat from the one Mr. Romney employed four years ago. In 2007, he sought to offer a more sunny, upbeat approach to his stump speech. “I am optimistic about this country, if you haven’t got that measure already,” Mr. Romney said in South Carolina that year. “I’ve met people from, boy, a lot of states, and you come away confident that the American people have the heart to succeed at everything we put our minds to.”Mr. Romney has been slightly more optimistic in his public appearances in recent weeks, but that kind of tone is increasingly scarce on the presidential campaign trail as he and the other candidates reach for the sharpest contrast they can find with Mr. Obama.The result has been a Republican vocabulary largely shorn of the “hope” and “change” rhetoric that Mr. Obama was so fond of in the 2008 presidential campaign.Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota said in her announcement speech that economic success and “dreams are distant for many Americans.” A new political action committee formed to bolster the chances of Jon M. Huntsman Jr. offered the following grim assessment: “A country in unprecedented turmoil. Unemployment. Overspending. Hopelessness.”The gloom-and-doom strategy is not unheard of for the party out of power. Like challengers before them, Mr. Romney and his rivals are betting that voters will identify with the negativity and blame Mr. Obama.But it is not without risk. If the economy continues to get worse, the candidates open themselves to the kind of charge that was leveled at President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s — that the talk of an economic malaise was actually contributing to the country’s problems.And when it comes to election-year politics, the grim message could adversely affect turnout. It is much easier to fill a stadium with excited supporters by using a rallying cry that suggests that things will get better. Wooing voters with depressing news is a tougher sell.Mr. Romney, in particular, has apparently decided the political rewards are worth the risks.“It’s hard to be upbeat about the economic crisis we’re facing,” said Eric Fehrnstrom, a spokesman for Mr. Romney. “The first step in a turnaround is to recognize that things are bad and need to change. Burying your head in the sand only makes the problem worse.”'"

"'11-08-31,'1','Should those whose job it is to prepare for the worst be punished because the worst didn’t happen?What determines your judgment of politicians’ reaction is what happens to you. Those washed out from to New Jersey to don’t think government overreacted. As once said, “Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die.”Asked at a Saturday hurricane briefing about the response in relation to the debate about the role of government, Christie made it clear that saving lives was the most important thing. The Republican said he didn’t think that Democrats and Republicans were debating this: “Protecting the safety of our citizens is one of the bedrock roles of government.”Not so bedrock for some of the Flintstones types in who are now hotly debating austerity versus salvation. The impressively hands-on performances of Christie, Bloomberg and Gov. of New York were not enough to make Tea Partiers, Republican presidential candidate and Republican House Majority Leader root for big government against rampaging nature.Paul, a libertarian whose scorn of government is so great that he doesn’t even want it to coordinate in natural disasters, insisted that , which he calls “a giant contributor to deficit financing,” should be shut down.Though his state of was the epicenter of an earthquake before being hit by Irene, Cantor has insisted that additional money for cash-strapped FEMA must be offset by spending cuts, echoing his remarks in May that money sent to traumatized victims in Joplin, , would mean cuts somewhere else.The callous comments about disaster relief in recent days by Cantor, Paul and, believe it or not, the disgraced former FEMA Chief Michael “Heck of a job, Brownie” Brown infuriated , the independent Vermont senator touring his inundated state. He told Carl Hulse of The Times that coming together to help on disasters “is what being a nation is about.”In a briefing at the White House Monday, FEMA Director Craig Fugate said that the lesson of Katrina is for the federal government to “get things going earlier” and not wait until an overwhelmed state “says we’re going to need help.”Too bad that didn’t occur to W. in 2005. He met with Gov. of and Mayor on and correctly assessed that they were not up to the job but then retreated behind clinical states’ rights arguments as a great American city drowned.In his new memoir, faults Blanco for dithering and not requesting that the president federalize the response to Katrina. It’s a variation on Rummy shrugging that “You go to war with the army you have.”Always the hard-liner, Cheney notes: “President Bush has written that he should have sent in U.S. troops earlier, which may be true, but which to my mind lets state authorities off the hook too easily.” Why save lives if you can slap bumbling Democrats around? Proving once more that he is truly delusional, Vice praised President Bush in the wake of Katrina for “reaching out to people who needed to know that their government cared about them.”The awful hypocrisy is this: As we saw when they spent trillions trying to impose democracy on and , W. and Cheney believe in big government, in a strong, centralized executive power. But with Katrina, they chose not to use it.'"
"'11-08-31,'1','The country was little more than a loose federation of regions and tribes before Colonel Qaddafi came to power. His reliance on favoritism and repression to maintain control did little to bridge Libya’s regional, ethnic and ideological divisions. Nor did the rebels who ousted Colonel Qaddafi ever organize themselves into a unified force. Rebels from the western mountains, the mid-coastal city of Misurata and the eastern city of Benghazi each fought independently, and often rolled their eyes in condescension at one another.And although the transition so far has been surprisingly orderly — almost no looting and little violence — Tripoli has become an early test of the revolution’s ability to bridge those divisions because in contrast to other Libyan cities liberated by their own residents, Colonel Qaddafi was ousted from Tripoli by brigades from other regions, and most remain in the streets.Early steps toward unifying the brigades under a common command have brought out latent divisions among rebel leaders. Some became apparent when a fighter named  Abdel Hakim Belhaj was named commander of a newly formed Tripoli Military Council.Several liberals among the rebel leadership council complained privately that Mr. Belhaj had been a leader of the disbanded Libyan Islamist Fighting Group, which rebelled against Colonel Qaddafi in the 1990s. Some said they feared it was the first step in an attempt at an Islamist takeover. They noted that Mr. Belhaj was named commander by the five battalions of the so-called Tripoli Brigade, rather than by any civilian authority. And they complained about the perceived influence of , which helped train and equip the Tripoli Brigade and also finances .“This guy is just a creation of the Qataris and their money, and they are sponsoring the element of Muslim extremism here,” another council member from the western region said. “The revolutionary fighters are extremely unhappy and surprised. He is the commander of nothing!”Mixed with the ideological concerns, however, was an equal measure of provincial rivalry over who did more to liberate Tripoli. Not only was Mr. Belhaj an Islamist, the council member argued, but he had done less than the western rebels in the fight for the capital.“People in the west were saying to each other, ‘What? This kid? This is rubbish! What about our top commanders?’ ” the council member said.Mr. Belhaj could not be reached for comment, in part because he was attending meetings in Doha, Qatar. Mustafa Abdel Jalil, chairman of the Transitional National Council, said he made a point to take Mr. Belhaj along to a meeting with their allies in Doha to show that despite his background, he poses “no danger to international peace and stability.”Hints of another schism appeared this week after news reports that the council’s prime minister, Mahmoud Jibril — who, like Mr. Jalil, is not present in Tripoli — was naming a former Libyan Army general, Albarrani Shkal, as the chief of the capital’s security.Fighters from Misurata, considered to the rebels’ most formidable force, refused to accept his appointment, arguing that he was complicit in Colonel Qaddafi’s vicious crackdown on their city. In Misurata, about 500 protesters took to its central square to chant that the appointment would betray “the blood of the martyrs,” a correspondent for The Guardian reported, noting that the city’s local council registered a formal complaint with the national leadership.By Tuesday night, Mr. Jabril had taken back his decision, said Alamin Belhaj, a Tripoli member of the transitional council.Both conflicts over the selection of military leaders recall the uproar sparked by the murder of the rebels’ top military commander in Benghazi, General Abdul Fattah Younes. The murder, still unresolved, touched off allegations by some rebel leaders that he was killed by a brigade of Islamists, which they said sought revenge for his previous role as a top aide to Colonel Qaddafi. No one has been charged in the case.Libyan Islamists say they just want a chance to compete in an open democracy, and they argue that they are more qualified than the liberals to disarm the fighters in the streets.“They trust us more,” said Alamin Belhaj, the council member and a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood here, arguing that many Libyans fear that the revolution would be “stolen” by rich, Westernized and often expatriate liberals on the council.All sides agreed, however, that the conquest of Tripoli has made it a crucible of regional rivalries. Although the early fighting was in the east, the final assault on Tripoli was led by rebel groups in the west and finished by seasoned fighters from Misurata.Now members of nearly every brigade in Tripoli assert their group played the most heroic role in taking the city, or in breaking into the Qaddafi compound, or in taking the central square.“We have it on video,” insisted Mahdi al-Harati, the deputy leader of the Tripoli Military Council, defending his claim that his brigade was first to the central square.More than pride may be at stake, said Anwar Fekini, a French-Libyan lawyer with ancestral ties to the mountains who is a member of the national leadership council. “The people in the west say, ‘We paid a huge price, and we want to be in charge,’ and Misurata the same,” he said, adding that he argued Libyans should select their leaders on the basis of competence regardless of region.Alamin Belhaj had another idea. He said he had asked the other local councils to withdraw their brigades from the city limits, to leave the capital to the Tripolitans.'"
"'11-08-31,'1','The theater’s facade will be preserved, as will several historic elements including gilded chandeliers, a fountain and a grand staircase. While the cultural center’s plans are not complete, it now calls for two performance spaces: a 199-seat theater and a 99-seat theater in which seats can be removed to create a multitude of configurations. In addition, the four-story theater building will house a scenery shop, costume shop, administrative offices, dressing rooms and a gallery.“There will be no wasted space, since it is being custom-built, and we are taking advantage of economies of scale, such as shared restrooms, dressing rooms and a single receptionist,” said Jonathan Denham, a principal at the real estate company Denham Wolf, which is advising the cultural groups.The residential component of the Victoria Theater project will have a full-service rental building that is expected to be 50 percent market-rate apartments, 30 percent reserved for middle-income tenants and 20 percent for low-income ones, said Craig Livingston, a managing partner at Exact Capital. The developers are negotiating with several companies to run the hotel and hope to strike a deal this fall.“All the major hotel chains have expressed very serious interest in the project — even Starwood, which opened an Aloft hotel on Eighth Avenue but is considering another Starwood brand there,” said Curtis L. Archer, the president of the Harlem Community Development Corporation.Other projects planned for 125th Street include Mart 125, across the street from the Victoria Theater. The mixed-use project will create up to 67,000 square feet of cultural and commercial space. It will also be home to the National Jazz Museum in Harlem, which produces jazz events and education series, and ImageNation Sol Cinema, which runs an independent film festival. In May 2010, the city, which owns the site, put out a request for proposals, and hopes to pick a developer “in the coming months,” said Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.While these projects have been in the works for years, “I believe Mart 125 will happen soon and same with the Victoria Theater,” said Paul Wolf, a principal at Denham Wolf, which also represents the National Jazz Museum at Mart 125. “Soon in Manhattan timing, so not 60 days, but not years either. I believe these projects are really going to happen now.”In July, the city picked developers to re-imagine two other sites on 125th Street: the former Taystee Bakery complex and the Corn Exchange Building. The Taystee Bakery had been awarded to an affiliate of the Citarella food markets in 2001 but after it sat undeveloped for years, the New York State Supreme Court awarded it back to the city in 2009. The case is in litigation.The current plan for the Taystee Bakery is reinvent it as Create @ Harlem Green, a $100 million development that will include 90,000 square feet of office space, 40,000 square feet of retail and a 10,000-square-foot community facility.Several tenants are already lined up, including the Harlem Brewing Company and the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center.The $16 million Corn Exchange project will renovate the late 19th-century building at 125th Street and Park Avenue and add six stories to create 22,000 square feet for offices and 9,000 square feet for retail stores. The city hopes the project will break ground within a year, Mr. Pinsky said.A fifth project is the East Harlem Media, Entertainment and Cultural Center. A $700 million endeavor, it is planned to eventually include a hotel, 250,000 square feet of office space and more than 800 units of housing, but the first phase, expected to be completed later this fall, is far more modest. It will establish 49 units of affordable housing and 5,600 square feet of retail space. The second phase, to be started sometime next year, will create just under 100 residential units and 50,000 square feet of retail space.1000 2011-08-31 Analysts say home prices have stabilized in coastal cities over the last six months. Seasonally adjusted prices have fallen a modest 1 percent in the last six months, according to the index. That is less than a third of the decline from the previous six months.Home prices are certain to fall further once banks resume foreclosures, millions of which have been delayed because of a government investigation into mortgage lending practices. If the American economy slips back into another recession, prices could drop even further.“There’s no theoretical floor for prices. If the economy worsens, housing will get into a vicious cycle of falling prices and foreclosures,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “When prices fall, confidence wanes.”Separately, the Conference Board said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index fell to 44.5, down from a revised 59.2 in July, down almost 15 points. The number was the lowest since April 2009 when the reading was 40.8. It also is far below the 53.3 that analysts had expected. A reading above 90 indicates the economy is on solid footing; a score above 100 signals strong growth.The pace of sales for previously occupied homes is trailing last year’s 4.91 million sold, the fewest since 1997. In a healthy economy, people buy roughly 6 million homes each year.Sales of new homes dropped in July for a third month in a row. This year is shaping up to be the worst for sales of new homes since 1963.At the same time, falling consumer confidence numbers raise new concerns about consumers’ willingness to spend to jumpstart the economy. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.“Consumer confidence deteriorated sharply in August, as consumers grew significantly more pessimistic about the short-term outlook,” said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center in a statement.A number of factors contributed to the index’s decline. The index, which is based on a random survey of consumers sent to 5,000 households from Aug. 1 to Aug. 18, captured the wildest week on Wall Street since the financial crisis in 2008 after Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the credit rating of the United States on Aug. 5.1001 2011-08-31 A recipe for Turkey and Apple Sandwiches With Maple Mayonnaise....1002 2011-08-31 ROSENBERG-ISSEROW--Rachelle.
