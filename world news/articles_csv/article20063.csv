"'06-03-01,'1','""We're delaying some missions,"" he told the House Science Committee, ""but we're not abandoning them.""Today, Mary Cleave, NASA's associate administrator for science, said she took Dr. Griffin at his word that the cuts were a one-time event. ""There was no money available anyplace else,"" she said. ""We took a hit.""But the cuts have alarmed and outraged many scientists, who have long feared that NASA will have to cannibalize its science program to carry out the president's vision of human spaceflight.The new cuts, they say, will drive young people from the field, ending American domination of space science and perhaps ceding future discoveries to Europe, scientists say.""The bottom line: science at NASA is disappearing — fast,"" said Donald Lamb, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago and chair of a committee on space science for the Association of American Universities.And Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is chairman of the science committee, called the new budget ""bad for space science, worse for earth science,"" adding, ""It basically cuts or de-emphasizes every forward looking, truly futuristic program of the agency to fund operational and development programs to enable us to do what we are already doing or have done before.""The House panel will begin hearings on Thursday on the agency's budget.As a result of the new cuts, NASA's expenditures for space and earth science will grow about 1 percent a year between now and 2011, far less than inflation, even as the Bush administration promotes its effort to bolster American competitiveness by doubling the research budgets at the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology over the next 10 years.Senator Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and 56 other senators have introduced a bill to mandate a 10 percent increase per year in NASA's science budget from now through 2013.Astronomers and planetary researchers say that space science has provided NASA's brightest and most inspirational moments in recent years: the landing on Saturn's moon Titan, the exploits of the Mars rovers, and the stream of cosmic postcards from the Hubble Space Telescope.Despite Dr. Griffin's assurances, they say that delaying space missions can be a death sentence if there is not money in the budget to continue developing technology and to keep teams together until the mission is ready to fly again.That is the case, said Charles Beichman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with the Terrestrial Planet Finder missions, which are intended to produce images of Earth-like planets around other stars. They are the culmination of a line of missions devoted to hunting for planets around other stars and investigating if they are habitable or even already harbor life, a goal, planetary scientists point out, that is explicitly endorsed in Mr. Bush's space vision.""We're getting ready to fire all the people we've built up,"" said Dr. Beichman, who is the project scientist for the second of the two spacecraft, once scheduled for about 2020. Once those scientists have found other jobs, he said with a sigh, they are not likely to come back.""What I feel bad about is turning away a generation,"" he said, explaining that planet finding has been one of the hottest fields in science lately, attracting young scientists into astronomy. ""We were the new kid on the block,"" he said.Much of the concern among scientists is for the fate of smaller projects like the low-budget spacecraft called Explorers. Designed to provide relatively cheap and fast access to space, they are usually developed and managed by university groups. Dr. Lamb referred to them as ""the crown jewels in NASA's science program.""In recent years, one such mission, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, produced exquisite baby pictures of the Big Bang, while another, the Swift satellite, has help solve the a 30-year-old mystery, linking distant explosions called gamma-ray bursts to the formation of black holes.Explorers, Dr. Lamb said, are where graduate students and young professors get their first taste of space science. Until recently about one mission was launched per year, but under the new plan, there will be none at all from 2009 to 2012. In a letter to Dr. Cleave last fall, 16 present and former Explorer scientists said, ""Such a lengthy suspension would be a devastating blow to the program and the science community.""One author of the letter, Fiona Harrison, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, said she first learned from a news conference that own Explorer project, an X-ray satellite observatory called NuStar, was being canceled after several years of development. She said she had been invited to reapply again in 2008, but in the meantime she has had to tell her graduate student to find another thesis project.Dr. Harrison said she was thinking of leaving the country or perhaps even the field of astrophysics.In another move last month, NASA slashed this year's budget for individual research projects by 15 percent, retroactive to last fall, yanking the rug out from researchers and their institutions that had already begun work.Dr. Cleave, the NASA associate administrator for science, acknowledged that she had been deluged with faxes and e-mail messages from scientists alarmed about these developments. She said the agency would be willing to adjust ""the mix"" in favor of more research and analysis, but added that something would have to give.""I have my budget; I don't expect relief,"" she said. ""There's no free lunch here.""Many scientists said the roots of their plight lay in the Bush administration's refusal to ask Congress for enough money to carry out the Moon-Mars program, announced with fanfare two years ago. But others said they themselves were partly to blame for pursuing an overly ambitious agenda in the face of cold realities like the Columbia disaster and concern about the mounting federal deficit.For example, the James Webb Space Telescope — the designated successor to the Hubble telescope, designed to see back in time and space within a whisper of the Big Bang — was ranked first on the astronomers' wish list in an influential National Academy of Sciences survey in 2000. But delays and technical problems have almost doubled its cost, to more than $4.5 billion, and postponed its launching by two years, to 2013. Meanwhile, planned repairs to the Hubble telescope will cost some $300 million.Once the Webb and Hubble, the two highest priorities, are included, said John Mather, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center and project scientist for the Webb telescope, ""almost everything else that isn't started had to be stopped.""""People assume that when Congress votes for something, they send extra money,"" he said. ""They don't.""Dr. Griffin and his colleagues, the scientists agree, haves tough choices to make, but the so far, the space scientists complain, the choices have been made in a vacuum, without input from the community most affected, namely them. Last year NASA dismantled a longstanding network of scientific advisory committees, and while a new network of committees is in the works, it is not yet in place.As a result, Dr. Beichman said, ""Scientists feel very much left out of this process. You could have involved the community and said ""here's what we have to do.""He added, ""In the end, even scientists can be responsible.""'"
"'06-03-01,'1','Domestic fares on an industrywide basis are already up by about 8 percent compared with a year ago. Much of that increase, however, is because of reduced fleets at some major carriers, which has cut the supply of airline seats at a time when demand has remained strong.As Delta and Northwest Airlines move through bankruptcy proceedings, the fleet reductions will probably come to an end and the supply of seats will rise, making price increases harder to push through.During the last six years, when traditional airlines were piling up more than $40 billion in losses, JetBlue grew to $1.7 billion in annual revenue and became increasingly popular with travelers. Its planes feature leather seats and individual television screens with lots of channels. New planes and new, nonunion workers gave it unusually low costs.But now that fuel prices have pushed up expenses for all airlines, and older carriers have sharply cut their own labor costs, the advantage JetBlue enjoyed as a start-up is greatly reduced.""Many JetBlue investors we speak with are under the impression there's something patently different about its model, some core über-profitability that's waiting to be tapped,"" Jamie Baker, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities said in a report last month. ""We doubt it.""JetBlue's biggest obstacle has been Delta. ""We've had a competitor that's been willing to lose hundreds of millions of dollars,"" said David G. Neeleman, founder and chief executive of JetBlue.During last year's third quarter, Delta's average ticket prices on seven heavily traveled routes were lower than JetBlue's prices, according to Back Aviation Solutions, a consulting firm. Still, on flights between South Florida and New York, JetBlue planes flew 86.6 percent full during the third quarter and Delta planes were 76.7 percent full.""JetBlue is charging a premium to Delta and they're getting better load factors,"" said Michael Allen, a managing director at Back Aviation. ""The indication would be they have a preferred product.""Last October, the news that Delta would close Song, the low-price airline it started to compete with JetBlue, was greeted with relief at JetBlue headquarters. Finally, Mr. Neeleman and others hoped, the costly price war up and down the East Coast would subside.But more than three months later, JetBlue is still waiting to find out how substantially Delta will scale back the number of seats it offers on those routes. ""We are waiting to see what Delta does,"" said Tim Claydon, senior vice president of sales and marketing at JetBlue.Delta, while saying it will substitute smaller planes on some New York-to-Florida routes beginning in May, is in no hurry to offer comfort to JetBlue by disclosing its plans. ""We ain't pulling out,"" Chris Kelly, a Delta spokeswoman, said. ""Much to their dismay, I'm sure.""Delta plans to withdraw some of the Boeing 757's that were operated as Song planes, seating 199 passengers, and replace them with Boeing 737's or MD-80's, which seat about 150 and 142, respectively, said Bob Cortelyou, vice president of network planning at Delta.Mr. Baker of J. P. Morgan estimated that Delta was reducing seats between the Northeast and Florida by about 15 percent from a year ago. He said that should be enough to allow JetBlue to raise fares and report a small profit for 2006.As of last week, one-way tickets from New York to Fort Lauderdale, purchased three weeks in advance, were $69, before taxes, on both airlines. But those prices might not last. Consumers can expect to see somewhat higher prices for tickets purchased far in advance and somewhat fewer of those tickets available. JetBlue hopes to sell more tickets closer to travel time, when consumers are accustomed to paying more.According to Mr. Baker, Mr. Neeleman told an investor conference last week that JetBlue had set prices too high on top-end fares, failing to sell some seats, and too low on some bottom-end fares, selling out but at too low a price.JetBlue, with all the planes it is buying, not only needs to raise fares but also must find new markets it can serve profitably.But Southwest Airlines is growing rapidly, too, and looking for new routes. And even Continental is expanding, adding planes and increasing its New York-to-Florida capacity by 30 percent since last winter. Continental, said David Messing, a spokesman, will match JetBlue ""dollar for dollar, every flight.""In that competitive environment, JetBlue has begun efforts to sharpen its operations. Until recently, for example, the workers who set ticket prices and choose the routes that JetBlue planes fly were allowed to work away from company headquarters, an arrangement that is now ending. Operating separately slowed decision-making and information-sharing, said Mr. Claydon, the JetBlue executive.JetBlue also missed a big opportunity. Unlike most big airlines, it had a strong enough balance sheet in recent years to hedge its fuel costs, essentially buying insurance against very high oil prices. Southwest hedged and thus remains highly profitable. JetBlue did not, in part owing to Mr. Neeleman's belief that oil prices would not skyrocket, and now the company is losing money.""We had the wherewithal to do it,"" Mr. Neeleman said. ""We just missed it.""Rapid growth, meanwhile, is hard to manage. A year ago, JetBlue claimed it had the best on-time performance among major airlines. As it has grown, however, and it has run more flights from its home base, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, its performance has declined. In December, it was last among 20 carriers tracked by the Transportation Department, with just 64 percent of its flights arriving on time.Jenny Dervin, a spokeswoman, said JetBlue was trying to shift landings away from the busiest periods at Kennedy and to speed plane cleaning so that planes landing late could still take off again on time.JetBlue's startling success, until recently, gave Mr. Neeleman, its 46-year-old chief executive, a soap box to discuss the industry's failings and his company's alternative approach to the business. An outspoken Mormon who says he has attention deficit disorder, he can seem alternately arrogant and humble. Mr. Neeleman expresses contempt, for example, for the industry's labor practices.""Some companies deserve unions,"" he said in an interview.His combined salary and bonus, less than $300,000 a year, is very low for a chief executive. But the JetBlue stock he paid little for in the start-up is now valued at about $70 million. And he was wealthy before JetBlue.He helped build a small Salt Lake City carrier, Morris Air, which was bought by Southwest Airlines in 1993 for $129 million. Mr. Neeleman, who held a large minority stake in Morris Air, was fired months later by Southwest's founder, Herbert D. Kelleher."" 'You're driving everyone around here crazy,' "" Mr. Kelleher told him, according to Mr. Neeleman, who added: ""There were a lot of things I thought they could do better. I think that offended them.""Mr. Kelleher insisted that Mr. Neeleman honor a five-year noncompete agreement. That gave him time to build and sell a second company, a technology firm, pocketing a second fortune, and to refine the Southwest business model for New York. ""Herb did me a huge favor,"" he said.Mr. Neeleman encourages and seems to enjoy the comparisons to Southwest and to Mr. Kelleher, of whom he said, ""He's an attorney, smokes three packs a day, drinks a quart of Wild Turkey. I'm a Mormon. Other than that, we're a lot alike.""A Southwest spokeswoman, Beth Harbin, accustomed to answering questions about Mr. Neeleman's comments on Mr. Kelleher, said of the description: ""I'm sure he's done it, but not on a daily basis.""'"
"'06-03-01,'1','At the same time, an abundance of technology is available to help disabled people operate computers, like software that lets a blind person use a keyboard instead of a mouse to navigate a program, and voice synthesizers that turn text into speech. There are also alternatives to the mouse for people with limited use of their arms.Steven Singley, 41, who is quadriplegic as a result of a car accident 20 years ago, has a special setup that helps him take calls for Office Depot from his home in Centerville, Utah. His right arm, which has limited movement, is strapped to the armrest of his wheelchair, allowing his hand to pivot on a trackball and his pinky knuckle to tap a clicker. A splint with a rubber tip is hooked to his palm so he can type on a keyboard sitting on his lap.""You would think that typing one key at a time would be slow, but I can type 25 words per minute accurately,"" Mr. Singley said. He puts in 20 to 24 hours a week, requiring extended breaks so his girlfriend can give him his medication and prepare him for his meals.No one has statistics on just how many disabled people work from home as phone agents. But the market research firm IDC says that about 112,000 home agents -- both disabled and not -- were working for outsourcing firms like Willow, Alpine Access of Golden, Colo., and J. Lodge of Hammonton, N.J., at the end of 2005. That number is expected to climb to 300,000 by 2010. That does not count employees of companies that hire their own home agents. Many new jobs will go to people who are disabled or to people who care for them, several specialists said, because there are more programs to train them.These jobs pay relatively well, from about $10 to $14 an hour to $20 an hour for those who earn a commission when taking orders over the phone. Firms like Willow, based in Miramar, Fla., often treat their agents as independent contractors, with no benefits, but many disabled agents qualify for Medicare.The wages are higher than agents get for similar work in India, where many companies have moved call centers in the last few years, but the costs are still at least 30 percent lower than hiring full-time employees and providing working space for them, said Stephen Loynd, an analyst at IDC. Some executives at outsourcing firms say that the extra expense of hiring American workers is worth it, because many customers complain that offshore agents do not speak English well.""If you want to find a job where nothing counts but brains and voice, this is it,"" said Gil Gordon, a consultant in Monmouth Junction, N.J., who advises companies on setting up telecommuting programs.At the Internal Revenue Service, about 350 disabled workers in 42 states are taking calls this tax season. The I.R.S. and other federal agencies are required to hire people with severe disabilities as part of their compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act. The agency determined that disabled agents could easily handle its seasonal call center, answering requests for tax forms.The I.R.S. was especially interested in having agents answering calls during peak hours -- midday on Mondays and Tuesdays -- without having to employ them full time.""In a traditional call site, they work eight hours a day, five days a week,"" said Anna Howington, a senior policy analyst at the I.R.S. who oversees taxpayer services. Ms. Howington said she was ""absolutely happy"" with the quality of the agents' work, which costs the agency about $5 million a year.Customer service is not the only job that can be moved into the home. Janet Eckles, 53, of Orlando, Fla., who is blind, works full time for Language Line Services of Monterey, Calif., taking calls from hospitals and courts that need a Spanish translator. Clients call a central number and are routed to either Ms. Eckles or hundreds of other translators.Ms. Eckles uses a computer to train other Language Line interpreters over the phone. For that, she uses a Windows program called JAWS, for Job Access With Speech. It is customized to let her navigate her computer using a keyboard rather than a mouse, and it reads the output into one ear while she talks to a trainee, like a television anchorwoman taking cues from a producer.""It does take some getting used to,"" she said.Some call center operators have found that disabled workers stay in their jobs longer and are more loyal than other workers. They also tend to be older and better educated, and they will work for less. ""This is an untapped pool of labor that doesn't have many other options,"" said M. J. Willard, who runs the National Telecommuting Institute in Boston, an advocacy group that trains disabled workers for jobs.About 6.5 million people receive disability benefits from the Social Security Administration, and about a million disabled people are registered with state agencies looking for work. ""A lot of those people can work from home,"" Ms. Willard said. She works with state vocational rehabilitation programs to help them find work. She has about 500 workers in her program and expects to add 50 a year. Because the jobs in Ms. Willard's program are often seasonal, employment may be sporadic for many workers. She also helps employers claim tax benefits and grants for hiring disabled workers.There are limits, though, to the ability to work while drawing disability benefits. Those who qualify for federal disability insurance cannot earn more than $860 a month after completing a nine-month trial period, or they lose disability payments, which average $938 a month.Garth Howard, chief executive of the outsourcing firm Alpine Access, says he moved many customer service jobs overseas as an executive at American Express and TeleTech Holdings. Now, he says, technology is helping him hire disabled workers at competitive wages because he can offer them a measure of convenience that was not available just a few years ago.""I'm excited to be able to bring some jobs back,"" he said.'"
"'06-03-01,'1','""We get some calls that say, 'I just thought about my fiancé is missing,' "" said Lenora Green, shaking her head in a mixture of sympathy and disbelief. ""It's like they just click back into reality because of the shock they're going through.""Ms. Green is a shift supervisor at the Find Family National Call Center, a vast array of cubicles, computers and telephones in a former sporting goods store in Baton Rouge, created after the hurricane to help people locate loved ones, living or dead. The call center is a collection place, not just of names and vital statistics, but of the most intimate stories of a poor city broken apart by crisis.They include every permutation in the grand mosaic of human relationships, an intricate design of unpaid child support, paranoia, grudges, helplessness and anguish, the lonely cul-de-sacs of estrangement and old age.""Some people are just getting out of jail,"" Ms. Green said. ""Some, it's like baby-mama drama, I call it.""Some evacuees simply do not have access to the one human link most taken for granted: the telephone. Numbers have been changed, disconnected, rinsed away. ""That's how I got lost,"" said Alvin Alphonse Jr., who was put on the missing list by a former girlfriend claiming to be his cousin. ""I didn't have anybody written down, no numbers, nothing.""Scott Shepherd, another call center worker, allowed one couple to use the telephone at the center after they told him they did not have one.After the call, he led the woman to a brass bell the workers ring every time someone is located.""I was able to let that woman ring the bell for her own sister,"" Mr. Shepherd said.Officials at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which helps reunite parents with their children, said they had had to adjust to some stark facts about a population that did not have access to phones, computers or in some cases even television. One reunion involved a child who had been left in the care of a neighbor who could not read or write.But again, said Ernie Allen, president of the center, the problem is more fractured families than orphaned waifs. The most pressing cases, in which parents let their children have the first seats in rescue helicopters, or pushed them to the front of the line to board buses at the Superdome, have been resolved. The center has 131 children remaining on its list, down from more than 5,000.""The vast majority of these kids are with a dad or a mother or a brother,"" Mr. Allen said. ""They're not alone, but they're separated from some key person in their families.""Initially, families were told to contact the call center if they thought a loved one might have died in the storm. But some families have put off calling because they see it as an admission that they have lost hope. Still others have made a report but refused to fill out an eight-page ""victim identification profile,"" which lists details like tattoos and jewelry. Without such a form, a body at the morgue might never be identified.Cheryl Spooner, a call center worker who has used databases, the Internet and hunches to locate the missing, said one of her difficult cases was a mentally disabled man who had been in a group home in New Orleans. She cannot find the man, and she cannot find the home's owner. But the family does not want to fill out the profile or supply DNA for a match. ""The brother is saying, 'We're going to keep searching for my brother. We don't want to do that right now,' "" Ms. Spooner said.She and other workers also regularly call back those who have reported someone missing, to see if they have made contact on their own.Of the 12,000 reports taken by the call center, which is run by the state health department and staffed in part by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster mortuary team, more than 8,000 people have been found alive. But for the center's staff members, who might talk to a single caller a dozen times, it is the saddest stories that linger.One woman waited months to report her daughter missing because she rarely heard from her anyway, and the place where her daughter stayed in the city had not flooded, said Bonnie Riley, a part-time minister who keeps her Bible close to the phone as she answers calls. But when the mother finally went back to New Orleans, she learned that her daughter had gone to the store after the storm. ""And that's when the levees broke,"" Ms. Riley said, adding that the daughter was presumed to have drowned and been washed away.Because many bodies may never be recovered, it may take years to learn how many of the 1,880 people on the missing list are dead, but the current estimate is around 300, which is based in part on the number of names about which there are repeated inquiries, said Dr. Louis Cataldie, the state emergency medical director. The total number of deaths so far in Louisiana is 1,080.The call center has had its share of obstacles. Because of database incongruities, about a dozen people are listed as both missing and dead. It has no access to commercial databases that charge a fee to supply information about people, which is why a reporter with such access was able to put Mr. Broussard in touch with his daughter when the center had not. Because of privacy concerns, it has only recently been given access to FEMA's list of people who have applied for housing assistance, said Henry Yennie, the deputy director of operations at the center.But for many, the center is the only hope, as other Internet sites for evacuees start to disappear. A spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, Kathleen Salanik, said its Web site, katrinasafe.com, was about to be taken down because it was no longer of use. ""We know from previous disasters that the greatest need is in the first two to four weeks,"" Ms. Salanik said. But, she added, 11 people had posted or updated information on the site in the last 24 hours.One of the center's tasks is to find the next of kin of the dead. That job falls to Christine Niss, a medical legal investigator who says it is as much art as science. ""You have to sit and think about where they might leave a trace of themselves,"" Ms. Niss said, explaining how one victim's emphysema, revealed in an autopsy, had led her to his family.She found a hospital in New Orleans where he had been a patient before the storm and had listed a next of kin.In another case, her trail led her to several family members before she reached the victim's brother. ""The whole family ended up getting back together and mending fences,"" Ms. Niss said. The brother was so grateful, she said, he called her right after the funeral. ""There were still people in his house eating the deviled eggs.""'"

"'06-03-01,'1','CUPERTINO, Calif., Feb. 28 - Apple Computer furthered its push into home entertainment on Tuesday with the introduction of a high-fidelity stereo system for the iPod music player, as well as a new version of the Mac Mini computer with features for managing digital music and video.The announcements, which come as Microsoft pushes its own approach to digital home entertainment based on its Windows Media Center technology, shows Apple's increasing focus on consumer electronics.In recent quarters, sales of Apple's iPod devices and iTunes music downloads have overtaken the company's sales of Mac computers, rising to 60 percent of sales last quarter from 40 percent a year earlier. Just last week, the online Apple iTunes music store sold the billionth song since the service was introduced three years ago.

"'06-03-01,'1','""American music is the soundtrack to American history,"" Mr. Glass said. ""Hip-hop has been a part of American music for more than 30 years.""With help from the music industry, the museum has been soliciting donations, and most of the initial contributors were present: in addition to Ice-T, Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash, Russell Simmons, DJ Kool Herc and the dancer Crazy Legs have opened their archives, and were clearly proud of the recognition.""Nobody expected this thing 35 years ago to be mentioned in the Smithsonian conversation,"" said Kool Herc, one of the prime technological innovators in the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx, who was still trying to decide what to donate.The National Museum of American History is not the first major institution to collect hip-hop materials. The Experience Music Project in Seattle has also built a sizable collection, and in 1999 the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland organized an exhibition of hip-hop memorabilia that traveled to the Brooklyn Museum.Mr. Simmons, the impresario who was a founder of the Def Jam label, said that at first he had feared that hip-hop's inclusion in a major museum would mean it had lost its power and novelty. His initial thought when contacted by the Smithsonian, he said, was ""It must be over.""But in an opinion echoed by nearly every speaker, Mr. Simmons suggested that as hip-hop aged it was in danger of losing its connection to its roots and that younger fans and performers would profit from direct experience of the music's history. Hip-hop, he said, is ""the only real description of the suffering of our people.""Museum officials say that the collection may take three to five years to develop and that they are still approaching musicians about donations. When complete, they say, the collection will be used for a long-term exhibition. The museum also plans scholarly symposiums to discuss the content, as well as a traveling show.Afrika Bambaataa, who helped integrate hip-hop with electronic music in the early 1980's on recordings that remain influential, praised the museum in his familiar declamatory tone for its attention to ""factology"" in representing the music's history.""Brothers and sisters,"" he said, ""this is beautiful that the Smithsonian Institution is recognizing hip-hop culture for what it is.""'"

"'06-03-01,'1','One federal counterterrorism official recently told Congress that animal rights groups posed the nation's most serious domestic terrorism threat.Prosecutors say that the activists used their Web site as the nerve center of a campaign of violence and intimidation. The group posted the names and home addresses of ""targets"" on a Web site that also featured a document detailing ""20 terror tactics"" and kept an updated tally of violent attacks on Huntingdon employees and their business associates, which it called ""a list that can be outdone and surpassed.""""They were generals in a war,"" said Assistant United States Attorney Ricardo Solano said in closing arguments. ""And just like in any war, the generals didn't always know all of the foot soldiers.""But the activists assert that they are guilty of nothing more than overzealousness and bad manners. While defense lawyers have conceded that the group's members were occasionally combative in tone, they argued that their clients were simply exercising their First Amendment right to protest and should not be held responsible for violence committed by unknown extremists.""Advocating obnoxiously is not a crime,"" said Eric Schneider, a lawyer for Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty's former president, 28-year-old Kevin Kjonaas.Prosecutors cited a series of actions, however, that they said were instigated by the defendants, including death threats, broken windows, homes spray-painted with the phrase ""puppy killer"" and a pipe bomb attack on a California company that did business with Huntingdon.They also said the group members sought to terrorize their targets by posting their children's names, ages, schools and after-school schedules.Sally Dillenback, an executive at an insurance company in Dallas that covered Huntingdon, testified that her 7-year-old son was so intimidated by the group's protests outside her home that he once grabbed a knife when he heard the doorbell rang.""He said, 'Mommy, I want to protect you from the animal people,' "" Ms. Dillenback testified.Prosecutors produced an assortment of conversations, speeches and e-mail messages in which group members expressed glee in the violent attacks, often using the word ""we"" to claim credit for them.They also played a videotape of a raucous protest outside the home of one of the group's targets, which pictured Lauren Gazzola, a defendant, bragging that the police had been unable to protect the victims of pipe bombings and vandalism attacks.""The police can't help you!"" Ms. Gazzola, of Connecticut, screamed through a bullhorn.But defense lawyers repeatedly reminded the jury that although it is illegal to incite violence, it is not against the law to advocate unlawful behavior to achieve a political goal. They also sought to present the tamer side of the animal rights movement, saying that the actions of a few unknown extremists had overshadowed the many law-abiding citizens concerned about the treatment of animals.Indeed, with his slight build, delicate mannerisms and courtroom attire of button-down shirts and pullover sweaters, Mr. Kjonaas, the group's former president, did not project the image one might expect from someone the government has labeled a major terrorist.Mr. Kjonaas worked briefly in Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty 's main office in Worcestershire, England, near Huntingdon's corporate headquarters, then, in 2001, took over the group's operations in the United States. Last September, without explanation, the New York Stock Exchange dropped plans to list the company after the group reportedly listed the names and personal information of exchange employees on its Web site.Huntingdon executives say their company uses the most humane methods possible when testing animals for the food and cosmetics industry. But the Food and Drug Administration requires that drugs be tested on animals before it will grant approval, and testing laboratories like Huntingdon are hired to carry out those experiments, often injecting test animals with a substance, then killing and dissecting them.The group's Web site notes that Huntingdon was fined $50,000 in 1998 by the Department of Agriculture for animal abuses and says the company's secrecy shields such cruel treatment as force-feeding animals, beating puppies and performing amputations on conscious dogs.Before Mr. Kjonaas was indicted in 2004, his group's Web site included a wide range of personal information about the people it deemed targets. ""All this week we will release the unpublished, personal information of HLS scum,"" read one entry posted in 2002. ""Do with it what you may, so long as it's constant.""The site also included a disclaimer, saying that the group did not advocate violence.Assistant United States Attorney Charles B. McKenna said that group members had extensive contact with other animal rights activists who advocated violence and that they knew that the information on the Web site was likely to incite violent reprisals against their targets. He said that the First Amendment did not protect speech that was likely to encourage or incite violence. ""At some point, their ability to say certain things had to yield to the knowledge that houses would be vandalized and lives would be ruined,"" he said.But defense lawyers say the government is unfairly targeting the group's leaders, partly because the authorities have been unable to catch those who carried out the violence. Hal Haverson, a lawyer for Jacob Conroy, one of the defendants, said that several of the victims cited by the government had been attacked before their personal information appeared on the group's Web site.""They're prosecuting the wrong people for the wrong things,"" he said.'"

"'06-03-01,'1','Yusef Robb, a spokesman for California's state controller, said the Bush administration's approach was based largely on spotting inconsistencies between different forms that energy companies file to the Interior Department.""Under the compliance review system, if you fill out your fraudulent form correctly, you can get away with the fraud,"" Mr. Robb said. ""We know we can't trust companies to do what's right without regular auditing.""Last year, the government collected about $8.5 billion in royalties from oil and gas sales on federal land and in the Gulf of Mexico.The Bush administration has cut spending over the last five years for what it calls ""compliance and asset management"" -- the job of verifying royalty obligations -- even as it has sharply expanded oil and gas leasing in the Gulf of Mexico.The administration is proposing to spend $43.1 million on compliance efforts in 2007, up slightly from $42.7 million in 2006 but well below the $51.3 million that was spent in 2001.The Bush administration is also proposing to sharply cut the amount it pays several oil- and gas-producing states, notably California and Colorado, for auditing work on behalf of the federal government. The federal government essentially hires state governments and Indian tribes to keep track of oil and gas leases within their boundaries.California officials asked for $1.2 million in 2006, the amount they said was necessary to keep the number of auditors at 10. The Interior Department provided $800,000, enough for eight auditors, and California officials say it wants to cut spending next year to about $700,000.Similar cuts are being imposed on Colorado, which monitors thousands of oil and gas leases in the Rocky Mountains. Colorado's budget for auditing and compliance was reduced to $750,000 in 2006, from $975,000 in 2005, and the Bush administration is seeking additional cuts for next year.Administration officials say they have developed better strategies.""We implemented a new management strategy that increases efficient use of our internal resources, and in fact allows us to do as many or more audits with fewer auditors,"" Johnnie M. Burton, director of the Minerals Management Service wrote to House members last month.Administration officials said they had been able to reduce auditing costs by letting more companies pay royalties in the form of oil and gas rather than in cash.Supporters of this approach, known as ""royalties in kind,"" say it permits the government to do away with much of the arcane accounting that goes into determining the sales value of oil and gas in dollar terms.Administration officials also say they have concentrated more of their money on the biggest oil and gas producers, a tactic that leads to a more efficient use of auditors.Some state auditors say the government is short-changing itself, and by extension the nation's taxpayers.California officials say their auditors typically recover three times as much money from underpayments as they spend on auditing.Dennis R. Roller, a state auditor in North Dakota, said the Interior Department occasionally misses even the most obvious lapses in payments.Mr. Roller said the Interior Department had not noticed that a bankrupt company in North Dakota had stopped paying royalties, even though it was still producing oil and gas, until North Dakota officials alerted Washington in December.'"

"'06-03-02,'0','""We're delaying some missions,"" he told the committee, ""but we're not abandoning them.""Yesterday, Mary Cleave, NASA's associate administrator for science, said she took Dr. Griffin at his word that the cuts were a one-time event. ""There was no money available anyplace else,"" Dr. Cleave said. ""We took a hit.""The programs could still be saved if Congress voted to increase the NASA budget. The agency has powerful allies in both parties, and some have expressed alarm at the proposed cuts, which will be discussed today at a hearing of the House Science Committee.But at a time when fiscal conservatives are placing intense pressure on the Republican Congressional leadership to rein in government spending, programs that were previously considered sacrosanct are now vulnerable.The cuts have alarmed and outraged many scientists, who have long feared that NASA will have to cannibalize its science program to carry out the president's vision of human spaceflight.The new cuts, they say, will drive young people from the field, ending American domination of space science and perhaps ceding future discoveries to Europe.""The bottom line: science at NASA is disappearing — fast,"" said Donald Lamb, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago and chairman of a committee on space science for the Association of American Universities.Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Science Committee, called the new budget ""bad for space science, worse for earth science,"" adding, ""It basically cuts or de-emphasizes every forward-looking, truly futuristic program of the agency to fund operational and development programs to enable us to do what we are already doing or have done before.""As a result of the new cuts, NASA's expenditures for space and earth science will grow about 1 percent a year from now to 2011, far less than inflation, even as the Bush administration promotes its effort to bolster American competitiveness by doubling the research budgets at the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology over the next 10 years.Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and 56 other senators have introduced a bill that would mandate a 10 percent increase per year in NASA's science budget from now through 2013, among other things.Astronomers and planetary researchers say space science has provided NASA's brightest and most inspirational moments in recent years: the landing on Saturn's moon Titan, the exploits of the Mars rovers and the stream of cosmic postcards from the Hubble Space Telescope.Despite Dr. Griffin's assurances, they say that delaying space missions can be a death sentence if there is not money to continue developing technology and to keep teams together until the mission is ready to fly again.That is the case, said Charles Beichman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with the Terrestrial Planet Finder missions, which are intended to produce images of Earth-like planets around other stars. They are the culmination of a line of missions devoted to hunting for planets around other stars and investigating if they are habitable or already harbor life, a goal, planetary scientists point out, that is explicitly endorsed in Mr. Bush's space vision.""We're getting ready to fire all the people we've built up,"" said Dr. Beichman, who is the project scientist for the second of the two spacecraft missions, once scheduled for about 2020. Once those scientists have found other jobs, he said, they are not likely to come back.""What I feel bad about is turning away a generation,"" Dr. Beichman said, explaining that planet-finding has been one of the hottest fields in science lately, attracting, in particular, young scientists into astronomy.""We were the new kid on the block,"" he said.Much of the concern among scientists is for the fate of smaller projects like the low-budget spacecraft called Explorers. Designed to provide relatively cheap and fast access to space, they are usually developed and managed by university groups. Dr. Lamb referred to them as ""the crown jewels in NASA's science program.""In recent years, one such mission, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, produced exquisite baby pictures of the Big Bang, while another, the Swift satellite, has helped solve a 30-year-old mystery, linking distant explosions called gamma-ray bursts to the formation of black holes.Explorers, Dr. Lamb said, are where graduate students and young professors get their first taste of space science. Until recently, about one mission was launched a year, but under the new plan, there will be none from 2009 to 2012. In a letter to Dr. Cleave last fall, 16 present and former Explorer scientists said, ""Such a lengthy suspension would be a devastating blow to the program and the science community.""One author of the letter, Fiona Harrison, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, said she first learned from a news conference that her own Explorer project, an X-ray satellite observatory called NuStar, was being cancelled after several years of development. Dr. Harrison said that she had been invited to reapply in 2008, but that in the meantime she had to tell her graduate student to find another thesis project.Dr. Harrison said she was thinking of leaving the country or perhaps even the field of astrophysics.In another move last month, NASA reduced this year's budget for individual research projects by 15 percent, retroactive to last fall, taking money from researchers and their institutions that had already begun work.Dr. Cleave, the NASA associate administrator for science, acknowledged that she had been deluged with faxes and e-mail messages from scientists alarmed about these developments. She said the agency would be willing to adjust ""the mix"" in favor of more research and analysis, but added that something would have to give.""I have my budget. I don't expect relief,"" she said. ""There's no free lunch here.""Many scientists said the roots of their plight lay in the Bush administration's refusal to ask Congress for enough money to carry out the Moon-Mars program, announced with fanfare two years ago. But others said they were partly to blame as well for pursuing an overly ambitious agenda in the face of cold realities like the Columbia shuttle disaster and concern about the mounting federal deficit.For example, the James Webb Space Telescope — the designated successor to the Hubble telescope, designed to see back in time and space within a whisper of the Big Bang — was ranked first on the astronomers' wish list in an influential National Academy of Sciences survey in 2000. But delays and technical problems have almost doubled its cost, to more than $4.5 billion, and postponed its launching by two years, to 2013. Meanwhile, planned repairs to the Hubble telescope will cost some $300 million.Once the Webb and Hubble telescopes, the two highest priorities, are included, said John Mather, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center and project scientist for the Webb telescope, ""almost everything else that isn't started had to be stopped.""""People assume that when Congress votes for something they send extra money,"" Mr. Mather said. ""They don't.""Dr. Griffin and his colleagues, the scientists agree, have tough choices to make, but so far, the space scientists say, the choices have been made in a vacuum, without input from the community most affected, namely them.Last year NASA dismantled a longstanding network of scientific advisory committees, and while a new network is in the works, it is not yet in place.As a result, ""scientists feel very much left out of this process,"" Dr. Beichman said. ""You could have involved the community and said, 'Here's what we have to do.' ""He added, ""In the end, even scientists can be responsible.""'"
"'06-03-02,'0','PARIS, March 1 - Frustrated by his failure to find clear evidence that European governments have taken part in the secret detention or transportation of American-held terrorism suspects, the chief of Europe's human rights agency called Wednesday for tougher oversight of European intelligence services and stricter controls over foreign agents operating in Europe.""These are two glaring gaps in Europe,"" said the official, Terry Davis, secretary general of the Council of Europe, which is responsible for enforcing the European Convention on Human Rights.Mr. Davis released a report documenting responses by the council's 46 member states to questions about whether any of their officials had been involved in the extrajudicial transportation or detention of terrorism suspects. No country said yes; some failed to reply adequately or at all. He singled out Italy and Poland for special criticism, as well as two former Yugoslav republics, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Albania's response was so cursory it was not even included.In the report, Mr. Davis called Europe a ""happy hunting ground"" for foreign security services and said the skies ""appear to be excessively open,"" noting that no government had procedures in place to check for human rights offenses in civilian aircraft passing over or landing in their countries.The Council of Europe investigation and one by the European Parliament were undertaken after reports were published in November that the C.I.A. had operated secret prisons in central and eastern Europe as part of its well-documented ""rendition"" program, in which American-held terrorism suspects are sent to third countries for interrogation, outside the jurisdiction of United States law.'"
"'06-03-02,'0','""It was an exercise you have to live with, win and then learn from,"" said Ghassan Tahboub, media manager at the executive office of Dubai's ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the self-styled C.E.O. of the city. ""This was America. There are lobbies, politics and interest groups, and Dubai found itself in the middle of a jungle. In the end I have to thank everybody there for this lesson.""Many here readily admit that as Dubai emerges as a power on the global economic stage, it has much to learn about the ""soft"" aspects of business, from politics to public relations.""We don't have qualified people to speak,"" said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of political science at Emirates University, speaking of the government. ""They don't have experts and commentators. There's no political discourse in this city, and it showed.""A prominent publicist who has been advising the government said the city needed to distinguish itself from other Arab cities and countries. ""Dubai still has a big role in explaining who we are to the world,"" said the publicist, who requested anonymity because of the delicacy of implicitly criticizing other Arab countries. ""Everybody knows who Dubai is in the region. But in America, Dubai is Arab, period.""With native Emirati citizens accounting for only about 15 percent of the population, Arab may be the last word that comes to mind in describing this city. Indeed, the average resident here is more likely to speak English than Arabic, and more likely to be Asian than Arab. Many Indians jokingly refer to Dubai as ""the best-run Indian city.""Set across the Persian Gulf from Iran and just east of Saudi Arabia, Dubai is the financial capital of the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikdoms that won independence from Britain in 1971. But in stark contrast to many of its neighbors, Dubai more than two decades ago turned its back on oil and focused on diversifying its economy.Today, the city derives less than 15 percent of its revenue from oil, but greets more than five million tourists a year, many of them from Europe, and is the Middle East headquarters for more than 800 American companies. Like Singapore, long a model for the city, Dubai has also become a regional trade hub and a magnet for Arab, Iranian and Asian investors.""Dubai has been trying to prove to the rest of the Arab world that there is life after oil, and that in fact it's a better life,"" Mr. Abdulla said. ""The good news is there is room for a second and a third Dubai, just like there was room for a second Singapore in Asia."" The city is lucky in that its long-term strategy has come to fruition at a moment when other Arab states are flush with billions of oil dollars and seeking places to invest their newfound wealth.""This is an Arab city living in a unique moment in history,"" said Mr. Abdulla, who likens Dubai's stature in the Arab world today to that of Beirut in the 1960's and Cairo in the 1950's -- capitals that defined the political direction for much of the region. But whereas those cities focused on the Arab world, Dubai has looked outward and embraces globalization.Other Arab states, particularly Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait, would like to emulate Dubai, but it is not clear they will succeed. Those states may not have Dubai's penchant for finding opportunity in misfortune, nor its openness to outsiders and dedication to unfettered business dealings.In the 1980's it built strong relations with Iran by serving as a waypoint to the rest of the world and offering a lifeline during the Iran-Iraq war. In 1991, it became a haven for Kuwaitis who escaped Saddam Hussein's invading armies, then in 2003 it became a haven for Iraqis escaping the second gulf war. And in the years since, Dubai has gradually fashioned itself into a refuge for Iranians, Arabs and others who have eschewed the call to America or the West in exchange for a lifestyle that comes close, but is in keeping with Middle Eastern values.Modernity, however, has not come easy. With 85 percent of the population made up of foreigners, many of them second and third generation, the city faces a simmering demographic and identity crisis.Dubai is likely to confront numerous other questions as a 45-day investigation of its port management program gets under way, possibly illuminating the emirate's struggles with money laundering and other illicit activities. A spotty human rights record regarding foreign workers could also be a sticking point, along with its participation in a continuing Arab boycott of trade with Israel.In the end, Dubai may be pummeled in the ports controversy, but it will also have gained a lot, some officials say.""In the end, I think Dubai won,"" said Mr. Tahboub, the sheik's media manager. ""We got a lot of publicity, and we deserve it, perhaps not in this manner, but we deserve the publicity.""'"
"'06-03-02,'0','Stanley K. Schlein, the politically influential Bronx lawyer who is the chairman of the city's Civil Service Commission, has been barred indefinitely by state court officials from accepting guardianships and other potentially lucrative judicial appointments.Ann T. Pfau, the state's first deputy administrative judge, informed Mr. Schlein by mail last week that he was being removed from the ""eligibility list for fiduciary appointments."" David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the state courts, declined to comment specifically on the case, but cited state court regulations in saying the only reason for the action would be ""conduct incompatible with the appointment and/or unsatisfactory performance.""""I did nothing wrong,"" Mr. Schlein said yesterday. ""I strenuously disagree with the decision. There was a dispute between myself and another co-guardian over filing of taxes.""He said he had not solicited most of the court appointments; rather he was appointed at the initiative of judges. Last year, Mr. Schlein received at least four appointments from Bronx judges as a court evaluator, who assesses the condition of incapacitated people and their assets, or as a receiver.The court system's inspector general investigated complaints against Mr. Schlien in at least two cases, but neither Mr. Schlein nor officials of the Office of Court Administration would elaborate on the nature of the complaints. In one case, Mr. Schlein was a joint guardian of an estate, and a failure to file timely tax returns cost the estate thousands of dollars. In that case, he was expecting a fee of about $24,000. In the other case, property owned by someone he was representing as a guardian was foreclosed for back taxes.'"
"'06-03-02,'0','DETROIT, March 1 - The Dana Corporation, the auto parts maker, said Wednesday that it missed two payments totaling $21 million that were due on its bonds, heightening speculation that it might be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.Dana said it would take advantage of a 30-day grace period for making the interest payments, which were due on two categories of senior notes.The announcement, which came after the close of trading on Wall Street, sent Dana's shares tumbling in after-hours trading. By evening, Dana's stock had fallen 48 cents, to $1.37 a share. Earlier, the stock had risen 9 cents a share, to close at $1.85.On Monday, Dana said it was continuing talks with its lenders on financing options.That news had cheered investors.

"'06-03-02,'0','Now, changing chip families in a computer isn't as simple as changing a CD in your stereo. The entire operating system and every single software program must be rewritten -- recompiled, the geeks would say -- to speak the new chip's language. That process can take weeks or months.But Apple deemed the big transition to be worth the effort. In return, it gets the state of the art in laptop horsepower: Intel's new Core Duo chip, which bears two electronic brains instead of one. By the end of this year, every Macintosh model will receive an Intel brain transplant. (The same Core Duo chip, running at the same speeds, is also showing up in new Windows laptops. And no, the Intel chip does not make a Mac vulnerable to Windows viruses. It does, however, mean that in theory, with the help of a conversion kit that someone will surely write, a Mac could run Windows.)Last month, Apple put an Intel chip into the iMac; on Tuesday, it put one into the Mac Mini. And this week, the first Mac laptop containing the Intel processor is reaching customers -- a 15-inch PowerBook that's been inexplicably renamed the MacBook Pro. (Why do Mac fans despise the new name so much? Partly because all those harsh consonants -- K, K, P -- make the name uglier and harder to say.)APPLE calls the MacBook ""the finest laptop in the world."" In truth, a more accurate description would be ""the finest laptop in the world, with a small serving of disappointment on the side.""You can see why Apple might be fond of its latest machine. The one-inch-thick MacBook is only 0.1 inch thinner than the PowerBook, but somehow feels worlds sleeker and more futuristic. Fit, finish and quality are spectacular.The wireless antenna has been moved, so Wi-Fi reception is much improved. The guts, from the bus (circuitry) to the graphics card, have been substantially accelerated. Battery life is pretty much the same as on the PowerBooks: 3 to 3.5 hours.The MacBook trumps its predecessor in five substantial areas. First, the gorgeous, 1,440-by-900-pixel screen is much whiter and brighter. It's very, very bright. At half brightness, it matches the brightest setting of other laptops; at full brightness, it could illuminate a runway. It's really bright.Second, a tiny video camera is tucked inconspicuously above the screen. It's ideal for taking Web pictures (640 by 480 pixels), capturing video or creating video blogs to post online. (The laptop's bounteous software collection includes programs for making blogs, Web sites, videos and podcasts.)Better yet, the camera makes the MacBook a perfect companion to the iChat program, which lets you hold smooth, full-screen video conferences with up to three other people over the Internet -- free. Other Mac laptops can join such virtual meetings (using an external camera), but the MacBook is the first laptop with the horsepower to start one. (One high-speed Mac must be the ""host"" of an iChat conference; slower machines connect afterward.)The third enhancement is a slim finger-length remote control. You can use it to operate the MacBook from across the room, summoning slide shows of your photos, concerts of your music collection, playbacks of your movies or playback of a DVD you've inserted.In addition, there's a new power cord. Now, most people probably wouldn't consider a laptop's power cord worth writing home about, let alone taking up precious newspaper space. But this one's a breakthrough.It attaches to the laptop magnetically. If someone trips on the cord -- which, in the real world of laptops, is practically an inevitability -- your $2,000 computer doesn't crash to the floor. Instead, the cord politely detaches and drops, leaving the laptop sitting exactly where it was, grinning away on battery power.This new connector still lights up helpfully to indicate that it's plugged into a working outlet. On the other hand, the white plastic power brick -- in the middle of the cord -- is much bigger and bulkier than before. And, of course, the new connector means that you can no longer interchange the cord with that of any other Mac laptop, as Apple fans have been able to do for years.The biggest change of all, though, is in the MacBook's speed. It's nothing like the 4X or 5X speedup measured by Apple's benchmarks. Even so, this machine flies. It starts up fast, programs open fast, iTunes imports CD's fast, iMovie processes high-definition video fast and Web pages blink onto the screen, fully formed. This laptop makes you aware of how many little pauses you've been tolerating on your old computer.Note, though, that all of that speed is available only when you're using programs that have been revised to work with the Intel chip -- so-called Universal programs. In that category, you'll find Mac OS X itself; all of the programs that come with the MacBook (iTunes, iMovie, iPhoto, Web browser, e-mail program, calendar and address book, and so on); over 900 programs from other companies (they're listed at www.apple.com/universal/applications); and, later this month, Apple's professional programs (Final Cut, Aperture and so on).Unfortunately, most of the big-name programs, like Microsoft Office and Adobe everything, won't be released in Universal format for quite some time. These older programs still run acceptably on the MacBook, thanks to the magic of Apple's smooth, invisible translation software. But they run slowly, with pauses here and there. Even Photoshop runs all right, although photo editors won't want MacBooks as their primary Photoshop machines.Now, Apple always giveth and taketh away. This time around, though, Apple hath taken away quite a few PowerBook features. The S-video connector, for high-quality TV playback of movies, is gone -- a weird omission, considering the multimedia emphasis implied by the new remote control. (You can restore the S-video jack with a $20 accessory cable.) The FireWire 800 connector, for high-speed hard drives, is also missing. The DVD burner is only half as fast as the previous model (4X instead of 8X) and can no longer burn dual-layer DVD discs. Current PC expansion cards (including high-speed cellular Internet cards) don't work or fit in the new narrow-format ExpressCard slot.Most mystifying of all, Apple has removed the laptop's dial-up modem, so you can no longer send or receive faxes. You can't go online in hotels that don't offer high-speed connections (or that charge way too much for them), either. Apple points out that you canbuy its tiny external modem for $50, but that's another piece to pack, track and lose.It's also worth noting that a few programs, here and there, will require updates to iron out problems on the Intel Macs. They include the Now Up-to-Date calendar (the menu-bar list of today's appointments doesn't appear), Microsoft Virtual PC (doesn't run at all) and, at least on my test system, Microsoft Word (jitters like mad when you use the MacBook's ""drag on the trackpad with two fingers to scroll"" trick). And programs designed for pre-Mac OS X machines, now called Classic programs, don't run on any Intel Macs and never will.Over all, the MacBook Pro is a beautifully engineered machine. If it's not the world's finest, it's darned close. (Apple hints that its 12-inch and 17-inch siblings are on the way.)But in so many ways, it's a forward-thinking laptop. It won't achieve true greatness until the important programs have been rewritten for the Core Duo chip's blazing speed, expansion cards for the new slot are available, and wireless Internet is offered by every hotel, bed-and-breakfast and friend's house. Until then, call it the MacBook Po -- for Potential.'"
"'06-03-02,'0','Over the first 50 years of Paul Taylor's career, the choreographer has tried nearly everything, in all its dizzying variety of mood and style. Most of that everything was on display in last winter's 50th-anniversary season and will be on display again in the company's season that opened on Tuesday night at City Center.Linking the variety are two constants: Mr. Taylor as a brand, assuring audiences of a lively good time, and the all-American optimism, underlying even the darker pieces, that defines that brand. But becoming a commodity may limit as well as define.Last year the company celebrated its anniversary in part by expanding its by then customary two-week New York winter season to three weeks. So this year, as ""the next 50 years of greatness begins!"" -- the season's marketing slogan -- there is another three-week season, with the opening gala again including live music.It was a cheerful, overtly populist affair, as befits a gala. The cheerful note was struck right from the start with the New York premiere of the first of two new works this season. This one was called ""Spring Rounds,"" in hopeful anticipation of warmer times. Set to Richard Strauss's Divertimento (Op. 86), a suite of dances after Couperin, Mr. Taylor's choreography evokes the 18th century in an updated way akin to Strauss's rich (for a chamber ensemble) orchestrations.There are lots of patterns for the seven men and seven women. Choral intertwinings, the elevation of the group over any mere individual, are one of Mr. Taylor's great strengths; they help make him a democratic artist. As befits the title, there are all manner of rounds and circles, although there also is a central couple -- Lisa Viola and Sean Mahoney -- who seem to be the celebrators, or the celebrated, in this particular pastoral ritual. ""Spring Rounds"" is sweet and charming, and not to be damned for its innocent inconsequentiality.'"

In that ruling, the commission found the company guilty of monopoly abuse and ordered it to change the way it sold its software in Europe.Two weeks ago, Microsoft responded to the accusations, claiming it was abiding by the 2004 ruling but had been denied the chance to fully defend itself.In a more pointed statement Thursday, Horacio E. Gutiérrez, Microsoft's associate general counsel in Europe, said there was collusion against the company.""The commission, the trustee and Microsoft's adversaries were secretly collaborating throughout the fall of 2005 in a manner inconsistent with the commission's role as neutral regulator and the trustee's role as independent monitor,"" Mr. Gutiérrez said.'"

"'06-03-03,'0','Using a system known as a Dutch auction, Hambrecht collects bids from all interested investors, big and small, and groups them by how much each is willing to pay. Its bankers then count down from the top bid until they reach the highest price at which the selling company could sell all of the shares it wants to offer.The company can choose that price or, for various reasons, a lower one. Hambrecht then sells at the chosen price all the shares that were bid at that price or higher.In a typical first-time sale of stock, investment bankers meet with managers of mutual funds and hedge funds to gauge their interest in a company, then set a price that is slightly below what they estimate is the market value. That method, as much art as science, often excludes most of the individual investors who want to buy shares and occasionally sets off a frenzied first day of trading.The underwriters of the Chipotle offering, led by Morgan Stanley, set a price of $22 a share, for 7.9 million shares. But by the end of the day those shares had doubled to $44 and they have not dipped below $40 since.Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida who studies the public offering market, refers to the difference between what the company received for its shares and what they were worth at the end of the first day as ""money left on the table."" In Chipotle's case, it amounted to almost $175 million.In the same week, Traffic.com sold 6.55 million shares for $12 each and they have barely moved up or down since. The absence of a pop did not seem to bother Traffic.com's chief executive, Robert N. Verratti.Mr. Verratti said he talked to traditional investment banks but hired Hambrecht because the company's goal was to maximize its proceeds from the sale, which it used to pay off $37 million in high-interest debt.""The board of directors felt it was the fairest way to get a price for the company that was meaningful, that wasn't undervalued or overhyped,"" Mr. Verratti said. ""We are always open to questioning conventional thinking."" Plus, he added, ""A lot of our board members were big fans of Bill Hambrecht. He knows technology.""Mr. Hambrecht founded Hambrecht & Quist, which was one of the first investment banks focused on financing the technology boom in Silicon Valley. When he started preaching about the superiority of auctions for raising capital back in the 1990's, he was seen by competitors as a heretic.After all, investment banks typically keep 7 percent of the proceeds of a public offering and receive streams of trading commissions from customers grateful for having been let in on the ground floor of hot new offerings. None of the major firms would do anything to derail the gravy train, or so the conventional wisdom held.Then came Google. When its founders insisted on holding an auction of their first public shares, not even the titans of Wall Street dared refuse. Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse managed the sale, a variation on a Dutch auction, and Hambrecht was part of the underwriting team.Google inspired followers. Last year, Morningstar, a financial research company, hired Hambrecht to take it public in an auction that raised $140.8 million, but only after Morgan Stanley refused to do things Morningstar's way. The underwriters in that deal kept just 2 percent of the proceeds.""Google was important because it led to Morningstar, but Morningstar was more important because it was a purely run auction"" without any big banks imposing their traditional ways on the process, Mr. Corbus said.Shares of Morningstar rose $1.55, or about 8.5 percent, on their first day of trading, to close at $20.05. By Mr. Ritter's measure, Morningstar left about $12 million on the table but saved about $7 million in underwriting fees.Kent L. Womack, a professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, said auctions should be ideal for taking public big, well-known companies. ""Smaller companies have more reluctance to go with the method where they're not getting a lot of aggressive salesmanship put on by the investment bank,"" he said.Yet with the exception of Google, the biggest deals are still done the traditional way. When Burger King filed last month to raise as much as $400 million in an initial public offering, the list of underwriters was just as familiar: J. P Morgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.""You're fighting against some of the strongest brands in the world and some of the best capitalized companies in the world,"" said Mr. Corbus. But, he added, ""We find a lot of companies are listening and taking us seriously.""'"

"'06-03-03,'0','Jurors were also shown a videotape of the group's director, Lauren Gazzola, at a protest in Boston, making reference to the previous acts of violence and warning a target, ""The police can't protect you!""The defendants showed little emotion as the jury foreman announced that they had been found guilty on all counts, but after jurors left the room, Ms. Gazzola wept and Mr. Kjonaas turned to the 20 supporters in the courtroom and offered a wan smile and a shrug.They face prison terms of up to 23 years, but are likely to serve no more than 7 under federal sentencing guidelines, according to Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office.Pam Ferdin, who became president of the group after Mr. Kjonaas was indicted, called the verdict an insidious curb on free speech and said she was ""ashamed of the jury.""""Anyone who writes anything on an e-mail or on a Web site is being treated like we're in a fascist state,"" said Ms. Ferdin, a former child star who played Felix Unger's daughter on ""The Odd Couple"" and was the voice of Lucy in the ""Peanuts"" cartoons. ""Our forefathers fought for the right to fee speech.""But the prosecutor, Charles B. McKenna, praised the decision, saying that jurors had correctly found that the First Amendment does not protect speech that is likely to incite violence.Although Ms. Ferdin said that the verdict would most likely lead the group to disband, the group's campaign has succeeded in causing substantial economic damage to Huntingdon, where, the group claims, 500 animals a day are killed and dissected as part of drug and cosmetic research. By concentrating on a wide range of people who invest in, and do business with, Huntingdon, the campaign led many companies to sever their ties with the lab, including insurance companies like Aetna and Marsh and major financial institutions including Goldman Sachs and the Bank of America.One group of researchers, Americans for Medical Progress, warned that the verdict would lead to more violence and called on federal lawmakers to strengthen the laws against animal rights extremists.""We've seen a dramatic rise in the number of criminal actions against research over the past five years,"" said Dr. John Young, a veterinarian who is chairman of the research organization. ""There's no doubt today's guilty verdicts will provoke still more acts of harassment, intimidation and violence. That is terrorism, and it must be stopped.""Ms. Ferdin vowed that the campaign against animal testing would continue, despite the verdict against her group.'"

"'06-03-03,'0','Much of the optimism on nuclear construction is based on the idea that two recent trends will continue: the cost of competing fuels will rise, as will government controls on carbon emissions. And it assumes that methods of lowering carbon emissions from other energy sources, like coal, will not become widespread.Nuclear power plants are more expensive to build than gas or coal plants, and take several years longer to construct. But once built, they generate energy steadily and cheaply, and emit negligible amounts of greenhouse gases.In European countries where rules about carbon emissions are already firmly established -- in contrast to the United States, where limits are more lenient -- some critics of nuclear power have started to question whether building new reactors is a cost-effective way to lower these emissions.More nuclear power generation ""doesn't make sense economically and environmentally,"" said Norman Baker, a specialist on environmental issues for the Liberal Democrat Party in Britain. Spending £1, or about $1.70, on improving energy efficiency yields seven times the reduction in carbon emissions as spending the same amount on new nuclear construction, he said. ""If you're interested in climate change, you should demand clean coal and renewable resources"" instead, Mr. Baker said.Energy markets have changed significantly across Europe since the 1970's, the last time a significant number of nuclear plants were built. Many European power companies have been privatized, and the energy market opened up to competition in many countries.Any new construction would need to be financed by a private company, which would have to guarantee its investors that the reactor would earn profits in the future. It is not a sure bet, energy analysts say.It is ""too early to speak about a nuclear renaissance,"" a recent report on Europe by the rating agency Standard & Poor's concluded.""The market environment is now significantly riskier than it was when the original nuclear plants were built,"" said Peter Kernan, an analyst at S.& P. who was a co-author of the report. ""Operators would need to be convinced there is a sound and robust business case"" for building a plant before they start devoting capital to it, Mr. Kernan said. He said there was no evidence yet to suggest that.Mark Herlach, a lawyer at Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan who represented British Nuclear Fuels in the deal and who specializes in energy asset sales, defended the price of the transaction, saying it made sense because of the rising costs of other fuels and concerns over greenhouse gases. ""This is a different environment,"" he said.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently approved the design of a new Westinghouse model, the AP-1000, an ""advanced passive"" reactor that would have fewer moving parts in its safety systems. No one has bought it yet.""What Toshiba has done by this acquisition is acquired a leading technology in the AP-1000, "" Mr. Herlach said. And China, the largest emerging market in the world, has expressed a preference for that type of reactor, called a pressurized water reactor.With the Westinghouse deal, Toshiba has acquired more than a new reactor design. The bundle of assets being sold to Toshiba is the distilled result of years of scrambling and reassembling the companies that built reactors in the 1970's and 80's and still service them.The core asset in the sale is the former nuclear division of Westinghouse Electric, which had already absorbed Combustion Engineering. So, with Westinghouse, Toshiba gains two of the four companies that built the existing complex of American reactors. A third company, the commercial nuclear division of Babcock & Wilcox, is now in the hands of Areva, a French-German consortium. The fourth company is General Electric, which is trying to sell a newly designed reactor.With the sale, Toshiba becomes the only vendor to sell updated versions of both types of reactors now in use. But in the short term, the least glamorous parts of Westinghouse's business may prove the most valuable for Toshiba: the company's extensive repair and maintenance services.'"
"'06-03-03,'0','More skepticism is expected from China, several diplomats said, because India has made little secret of its desire for a nuclear weapons arsenal to counter Beijing and its longtime ally, Pakistan.Critics of the deal in Congress and abroad are certain to focus on what they maintain is a double standard embraced by the Bush administration: in effect, allowing India to have nuclear weapons and still get international assistance but insisting that Iran, North Korea and other ""rogue states"" be given no such waiver.But administration officials insisted there was no double standard.""The comparison between India and Iran is just ludicrous,"" R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, said Thursday in a telephone interview. ""India is a highly democratic, peaceful, stable state that has not proliferated nuclear weapons. Iran is an autocratic state mistrusted by nearly all countries and that has violated its international commitments.""What has emerged on Capitol Hill is an alliance of conservative Republicans, who are concerned that the deal will encourage Iranian intransigence, and liberal Democrats, who charge that the Bush administration has effectively scrapped the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.This bipartisan skepticism is unusual, producing for example cooperation between a liberal Democrat, Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, and a conservative Republican, Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, chairman of the House International Relations Committee.Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who leads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has raised more than 80 questions about the deal that he says need to be answered before it can be approved.""People are worried about the precedent of establishing a full-fledged cooperation with India while we're wagging our finger at North Korea and Iran,"" said a Republican aide on Capitol Hill, who requested anonymity because he was describing matters still being weighed in private discussions. ""But it's also true that India is facing an energy crisis, and we can't ignore that problem either.""The negotiated accord announced Thursday by President Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi is aimed at removing the ban effectively imposed by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty on the sale of fuel and civilian nuclear technology to India, in return for India's agreement to put its civilian reactors under international inspections.India, the negotiators agreed, will be able not only to retain its nuclear arms program but to keep a third of its reactors under military control, outside international inspection, including two so-called fast-breeder reactors that could produce fuel for weapons.The accord would also allow India to build future breeder reactors and keep them outside international inspections. A fast-breeder reactor takes spent nuclear fuel and processes it for reuse as fuel or weapons. American officials negotiating with India over the last several months failed to get India to put its current and future breeder reactors under civilian control. But the accord would allow India to buy equipment and materials for only those new reactors that are to be used for civilian purposes.India's refusal to put all its breeder reactors under civilian control was seen in New Delhi as a matter of pride and sovereignty. Mr. Singh, who reiterated the need for India's autonomy in nuclear matters, faces pressure from his governing coalition, which includes the Communist Party and other anti-American elements.India's nuclear program has previously mixed civilian and military purposes. But the accord announced in New Delhi would place 14 of India's 22 nuclear reactors under civilian inspection regimes by 2014. The phase-in and the possibility that breeder reactors may never come under such a regime have drawn fire from critics.""This deal not only lets India amass as many nuclear weapons as it wants, it looks like we made no effort to try to curtail them,"" said George Perkovich, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""This is Santa Claus negotiating. The goal seems to have been to give away as much as possible.""'"

"'06-03-03,'0','""The idea is to let people get on with their research and not reclassify documents unless it's absolutely necessary,"" said Mr. Weinstein, who in the mid-1970's successfully sued the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain records he used for his book about Alger Hiss, the State Department official found to be a Soviet spy.The flap over reclassified records takes place at a time when record-setting numbers of documents are being classified, fewer historical records are being released and several criminal leak investigations are under way. Bush administration officials have cited the need to keep sensitive information from terrorist groups and executive privilege in justifying the need for secrecy, and some members of Congress have called for tougher laws against leaks.Mr. Weinstein met with historians on Thursday to announce the moratorium and plans for a meeting on Monday with representatives of the intelligence and military agencies, which have had teams of reviewers at the archives studying and withdrawing documents.In a statement, Mr. Weinstein called on those agencies to ""commit the necessary resources to restore to the public shelves as quickly as possible the maximum amount of information consistent with the obligation to protect truly sensitive national security information.""The secret agreement governing the reclassification program prohibits the National Archives from naming the agencies involved, but archivists have said they include the C.I.A., the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Air Force.Judith A. Emmel, a spokeswoman for the director of national intelligence, John D. Negroponte, said the intelligence agencies would ""continue to work with the National Archives to strike a balance between protecting truly sensitive national security information from unauthorized disclosure and ensuring that the public receives maximum access to unclassified archival records.""A C.I.A. spokesman, Paul Gimigliano, said the agency looked forward to discussing the issue. ""The C.I.A. has worked hand in glove with the National Archives over the years on declassification and welcomes this initiative,"" Mr. Gimigliano said.Historians have found that among the documents removed from open files are intelligence estimates from the Korean War, reports on Communism in Mexico in the 1960's and Treasury Department records from the 60's. The historians argue that there is no justification for keeping such papers secret.Mr. Leonard has said he was shocked after reviewing a selection of documents presented by the historians, none of which he thought should be secret.Matthew M. Aid, an intelligence historian in Washington who first uncovered the reclassification program and who attended the meeting with Mr. Weinstein, said the archivist's actions were ""a positive first step."" But Mr. Aid said ""the real deals are going to get made"" only after next week's meeting with the intelligence agencies.Meredith Fuchs, general counsel of the National Security Archive at George Washington University, which has posted many of the reclassified documents on its Web site, said Mr. Weinstein ""took our concerns very positively."" She said he did not promise that the reclassifications would stop permanently, but assured the historians that ""if it happens, it will be guided by better standards and it will be more transparent.""'"

"'06-03-03,'0','Next Monday's count could be even larger than this week's, depending on factors like arrest rates and the weather. But Mr. Horn said an influx of another 700 to 1,000 inmates could happen ""in a blink of the eye.""""If it precipitously jumps and tomorrow I'm looking at 14,700 and it could jump by another 700 in a month,"" he said in an interview on Wednesday, ""then I'm going to start making contingency plans.""If, however, a sudden increase in jail inmates occurs later this month, the department might resist opening the Brooklyn jail, Mr. Horn said, knowing that the inmate population typically declines steadily in April, May and June.If the jail count reaches 14,700 in June, , he said, ""that would be a big problem,"" he said.""I would say June is the tipping point,"" Mr. Horn said, ""because June through September it's going to continue to grow.""Once the decision is made to reopen the 760-bed Brooklyn jail, cleaning crews would need several weeks to remove debris left from a renovation -- of the jail clinic, visitor center and administrative office -- that has cost $50 million over the past 12 years, Mr. Horn said.Jail officials said they did not know precisely why there were more jail inmates now, but they suspected it was partly because of the unusually warm winter, which drew more residents outside and into trouble that led to arrests. Delays in the state and city criminal courts may also be leaving more people in jail, unable to post bail while awaiting a preliminary hearing.But the most powerful influence on the city's jail population, correction experts said, is the New York Police Department, whose arrest rates and anticrime initiatives directly affect how many people end up behind bars.A spokesman for the Police Department, Inspector Michael Coan, said officers made 59,191 arrests this year through Feb. 26, compared with 57,263 in the same period last year, a 3 percent increase.Whatever the cause, a 1,000-person increase in jail population in two months is unusual, jail experts said.""That's a pretty big bump,"" Michael Jacobson, a former city correction commissioner who is now director of the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit policy research organization based in Manhattan. ""I would think that it has to do with more than just the weather.""The growing jail population is already causing logistical and bureaucratic problems on Rikers Island, including unacceptably long waits to process newly arriving inmates, Mr. Horn told members of the city's Board of Correction at a public meeting last month.Some neighborhood groups say they are sanguine about any reopening of the Brooklyn jail. But some homeowners wondered if the city has other options.""We really would prefer it not to open,"" said Sue Wolfe, president of the Boerum Hill Association, adding, ""It hurts the merchants; it hurts the people that live and work here.""Judy Stanton, executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association, said a jail reopening would have a visceral impact on the area, with more Correction Department buses driving through, more inmates in handcuffs seen in the neighborhood, and more inmates' family members arriving for visits. But she said her group could live with that.'"
"'06-03-03,'0','WASHINGTON, March 2 - Responding to criticism, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday that it would move quickly to write a policy that determines when it is appropriate to issue subpoenas to journalists.The decision was announced by the S.E.C. chairman after a unanimous vote of the commissioners.The chairman, Christopher Cox, told reporters that he expected the policy would make clear that such subpoenas would be issued ""after other avenues are first exhausted"" and that they would be written in a way that is ""least intrusive upon the First Amendment.""The commission's decision came after criticism over subpoenas issued last month to two Dow Jones columnists, Herb Greenberg and Carol S. Remond, and to James J. Cramer, the host of ""Mad Money"" on CNBC. They were subpoenaed in an investigation into accusations of stock manipulation by a group of hedge funds and a research firm, Gradient Analytics.In a lawsuit filed in California, Overstock.com, an Internet retail company, has accused Gradient and the hedge funds of conspiring to improperly manipulate its stock. Gradient and the hedge funds have denied the accusations.The enforcement of the S.E.C. subpoenas was suspended, at least temporarily, after reporters called the commission on Friday to prepare articles about them.

In the stairwell hangs a mounted deer head -- a mule deer my dad shot a couple of years before I was born. The ears are coming apart at the edges, though the glass eyes are as bright as ever. They have been looking at me since I was an infant. How did these things get to be so old?But nothing meters the passing of time like paperback books. I began buying them when I was in high school. I kept a small stack of them -- Twain, Faulkner, way too much Aldous Huxley -- beside the clock radio on my bedside table. Each one felt like another stone in the raising of a free-form house. I had grown up on public libraries, but cheap paperbacks made it possible to have a library of my own.Now that paperback library is coming apart.The pages have yellowed. The glue in the bindings has turned brittle. The edges are crumbling. I reread a Dorothy Sayers mystery a couple of weeks ago and found myself using a page from the middle of the book as a bookmark. Nearly all of my old Penguin classics -- the ones with the black spines -- are dis-binding themselves. St. Augustine fell into my lap not long ago. As for Defoe, he was one of the first to go to pieces. You would not believe how sallow Samuel Butler looks, how debilitated Flaubert has become. Even poor Kierkegaard, published by Princeton, snapped in two the other day.The books themselves are not really worth restoring, of course. Their texts may be of permanent value, but the physical objects are not. There are only two solutions. One is to go on handling the paperbacks ever more carefully until the time, which doesn't really seem that far away, when all that remains is neatly organized piles of yellow dust on the bookshelves. The other solution is to honor the ephemeral nature of paperbacks and replace them, as if they were vinyl LP's waiting to be replaced by CD's.My Penguin copy of Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park"" is identical to the thousands -- if not tens of thousands -- of other copies that were printed when that edition first appeared. But replacing it means abandoning all the marks I made in it when I read it in graduate school. The marks have almost everything to do with who I was as a reader in the late 1970's and almost nothing to do with Jane Austen. They are probably worth abandoning for that reason alone.But to me, ""Mansfield Park"" is that one edition. Like many readers, I have a visual memory for books. It is easier to remember just where a passage appears, spatially, than exactly what it says. Replacing that old familiar edition means learning a new map of the text. That is the peculiar thing about living with so many books. I can often picture just where I need to look inside a book, though I can't remember for the life of me where the book is actually shelved. The thought of remapping my literary memory is simply too much to stand.'"

Rigas, whose father and brother led a huge fraud that drove the Adelphia Communications Corporation into bankruptcy, was spared prison yesterday as a judge sentenced him to 10 months of home confinement for his role in the scheme. Mr. Rigas was sentenced by Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who said his conduct ""pales in comparison"" to that of his father, John J. Rigas, and his brother, Timothy J. Rigas. Michael Rigas pleaded guilty to falsifying records after a jury was unable to reach a verdict on charges that he participated with his father and brother in the fraud that drove the company into bankruptcy. Judge Rakoff also sentenced him to serve 14 months of court-supervised probation after he completes home detention and to pay a $2,000 fine. Michael Rigas, 52, said he was ""glad to move on with my life."" His lawyer, Henry J. DePippo, said Judge Rakoff handed down a ""just sentence.""

Mr. Immelt said he asked the board to abandon the cash bonus to show his confidence in G.E.'s stock. He will receive half the shares in two years if the stock meets or exceeds a measure based on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and half if cash from operating activities rises at least 10 percent, G.E. said in a regulatory filing yesterday.

Case Invemed Associates, a New York investment bank, won dismissal of a regulatory claim that clients paid inflated fees for access to popular initial public offerings. An NASD hearing panel said the enforcement unit failed to prove wrongdoing and threw out all the claims, the regulator said yesterday in a statement. The NASD made the claims in 2003 about Invemed's business practices in 1999 and 2000. Invemed is run by Kenneth Langone, a billionaire investor who has been accused by the New York attorney general of misleading the New York Stock Exchange's board about then-chairman Richard Grasso's pay when Mr. Langone headed the compensation committee.

Heinz has struggled with its business in Europe, while Wendy's has suffered from stiff competition from a revitalized McDonald's and lackluster sales at its Baja Fresh chain, which offers Mexican food. Mr. Peltz, who controls less than 5 percent of Heinz shares, wants five directors on the board, including himself and the professional golfer Greg Norman, Heinz said, citing a notice that it received from Trian Partners Master Fund, which Mr. Peltz controls.

The agency and Interpublic declined to elaborate beyond saying the investigation is expected to be completed by the end of March. Trade publications reported that the suspension stemmed from the recent loss of the London office's largest account, the Tesco supermarket chain, to an agency being opened by Sir Frank Lowe, the founder and former chairman of Lowe Worldwide. The trade publications reported that Sir Frank and Mr. Lace met several times before Tesco left Lowe London for Sir Frank's new agency, named the Red Brick Road.

"'06-03-04,'0','Speculation that Dana would file for Chapter 11 protection has intensified over the last week and a half. Last week, after reports that the company had hired restructuring consultants, Dana's stock went into free fall. Then on Wednesday, Dana announced that it had missed $21 million in bond payments.Credit rating agencies, already troubled by Dana's recent decision to postpone a stock dividend payment to shareholders while it reviews fourth-quarter and full-year earnings, had lowered the company's debt deep into junk status. On Friday, Standard & Poor's lowered its assessment of Dana to default, its lowest rating.""The entire automotive value chain is just beginning a long restructuring process,"" wrote a Merrill Lynch analyst, John Murphy, in a recent report. ""When the dust settles, there will be fewer, larger, highly specialized, and well capitalized suppliers.""Dana's slide into Chapter 11 opens the possibility that the company could be sold off, broken up or both.Indeed, other domestic auto suppliers have sold off pieces of themselves in attempts to remain afloat. This week, Collins & Aikman, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in May, completed the sale of most of its European operations to the billionaire investor Wilbur Ross.Last year, Delphi sold its automotive battery business to Johnson Controls of Milwaukee. And just this week, the German tire maker Continental said it was in talks with Delphi to purchase some of its overseas operations.In 2003, Dana fought off a hostile takeover bid from ArvinMeritor, a rival supplier based in Troy, Mich. Shortly afterward, Dana's chief executive, Joseph Magliochetti, died of pancreatitis. Dana has long been a crucial part of Toledo, much as Ford has been to Dearborn, Mich.Its lapse into bankruptcy has elements that are similar to recent bankruptcies at other auto parts companies. Like Delphi before it, Dana late last year restated several years of earnings, saying it improperly accounted for some transactions with its suppliers. And like both Delphi and Collins & Aikman, it was also conducting an internal accounting review before the Securities and Exchange Commission stepped in.But Dana is not a former subsidiary of one of the major auto companies and, therefore, cannot expect the sort of financial assistance that Delphi, which G.M. spun off in 1999, is currently negotiating. Second, because only 7,000 of Dana's 19,000 employees in the United States are unionized, labor unrest is likely to be less disruptive than it would be at Delphi if major wage or benefits concessions are imposed.Brian Johnson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said that unlike Delphi's bankruptcy, which many analysts viewed as brinksmanship, Dana appears to have run out of options. ""This company has a long way to go before it can return to its old levels of profitability,"" he said.'"
"'06-03-04,'0','""I think it's a combination of all those things,"" said County Comptroller Howard S. Weitzman, who monitors the agency, which spun off from county government in 1999. The county subsidizes the agency and guarantees its debt.Nassau County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi, who organized the original revamping, said the agency ""is better than it was two years ago, but it failed to take the necessary steps to address the structural budget imbalance,"" including failing to make further staff reductions. The county is committed to saving the system, but only if further changes are guaranteed, he said.The linchpin of the new rescue is money the county receives from tobacco companies as part of a settlement of lawsuits over health care costs from smoking. Like many local and state governments, the county has borrowed against future tobacco company payments and is now proposing a refinancing. That refinancing, estimated to yield $120 million, will be submitted to the County Legislature on Monday.Exactly how that money will be spent has not been decided, said Helena Williams, the deputy county executive. A portion could go to the health care agency, but it could also be used for health education and for care for veterans and members of minority groups, she said.The consultant who designed the first restructuring, George Kalkines, sent the Legislature an outline proposing that $98 million of tobacco money go to the agency, to be spent over eight years. Part of that money would be used to offset the debt that was imposed on the agency by the county when it was created.County officials demanded that the money would be provided only with strict county controls on its use. Up to $15 million would be earmarked for early retirement bonuses, an indication of further staff cuts.Another condition of the new plan is that the agency hire Arthur A. Gianelli, recently retired as Mr. Suozzi's deputy for financial affairs, as the agency's executive vice president and chief operating officer. Mr. Gianelli is credited as having been instrumental in Nassau's own fiscal recovery. Some critics say the agency's leadership deviated from the plan that would have brought it into the black, because they disagreed with elements of it.""I have to hold them responsible,"" said County Legislator Lisanne G. Altmann, who has called for the departure of the agency's president, Daniel A. Kane. But the agency's board chairman, Lawrence C. Gottlieb, said the full board supported Mr. Kane. In its defense, the agency has said its finances suffered from factors beyond its control, including delayed state and federal reimbursements and soaring costs for utilities, pensions and health insurance.The chairman of the Legislature's health committee, Jeffrey W. Toback, said, ""We would like to have been turning a profit, but really, percentage-wise, we're not that far off,"" with a deficit of about 2 percent. Throughout the state, most hospitals say they are either losing money or barely breaking even.Mr. Toback also said the agency was ""unfairly saddled with an $80 million artificial debt"" at its birth. And, he said, because it is a public system, it serves many uninsured patients who cannot pay.A spokesman for the Legislature's Republican minority, Edward Ward, said they support the hospital, ""but we'd like to see the long-term plan."" He added: ""You can't keep doing one-shots every two years.""'"
"'06-03-04,'0','""It's an open question whether Bolton's throwing all the cards up in the air is meant to improve the council or to prove that the U.N. can't reform itself and therefore should be abandoned,"" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch.Yvonne Terlingen, the United Nations representative for Amnesty International, warned, ""If the U.S. insists on revising the text, it will be aiding and abetting those whose purpose is to wreck the council, not to make it stronger.""In an interview on Friday, Jan Eliasson of Sweden, the General Assembly president, who wrote the final text, said: ""I definitely don't want to have an isolation process vis-à-vis the U.S. This is the country of Eleanor Roosevelt and the Bill of Rights. The U.S. belongs on this council, and I want the U.S. on board.""The current rights commission has been faulted for allowing notorious rights abusers like Sudan and Zimbabwe to become members, and producing an effective substitute for it has been seen as a test of whether the United Nations can meet widespread demands for fundamental change.Mr. Eliasson said he had set a goal of resolving the matter by next week because the existing commission is scheduled to begin its annual meeting in Geneva on March 13.This week, Mr. Bolton dismissed the importance of that deadline, saying, ""It might be worthwhile having the commission meet again to remind everybody it is so bad that we can get on the track of real reform.""Asked for comment on the impasse, Benjamin Chang, a spokesman for Mr. Bolton, said there was nothing to add to what the ambassador had already said.Mr. Eliasson put the proposal forward on Feb. 23 for a new Human Rights Council, after months of negotiations and revisions. Mr. Bolton said the same day that it had too many ""deficiencies"" and should be renegotiated, and on Monday he announced that the United States would oppose it if it were put to a vote.Though the United States has no veto power in the 191-member General Assembly, a negative vote could critically undermine the new panel.""A Human Rights Council without the United States would lack credibility,"" Emyr Jones Parry, the British ambassador, said Thursday. Noting that the European Union had formally endorsed the text, Mr. Jones Parry said, ""The job now is to get clarity on what the U.S. wants.""Those working for acceptance argue that provisions in the plan for direct election of members, formal review of member nations' rights records and suspension of gross violators would make it less likely that abusers could join.They also claim that a requirement that new members be approved by a majority -- a minimum of 96 votes -- would eliminate violators from membership. The formula weakens the requirement in the original proposal, made by Secretary General Kofi Annan, for a two-thirds vote for new members of a Human Rights Council.""There's no way that a Sudan or Zimbabwe is going to be able to get on this council,"" said Mr. Roth, of Human Rights Watch.Mr. Roth also contended that Mr. Bolton's absence last fall and winter from some 30 meetings of the group drawing up the proposal led other countries to conclude that the United States was not fully committed to it.In a crucial meeting with Mr. Eliasson last month, in which countries laid down their demands, Mr. Bolton did not mention the importance to the Bush administration of the two-thirds vote. He has since cited its omission as one of the reasons for the United States objection.""The State Department was trying to communicate to the U.N. that the two-thirds vote was an important part of the U.S. position,"" said Tom Malinowski, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch, ""and there was quite a bit of surprise in the department that Bolton didn't bother to mention this to Eliasson.""'"
"'06-03-04,'0','ANCHORAGE, March 3 - For the third straight year, a lack of sufficient snow is causing the start of the 1,100-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which gets under way this weekend, to be moved northward.Anchorage used to be the starting point, but a dearth of snow in the early 1990's led organizers to haul in just enough for a ceremonial start. An ""official restart"" was held the following day in Wasilla, about 35 miles north.That worked for a time, but for the last couple of years there has not been enough snow in Wasilla, either. So starting in 2004, organizers have looked 30 miles farther north, to Willow. There, the race trail spills immediately onto the frozen Susitna River, which requires less snow cover to be suitable for the sleds.The ceremonial start here this year is Saturday, when 84 mushers and some 1,200 dogs take off across Alaska's remote wilderness to Nome.'"
"'06-03-04,'0','Take, for example, the band of Lebanese historians in ""Notebook Volume 72: Missing Lebanese Wars"" who make daily trips to the racetrack. They go to bet -- not on the horses, mind you, but on exactly how close to the finish line the nose of the winning mount will be when the track photographer records its victory. The work's beautiful color reproductions reflect an archivist's loving touch; they carefully annotate the messy notes that the apocryphal Dr. Fadl Fakhouri made of each race. But there is also a Beckett-like darkness: the historians refine and make a fetish of a gambling sport, waiting for the end of the war, when they can begin their work.When Mr. Raad's art is too arch, detached or text-dependent, as in the other photo-based pieces here, it seems frivolous. It doesn't so much lack truthfulness, as gravity. Conversely, with the proper weight, veracity doesn't matter: a larger reality, made of tragedy and farce, opens up.This happens most convincingly in a 16-minute video about a Lebanese man who was held for several months in a small room with five well-known American hostages, all of whom wrote about the experience. The man, renamed Souheil Bachar by Mr. Raad, is telling his side of the story, on tape, for the Atlas archive. He is played by a well-known Lebanese actor, so viewers in Lebanon would immediately see the artifice of the piece. But as the man explains his role as an exotic within the group and describes the homo-erotic tensions that abounded during its confinement, Americans may be struck more by an emotional realness that illuminates power relationships in Lebanon.Even more convincing was Mr. Raad's appearance on Tuesday. Part of a larger piece called ""My Neck Is Thinner Than a Hair,"" a purported archive that documents car bombings in Lebanon, his performance focused on a single bombing in Beirut on Jan. 21, 1986. Seated calmly at a desk, reeling off information about casualties, damage and the probable cause of the bombing (a power grab among Lebanese Christians), Mr. Raad had the unruffled veneer of a government spokesman.The audience sometimes laughed as information accumulated on a large screen behind him: photographs, maps, charts and, finally, a meditative video of the alternately intact and blown-out facades of Beirut.But during the question-and-answer period, you would have thought Mr. Raad was a specialist on the peace process, and in a way he clearly was. Toward the end, he mentioned that the Atlas Group now struck him as no longer adequate, indicating that it would probably be phased out. Still, it was hard to know whether to believe him.""The Dead Weight of Quarrel Hangs: Documents From the Atlas Group Archives"" runs through next Saturday at the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-5793.'"
"'06-03-04,'0','On Thursday, Joseph Osha, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, trimmed his quarterly revenue and earnings estimates for Intel, calling processor shipment data for January ""surprisingly weak.""Friday's report, issued before financial markets opened, caused shares of Intel to decline 17 cents, to $20.32, its lowest point in more than a year, but did not prompt the major sell-off that Intel's misses have caused in the past. Shares of A.M.D. declined $1.82, to $39.51.The revised forecast was one of Intel's sharpest warnings since 2001, when the company's troubles were part of the industrywide slump. Intel's warning Friday was seen as a combination of broad industry troubles and problems unique to Intel.""For the first time we're seeing weakness in the food chain and share loss,"" said Apjit Walia, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ""We don't usually see them at the same time.""Mr. Walia said investors were concerned that Intel's troubles pointed to weakness in the overall PC industry. That concern has already had an impact on Intel's stock, which has declined by a third in the last three months. A.M.D.'s share price, however, had doubled since mid-October, so the effect of the investor concern is more intense.Some PC makers also seemed to feel the chill of Intel's announcement. Dell's stock lost 1.5 percent, to close at $29.13, while Hewlett-Packard was off 2.7 percent, to $33.26.For several quarters, A.M.D. has gained considerable momentum over Intel, particularly in the market for business servers. It beat Intel to market with a line of high-performance dual-core chips as Intel stumbled to recast its product strategy.At the same time, Intel appears to have lost ground in the desktop market, too. Intel's share of the retail PC market in the United States fell by 11 percentage points last year, to 53.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 from 64.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004, according to Current Analysis, a market research firm. Those figures, however, do not reflect sales by Dell, Intel's largest customer, which sells directly to customers and uses only Intel chips.Still, Intel continues to have a huge lead over A.M.D. in the fast-growing notebook market, where Intel's Centrino chipset has helped the company gain a strong foothold. But even there Intel's lead is shrinking. During the fourth quarter of 2005, A.M.D.'s share of the notebook market increased to 30.5 percent from 22.3 percent a year earlier, according to Current Analysis.Intel's gross profit margin, a significant indicator of profitability, will also be affected by the lower revenue, though Intel declined to provide specific figures. In January, Intel projected it to be 59 percent, plus or minus a couple of points. The company also said on Friday that its expenses would be lower.In January, Intel disappointed investors when it reported that sales rose only 6 percent, to $10.2 billion, in the fourth quarter, far short of the estimate Intel had given only six weeks earlier. At the time, Andy Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, said the disappointing sales were a result of a shortage of components from outside suppliers, though he also conceded that the company had lost about a percentage point in market share during the period.In contrast, the day after Intel released its earnings report, A.M.D. said its revenue had risen 45 percent, to $1.84 billion, in the same period.In January, Paul S. Otellini, Intel's chief executive, told financial analysts that he felt Intel would regain market share as the company continued to ramp up its new dual-core processor line this year with a string of new products.""We will be able to retake share in 2006,"" Mr. Otellini said in January. ""We're starting out in more of a hole than we had thought.""'"
"'06-03-04,'0','In the semifinals of the NEC Cup at the NEC Bridge Festival played last month in Yokohama, Japan, Italy played against Japan-YOI, and Israel faced the American team of Gaylor Kasle of Boca Raton, Fla., John Sutherlin of Dallas, Garey Hayden of Tucson and John Onstott of New Orleans.The diagramed deal, Board 25 of 40, shows that even experts can bid to the wrong contract. In the third position, all four Souths opened one no-trump, 15 to 17 points. Each North responded two clubs, Stayman. And every South rebid two diamonds to deny a four-card major. For Italy, Agustin Madala (temporarily suspending his Argentine nationality) rebid a natural and game-forcing three diamonds. South, Guido Ferraro, continued with three hearts, promising values in that suit and trying to imply weak spades. North bid three spades, which East, Masayuki Ino, doubled. That was passed back to North, who redoubled. South's next call was three no-trump, which was passed out.West, Tadashi Imakura, unimaginatively led a spade, and the defenders took the first five tricks. What went wrong? North thought that three spades showed a shortage, although there was no partnership agreement to that effect. But whatever South thought his partner was doing, North had denied a spade stopper, so jack-doubleton was insufficient for three no-trump.At the other table, over two diamonds, North for Japan-YOI, Kazuo Furuta, rebid three clubs, a transfer to diamonds. South, Dawei Chen, bid three diamonds as requested, and now North strangely continued with three no-trump. Surely he should have bid either three hearts, if that would have shown values in the suit, or three spades, if that would have promised shortage. Either would have steered them away from the hopeless game. The board was an embarrassing push. Japan won the match by 130 international match points to 87.For the United States, over two diamonds, Sutherlin jumped straight to three no-trump. This did not give anything away, but West, Doron Yadlin, led fourth-highest from his longest and strongest for down one.The given auction was the only one to reach a makable game. (In fact, 12 tricks can be won in either minor.) When South, Migry Campanile, bid three hearts, North, Michael Barel, knew that spades were uncovered, so went for the 11-trick game in diamonds. (If he had offered four hearts as a final contract, that could have been made, too.)'"
"'06-03-04,'0','""He was a really committed Christian all his life,"" said Patrick Carr, who co-wrote Mr. Cash's 1997 autobiography. (The film was partly adapted from that book, but Mr. Carr was not part of the deal.) Mr. Cash even saw his drug addiction as his metaphorical years in the wilderness. ""As he was going further into addiction, he knew he was traveling away from God; that's how he thought about it,"" Mr. Carr said. ""He was feeling that he was completely separated from God, and that was the worst thing.""At the nadir of his addiction, Mr. Cash went to Nickajack Cave in Tennessee, crawled in as far as he could and essentially lay down to die. When he did, he had the sensation that ""I was going to die at God's time, not mine,"" he wrote in his autobiography. When he walked out, he told his mother that God had prevented him from killing himself.It is not surprising that the scene is not in the film, if only because an internal monologue in a pitch-black space is hardly the stuff of which onscreen drama is made. But several Christian writers have criticized the film for omitting the role of Mr. Cash's beliefs in delivering him from his demons.""His faith was primary in getting him over that problem,"" Mr. Urbanski said.Mr. Black and others have suggested that the role of religion in Mr. Cash's life was minimized because Hollywood generally shies away from such subject matter. But the issue could have just as much to do with the practical limits on making a satisfying film. ""I wanted to make a movie about Johnny Cash and June Carter and the birth of rock 'n' roll,"" said James Mangold, who directed ""Walk the Line"" and wrote it with Gill Dennis. So, he explained, he tried to use Mr. Cash's love for Ms. Carter as a symbol for various forms of redemption.""June was a figure of redemption,"" Mr. Mangold said, ""beautiful in the way that God's light is beautiful.""Certainly, the movie presents an image of Johnny Cash that would appeal to a secular, urban audience: that of an outlaw who struggled to control his worst impulses. It's the same sort of image conveyed in Mr. Cash's ""American Recordings"" albums, produced by Rick Rubin late in the singer's career. ""The portrayal of Cash in the movie is in keeping with the way he was marketed during the Rick Rubin years,"" said Bill Friskics-Warren, the author of ""I'll Take You There: Pop Music and the Urge for Transcendence"" and a music journalist (and occasional contributor to The New York Times) who interviewed Mr. Cash toward the end of his life. ""He felt that he had contributed to the narrowing of his legacy -- not that he didn't embrace the outlaw hero persona, but that it may have removed a dimension or two, such as his devotional side or his humorous side.""Perhaps Mr. Cash's life is simply too big for one movie. He accomplished and stood for so much that when he died in 2003, at 71, different fans could remember him in different ways. In Nashville, he was seen as a dignified patriarch. To baby boomers, he was a country icon who identified with the values of the counterculture. To some younger fans, who discovered him through ""American Recordings,"" he was a consummate outlaw whose lyrics about violence influenced gangsta rap. (Hardly anyone chooses to remember that most of his murder ballads and love songs were not nearly as popular as the comic novelty song ""A Boy Named Sue."")""People remember Johnny Cash differently depending on where they encountered him,"" said Richard Maltby Jr., the director and creator of ""Ring of Fire,"" a Broadway show based on Mr. Cash's music. Mr. Maltby shows several different sides of Mr. Cash, including his cornpone humor in ""Flushed From the Bathroom of Your Heart"" and his faith in ""The Man Comes Around,"" a haunting song about the end times that Mr. Cash wrote toward the end of his life. But it could be argued that he underplays the bad behavior that makes up a major part of ""Walk the Line.""It is hard to know what Johnny Cash would make of any debate about his legacy, though he was obviously happy enough with the movie's script to approve it. But he was far too complex a figure to be claimed by either side in the culture wars. Although he was guided by faith, he never cared much for organized religion; he had a sense of himself as deeply flawed, but not beyond hope of redemption.

"'06-03-04,'0','""There is nothing I can do about it,"" said Yu Songling, 50, a manager at an outdoor market in Anning. The neighborhood, in the midst of being rebuilt, is like a carcass left over from the old socialist economy: decrepit state-owned factories, many of them now closed, and vast numbers of laid-off workers, many scraping by on minimal welfare benefits.""There are a lot of wolves,"" said Mr. Yu of the struggle faced by many people in the neighborhood, ""and not enough meat.""There have always been enough noodles, though. Noodles served in a scorching, spicy broth in the winter or al dente in the summer, tasty, warm, filling and cheap. Lanzhou beef noodles call for chives, red peppers, beef bouillon and noodles, a recipe that to the unschooled seems mundane but one that many locals consider a subtle art.""There is a big difference between noodle shops,"" said Wang Xiaoxia, 29, a taxi driver. ""The taste, the color, the aroma. On days I drive, I always eat noodles. It makes me feel good.""For people in Anning, the Black Sunday of the noodle controversy was Feb. 12. Posters suddenly appeared in noodle shops announcing a price increase of 3 mao, or about 4 cents. Higher costs, wage increases, taxes -- even China's embrace of market economics -- were blamed. A day later, the price rose.Inside one of the biggest shops in the neighborhood, the Gazhang Halal Beef Noodle Shop, the poster with the price increase hung beside a small table where the manager sold boiled eggs and tickets for noodles. In the small kitchen, a cook in a blue smock pulled noodles into long strands, twisting them in his hands like yarn before tossing them into a cauldron of boiling water that filled the room with steam.Kitchens like this one can be a first step out of rural poverty for some migrant workers. At the Gazhang shop, all the workers are from the owner's home village, a typical arrangement. An owner gets cheap, reliable help; a migrant worker gets a trade and a start. But where last year a trained cook made $60 a month, the rate is $90 or higher this year because of increased competition for low-wage workers. At the same time, the price of flour also has risen.""All the expenses are going up,"" said Zhang Yuxiao, 31, the owner of the Gazhang shop. ""We're just following the market.""But was it really just the market? The number of noodle shops in the city has risen, increasing supply. In early February, price increases in other districts of the city had already attracted attention.Then a day after the increase in Anning, The Western Economic Daily broke a major scandal: ""The Beef Noodle Price Hike, a Price-Fixing Scheme."" The paper documented a coordinated pricing scheme, led by a small group of noodle shop owners, who had made threats against any owners who resisted.One owner, Ma Ali, taking a break from his kitchen after the scandal had become public, confirmed the pressure tactics. ""They came over and handed this to me,"" said Mr. Ma, showing a two-page agreement that called for every shop owner to raise prices. ""They said, 'If you don't raise your prices, we're going to tear down your shop sign.' ""But, Mr. Ma added, noodle shops face a problem of too much supply and too little labor: ""Of course, what they are saying is true. We are not making a lot of money. And it is hard work.""It also made a good story. The Western Economic Daily, a private newspaper, wrote editorials, commissioned a poll and continued a barrage of headlines like ""Ruthless Competition Leads to a Vicious Cycle"" and ""Beef Noodles: Price Collusion Is Illegal."" Finally, the city price bureau opened an investigation.None of the ringleaders are confessing to any wrongdoing. (Mr. Zhang, owner of the Gazhang shop, is one of the owners listed as an author of the two-page agreement calling for the higher prices. Asked about price fixing and the newspaper stories, he replied, ""Journalists have nothing else to do."")So far, nearly all of the noodle shops in much of the city are still charging the higher price. An exception is Master Zhang's Beef Noodle, a dingy storefront in the Anning District that opened in late December. The owner, Zhang Wei, 41, has struggled to make a living since losing a factory job more than a decade ago. He thought noodles might work.He, too, got a visit from the noodle cartel, and his wife even signed an oath with a thumbprint, pledging to raise prices. But after Mr. Zhang saw the newspaper coverage, he returned his prices to the lower rate. ""I had a lot fewer customers after I raised the prices,"" he said.And he has other worries. A new shop just opened around the corner. ""And they are giving away eggs,"" he said. ""People here are really poor. They don't make any money, so they go there because they give away the free egg. If I start giving away eggs, I start losing money.""So, like owners of every other Lanzhou noodle shop, Mr. Zhang hopes to succeed by giving Lanzhou residents what they most seem to want -- good noodles.""It's all going to depend on the taste of the noodles,"" he said. ""If people like the taste, they will slowly start coming.""'"
"'06-03-04,'0','A man, a plan, a viola da gamba: Jordi Savall. That's all that was onstage at Weill Recital Hall on Thursday night -- a bearded man playing an amber instrument in muted light -- and it was more than enough to fill an evening, richly.Mr. Savall has gained a tremendous following as a pioneer of early music in general and the gamba repertory in particular. His presentation combined a kind of asceticism and absolute integrity with a profound ability to communicate, and the rapt audience responded to every word he spoke between sets during the second half of the program. He explained, for instance, that early gamba players would have been proficient on other instruments like the lute, so they sometimes held the gamba across their laps. He then demonstrated lute technique in a virtuosic piece called ""La Cloche"" by John Playford, which involved a kind of duet between plucked and bowed notes that Mr. Savall made sound easy.This might give the impression that the evening was didactic; it was not. Before he began to speak, Mr. Savall played more than half of the program in eloquent silence, exploring the nuances of an instrument that in his hands was now throaty, now twangy, now vibrant, now a mere whisper, and always tangibly expressive. His program, called ""Les Voix Humaines,"" wafted gently back through the ages into an ever more distant past, starting with Carl Friedrich Abel, an 18th-century student of Bach, and receding nearly two centuries to Tobias Hume and Alfonso Ferrabosco, whose ""Coranto"" required Mr. Savall to retune his instrument (a technique called scordatura).The hall was full of gamba fans. If not all listeners in attendance fitted that description when they arrived, they certainly did by the time they left.Jordi Savall and his ensemble, Hesperion XXI, will perform a concert called ""From the Old to the New World"" tonight at 8 at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle (Columbus Avenue at 60th Street), presented by the Miller Theater, (212) 854-7799.'"

"'06-03-04,'0','Bolinas, Calif. - TALK of reducing our dependence on foreign oil through alternative energy sources like biomass is everywhere these days -- even on our president's lips. As a livestock farmer and environmental lawyer, I've paid particular attention to discussion about using manure as ""green power."" The idea sounds appealing, but power from manure turns out to be a poor source of energy. Unlike solar or wind, it can create more environmental problems than it solves. And it ends up subsidizing large agribusiness. That's why energy from manure should really be considered a form of ""brown power.""Manure is used mainly in methane digesters, incinerators and certain biodiesel plants. Digesters, often at dairy farms, liquefy manure, then put it in large tanks with anaerobic bacteria. As the liquid decays, the bacteria produce methane, which is purified and used like natural gas. Incinerators generate power by burning animal waste, usually from poultry. Biodiesel involves creating a gas from manure, then combining it with oil from animal fat or plants (often soybeans or corn).Government officials tout such projects as energy generation that benefits both nature and agriculture, and are pouring public funds into them. Few seem to question whether the projects make economic or environmental sense. And there are plenty of questions that need to be addressed. For starters, manure simply does not contain enough energy to produce cost-effective power. Studies show that manure power projects are probably not viable without large public subsidies and are likely to remain so. An analysis by researchers at the University of Minnesota's Applied Economics Department found that methane digesters are dependent on big subsidies to break even. Electrical rates would have to double to pay the full cost of digesters, says Jeff Lorimor, an Iowa State University agricultural engineering professor. Electricity from manure-burning incinerators is also much more expensive than other power, requiring federal and state subsidies to make it competitive with other sources, according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.Part of the problem is that the digesters, incinerators and biodiesel plants are expensive to build and run. Cost and technical complexity make these manure power projects more economical when done on an industrial scale, with operations that produce vast quantities of manure. It's telling that one of the first major manure biodiesel plants in the United States will use the millions of pounds of waste produced by the 500,000 pigs at a Smithfield Foods operation in Utah.But even the largest projects require significant public money for construction and operation. This has also been Europe's experience with manure power projects.'"
"'06-03-05,'0','The massive mountain ranges that surround Chamonix, with more than half a dozen peaks, continue to draw thrill seekers. Visitors with skis, snowboards, paragliders, ice axes and crampons flock there in the winter to test their mettle against the mountains. (Sometimes, the mountains win. Jon Krakauer, the mountaineer and author of the Everest-climbing disaster book ""Into Thin Air,"" christened Chamonix the ""death-sport capital of the world."")For skiers of much less than professional ability who don't have any desire to be upside down at any point whatsoever, Chamonix still provides plenty of opportunities to get the adrenaline flowing. As with many Alpine ski areas, several mountains, from peak to crevasse to glacial valley are open to anyone, for the price of a single ticket. You can venture off the well-trod trails, glide close to glaciers and confront jagged. rocky vistas, often without another person in sight.The town of Chamonix buzzes just after the slopes close, when groups in snow gear gather to buy groceries and down beers, clustered under the heat lamps in the main square. A mixed parade of regulars and locals passed us: snowboarders toted cases of beer and toilet paper and armloads of baguettes; a fur-clad older woman walked her tiny dog; hungry skiers rushed to the butcher shop to buy the best cuts of veal.Night life spots were numerous, varied and comfortably reached on foot from nearly everywhere in town. But there was one major ingredient almost entirely missing: women. The après-ski male-to-female ratio approached 20 to 1 in some slopeside bars, so going out after dark is probably an exercise in futility for male visitors seeking more than a good male-bonding session. (Note: there is one gay bar in town, Le Tof, but the scene is predominantly heterosexual.)No Escape, a nightclub that was converted from an Australian-themed beer hall this summer, was equipped with white leather couches, birch stump tables and Euro-disco beats on our visit. Freshly showered groups of men were huddled by the bar, hopefully eyeing the door each time it opened. The naked anticipation on their faces seemed to say, ""This time, it has got to be the Swedish women's ski team.""They were always disappointed. Instead, it was yet another group of freshly showered men.Consequently, packs of French, British, Swedish, Italian and American men of all ages wandered the streets at night, the Britons often holing up in familiar-looking pubs with names like the Queen Vic to sink pints of beer, the French to L'Expédition, North Americans to the microbrewery MBC and everyone at some point to a Scandinavian night spot, Chambre Neuf. (Chamonix really could use a few bachelorette parties.) That's not to say that the mostly male crowds weren't having any fun.During the high season, Chamonix's clubs and bars attract a clutch of European D.J.'s, who come to play loungey tunes in dimly lighted spots like Goophy's Grill (named for the left-handed snowboard stance, not the cartoon character). By 10 at night, this Moroccan-themed bar was comfortably throbbing with intoxicated shaggy haired boys, moving slowly to Latin-tinged beats.At MBC, groups of men clustered around ""camels"" — giant towers of beer in a tube — before bopping to live bands. L'Expédition, a tiny bar on a side street off Rue des Moulins, mixed excellent mojitos, and its L-shaped couch filled up quickly with well-dressed French après-skiers. The Clubhouse, a hot new members-only hotel, frequently plays host to groups of well-dressed patrons in its Art Deco-looking living room and bar, who come to put sizable dents in the well-stocked scotch and whiskey stores, and tell tall tales about skiing.If you want to stay up really, really late, there are a few dance clubs: Dick's Tea Bar doesn't get going until about midnight and shuts its doors at about 4 in the morning. All this late-night activity takes its toll on the slopes: Chamonix's lifts didn't have any lines until after 11 a.m.But, sometimes, there are things in town that the mountain just can't offer. At 11 p.m. on a Tuesday, the Chambre Neuf, a generic-looking ski-town bar, was packed with mostly male revelers from their teens to their 50's, singing along with a one-man cover band's enthusiastic rendition of ""No Woman No Cry,"" naturally.One baggy-pants-wearing, ski-hatted boy jumped on a table and inexplicably flashed his naked chest. He was suddenly rewarded when two of the handful of women in the room climbed up to dance with him.At the end of the song, they smothered him in hugs. The mountains, after all, can't supply all the thrills.HOW TO GET THEREThe best way to get to Chamonix from the United States is to fly into the Geneva airport; from the New York area, Swiss and Continental Airlines have direct flights, recently starting from about $425 round trip in late March.The town is about an hour's drive (52 miles) on the A40 highway. There is also a bus service, run by Airport Transfer Service (www.a-t-s.net), which costs 42 euros ($51, at $1.21 to the euro) each way.The country and area codes for Chamonix are 33-4.Accommodations in Chamonix vary from apartment rentals to a newly refurbished high-end chalet from the owners of the Milk and Honey bars in New York and London. The latter, called the Clubhouse, says it is for ""members only,"" and membership costs 150 euros. Rooms are open to nonmembers, but rates are about 30 percent higher, from 71 euros a person a night in the ""bunkhouse,"" which sleeps six, to 308 euros a night for the top room, including breakfast and dinner.

For something that is not cheese-based, the excellent Le Panier des 4 Saisons, at 24 galerie Blanc Neige (50.53.98.77) serves seasonal specialties and has a very robust wine list. A three-course dinner for two, with wine, runs about 100 euros.The Canadian microbrewery MBC, at 350, route de Bouchet, (05.53.61.59) serves heaping plates of burgers and fries, as well as Thai-style noodle dishes and great beer.

"'06-03-05,'0','Allison Beth Weiss, the daughter of Diane N. Weiss of Boca Raton, Fla., and George A. Weiss of West Hartford, Conn., was married yesterday to Dennis Arden Brady Jr., the son of June Brady and Dennis Brady of Dallas. The Rev. Joseph P. Watkins, an Evangelical Lutheran minister, performed the ceremony at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami.Mrs. Brady, 35, was until last year the president of WeissPR, a public relations firm in Miami. In the 1990's, she was a fashion model, appearing in magazines like Glamour and Fit. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.The bride's father is the president of a hedge fund in Hartford that bears his name. He is also the founder of Say Yes to Education, a foundation that helps poor children go to college. His daughter is on its board.Mr. Brady, 34, is known as Chip. Until December he was a senior business analyst at the Sprague Energy Corporation, a gas and oil trading company in Portsmouth, N.H. From 1994 to 1999 he was a lieutenant, junior grade, in Naval intelligence at the Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach. He graduated from Penn with two bachelor's degrees, one in international relations and the other in finance from its Wharton School.The bridegroom's father, now retired, was a plant controller and manager in Ford City.

His mother retired as a business teacher at Moniteau High School in West Sunbury, Pa.The bridegroom's first marriage ended in divorce.'"
"'06-03-05,'0','""Some deeply seated conflicts that have accumulated over a long time have yet to be fundamentally resolved, and new problems have arisen that cannot be ignored,"" he said.Mr. Wen focused a large section of his speech on the recently announced effort to build a ""new socialist countryside,"" in which the central government has pledged to spend more on agricultural and rural infrastructure, crop subsidies and social services for the country's 800 million farmers and rural residents.He said he had earmarked $42.3 billon in such spending this year, an increase of 14.2 percent over 2005. That rate of growth is not particularly high for a country that recorded 9.9 percent economic growth last year and has had ballooning tax revenue. Over all, central and local government revenue rose 19.8 percent in 2005, according to a budget report released at the legislative session.Mr. Wen's administration already eliminated agricultural taxes, some of which date back thousands of years, in a bid to raise rural incomes. He said Sunday that China's less wealthy western regions this year would completely eliminate tuition and fees associated with required schooling through lower middle school, potentially relieving a significant burden for rural families.Although it received only passing attention in Mr. Wen's report, China also announced over the weekend that it would increase military spending this year at a higher rate than the increase in rural investment. The official military budget will grow 14.7 percent to $35.3 billion, continuing a long streak of double-digit increases in outlays for its 2.5 million-man armed forces.Some American and European military experts say China's official military budget understates its actual spending by a factor of two or three, and that China now devotes more resources to its military than any country except the United States.Its military spending has been a sore point in relations with the United States, which has questioned why Beijing needs to invest heavily in new armaments, including sophisticated aircraft and naval vessels from Russia, even though it often claims to have no enemies and constantly pledges to follow a ""peaceful development path.""Mr. Wen said Sunday that the spending would be devoted mainly to raise pay for soldiers and to ""strengthen the army's capability to fight a defensive war.""Despite recent tensions with Taiwan over what China views as steps toward formal independence by President Chen Shui-bian, Mr. Wen did not put much emphasis on Taiwan in his speech and used relatively restrained language in referring to the threat of Taiwanese independence.China has experienced an extraordinarily long period of high economic growth that has transformed it from an impoverished socialist laggard into the most dynamic major economy in the world.But Mr. Wen recited a long list of problems that have dogged policy makers in recent years, including excessive government-driven investment, excess production, pollution and high energy use. He said the government would try to reduce the rate of economic growth to 8 percent this year. But he announced the same target a year ago, after which the economy expended nearly 10 percent.He said officials must do more to slow the growth of fixed-asset investment, the primary stimulus in the Chinese economy.Mr. Wen also highlighted a fresh commitment to environment controls and energy efficiency. He said China must reduce the amount of energy it takes to produce each dollar of output by 4 percent in 2006 and by 20 percent in five years.After five years, he said, China will also reduce the quantity of pollutants released into the air and water by 10 percent, a significant challenge given that the country's nearly 10 percent rate of growth means it is burning ever greater quantities and coal and oil, and sending more toxins and chemical waste into waterways.He made no mention of instituting a new system of assessing the economic cost of environmental degradation, disappointing some Chinese environmental experts, who hoped the country would embrace experimental methods of calculating ""green G.D.P.""'"

"'06-03-05,'0','ONE of the more striking trends at the Paris fashion shows last week was the obscuring, by masks, hoods, hats and swaths of fabric, of the radiant faces of the models.The designs shown on many runways are often more symbolic than practical. To some art historians and scholars of gender studies, this shrouding of women by several designers was a sign of misogyny. To other commentators, it was a reflection of cultural anxiety -- a response to anything from Islamic fundamentalism to bird flu. To others still, it was ""only fashion.""Just how much meaning should be read into fashion is a matter of debate. But few would disagree that clothes have always reflected the exuberance, the gloom, even the chaos of the moment. As Barbara Bloemink, curatorial director of the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, put it, fashion can ""both sense and influence.""For example, Anne Hollander, the author of ""Seeing Through Clothes,"" said in an e-mail message that the French Revolution was heralded by the fashionable folk of the time. Women, before 1789, began to wear ""simple, belted shifts,"" while men wore ""plebeian garb"" like ""rough coats and unkempt neckwear.""In the 1920's, fashion -- through tasseled dresses that revealed kneecaps and swung with the music -- expressed the unbridled impulses of the jazz age, said Lisa Koenigsberg, president of Initiatives in Art and Culture, which organizes arts conferences.

"'06-03-05,'0','So when the BBC approached Mr. Davies in late 2003 to update ""Doctor Who"" for the 21st century, he was already teeming with ideas. ""It's a genuine love of mine,"" he said, ""and loving a program means you're not blind to its faults.""For starters, Mr. Davies abandoned its serialized format, in which stories were generally told over three to four 30-minute episodes, in favor of stand-alone episodes of 45 minutes each. (When the new ""Doctor Who"" has its American debut on Sci Fi on March 17, each episode will run one hour with commercials.) He also assembled himself a dream team of writers known for creating some of Britain's most influential television series -- if not necessarily for their science-fiction credentials -- and charged them with updating the show's titular hero for a post-""Matrix,"" post-""Buffy"" generation.""It was very important to Russell that the Doctor not be posh,"" said Mark Gatiss, a co-star and co-creator of the quirky ensemble television comedy ""The League of Gentlemen,"" who was recruited onto Mr. Davies's writing staff. ""It's all about the Doctor being a kind of burning, firework personality that is incredibly attractive, but also slightly dangerous to be around.""To that end, Mr. Davies selected the rugged actor Christopher Eccleston, of the films ""Shallow Grave"" and ""28 Days Later,"" to be the ninth actor to portray the Doctor, injecting the show with a much-needed shot of credibility. ""When people would talk about who was going to be the next Doctor,"" Mr. Davies recalled, ""they would mention celebrity chefs and magicians. And you'd read this stuff in the papers and think, 'How devalued has this property become?' "" He then gave the Doctor a young, unmistakably female sidekick, played by the pop singer Billie Piper. ""It was a bit like casting Britney Spears,"" Mr. Davies said, ""and then we auditioned her and discovered she was brilliant.""In the days leading up to the premiere of the new ""Doctor Who"" in March 2005, the British tabloid press did its best to insinuate that Mr. Davies -- who is openly gay, and proud that his ""Queer as Folk"" series included, in his words, ""more sex than any other program ever"" -- might somehow be an unfit candidate to re-establish a beloved cultural icon.The faithful, however, declined to take the bait. ""The vast amount of fans out there were just elated that the show was coming back,"" said Shaun Lyon, editor of the ""Doctor Who"" fan Web site Outpost Gallifrey (www.gallifreyone.com). ""Pointing out that Russell's gay, let's be honest, you can no longer get a story out of that. Gay is officially boring now.""The first episode of Mr. Davies's ""Doctor Who,"" teeming with rapid edits, dark humor, and, for the first time, computer-generated special effects, drew over 10 million viewers, or about 44 percent of the potential viewing audience, something that would translate into a Super Bowl-size audience for an American broadcast.But controversy eventually caught up with the series: four days after the premiere, the BBC published a news release in which Mr. Eccleston revealed that he would not be returning for a second season -- an awkward situation made more so when he protested that the BBC had falsely attributed quotes to him and had broken an agreement to withhold the announcement until after the show's first season had ended. ""I'm sure it could have been handled better,"" Mr. Davies said. (Mr. Eccleston declined to comment for this story.)Some fans were also slightly mortified by an episode involving clandestine aliens whose otherworldly identities are given away by their flatulence. Yet none complained about a scene from that same show in which the British prime minister (played by a Tony Blair look-alike) is found dead in a closet, or a sequence in the following week's broadcast in which 10 Downing Street is blown up by a missile.And few if any eyebrows were raised when later episodes of ""Doctor Who"" introduced a character named Jack Harkness, a starship captain from the 51st century whose roguish banter implies that he is not merely bisexual, but omnisexual. ""It felt right that the James Bond of the future would bed anyone,"" said Steven Moffat, the creator of the BBC sitcom ""Coupling"" and the writer of the Captain Jack storyline. ""He's far too busy saving the universe to worry about which brand of genitals is best."" In fact, Captain Jack proved so popular that the character was granted his own spinoff series, ""Torchwood,"" now in preproduction.Though Mr. Davies's first season of ""Doctor Who"" has more sexuality, both submerged and overt, than the several hundred episodes that preceded it, the show's producers argue that it is Mr. Davies's creativity, and not his sexual identity, that has made their show a hit.""You come across the occasional nutter who will talk about Russell's gay agenda -- I imagine he keeps it in a pink folder in a special leopardskin safe -- but this is possibly the most heterosexual Doctor we've ever had,"" Mr. Moffat said. ""Clearly, Russell's gay agenda is to turn everyone straight.""As he prepares for the reinvigorated ""Doctor Who"" to begin its second season on the BBC this spring, Mr. Davies said sexuality would always have a place in his science fiction, so long as it is balanced with all the other elements that constitute human experience. ""People expect me to do that visceral stuff,"" he said, ""but I don't think it's that clever to be violent and naked onscreen all the time. There's better, more intelligent and more humane stories to tell. If you want to just get silly with it, you might as well go and see a flasher movie.""TELEVISION Correction: April 8, 2006, Saturday A television review in Weekend on March 17 about ""Doctor Who,"" on the Sci Fi channel, misstated the number of actors who played the title role in the original BBC series from 1963 to 1989. (The error also occurred in an article in Arts & Leisure on March 5.) It was seven actors, not eight.The review also referred imprecisely to the reason the Nestene Consciousness, a life form from another planet, sought a new source of food, and it misstated the composition of a trash bin that swallowed a character. The life form's protein planets were destroyed; it did not exhaust its food supply. The bin was plastic, not rubber.'"

Along with the Shostakovich, he is conducting a new production of Tchaikovsky's rarely performed ""Mazeppa"" at the Metropolitan Opera, where he is the principal guest conductor, starting tomorrow evening. It is the latest installment in what Mr. Gergiev says is his effort to bring more Russian opera to the Met stage.But on this chilly February day, it is Shostakovich who weighs heavily on his mind.The night before, he conducted an intense, draining performance of the cyclonic Symphony No. 4 with the London Symphony as part of his Barbican cycle despite a temperature of 101.5.Why go through with it?""It's a cycle,"" he said. ""I want to deliver on one of the big projects of my life.""Mr. Gergiev blamed his ailment on exposure to the cold during a tour in Japan the previous weeks, when he was stopped by fans outside a hall after a hot shower. ""I thought I could fight my way through it,"" he said. But a day of rehearsing in London proved too draining. ""My body,"" he added, ""just said enough is enough.""It is not something he is used to hearing from his body, he said. His father, from the Caucasus land of Ossetia, died at 106. ""He didn't know where the doctors were,"" Mr. Gergiev said.When he took the podium at the Barbican, Mr. Gergiev said, he barely made it through the first piece, Mozart's ""Linz"" Symphony (No. 36). He had to grab the podium railing behind him several times to keep from keeling over.One London critic, apparently unaware of Mr. Gergiev's state, said he conducted in the spirit in which we like to think Mozart composed: ""so relaxed, so minimalist in physical effort but with a psychic intensity that was overwhelming.""Mr. Gergiev slept briefly at intermission and faced the Shostakovich with renewed strength. ""It's such a big symphony, maybe my adrenaline started to work 100 percent,"" he said. ""I hope it will never happen again that I have to give a concert this way.""On the podium, Mr. Gergiev's idiosyncratic conducting style was on display. He used no baton, and his hands molded phrases, often flickering in seeming sympathy with the vibrato of the strings. It was a crackling performance, a tour de force of dynamic control. As the last notes died away, Mr. Gergiev held still for an impossibly long time. Amid the applause, the players, clapping and tapping their stands with bows, declined to stand when Mr. Gergiev asked them to, a sign of appreciation for him.A warm bond has clearly developed between conductor and orchestra. ""He has an amazing magnetism,"" said Evgeny Grach, one of two principal second violinists. The strength of his performance of a symphony cycle by another Russian with the orchestra, Prokofiev, helped lead to his appointment as the London Symphony's principal conductor, which takes effect next January.Backstage, a gray-looking Mr. Gergiev stood in his dressing room for a half-hour greeting well-wishers, before his manager, R. Douglas Sheldon of Columbia Artists Management, bundled him off to the hotel.The next day, Mr. Gergiev spoke about the Shostakovich symphonies and why it was important to present them all.""These symphonies provoke so much discussion about political situations, the propaganda machine around Shostakovich, historical figures like Stalin or Hitler or Zhdanov,"" he said. ""I try to understand if the purely musical strength can keep the public.""Yesterday,"" he said of the performance of the Fourth, the Shostakovich symphony he has conducted the most, ""I hope most of the audience had no idea which part spoke about Stalin or which part spoke about horrifying other men.""""Beethoven's 'Eroica' was originally dedicated to Napoleon,"" he continued. ""Yet today it's a great, great symphony that lives in many hearts without reference to Napoleon. It's just a colossal piece of music.""He drew a contrast to Prokofiev. ""This guy doesn't speak too much, but he means a lot,"" he said. ""Shostakovich represents a different philosophy. For him, historical social drama needs a huge amount of talk, expression, thoughts. He wants us to feel power but also joy, and judge for ourselves.""Mr. Gergiev acknowledged that some of the symphonies are not ""on an equal level of expression,"" citing the Second and Third Symphonies, criticized for their overtly political nature. Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 15 are, in varying degrees, still waiting to be accepted.""Some of them will evoke curiosity,"" Mr. Gergiev said. ""A couple of them have nice surprises, where you can hear humor or sarcasm. But all in all, they are central symphonies. The true importance of this cycle is that people will consider more, not less, that these symphonies are totally important and irreplaceable. We're committed to do the whole cycle, so we have to find strength in these symphonies.""Mr. Gergiev said he had opted not to present the symphonies in chronological order, because the programs would have been too unbalanced, given the varying lengths. Financial reasons also played a role. An evening of lesser-known symphonies would not sell as many tickets, Mr. Sheldon said.The cycle performances go a long way toward asserting Mr. Gergiev's position as a Shostakovich interpreter. He mentioned the previous generation of conductors who had put their stamp on the symphonies, including Kirill Kondrashin and Yevgeny Mravinsky. They were men who knew the composer. Mr. Gergiev did not, and he heard the music for the first time only at 19.""I find myself being an artist who cannot ignore the achievements of the previous generation,"" he said, ""but who clearly does more and more to go away from the readings of the 50's and 60's."" That might mean finding more joy in the most dramatic symphonies, he added, or discovering links to Bach, Beethoven and Mozart, or emphasizing humor, like the ""crazy scherzo"" section in the first movement of the Fourth Symphony.As for his jet-setting fame, Mr. Gergiev said the reputation was exaggerated.""It's a legend, which says I am 100 percent completely full of rehearsals and telephone calls,"" he said. ""Thank God people don't know I do many, many things. I leave it to them to guess.""Some hints? Playing with his children, he said. In Japan he spent two days at a seaside resort.Anything else? ""I like to go to the sauna.""All the same, Mr. Gergiev claims that he is slowing down.He said he has steered his orchestras -- the Kirov Orchestra and the Rotterdam Philharmonic -- to longer residencies in foreign cities rather than quick stops. The month in Japan with the Kirov was an example. Another is a 10-day stretch in Rome next November, with more Shostakovich on the programs. As Mr. Gergiev takes up the post of principal director of the London Symphony in January, he will slowly scale back his Rotterdam commitment.Meanwhile, he remains artistic and general director of the Maryinsky Theater, touring extensively with the Kirov Orchestra. He is also artistic director of four festivals, including the Moscow Easter Festival and the Stars of the White Nights festival in St. Petersburg, which begins in May. The Kirov Orchestra will run through the Shostakovich cycle during the White Nights festival with guest conductors pitching in.""There are not so many crazy jumps,"" Mr. Gergiev said. ""Europe to America seven times a winter? Not anymore.""'"
"'06-03-05,'0','For nearly 25 years, Lawrence Weschler has been collecting what he calls convergences, tearing out images from magazines, advertising and newspapers that recall works of art or nature or even science.What differentiates his juxtapositions from the ""A Looks Like B"" school of cultural criticism (see Birth, Separated at), is that rather than close a loop, in his new book, ""Everything That Rises"" (McSweeney's), a collection of dozens of these pairings, Mr. Weschler seeks to open it. ""The convergence is like the rhyme,"" he said recently in his art and ephemera-crammed office in the New York Institute for the Humanities, which he directs. ""But then you've got to write the poem about it. The thing that makes it sing is the cascading of possible meanings.""He first saw the photograph, above right, of firefighters at ground zero in a gallery show of Joel Meyerowitz's work. It might not have put the average viewer in mind of a Civil War-era image, but nearly imperceptible cues -- the placement of the flag, the position of the photographer -- reminded Mr. Wechsler of a Civil War image, below right, from 1861 of Union Army engineers (the photographer is unknown).

"'06-03-05,'0','MOSCOW, March 4 - Ramzan Kadyrov, the outspoken leader of a violent paramilitary force that controls much of Chechnya, continued his political rise on Saturday when he was appointed the republic's prime minister.Mr. Kadyrov, 29, is the son of Akhmad Kadyrov, a former Chechen president and separatist turned Kremlin loyalist who was assassinated in 2004. The father had allowed the son to lead several thousand former rebels in a notorious unit called the Presidential Security Service, which gave him a firm base of power.Since his father's death, Ramzan Kadyrov has ascended swiftly, making clear his allegiances to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia while exerting a heavy-handed influence over Chechnya's ruins and leading much of the counterinsurgency against the republic's separatists.He is variously described as Chechnya's most feared man or its most hated one. He has been accused of corruption, torture and approving kidnapping. Russian soldiers and police officers sometimes speak of him in private with disgust, but the Kremlin has embraced him.Mr. Putin awarded Mr. Kadyrov the Hero of Russia citation in 2004, a gesture that made human rights organizations blanch. On Saturday, Alu Alkhanov, the republic's Kremlin-backed president, named Mr. Kadyrov to lead the government.He pledged to work without favor. ""I am officially warning you that my requirements will be tough,"" Mr. Kadyrov told the republic's cabinet, according to Interfax. ""Business and friendship do not mix.""'"

"'06-03-05,'0','It contains the names, salaries and agencies for most employees of the city, as well as some at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency that is not part of the city budget.An anachronism by modern standards of electronic recordkeeping, the list has been published by the city annually since the enactment of the civil service law in 1883, when it originally included employees' home addresses. Since the 1960's, the list has been filed on microfiche, and two years ago the Records Department began putting scanned images of it online.Except for a handful of genealogists and connoisseurs of the civil service system, few people seem to know, or have reason to know, the civil list exists.It enjoyed a rare moment in the sun last month, when an online blog posted a link to it to show the salaries of City Council staff members who had been fired by Speaker Christine C. Quinn.The discovery that such information was not private shocked some readers of the blog, Backroom Deal Breaker, and one posted a message calling it sickening. An anonymous city worker replied, ""It's the price we pay for being employed by the taxpayers.""Indeed, basic information about most employees at all levels of government, including their salaries, is generally available to reporters or members of the public, who often must endure a time-consuming process of extracting it from public information officers. Rarely is such data deposited all at once, as a matter of routine, for anyone to look at it.The civil list is so big -- it dwarfs that of New York's largest private employer, Citigroup, which has about 27,000 employees in the city -- and has such a lengthy pedigree that it can fairly be said to reflect the evolution of the city itself.""There is a racial and ethnic mosaic within the civil service that reflects the politics of the city at various points in time,"" said John H. Mollenkopf, executive director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York Graduate Center.""It's amazing that specializations that were established 100 years ago survive today -- the Irish cops, the Italians in the parks department, the Jewish names in social services,"" he said. ""That reflects, to some degree, the mayors who were in office at the time and what groups formed their electoral base.""Scanning the Police and Fire Department rosters from 2005, for example, finds echoes of the Tammany era, when those agencies were well-known entry points for Irish immigrants. There are 52 McCarthys and 54 O'Connors at the Police Department, far more than at any other agency; the Fire Department has the second greatest number, with 28 and 30, respectively.Earlier versions of the list, going back 30 to 40 years, have few Hispanic surnames compared with the current list.And perhaps because of the relative newness of Hispanics in filling the ranks of the civil service system, the average salary now listed for a Rodriguez is $44,000, compared with $53,000 for a Rizzo.Although formalized under the state civil service law, civil lists cataloguing government employees have been around since colonial times, and were a concept imported from England, where such lists were used to keep track of payments to civilian government employees and pensioners.A history of New York published in the 1840's cites a civil list from 1693, which noted that ""600 pound sterling"" was set aside annually for Benjamin Fletcher, New York's ""governour in chiefe,"" while Godfredus Dellius earned 60 pounds sterling for ""teaching and converting the Indians.""The 1883 civil service law created rules for the hiring, firing and promotion of public employees, and was intended to clean up what was widely perceived as a corrupt, patronage-fueled system in which fealty to political bosses and family connections trumped merit. A key to the law's success was its requirement of transparency, Mr. Mollenkopf said.""The fact that what people are making is public knowledge means that everybody knows where everybody else stands, so there are no secret deals,"" he said. ""It makes salary-setting less arbitrary, and if you learn that you're earning less than the standard for your peers, you can argue for more.""Over time, as the city payroll grew, publication of the list took on a life of its own. When the city proposed suspending it in 1943 to save $20,000 in printing costs, labor unions representing the printing trade sued, arguing that not publishing it ""would mean unemployment, distress and financial loss.""These days, the list is available on the records department Web site at http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/html/govpub/labor1.shtmlThe continued value of the civil list is not entirely clear, because it has failed to keep up with changes in the structure of city government.Historical quirks in the legislative formation of various agencies, for example, means that the list contains records for the 47,000 employees of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, but has no records for the city's 77,000 teachers or employees of its economic development corporation.Even the rationale for publishing it is lost on some city officials. The Department of Citywide Administrative Services, whose City Record journal produces the list, is obligated by law to continue publishing it each year, said Mark Daly, a department spokesman.But over at the Department of Records, which maintains the city archives and has copies of the civil list going back to 1883, Deputy Commissioner Kenneth R. Cobb admitted being in the dark about why it keeps showing up at his office every April.""To be honest, I don't know,"" he said. ""The City Record just keeps publishing it, and we continue to make it available.""Correction: March 8, 2006, Wednesday An article on Sunday about a list that details the salaries of all 267,000 New York City employees misstated the title of Kenneth R. Cobb, an official in the Department of Records. He is the assistant commissioner, not the deputy commissioner.'"
"'06-03-05,'0','""Maybe we shouldn't talk about this right now,"" says Win, who doesn't like cellphones and certainly doesn't assume that any conversation on them is secure.Sykes is alone in the small morgue office on the 11th floor of a tall beige building behind the U.N.C.-Chapel Hill medical school's hospitals. She is bewildered, seems the more she looks into Vivian Finlay's violent death, the more mysterious it gets. First, her case file has disappeared except for an inventory of clothing she supposedly had on when she was murdered, tennis clothes that would appear to be the wrong size. Second, a train fatality may somehow be connected to her case, and now the M.E. and his sky-diving accident.""Just a few things,"" Win adds. ""Keep the details to a minimum. How?""""There should have been an autopsy on the chute.""""How about I e-mail all this to you?"" Sykes says. ""How about you read it yourself? When you getting back this way?""She's feeling very isolated, abandoned. He's up there with that D.A., the two of them headline news. As far as Sykes is concerned, he was involved in a shooting, should get out of town and be down here to help her out. It's his case. Well, that's not how it's feeling anymore. But fact is, it's his case. Typically, now that something sensational has happened, an old lady murdered 20 years ago is a throwaway. Who cares?""As soon as I can"" is all Win has to say about it.""I know you got some real problems up there,"" she replies as reasonably as possible. ""But this is your case, Win. And if I don't get back to the academy, the T.B.I. will be all over me like white on rice.""""Whatever happens, I'll fix it,"" he says.He always promises that, and so far he hasn't fixed a damn thing. She spends all her time talking to him, doesn't study or hang out with the other students discussing what they just learned that day in class, then gets behind and doesn't fully comprehend the newest forensic technology and investigative techniques or have friends. She complains, and he says: Don't worry. You got me, and I'm a great tutor. She says maybe she shouldn't devote so much of herself to a man almost young enough to be her son, and he says he doesn't care about age, then pays attention to some younger woman or obsesses about that D.A., Lamont, who's smart and beautiful, well, maybe damaged goods now. Not nice to think it, but a lot of men don't want a woman after she's been raped.Sykes goes through the medical examiner's case. His name was Dr. Hurt. That figures, might be funny if it wasn't so sad. Fell from an estimated 5,000 feet, she reads, suffered massive trauma to his head, part of his brain avulsed, femurs driven up into his hips, crushed and fractured this, ruptured that. The only mention of the parachute is a brief description by a police officer who responded to the scene. He stated that it appeared the chute was improperly packed. Witnesses claimed Dr. Hurt packed it himself. The possibility was raised that he might have committed suicide.Colleagues and family acknowledged that he was deeply in debt and getting divorced but claimed that he wasn't depressed or acting oddly at all, in fact seemed to be in good spirits. Sykes has heard that tall tale before, people didn't notice a thing. Well, guess why. If they admit that there was even the slightest reason for concern, they might feel guilty about being so caught up in their own lives that they couldn't take a moment to worry about somebody else. She looks up as a knock sounds and the door opens. The chief medical examiner walks in, a mousy kind of pinched-looking woman somewhere in her 50's, granny glasses, a loose lab coat, a stethoscope around her neck.""Now that's something,"" Sykes says, looking pointedly at the stethoscope. ""You making sure everybody's dead before you start cutting and sawing?""The chief smiles, says: ""My secretary asked me to check her lungs -- she's getting bronchitis. Just making sure you don't need anything.""It's more than that.""I don't guess you were around here when Dr. Hurt died,"" Sykes says.""I succeeded him. What's this about, exactly? Why all the interest?"" She glances at the two case files on the table.Sykes isn't going to tell her, says: ""Several seemingly unrelated deaths may have something in common. You know how it is, you have to look at everything.""""I think it was pretty clear he was a suicide. Why's the T.B.I. involved?""""It's not, exactly.""""Then you're not working the case?"" she interrupts.""I'm helping. It's not my case,"" as if Sykes needs to be reminded of that one more time. ""Like I said, I'm just checking out a few things.""""Well, I see. I guess it's all right. I'll be in the morgue if you need me,"" the chief says, and she shuts the door behind her.Guess it's all right. As if Sykes were a Girl Scout.Then she thinks about Dr. Hurt, wonders about his state of mind, his level of professional competence, the effort he put forth if he was anxious and depressed and no longer valued his life. She imagines herself in a similar situation and is fairly certain that she would miss important details, might not try very hard, maybe wouldn't care. She keeps that in mind as she reviews the train fatality, a terribly mutilating death that occurred at a rail crossing on a two-lane rural highway, the freight train's engineer stating that when he rounded a sharp curve at approximately 8:15 that morning, he saw the decedent lying face down across the tracks and couldn't stop the train in time to avoid running over him. The victim's name was Mark Holland, a 39-year-old detective with the Asheville Police Department.His widow, Kimberly, was quoted in the newspaper as saying that her husband left their Asheville home early the previous evening en route to Charlotte, where he was to meet with someone, she didn't know whom, but ""it was related to work."" He was not depressed, and she could think of no reason whatsoever to account for his alleged suicide, that she was extremely upset and adamant that he would not have done such a thing, especially since ""he just got promoted, and we were excited about starting a family.""The autopsy revealed a laceration to Mark Holland's head and an underlying fracture (well, no damn wonder) that was consistent with a fall.Dr. Hurt wasn't just depressed, Sykes thinks, he was ""lights on, nobody home,"" bought into the Charlotte cop's suggestion that Holland was crossing the railroad tracks on foot, perhaps on his way to have a secret meeting with a witness, tripped, fell, knocked himself unconscious. Dr. Hurt signed out the case as an accident.Forensic scientist Rachael, or Rake, as Win calls her, places the letter on top of a porous metal platen called a vacuum bed. She hits a switch and begins vacuuming down the box.He has watched her work the electrostatic imaging system before, and sometimes they've been lucky, most recently in a kidnapping case, the ransom note written on a sheet of paper that had obviously been under one the kidnapper used earlier to jot down a phone number that led the police to a Papa John's pizza, where he had placed a takeout order and paid for it with a credit card. Rake wears white cotton examination gloves, was happy when Win told her he hadn't touched the letter with his bare hands. After they're finished looking for indented writing, the letter the man in the red scarf left for Win at the Diesel Café will go to the fingerprints lab to be processed with ninhydrin or some other reagent.""How's Knoxville?"" asks Rake, a nice-looking brunette, started out with the F.B.I. lab in Quantico, decided after 9/11 and the Patriot Act that she didn't want to work for the feds. ""You gonna start talking with a dueling-banjo twang?""""That's North Georgia, 'Deliverance' country. No dueling banjos in Knoxville, just blaze orange everywhere.""Rake covers the letter and the platen with a clear plastic imaging film that reminds Win of Saran Wrap.""Win?"" she says without looking up. ""Sounds trite, but I'm sorry about what happened.""She passes what she calls a corona-discharge unit over the surface. Win always smells ozone when she does it, as if it might rain.""I don't care what anybody says. You did the right thing,"" she adds. ""I don't see how anybody can even question it.""""I didn't realize anybody was,"" he says, getting one of his uneasy feelings.She tilts the tray and cascades toner-coated beads over the imaging-film-covered document, says, ""Heard it on the radio during a coffee break.""The electrostatic charge causes the toner to migrate to indentations that aren't visible to the unaided eye, areas of the paper with microscopic damage caused by handwriting.""Go on. Tell me,"" Win says, already knows.""Just that Lamont said you're being investigated, like maybe it wasn't a good shooting. A big story's being run tomorrow, and they're already promoting it with teases."" She looks at him, adds, ""How's that for grateful?""""Maybe what I expected,"" he says as latent images appear in faint black, partial words, confusing.Rake isn't impressed, points out something on the threatening letter the man in the red scarf left for Win, decides, ""Think we'd better try 3-D enhancement.""Toby Huber is cold, shivering as he sits on his balcony of the Winnetu Inn in South Beach, Edgartown, smoking a joint, looking at the ocean, at people in long pants and jackets walking along the beach.""I'm sure it's gone, just not where, exactly,"" he says over his cellphone, annoyed but a nice buzz going. ""Sorry, man. But at this point, it doesn't matter.""""That's not for you to judge. Try to think for once.""""Look, I told you, O.K.? It must be when I threw out everything in trash bags, whatever. And I mean everything, including any food in the fridge, any beer, anything. Even hauled the trash about five miles away to a Dumpster behind. . .some restaurant, can't remember which one. Damn, it's freezing here. I've checked and rechecked, and it's not here. Man, you need to chill before you have a stroke.. . .""A knock from inside the one-bedroom suite, and then the door opens, the housekeeper is startled as Toby steps inside and glares at her.""What is it you don't understand about 'Do Not Disturb'?"" he screams at her.""Sorry, sir. The card's not on the door."" She quickly vanishes.Toby returns to the balcony, takes a toke, almost yells into the phone: ""I'm out of here. You got that? Where it's warm. Boring as goddamn hell here. You've put me through enough, and it'd better be worth it.""""Not quite yet. It will look suspicious if you're suddenly flying off to L.A. You need to stay put a few more days. We've got to make sure it's not someplace where it might be found and cause us a lot of trouble. Think, Toby!""""If it's anywhere, it's still inside the damn apartment. I don't know.. . ."" Something glimmers. He's not sure he checked under the bed, mentions that, adding: ""You know, when I was reading it, could have stuck it there. Why don't you go check your goddamn self?""""Then you're so spazzed out about it, go check again!""""Think! Where did you have it last? You sure you didn't leave it at the office?""""I told you. I took it with me, know that for a fact because I was reading it.""""I didn't tell you to take it so you could read it!""""Yeah, so you've said about a hundred times by now, so you can just shut up about it, O.K.?""""You put it in your car, drove it there? What? Reading it in bed? So you could look at the damn pictures? Are you insane? Where did you have it last?""""I told you to shut up, don't be such a hysterical old woman. It's not like I can exactly go look. So you help yourself, look till the cows come home. Maybe I missed it, O.K.? I had it all kinds of places when I was there. In a drawer, maybe in a pile by the bed, under the pillow. At one point I had it in a basket of dirty clothes. Or maybe it was in the dryer.. . .""""Toby, are you sure you didn't take it with you to the Vineyard?""""How many times you going to ask me? What difference does it make? So what if it's gone? Nothing worked the way it was supposed to, anyway.""""Well, we don't know it's gone, now do we? And that's a problem, a very serious problem. You were supposed to leave it where it would be found. The last thing you did before you left. But you didn't. You completely ignored my orders.""""So it probably ended up in the trash, O.K.? That's probably what happened when I cleaned things out."" He takes another toke. ""You know, it's not like I didn't have a lot on my mind, right? And he kept wanting to know about the money, said I'd better give it to him in advance, and I said half of it upfront, and then you took forever getting it for me.. . .""""How the hell did I end up with someone like you?""Holding in smoke. Exhaling: ""Because you're lucky. So far. But that can change, you know.""Rake is lost in a software world of pixels and Z ranges and histograms, panning, zooming, rotating, manipulating light angles, surface reflection, contour enhancement while Win stares at the big flat screen, looking at shadowy shapes in magnified 3-D.He starts seeing a word, maybe numbers.""An e, an r, a w, lowercase?"" he suggests. ""And 3 and 96?""There's more. She keeps working, the words and numbers materializing. Odd-looking, almost overlaid.""More than one note that's left indented writing?"" Win considers.""That's what I'm thinking,"" Rake says. ""Could very well be indentations from different writings on different sheets from the same pad of paper. You know, you write a note, then another page down, write another one, and the pressure of the pen or pencil pressed against the paper is sufficiently strong to create an indented image multiple sheets down.""She works some more, and theymake out what they can: 3 year market exclusivity, and O.K., and partly overlaying that, suggesting it was a separate writing on a separate sheet of paper, is $8.96 and what appears to be, up from an earlier forecast of $6.11.Next week: Lamont plots to cover her tracks.THE FUNNY PAGES: III: SUNDAY SERIAL Previous chapters are online at www.nytimes.com/funnypages.'"
"'06-03-05,'0','Thanks to advances in technology, the tissue-processing industry has expanded to make use not only of donated organs but also of muscle, bone, tendons and skin for research and transplant. But now prosecutors say that some people who desperately needed help were given diseased tissue and body parts. Already there are patients who say they have contracted syphilis and hepatitis from these transplants. Imagine for just a second, if you can bear it, being told by your doctor -- as thousands of patients have been -- that in retrospect they aren't exactly sure where the tissue they put in you came from. How could you run away from yourself fast enough?What has been surprising to me is how disturbed I have been as a relative of someone whose body was stolen. Unlike the recipients of diseased tissue, I have not been made physically ill. Walking around with a turned stomach is a far cry from learning you may have hepatitis or H.I.V. But the malaise I've contracted is one of sorrow and apprehension.I've thought a lot about bodies over the last couple of months. I am not unfamiliar with dead bodies; I have watched autopsies, prayed over victims of fatal accidents, been in embalming rooms, funeral homes and emergency rooms and stood at many a graveside. I have counseled parishioners and families not to see our bodies as the core essence of who we are. Most of the time when I see a dead person, my reaction is: ""Oh, not here anymore. Gone."" I believe with all my heart that this is true. And though gone where, exactly, is less clear, gone to whom is pretty certain in my mind: gone to God.The body we are left with is empty in the way that counts most. But we have loved that body in its particulars -- perhaps the long fingers, the arch of the neck, the quirky smile, the strong arms, the face undone by tears.Though we may say what we'd like done with our bodies when we die, the final decision rests with our next of kin. My father stated in his will that he wanted to be cremated and most of him, I guess, was. He was 95 years old, frail and ravaged by illness. After he died, my goal was to leave that picture behind. As anyone who has lost someone to an extended illness or a brutal accident knows, you try very hard to let go of the image of that person's final suffering and instead to remember the person as he or she really was. Usually, we manage this.For almost three months, this goal has eluded me. Since I learned what happened to my father's remains, it has all been about the body, that still, empty vessel. It's hard to get beyond the body when the body is the story.Cultures and religions throughout history have all had strict rules about dealing with the dead. Whether because bodies are believed to be ritually impure, bearers of disease, or sacred entities, their treatment is carefully prescribed.In our society, figuratively and literally, we place death in a box, and we are able to grieve and to heal so long as its lid is nailed firmly shut. But sometimes the lid comes unhinged: when suspicion surrounds a death, when someone is missing in action, when a body is lost in a tsunami, or when, as in my father's case, someone steals a body and chops it up and sells it. Then we are plunged into an alien dimension.It wasn't always this way. A hundred years ago, people died at home. The women of the family would then wash Grandmother's body and dress her up in her Sunday go-to-meeting clothes as the funeral baked meats were laid out in the parlor. Where I live in Vermont, many old farmhouses have a room off the kitchen that used to be called the ""borning room."" In it, people were born and died close to the warm hearth.But since that time, we have handed death over to doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and funeral homes. And perhaps that's not surprising, since none of us wants to dwell too much with the unpleasantness associated with death.Maybe that's why the tissue transplant industry is so poorly regulated. The criminals in my father's case were apparently able to pull off multiple frauds. They forged his death certificate, medical history and family consent forms. A simple phone call to his next of kin would have revealed that these documents were false, but at no point in the chain did anyone audit them. Although it is illegal to buy and sell tissue, those involved may have managed this by exploiting a loophole that allows harvesters to charge an unspecified processing fee. And although the Food and Drug Administration forbids the transplant of tissue contaminated with malignant cancer, the tissue bank in question may not have run the mandatory tests.Being an organ or tissue donor is still a safe, generous and commendable act. Unfortunately, cases like these cast suspicion on all such endeavors. More stringent oversight would help restore confidence in organ and tissue donation programs. And public awareness could help bring such changes about, if citizens will bring pressure to bear on their Congressional leaders and other elected officials.No doubt the recipients of illegally procured tissue continue to live in fear, while we, the families told that our loved ones' remains were stolen, remain haunted by the body's gruesome fate. Just last week I discovered the unsettling detail that it was my father's legs that were cut off and sold. To know his bones were sold was one thing, but to see him standing truncated before me is another entirely.But perhaps this is a wake-up call -- at least for those still able to sleep. We must not be so intent on distancing death from our hearths that we fail to do everything in our power to make sure this sort of crime never happens again.Susan Cooke Kittredge is the minister of the Old Meeting House.'"
"'06-03-05,'0','Still, though fewer in number, the players performed the usual barroom scenes. Near the mirrored wall, where newspaper and television reporters were staked out at tables, a tall woman with her blond hair in a ponytail leaned into a stocky man dressed in black. They kissed. He rested his hand on her backside. The reporters talked among themselves.The stocky man walked off, leaving the woman to furtively wipe away tears until he came back to claim her. He led her on unsteady feet into the night.The birthday party dwindled, and a wedding party fresh from a rehearsal dinner arrived. They were young and well dressed and strolled in with authority. A woman in cream pants slipped off her red wool coat, revealing a halter top and the glow of skin, and heads swiveled. An Ohioan named Brian Blitz, 25, stole two glances at her shoulders.""This is the bar?"" a woman visiting from Chicago asked, eyes wide. She had heard of Ms. St. Guillen's slaying.It had been too late to change the site of the post-rehearsal gathering.A little while later, Matt, a bond trader from Hoboken, N.J., held court alongside the bar. He wore a baseball cap with a beer logo that read, ""Urban Angler.""The killing of Ms. St. Guillen worried him, he said. He said he always pays for his sister's cab fare back home from her late shift as a bartender in Midtown.Then he told a weather story. It went like this: A woman who is a friend of his went to a bar in New Jersey and met a man who took her home with him. The next morning the man told her to leave his apartment, but after the foyer door closed behind her she realized that it had snowed so heavily that she could not open the front door. She was stuck in the foyer. She rang the buzzer for three hours before he let her back in.Matt guffawed. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I laughed pretty hard when I heard that one.""It was now 3:03 a.m. A song by the Killers played. The night had claimed most of the wedding party. Reporters outnumbered patrons.Outside, where Ms. St. Guillen's face gazed from a reward poster, lay the path she probably took to The Falls, the bar at 218 Lafayette Street where she was last seen a week earlier between 3:30 and 3:50 a.m.Into the biting cold, around the corner onto Spring Street, past the red-faced young man who said, ""I just need a bar,"" and the police officer who handed out fliers with Ms. St. Guillen's picture. Past the Spring Lounge, where chairs already nested on tables, past the headless mannequins at Jenne Maag, past the banana peel and the chicken bones on the sidewalk outside the Gatsby bar.To The Falls. Where, at 3:45 a.m., the bouncer announced that the bar was closed, sending a steady stream of young people into the night, and a temperature below 20 degrees. A tall brunette in a black halter top and a silver and gold lamé skirt who had been barefoot inside the bar came outside, struggling to put her arms in her green wool coat. She tottered in black pumps. Her legs were bare.""Where's Kate? Where's Kate?"" she asked her friends, young men dressed in overcoats and scarves. They told her that Kate had already left. ""I don't believe you,"" she said, as she stumbled and fell on the sidewalk.'"
"'06-03-05,'0','""The situation in Iraq is in the hands of the Iraqi people,"" he said. ""A government of national unity must be formed to bring the country together.""Responding to the calls for faster political progress, Mr. Talabani told reporters he would summon the new Parliament into session for the first time before March 12, meeting a constitutional deadline that was deferred after a surge of sectarian violence last month.The Parliament will eventually have to approve the new government, including the choice of president and prime minister, but its opening session is likely to be taken up with less contentious matters, including the choice of a parliamentary speaker.Another priority for General Abizaid appeared to have been the need for strong action to curb political militias, a demand that gained fresh urgency amid sectarian violence that followed the bombing last month of a Shiite shrine in Samarra, north of Baghdad, and Shiite reprisal attacks on at least 30 Sunni mosques.American commanders say that many Shiite reprisals were carried out by the Mahdi Army, a militia loyal to Moktada al-Sadr, a volatile Shiite cleric, and that in some places, including Baghdad, units of the American-trained Iraqi Army stood aside, clearing the way for the militia fighters to carry out the attacks.Mr. Talabani's security adviser, Wafiq al-Samarraie, said after the meeting with General Abizaid that Mr. Talabani had agreed on the need for militia groups to lay down their arms. For Kurdish leaders like Mr. Talabani, who control much of northern Iraq through militia groups known as the pesh merga, the step would be a major concession.But Mr. Samarraie said Mr. Talabani's position was unequivocal. ""It is a clear and open call for the brothers who carry weapons,"" he said.At a separate news conference, Bayan Jabr, the interior minister, who has been accused by Sunnis of allowing Shiite death squads to operate within police ranks, said he had sent a letter to all militia groups asking them to disband, as required by the new Iraqi Constitution.Mr. Jabr said that he had allocated $10 million to a fund to help militia members find new jobs, including positions in the new army and police forces.General Abizaid's visit coincided with signs that the disputing Iraqi groups might be working for a resolution to the political standoff. Although the Shiite bloc won 130 of the 275 parliamentary seats, the Constitution effectively requires a two-thirds majority to choose the prime minister, giving the Kurdish, Sunni and secular parties, with about 140 seats among them, a de facto veto.A delegation from Mr. Jaafari's Dawa party met on Saturday in Najaf with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the country's most powerful Shiite religious leader. The Dawa officials emerged with what they presented as an endorsement of Mr. Jaafari. But Mr. Sistani, who opposes a direct clerical role in government, made no statement.The possibility of compromise over Mr. Jaafari's nomination appeared to grow with the announcement by President Talabani that he had spoken by telephone with Mr. Sadr, the Shiite cleric whose parliamentary bloc backed Mr. Jaafari as the Shiite alliance's choice for prime minister.Mr. Talabani said the two men had agreed that the main Kurdish parties should send a delegation to discuss the issue with Mr. Sadr.The direct contact between Mr. Talabani and Mr. Sadr was a surprise, considering the ambiguous and often incendiary political role played by Mr. Sadr, who has twice led armed uprisings against American troops and made plain his contempt for politicians like Mr. Talabani who have worked closely with the Americans.""We appreciated his gesture,"" Mr. Talabani said. ""We have been hoping for a long time to consolidate our relations with Mr. Sadr.""Shiite officials have suggested in recent days that the groups opposing Mr. Jaafari might have taken their position more in the hope of negotiating for a stronger voice in a Jaafari-led government than with a realistic expectation of unseating him.Mr. Talabani hinted at this possible tactic on Saturday when he told reporters that the Sunni Arab and Kurdish groups opposing Mr. Jaafari ""want to be real partners in the government, not ministers without a voice.""""We want a real share of power,"" he said, ""and a role in drawing up domestic, foreign and security policies.""Mr. Talabani spoke in a conciliatory tone of Mr. Jaafari, who has been heavily criticized for irresolute leadership since becoming prime minister, both by rival Iraqi politicians and, privately, by senior American officials. After the eruption of sectarian violence last month, in which hundreds of Iraqis died, Mr. Jaafari was accused of being slow in ordering the curfews that eventually curbed the violence.""The objection is not to Mr. Jaafari personally,"" Mr. Talabani said. ""We respect him. He has been our friend for 25 years. The issue here is the need for a national unity government that will truly unify all the parties.""The political maneuverings occurred on a day of relatively little violence. At least 13 people were killed in insurgent bombing and mortar attacks, according to the Interior Ministry, including seven people who died when a mortar destroyed a minibus across the road from a market in the Diyala Bridge neighborhood of southern Baghdad, and two Shiite worshipers who were killed by gunmen as they left a mosque in the northern city of Kirkuk.[Early Sunday, The Associated Press reported, Interior Ministry commandos stormed a Sunni mosque in western Baghdad, killing three people -- including the mosque's imam and his son -- in a 25-minute gun battle, the police said. The cause of the clash was not known, nor was the name of the Sunni cleric who was killed.[American forces blocked off the area after the exchange of fire, which also wounded seven people, said Lt. Maitham Abdul Rezzaq of the police.]DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, March 4 (Reuters) -- Al Qaeda's deputy leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, called on Muslims to attack the West, in an audiotape posted on the Internet on Saturday, urging strikes similar to those in recent years in New York, London and Madrid.In a video of his remarks televised by Al Jazeera, he also urged the Islamist militant group Hamas not to recognize peace deals signed by the Palestinian Authority with Israel.He also called on Muslims to boycott countries where satirical cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad had been published, including Denmark, Norway, France and Germany, and said that Muslims should prevent the West from ""stealing Muslims' oil.""Muslims have to ""inflict losses on the crusader West, especially to its economic infrastructure with strikes that would make it bleed for years,"" Mr. Zawahiri said. ""We have to prevent the crusader West from stealing the Muslims' oil, which is being drained in the biggest robbery in history.""It was not clear if the tape was made before the failed Qaeda attack last month on a Saudi oil facility.Commenting on Mr. Zawahiri's remarks, a Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said the group had no intention of recognizing the deals with Israel.'"

"'06-03-05,'0','The broad stock market declined slightly last week on concerns about interest rates, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index managed to claw its way to a gain.Reports suggesting that the economy was expanding briskly weighed on the broad market. Some investors feared that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates higher than had been anticipated.Some companies, however, benefited from the economic news. JDS Uniphase, which makes parts for fiber optic networks, rose more than 21 percent for the week, among the biggest gainers in the Nasdaq. Communications companies have been expanding their networks briskly. As a result, Wall Street expects the company to report a profit this quarter for the first time since 1999. The company's shares remain far from their 2001 peak.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 40.26 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 11,021.59. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 1,287.23. The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 15.56 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 2,302.60.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed to 4.68 percent from 4.57 percent the previous week.

"'06-03-05,'0','THE BRIEF HISTORY OF THE DEADHERE is a novel with an intriguing premise: that humans are divided into three categories, comprising those who are still alive, those who have died but live on in the memories of the living, and those who are dead and forgotten. In ""The Brief History of the Dead,"" Kevin Brockmeier has imagined a city populated by members of the second category, a sort of limbo with strong resemblances to this world. Its residents have what look like normal lives, but they're entirely sustained by the thoughts of people still living in the real world.As the story begins, there are ominous signs that all is not well. For one thing, many of the recent arrivals in the city of the dead are very young. There is mention of those who were ""killed in the bombing."" A few pages later, there are hints of ecological disaster and worse: ""The Americans and the Middle East had resumed hostilities. . . . Brazil was developing another mutagenic virus."" And then this: ""Jeffrey Fallon, 16 and from Park Falls, Wisconsin, said that the fighting hadn't spread in from the coasts yet, but that the germs had.""The time is the near future, and it's clear that the more alarming tendencies of the present day have grown considerably worse. Particularly troubling, apart from the terrorist warning beacons (to which nobody pays any attention), is what sounds like a worldwide epidemic of a terrible virus. It's no surprise, then, that people are flooding into the city of the newly dead. In fact, it's becoming distinctly overcrowded.We then cut to a research station somewhere in Antarctica, where a woman called Laura Byrd is working on a project for Coca-Cola (the corporation wants to convert polar ice for use in making soft drinks). Suddenly, she and her two male colleagues find themselves without Web or telephone connections to the outside world, and it slowly dawns on them that they're not only totally cut off but without hope of rescue. The two men set out to get help and never return, leaving Laura alone. Then the heating panels stop working. Then the electricity goes. In desperation, Laura provisions a sledge and sets off onto the ice.Back in the city of the dead, the overcrowding has eased off. But if the number of residents is dwindling, that can only mean there aren't as many people alive in the real world. This alarming development is confirmed by the few recent arrivals who speak of widespread social breakdown and mass infection of a fatal and fast-moving disease called ""the Blinks."" Once the global population has been wiped out, of course there won't be anybody left to sustain the city.But then we remember Laura Byrd, out there somewhere in Antarctica on her sledge. Because of her remote and isolated location, she will presumably not be infected by the Blinks, and therefore will not perish with the rest of humanity. Which would mean that those -- and only those -- in the city whom Laura Byrd remembers will survive.'"

"'06-03-05,'0','""THEY really let us create the show we wanted to create,"" Fred Goss was saying about ABC's approach to ""Sons & Daughters,"" the quirky new comedy in which he stars. But he was being only half accurate. The show may have made it to the air with its quirkiness intact, but the original pitch differed from the final product in one glaring way: Mr. Goss wasn't in it.As Mr. Goss and Stephen McPherson, president of ABC Entertainment, tell the story, the initial idea was for Mr. Goss to direct episodes of the show, which he created with Nick Holly. But ""Sons & Daughters,"" which has its premiere on Tuesday, is no typical sitcom -- the performances and dialogue are largely improvised by the actors, which means casting the series took extra care. Many audition tapes were made, with Mr. Goss's disembodied voice on them, coaching and playing against the auditioners. Gradually it became clear who the lead should be.""After watching so many audition tapes,"" Mr. McPherson said, ""I went to him and said, 'Fred, you've got to do this role.""'And so Mr. Goss (who ended up directing some episodes as well) is Cameron, the man at the center of the extended and somewhat fractured family chronicled in the show. The material is not pure improvisation -- ""We have a real strong spine; we have story arcs,"" Mr. Goss said -- but much of the dialogue is created by the actors on the spur of the moment. That gives the show a deliberately ragged, hand-held-camera kind of appearance that sets it apart from scripted series. ""We have no choice but to make our show look documentary,"" Mr. Goss said, ""because the camera people don't know who's going to talk next.""The improvised format also makes for some intensive sessions in the editing room. ""That really is the final rewrite,"" Mr. Goss said. ""Basically the show is a puzzle: there are a lot of different ways to assemble it, and there is no one right way.""'"

""If there's some very good advertising idea, I'll consider it, but there's not right now.""Many people on the Web have sided with her right to profit from her blog, but executives at Sina.com, which is based in Beijing, say they have no plans for blog ads.

Whatever critique of affirmative action Mr. Summers intended was lost in what became a soap opera of hurt feelings and facile accusations of racism.There was a larger issue of campus governance at stake. While it is certainly in Harvard's best interests to ensure that its university professors remain productive at a high scholarly level (the president reportedly slighted Dr. West's recording of a rap CD), it is unclear on what authority Mr. Summers was challenging Dr. West in the first place. The provost, not the president, is the chief academic officer of any university. But Harvard reinstituted a provost only in the early 1990's, and the weakness of that position is suggested by the provost's near invisibility through the public battles of the Summers regime.The ideological groupthink of Harvard's humanities faculty does patent disservice to the undergraduates in their charge, but it is the faculty alone that should properly determine curriculum and academic policy, a responsibility that descends from the birth of European universities in the Middle Ages. Over the past 40 years, there has been a radical expansion of administrative bureaucracies on American college campuses that has distorted the budget and turned education toward consumerism, a checkbook alliance with parents who are being bled dry by grotesquely exorbitant tuitions.Mr. Summers's strategic blunders unfortunately took the spotlight off entrenched political correctness and changed the debate to academic power: who has it, and how should it be exercised? Nationwide, campus administrations faced with factionalized or obdurate faculties have in some cases taken matters into their own hands by creating programs or reducing and even eliminating departments. The trend is disturbingly away from faculty power.Hence more is at stake in the Harvard affair than merely one overpriced campus with an exaggerated reputation. Support for Larry Summers was strong among Harvard undergraduates and outside the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which constitutes only one of Harvard's many colleges and professional schools. The Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz protested that Mr. Summers had been removed by ""a coup d'état."" But by his failure to provide a systematic rationale for his words and actions, Mr. Summers gave the impression of governing by whim and impulse. The leader of so huge and complex an institution cannot be a whirling dervish.IT now remains to be seen whether Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences is capable of self-critique. Will its members acknowledge their own insularity and excesses, or will they continue down the path of smug self-congratulation and vanity? Harvard's reputation for disinterested scholarship has been severely gored by the shadowy manipulations of the self-serving cabal who forced Mr. Summers's premature resignation. That so few of the ostensibly aggrieved faculty members deigned to speak on the record to The Crimson, the student newspaper, illustrates the cagey hypocrisy that permeates fashionable campus leftism, which worships diversity in all things except diversity of thought.If Harvard cannot correct itself in this crisis, it will signal that academe cannot be trusted to reform itself from within. There is a rising tide of off-campus discontent with the monolithic orthodoxies of humanities departments. David Horowitz, a 1960's radical turned conservative, has researched the lopsided party registration of humanities professors (who tend to be Democrats like me) and proposed an ""academic bill of rights"" to guarantee fairness and political balance in the classroom. The conservative radio host Sean Hannity regularly broadcasts students' justifiable complaints about biased teachers and urges students to take recording devices to class to gather evidence.These efforts to hold professors accountable are welcome and bracing, but the danger is that such tactics can be abused. Tenure owes its very existence to past intrusions by state legislatures in the curricular business of state universities. If politicians start to meddle in campus governance, academic freedom will be the victim. And when students become snitches, we are heading toward dictatorship by Mao's Red Guards or Hitler Youth.Over the last three decades of trendy poststructuralism and postmodernism, American humanities professors fell under the sway of a ruthless guild mentality. Corruption and cronyism became systemic, spread by the ostentatious conference circuit and the new humanities centers of the 1980's. Harvard did not begin that blight but became an extreme example of it. Amid the ruins of the Summers presidency, there is a tremendous opportunity for recovery and renewal of the humanities. Which way will Harvard go?Op-Ed Contributor Camille Paglia is the university professor of humanities and media studies at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.'"
"'06-03-06,'0','That everything is borrowed and everyone is shilling may be the most charming characteristic of the Academy Awards show, a billboard for an industry where people will billboard anything.Thirty years ago movie stars wore their own clothes and their jewelry to what used to be what amounts to a high-end trade dinner. Ten years ago, the job of movie star stylist could hardly be said to exist. Now it is accepted that even though actresses like Reese Witherspoon or Naomi Watts are paid well over $10 million a movie, there is no reason they should pry open their wallets to pay for clothes, never mind picking them out.Few people outside fashion could be expected to have heard of people like Jennifer Rade, who styles Angelina Jolie, or Anna Bingemann, who picks out what Rachel Weisz and Ms. Thurman wear, or Rachel Zoe, whose clientele includes Lindsay Lohan, Kate Beckinsale and Keira Knightley, who turned up in a low-cut Vera Wang dress with Grecian-style draping, a fishtail hemline that gave her the look of Dream Date Barbie and a 1960's necklace from the Roman jeweler Bulgari.""I'm choked up by the power of image-making,"" Ms. Zoe said recently, adding that there is no dollar amount one can put on the effect it has on the bottom line when Ms. Knightley wears a particular designer's dress.""Once it shows up on the red carpet,"" said Lana Marks, a designer of high-end handbags, ""you really can't keep it in stock.""And that is why every star worth her salt is careful to name-check her benefactors.""I had a lot of offers and this is the one I chose,"" Ms. Watts explained repeatedly of her pale, lace-trimmed one-shoulder dress from Givenchy, accented with a diamond necklace from the jewelry designer David Yurman.

Were there really 60 self-tanning treatments scheduled for presenters in the days leading up to the ceremony, at just a single dedicated suite in the Four Seasons hotel?

"'06-03-07,'1','This is a concern, because removing the implants entails surgery, raising the chance of infection. Advanced Bionics, the company that made the discontinued model, is now owned by Boston Scientific, in Natick, Mass. Paul Donovan, a spokesman for Boston Scientific, noted that fewer than 200 children under age 6 have that type of cochlear implant. ""The overwhelming majority of patients who have one are at a low level of risk and there is no need to have the device removed,"" he said in an e-mail message.Other implants were not linked to such a high risk. Only one child among the 3,436 in the study who had different models was reported to have meningitis since September 2002. That underscores the need to ensure that children with implants are fully vaccinated against infections and monitored for signs of meningitis like high fever and stiff neck. The findings also suggest that with the offending model off the market, the incidence of meningitis may fall significantly.That is a relief to doctors and educators, because for the most part the story of cochlear implants — which enable users to hear through electrical signals delivered directly to the auditory nerve — has been an increasing, even surprising, success.""Kids who are implanted at 1 by age 3 and 4 have language that is pretty normal,"" said Ann Geers, a psychologist who has studied the effectiveness of cochlear implants. ""That's something we've never seen before in profoundly deaf kids.""Cochlear implants do not help all deaf children understand language. Dr. Geers, an adjunct professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School at Dallas, said they worked in enough children that they had ""turned deaf education upside down.""""More kids now are being educated in regular mainstream classes with their age mates and not in special schools for the deaf anymore,"" she said.In the last 20 years, 11,000 American children have received the implants, according to data from the manufacturers. An estimated 50,000 to 70,000 Americans younger than 18 are profoundly deaf, said Dr. John K. Niparko, an otolaryngologist at Johns Hopkins.The cost of an implant runs $60,000 a child, including the price of the device, the surgery, therapy and other expenses, said Dr. Niparko, a consultant for all three companies that make the implants.Early implantation is encouraged, so that the children can hear in the crucial months and years to learn language. A recent study of 36 children with implants found that those who got implants before 2½ were better able than children who got implants later to integrate sound with a speaker's lip movements, a sign of expertise in using language. ""It was a dramatic difference after 30 months,"" said Nathan Fox of the University of Maryland, a co-author of the study. The Food and Drug Administration has approved implants for children as young as 12 months. Some surgeons implant them in even younger babies. A recent trial at New York University found that implantation in children as young as 6 months was safe.Whether it confers any greater advantage in learning language has yet to be studied. Dr. J. Thomas Roland Jr., an otolaryngologist who is a co-director of the N.Y.U. Cochlear Implant Center, said he had seen remarkable language skills in some of his youngest patients. Typically, an implant needs to be tuned up once a month or more in its first year. Regular but less frequent adjustments are required subsequently.A crucial consideration in deciding on implants is whether the child lives in an environment conducive to learning speech, in which people continually talk to the child and encourage the child to respond. ""Birds learn to sing because when they practice, the mother gives them a worm,"" Dr. Niparko said. ""Cochlear implant success depends on the same kind of encouragement.""The implants do not provide perfect hearing. In noisy places, it can be hard to pick out voices. Nor do they hear all the details and nuances of music. But when children with implants are in a ""one-on-one quiet situation,"" Dr. Niparko said, ""80 percent of them are hearing something pretty close to what a normal hearing person hears.""'"
"'06-03-07,'1','Dr. Carrillo and his colleagues, as well as government officials, worried they might have a mini-epidemic on their hands. But tissue samples from Corcovado spider monkeys — Costa Rica's most endangered species of monkey — sent to a laboratory at the University of Texas for analysis showed no evidence of a virus or other pathogen.The story of what really happened in Corcovado, or at least the prevailing theory, is less worrisome in the short term than a disease outbreak, but it has the potential to be deadly serious.Costa Rican researchers think the affected animals starved to death because of a lack of available food sources and an inability to forage for food during several months of extreme rain and cold.September, October and November brought excessive rainfall, nearly twice the monthly averages, and unusually low temperatures to many parts of Costa Rica, especially the Osa Peninsula, which juts into the Pacific in the south.Corcovado averages about 24 inches of rain in September, 31 inches in October and 20 inches in November. In 2005, more than 39 inches fell in the park in September, 59 inches in October, and 41 inches in November.While it is impossible to know if the weather in late 2005 is related to climate change, the Costa Rican team studying Corcovado worries that if the climate changes and produces more extreme weather events like this, animal populations may not bounce back easily, said Gustavo Gutiérrez-Espeleta, a wildlife population geneticist at the University of Costa Rica.The weather caused several problems for the monkeys. Some fruit trees did not bear fruit during the rainy months. Others produced fruit but it fell to the ground early, leaving nothing on the trees for long periods of time.Compounding the problem, researchers say, was that monkeys were unable to look for food because of the incessant rain.""If you have a long period of days where it's raining, raining, raining, they just stay in the tree waiting, and they don't eat,"" said Grace Wong, a wildlife conservation researcher at National University in San José.""The monkeys need sun to dry off,"" said Ronald Sánchez Porras, an ecologist at the University of Costa Rica. ""You can see in the tree when the monkey moves his body to try to shake the water off. But when it rains like this, it's impossible.""Four species of monkeys live in Costa Rica, and all four are found in Corcovado.The squirrel and capuchin monkeys rely on a diet of fruit, insects, leaves and stems; howler monkeys mainly eat leaves. The spider monkeys consume a diet almost exclusively of fruit, leaving them the most vulnerable.Spider monkeys in Corcovado also appear to have very low genetic diversity, said Dr. Gutiérrez-Espeleta, the wildlife population geneticist.""I've been finding that when we measure genetic variability, the spider monkey is the worst in Costa Rica,"" he said.Dr. Gutiérrez-Espeleta said he believed that a genetic bottleneck might have occurred several years ago among Corcovado's spider monkeys, leading to reduction in their genetic diversity.In addition to being hungry, the monkeys that died were severely dehydrated, apparently having been unable to venture down from the trees for water.This may have stressed their immune systems to the brink, causing parasites and infections that occur normally to become deadly.Feces collected from the park showed elevated levels of usually benign parasites, a sign, Dr. Guttiérez-Espeleta said, that the animals' immune systems were not functioning properly.Animals living near the edges of the park or outside the park in nearby privately owned rain forests seemed to fare better than those living deep in the park, probably because they had access to fruit trees and other crops planted by people.""I never saw toucans here before, but they were fighting outside my office because we have banana trees,"" said Marleny Jimenez, who owns the Drake Bay Wilderness Resort, a tranquil getaway at the headwaters of the Río Agujas, about five miles up the coast from Corcovado.At Bosque del Cabo, a 650-acre private rain forest preserve and eco-resort at the southern end of the Osa Peninsula, also near Corcovado, most of the property's fruit trees did not bear fruit during the excessive rains, said the proprietor, Kim Spier.""We have also noticed that we had many more animals, especially monkeys, than usual that were trying to get into the kitchen or our fruit storage area to steal food,"" Ms. Spier wrote in an e-mail message.While some estimates hold that as many as half the spider monkeys in Corcovado died in the last few months of 2005, the scientists cannot be certain, in large part because it is not known exactly how many animals live in the park.The Wildlife Conservation Society and Conservation International provided money for research into the animal deaths and will pay for follow-up visits to the park every other month.Researchers will then tag monkeys to keep tabs on troop populations and mark trees to monitor fruit production.""The lesson is that we should document as much as possible from now on with this kind of event and try to establish a link to the climate change process,"" said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Costa Rica's minister of the environment and energy.For several decades, Costa Rica has had a strong record of natural resource protection, with strict rules on what sort of resource extraction is allowed on private lands.The country uses a gasoline tax to pay landowners for ""environmental services"" provided by forests on their land, like watershed protection, greenhouse gas mitigation, biodiversity and scenic beauty.""Costa Rica is committed to reversing the process of climate change,"" Mr. Rodríguez said, citing the country's rain forest preservation efforts, ban on oil drilling and interest in renewable energy.""We don't see the rest of the world doing a good job,"" he added.Corcovado's starving monkeys, the Costa Rican scientists worry, may be early messengers of future problems associated with a changing climate.""It's proof,"" said Ms. Wong, the wildlife conservation expert, ""that sometimes we can establish a national park and say, 'We're taking care of animals here,' but the situation is out of the control of humans.""'"
"'06-03-07,'1','Men are at higher risk of being killed in car accidents if they are obese, researchers have found.Their findings spotlight not only another risk of being obese but a factor car designers may need to take into account as obesity increases in the United States.The study, which will appear in April in The American Journal of Public Health, found that obese women were not at higher risk of death in car crashes. The explanation may lie in the differing body shapes of men and women, said the lead author, Dr. Shankuan Zhu of the Injury Research Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin.Because of their weight, men experience greater forces in a crash. Other physical problems linked to obesity may also make men less able to withstand their injuries. And obese people can present treatment challenges in the hospital.But Dr. Zhu said he leaned to simple physics as the best explanation, specifically the momentum heavier people have in a crash.""Obese people have more mass,"" he said.The study drew on data gathered by the federal Department of Transportation involving more than 22,000 drivers who were in crashes from 1997 to 2001.The study also found some evidence that being heavier could help in an accident, perhaps because of the cushioning provided by fat. Men who had very low body mass indexes, below 22, were also at somewhat high risk of death. Those who were slightly overweight had the best survival rate.'"
"'06-03-07,'1','The Bell telephone companies have lobbied hard for the last year to get Congress to adopt a measure that would make it easier for them to offer video services. The phone companies want federal legislation that would pre-empt local authority over such services. (The cable industry has fought equally hard against the measure.) That fight is central to the telephone companies' new strategy of offering video service to compete head-on with cable and satellite companies that offer paid television services.As Internet service providers, the large phone companies are meanwhile involved in a political fight over whether they must offer equal access to all Web providers, an approach called ""Net neutrality."" Content providers like Google and Yahoo, and companies providing Internet-based phone service like Vonage, seek legislation to prevent phone companies from favoring their own Web sites and those offered by their partners, over rivals and Internet phone companies.While the phone companies fight that move, they are also battling legislative efforts to make it easier for municipalities to offer free wireless Internet services.But the continued consolidation of the telephone industry that the latest deal contemplates gives the phone companies' opponents significant political leverage in all three debates -- and for the time being, could make it harder for AT&T and Verizon, the two largest phone companies, to prevail on all fronts.""The reverberations at first will be subterranean, but they will be of earthquake proportions,"" Mr. Hundt said.The cable industry, awaiting regulatory approval of its own major consolidation in which Time Warner and Comcast expect to divide up Adelphia, was quick Monday to point out the perils of a consolidating telephone industry. But Verizon, signaling that it will not raise major objections to the BellSouth deal, issued a statement that called it ""logical and predictable."" And Kevin J. Martin, the chairman of the F.C.C., issued a noncommittal statement.""The F.C.C.'s primary responsibility is to determine whether the proposed transaction is in the best interest of consumers,"" Mr. Martin said. ""We will carefully weigh the information presented, examining any allegations of specific harm in individual markets and the potential benefits for the deployment of new services.""The agency will be considering what conditions to impose on the deal in a process that could take as long as a year.The AT&T-BellSouth deal provides a vehicle for regulators and lawmakers to consider what to do in the ""Net neutrality"" debate and whether the telephone companies can charge more money for certain content providers. The issue came to national attention in November when Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the blunt-speaking leader of AT&T, complained in an interview in Business Week Online about the current state of affairs.""We and the cable companies have made an investment, and for Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes free is nuts,"" Mr. Whitacre said.In the same interview, Mr. Whitacre was asked whether it was possible that his company would ever acquire BellSouth.""It sure would be nice, but it doesn't have much chance of happening because of market power, size, etc.,"" he replied. ""I think it would be real hard to do. I don't think the regulators would let that happen, in my judgment.""While AT&T seems to have overcome that concern, lobbyists and others in the industry said Monday that there would be pressure on regulators to impose conditions assuring that consumers continue to have unfettered access to the Internet, and precluding discrimination by AT&T against companies like Google and Yahoo.Any new rules, however, might not prevent phone companies from offering a more expensive tier of service providing faster Internet access for the transfer of video and other large files.In the case of the video-franchise legislation, the telephone companies in recent weeks had begun to see progress on favorable legislation in the House that could be derailed by the deal.Wasting no time, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the cable industry lobbying and trade organization, sent a letter to top lawmakers on Monday arguing against legislation that would remove local control over the introduction of video services by the Bell companies.The cable industry, having put together its franchises city by city, contends that the phone companies should face the same hurdles for video delivery.""It is important to take stock of where we are in 2006,"" said the letter from Kyle McSlarrow, president and chief executive of the association. ""In the last decade, the Bell monopolies have all but wiped out their telephone competitors; they have swallowed their long-distance competitors; and with the announcement of the AT&T-BellSouth merger, they are on the verge of recreating Ma Bell. And only one competitor really stands in their way: the cable industry.""'"

"'06-03-07,'1','Few mileage logs are up to I.R.S. standards. (You can see the rules on page 26 of I.R.S. Publication 463, which can be downloaded from the Web site www.irs.gov.) Frequent travelers may find it tricky to prove in an audit that they were where they claimed to be. So, many of these frazzled motorists are turning to several new products aimed at making a mileage log a more manageable task.The I.R.S. would not reveal how many tax returns are singled out because of questions about mileage claims or whether it had any plans to pursue business travelers who try to claim a high mileage deduction, citing a policy of not commenting on its audit practices.But why tempt fate? One solution is to make your log book digital, using a program on your personal digital assistant. Trip Mate, for example, is a clever application that allows you to keep tabs on your car's mileage through a Pocket PC. The program, which costs $29.95 and can be downloaded at www.bitstorm.com, lets you record whether the trip was for business or pleasure, calculates your car's mileage, and allows you to export the data.Michael Lahrkamp, a founder of Bitstorm, which is based in Toronto, said that demand for Trip Mate had been robust in recent months, in part because there were more pocket PC's in use. But he also said business travelers were increasingly concerned about keeping accurate records. ""People are looking for answers,"" he said.Another fix involves Global Positioning System technology, and while it promises to be more accurate, it is also costlier than a manual log. The G.P.S. systems developed by Advanced Tracking Technologies, for instance, start at about $200 a car. Its product, the Shadow Tracker, is a radar-detector-size device installed in a car that automatically records trip mileage, time and position using satellite tracking technology. A business traveler (or I.R.S. auditor) could pull up a detailed report that includes a car's location at a given time, the route traveled, stops made and even the speed of the vehicle.These gadgets are already credited with bailing some drivers out of tax trouble. ""We had a customer for a trucking company who was questioned for a fuel-tax deduction,"" said Kris Hauptman, a senior sales manager for the Houston-based company. ""Once they showed the auditor the records, they were off the hook.""Of course, there is always the tried-and-true method for tracking mileage: the old-fashioned log book. Business travelers may grumble, but it remains the most popular way to record a trip. And the cheapest. Dome Publishing, a specialty publisher in Warwick, R.I., offers a simple auto mileage log for a suggested retail price of just $2.15.Andrew Hamilton, the director of sales for Dome Publishing, said his sales were up, too. He suggested that the soaring price of gasoline had made travelers more intent on being reimbursed for every mile from their employers. ""Mileage is becoming a major issue,"" he said.None of these solutions are without a catch. A computer can crash, just as my pocket PC did a few weeks ago, and unless your data is backed up to a server, you may lose your records. G.P.S. systems are not foolproof either: they, too, are subject to the vagaries of technology. Some systems measure distance only as the crow flies, failing to account for the entire trip because they ignore the twists and turns in a road. And a paper-based mileage log can be lost, too.Which of these methods works best? For larger companies, a digital system may be ideal, says Lee Czarapata, the director of business vehicle services at the research firm Runzheimer International in Rochester, Wis. His company offers a Web-based mileage log for its clients, which can be downloaded and stored on CD's. ""Since logs should be kept for a length of time -- generally seven years -- it is more convenient to have an electronic system in place,"" he said.But as someone who has been audited by the I.R.S. before (and yes, they asked to see my mileage log), I wondered which system the government preferred. The answer, from William H. Rosenberg, a lawyer and tax accountant from Los Angeles who is also a former I.R.S. auditor, put the issue of recordkeeping into some perspective. Mr. Rosenberg suggested that the latest technology, while promising, will go only so far.""The I.R.S. is still stuck in the good old days, looking for pen-and-ink logs,"" he said. ""Will they accept a computer-generated log? They will, but they have less credibility. I mean, anybody can go back and create a word-processing document. Even a G.P.S. record that shows where you were -- how can they tell it was a business trip or a personal trip?""'"

"'06-03-07,'1','PARIS, March 6 - The fall ready-to-wear season ended with spectacular symmetry: a Marc Jacobs collection for Louis Vuitton that reprised the urban waif layers of his show in New York a month ago. And the best of what fell between these bookends, from more than 100 shows, told a similar story. It was about a strong silhouette.Of all the messages given by the collections -- mystery, sobriety, Gothic romance -- this was the one that mattered. Because whether you go in the direction of Balenciaga, Narciso Rodriguez or Miu Miu, which on Sunday also had exploding volumes, or go instead in the direction of Rochas, Jil Sander or Junya Watanabe, who made his girls look like Japanese noodles, you will be choosing an unambiguous line.The Vuitton show was chaotic and exhausting, and at some point, after the waffle knits, the capsizing fur hats, the tent-size hoods, the wide, hot-pink velvet jeans, the leopard-bottom bags and the sable mittens, I wrote down, ""Overload."" The circuits had finally blown. Mr. Jacobs had pushed everything too hard. The heaviness of the clothes was souring. I felt the adrenaline stored from a week of Paris shows suddenly rush out. I wanted to go home right then and there.The next day, though, I saw in the pictures of the clothes what I hadn't seen on the runway: an excess of energy and passion that was beguiling. A fashion kid had made these clothes, and probably a fashion kid had inspired them. True, they lacked the grace of Mr. Jacobs's own collection, and there was a makeshift academic quality about the effort, as though a Yohji Yamamoto had been cribbed from a Martin Margiela.But under the lid of the models' basin-size hats, in its shadow, there was a silhouette: it was real, both extreme and clear. The look was expressed best in a long hooded tweed coat with wide trousers and a silk print shirt, the oversize waffle knits and a sleeveless khaki military coat with a fur hem.'"
"'06-03-07,'1','Iran would have to agree to a moratorium on production of enriched uranium on an industrial scale for between seven to nine years, ratify additional measures that let the nuclear agency conduct intrusive inspections of its nuclear facilities and create a joint venture with Russia on the production of enriched uranium on Russian soil, the officials said. The proposal, which has not been made public, spurred Dr. ElBaradei to give an upbeat assessment about a possible swift resolution of the impasse over Iran's program, an official familiar with his thinking said.In a tonal shift, Dr. ElBaradei said Iran had made concessions on some issues. Calling Iran's activities at its uranium enrichment plant at Natanz ""the sticking point,"" he added, ""That issue is still being discussed this week, and I still hope that in the next week or so that agreement could still be reached.""In an interview on Monday evening, R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, said the administration would reject any proposal that did not require the Iranians to stop domestic nuclear enrichment and reprocessing activities. ""The United States will not support any halfway measures,"" he said. ""That means full suspension of all nuclear activities, and a return to negotiations on that basis.""Ms. Rice told Dr. ElBaradei that Washington wanted to see Iran's case before the Security Council as soon as this week's agency board meeting was over; that the United States would seek a presidential statement, which does not carry the weight of a resolution, noting Iran's past failures to comply with its international commitments; and that Iran's case would then be sent back to the nuclear agency for further review, according to an official with knowledge of the conversation.The Russian proposal is a reversal of its previous stance and seemed motivated by its determination to protect Iran from judgment by the Security Council.Russia -- and even China -- had joined the United States and the Europeans in demanding that Iran resume a freeze of uranium enrichment activities at Natanz, reflecting mounting global suspicion that Iran's nuclear program is intended to produce weapons.The Russian proposal surfaced late last week, when Sergei Kisliak, Russia's chief nuclear negotiator, presented it to officials of Britain, France and Germany.He said Iran would have to resume full suspension of all enrichment-related activities, including what it calls its small-scale ""research and development"" while the agreement on the package was negotiated. Once there was an agreement, however, Iran would be allowed to conduct limited uranium enrichment research activities under a pilot program as agreed with the I.A.E.A.As soon as Iran and the agency agreed on the small-scale enrichment, Iran's Parliament would ratify the ""Additional Protocol"" to Iran's nuclear agreement. That protocol gives the nuclear agency's inspectors the right to ask for exceptional access to Iran's nuclear facilities. When one of the Europeans asked Mr. Kisliak for his definition of a pilot program, he said there was no real definition, one official said.A moratorium on industrial-scale enrichment and reprocessing activities would last two to three years while the nuclear agency carried out an investigation of Iran's past nuclear activities and five to six years more until trust with Iran could be rebuilt.Mr. Kisliak conceded that a major risk of such a package was that Iran would inch closer to mastering the technology for a small cascade of centrifuges that turn uranium gas into enriched uranium that can be used to produce electricity or to make bombs. He added that it would shorten the period needed for Iran to ""manufacture a weapon"" by a number of months, one official familiar with the briefing said.Iran has always contended its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, although Russia, like the United States and the Europeans, is convinced it intends to make nuclear weapons.Mr. Kisliak speculated that Iran was unlikely to accept the proposal, in part because of the long-term constraints on its industrial-scale enrichment program. The proposal threatened to derail a carefully formulated, but fragile strategy to send Iran's case to the Security Council. Last month's resolution by the nuclear agency board demanded that no action be taken in the Council until after the current board meeting, a way to give Iran one last chance to comply with agency demands.Even though there is no specific timetable to seek economic sanctions on Iran, both Russia and China are opposed to sanctions. There is no need for another resolution to be passed by the agency board this time for the Security Council to act. Certainly, Dr. ElBaradei is looking for a negotiated solution to the Iran impasse even if it means giving Iran a significant concession on making nuclear fuel.In a conversation with the German and French foreign ministers, a senior British Foreign Office envoy and the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, in Vienna last Friday, Dr. ElBaradei expressed the view that Iran needed to continue some uranium enrichment work as a face-saving measure, a European official said. The Europeans, who met earlier with Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, replied that it was not a question of saving face but of maintaining both the credibility of the nuclear agency and a firm position toward Iran.The crucial issue for Iran is mastering the fuel cycle by enriching uranium. Indeed, in Tehran on Sunday, Mr. Larijani reiterated Iran's position that it would not freeze small-scale production of nuclear fuel even if its case came before the Security Council.'"
"'06-03-07,'1','The Club at La MaMa E.T.C. is an intimate little incubator of a space. It's a good place to ""hatch,"" as Wallie Wolfgruber & Friends did this weekend.Several of the brief dances seemed more like choreographic beginnings than fully fledged works, including 1996's ""Hatch."" Ms. Wolfgruber, a former Lar Lubovitch dancer, stood, knees pressed together and feet splayed, uncurling her torso in wonderfully delicate undulations to a Schubert piano sonata, performed live by Colin Huggins -- not a bad way to enter this world.""Presto ma non Troppo,"" a premiere made for Lawrence Goldhuber's 45th birthday, was more playful. As a spotlight searched the tiny room, a defiant Mr. Goldhuber lunged from his seat and plunged onto the stage. There were titters as Mr. Goldhuber, not a small man, balanced on one leg, scanning the audience with deadpan eyes. But the stakes of this mysterious game, which sent the commanding dancer twirling and hopping along diagonals, or arching his spine to confront the ceiling, seemed high.They went higher in ""American Blessings,"" a 2004 work revised for Ms. Wolfgruber and Janet Forward and danced to Bach's Goldberg Variations, also performed by Mr. Huggins. Fairly conventional, restless partnering was interrupted by a stark tableau: Ms. Wolfgruber, stripped naked and balanced, cowering, atop the curled Ms. Forward. Arms shielding her breasts and crotch, her sheer black shift pulled over her face, she became an instant symbol of American shame.Just as quickly it was gone. She redressed and the dance continued, Ms. Forward's luscious curves juxtaposed against Ms. Wolfgruber's severe but handsome planes. But the image of Abu Ghraib remained, a specter that wouldn't be put to rest.The evening also included ""A Hands-On Affair,"" a 2003 video duet for Ms. Wolfgruber's and Alvin Booth's hands, strutting about on two fingers and doing rather unprintable things to each other. It suggested those nature shows dedicated to the mating rituals of unidentifiable insect species. Luckily, there were no children in the room.'"

"'06-03-07,'1','There are any number of object lessons in the downfall of former Representative Randy Cunningham, the greedy politician, dubbed Duke, who took millions of dollars in bribes in return for doling out scores of millions in sweetheart defense contracts. Mr. Cunningham, a Republican, was sentenced to eight years in prison. His ill-gained riches included a Rolls-Royce, a yacht and a Louis-Philippe commode. For all that, far more stunning dimensions of influence peddling in Washington came to light recently when Mitchell Wade, the contractor who bribed Mr. Cunningham, also confessed to providing jobs to the son of a Pentagon official charged with oversight of his business and, later, to that official.Mr. Wade, seeking more than one friend in Congress, also admitted he had made illegal campaign donations to two lawmakers while pressing them to earmark more defense appropriations to keep his company growing. Earmarks are one of the scandalous goodies in Congress's quid pro quo culture -- the secretive doling out, beyond public notice, of millions in favors in the rushed passage of budget bills.One of the solicited representatives, Virgil Goode Jr., a Virginia Republican, received $46,000 in illegal donations while successfully earmarking $9 million in taxpayer money as Mr. Wade talked of more jobs for the lawmaker's district. The other, Katherine Harris, the Florida Republican, received $32,000 of Wade money, illegally disguised as smaller contributions from Wade employees. A $10 million earmark for the Wade company was requested but not delivered by Ms. Harris.Justice officials say there is no evidence of criminal violations by the two lawmakers. Once the scandal broke, they forwarded the illegal donations to charity. Proclaiming her innocence, Ms. Harris insists that she was duped in the ""perils of a process in which candidates are sometimes asked to determine the intent of a contributor."" Mr. Wade's intent, however, was hardly murky because the investigation established that he had taken Ms. Harris to dinner and that the two had discussed the possibility of further political contributions, of earmarked government money for Mr. Wade's company and of a company branch in her district.So goes licit political business these days in Washington. The prosecutor, Kenneth Wainstein, noted that Mr. Wade's company had been perceived as a classic ""American success story"" -- garnering $150 million in government contracts in just three years -- but was actually a model for spreading political corruption from Capitol Hill to the Pentagon.'"

"'06-03-08,'1','On Monday, European officials described a Russian proposal in which Iran would agree to a moratorium on production of enriched uranium on an industrial scale but would eventually be allowed to pursue what it calls its small-scale ""research and development."" On Tuesday, Russian officials denied that the proposal had ever circulated. But officials think the idea is certain to resurface.The proposal as described appears to refer to Iran's work at Natanz, where it is building a prototype plant that would hold 1,000 centrifuges and an industrial-scale one that would hold 50,000 machines. Centrifuges are tall, thin devices whose rotors spin extraordinarily fast to enrich a toxic gas in uranium's rare component, uranium 235, which can then be used to fuel nuclear reactors or atom bombs.The nuclear scientists and analysts said the research plant of 1,000 centrifuges would pose no immediate threat of weapon making if it were enriching natural uranium. To enrich enough natural uranium for a single nuclear warhead, they said, the plant's 1,000 centrifuges would have to operate around the clock for two or three years.But the calculus would change significantly, they said, if Iran acquired uranium that had already undergone some minimal enrichment and fed that into the prototype plant.On the face of it, that sounds like an exaggeration. After all, nuclear reactors operate on fuel containing only about 4 percent uranium 235, whereas nuclear weapons require levels of 90 percent or higher. Thus, Iran's diverting fuel for a nuclear reactor into the research plant would seem to give it hardly any advantage in making nuclear arms.Not so, the analysts said. They explained that enrichment worked under laws that are highly complex and nonlinear. Thus, it takes more energy to enrich natural uranium to a level of 4 percent than it does to go from 4 percent to 90 percent.For Iran's research plant, that kind of nonlinearity could translate into a great reduction in the time needed to produce a bomb. The International Institute for Strategic Studies, a respected arms analysis group in London, has calculated that the 1,000 centrifuges, if spinning low-enriched uranium, could make fuel for a bomb not in years but in as little as 108 days.David Albright and Corey Hinderstein of the Institute for Science and International Security, a private research group in Washington, have found that as few as 500 Iranian centrifuges spinning low-enriched uranium could produce weapons-grade fuel for a bomb in just six months.Could Iran, if it had international approval to go ahead and do centrifuge research, also gain access to a supply of low-enriched uranium, clandestinely or otherwise?The analysts said that was quite possible. Iran already has a number of research reactors running on low-enriched uranium and, with the Russians, is building a very large nuclear power plant at Bushehr that will use more than a hundred tons of it, though that will be under international safeguards. Tehran also has a long history of buying atomic materials on the global black market.""It's reasonable to be concerned about this issue,"" said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a research organization in Washington. ""Once a country is operating 1,000 centrifuges, you have to worry about the possibility that they could quickly make a bomb.""'"

""Most of us have raised our children here and have our businesses here,"" she said. Some of the criticism of the emirates has been like ""slapping your best friend in the face,"" she added.Jeffrey Adams, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin, said, ""Lockheed Martin defense equipment sold to the U.A.E. is an instrument of U.S. foreign policy and as such is vetted at the highest levels of the administration and Congress.""Exports from the United States to the United Arab Emirates grew rapidly last year, more than doubling to $8.48 billion, according to the United States Census Bureau. Some of America's largest companies, including Boeing, General Electric and several large banks, have forged strong ties to the emirates.Dubai is also a big buyer of goods from United States military and aircraft manufacturers. The Emirates Group airline, for example, is Boeing's largest 777 customer, and placed an order last year for 42 jets, worth $9.7 billion. The airline is also considering whether to buy Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner or the Airbus A350, with a decision expected this spring.""The emirates are a very important customer to Boeing,"" said Cai von Rumohr, an aerospace analyst with SG Cowen & Company. ""They buy a lot of planes. They've also got a big pending sale coming up, and I'm sure that Boeing is doing everything it can right now.""Dubai is ""a customer you do not want to alienate,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group, an aviation and military information company located in Fairfax, Va. ""There is a good chance that there will be Dubai-bashing and xenophobia in Congress. That could help poison commercial relations, and I would hope that calmer heads will prevail.""On March 13, representatives from the United States and the United Arab Emirates will meet for trade talks that are expected to center on the creation of a free trade agreement. The United States opposition to the ports deal ""will influence the ongoing discussions between the U.A.E. and the U.S. negatively,"" the central bank governor of the emirates, Sultan bin Nasser al-Suwaidi, said in a recent interview, according to Bloomberg News.The dispute over the ports deal has done nothing to curb the ability of some American companies to do business with Dubai. On March 5, for example, Morgan Stanley received a license to operate in Dubai's financial center. Georges Makhoul, Morgan Stanley's regional head for the Middle East and North Africa, called the license a ""true demonstration of our commitment to the growth and development of this region.""'"
"'06-03-08,'1','The Special Operations command reports to Mr. Rumsfeld, and falls outside the orbit controlled by John D. Negroponte, the newly established director of national intelligence, who oversees all the nation's intelligence agencies. An episode that took place early in the effort underscored the danger and sensitivity of the work, even for soldiers trained for secret combat missions.In Paraguay a year and a half ago, members of one of the first of these ""Military Liaison Elements"" to be deployed were pulled out of the country after killing a robber armed with a pistol and a club who attacked them as they stepped out of a taxi, officials said. Though the shooting had nothing to do with their mission, the episode embarrassed senior embassy officials, who had not been told the team was operating in the country.One official who was briefed on the events, but was not authorized to discuss them, said the soldiers were not operating out of the embassy, but out of a hotel.Now, officials at the Special Operations Command say, no teams may arrive without the approval of the local ambassador, and the soldiers are based in embassies and are trained to avoid high-profile missteps.Under guidelines established by Mr. Negroponte, the C.I.A. station chief assigned to most American embassies coordinates American intelligence in those countries.Most embassies also include defense attachés, military personnel who work with foreign armed forces and report to the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency. But the new special operations personnel have a more direct military role: to satisfy the military's new counterterrorism responsibilities, officials said.Special Operations forces include the Army Green Berets and Rangers, the Navy Seals, the Marines and special Air Force crews that carry out the most specialized or secret military missions. Their skills range from quick strikes to long-range reconnaissance in hostile territory, military training and medical care.The creation of the Military Liaison Elements, and the broader tug-of-war over the Special Operations Command's new role, appear to have exacerbated the disorganization, even distrust, that critics in Congress and the academic world have said permeates the government's counterterrorism efforts.Officials involved in the debate say the situation may require President Bush and his senior national security and defense advisers to step in as referees, setting boundaries and clarifying the orders of the military and other intelligence agencies.Many current and former C.I.A. officials view the plans by the Special Operations Command, or Socom, as overreaching.""The Department of Defense is very eager to step up its involvement in counterterrorism activities, and it has set its sights on traditional C.I.A. operational responsibilities and authorities,"" said John O. Brennan, a 25-year C.I.A. officer who headed the National Counterterrorism Center before retiring last year. ""Quite unfortunately, the C.I.A.'s important lead role in many of these areas is being steadily eroded, and the current militarization of many of the nation's intelligence functions and responsibilities will be viewed as a major mistake in the very near future.""Mr. Brennan, now president of the Analysis Corporation, an intelligence contractor in Virginia, said that if Socom operations were closely coordinated with host countries and American ambassadors, ""U.S. interests could be very well served.""But, he added, ""if the planned Socom presence in U.S. embassies abroad is an effort to pave the way for unilateral U.S. military operations or to enable defense elements to engage in covert action activities separate from the C.I.A., U.S. problems abroad will be certain to increase significantly.""Paul Gimigliano, a spokesman for the C.I.A., gave a measured response to the program, but emphasized the importance of the agency's station chief in each country.""There is plenty of work to go around,"" he said, adding: ""One key to success is that intelligence activities in a given country be coordinated, a process in which the chief of station plays a crucial role.""A State Department official said late Tuesday, ""We don't have any issue with D.O.D. concerning this,"" using the initials for Department of Defense. The State Department official said the Military Liaison Element program was set up so that ""authority is preserved"" for the ambassador or the head of the embassy.The Special Operations Command has not publicly disclosed the Military Liaison Element mission, and answered questions about the effort only after it was described by officials in other parts of the government who oppose the program.""M.L.E.'s play a key role in enhancing military, interagency and host nation coordination and planning,"" said Kenneth S. McGraw, a spokesman for the Special Operations Command, based in Tampa, Fla. The special operations personnel work ""with the U.S. ambassador and country team's knowledge to plan and coordinate activities,"" he added.Officials involved with the program said its focus is on intelligence and planning and not on conducting combat missions. One official outside the military, who has been briefed on the work but is not authorized to discuss it publicly, said more than 20 teams have been deployed, and that plans call for the effort to be significantly expanded.In a major shift of the military's center of gravity, the Unified Command Plan signed by President Bush in 2004 says the Special Operations Command now ""leads, plans, synchronizes, and as directed, executes global operations against terrorist networks,"" in addition to its more traditional assignment to train, organize and equip Special Operations forces for missions under regional commanders.Recently, Gen. Bryan D. Brown, the Socom commander, and his staff have produced a counterterrorism strategy that runs more than 600 pages. It is expected to be presented to Mr. Rumsfeld in the next few weeks for final approval.According to civilian and military officials who have read or were briefed on the document, it sets forth specific targets, missions and deadlines for action, both immediate and long-term.One goal of the document is to set the conditions for activity wherever the military may wish to act in the future, to make areas inhospitable to terrorists and to gather the kind of information that the Special Operations Command may need to operate.The problem is difficult in nations where the American military is not based in large numbers, and in particular where the United States is not at war. Thus, the Military Liaison Elements may not be required in notable hot spots, like parts of the Middle East, where the American military is already deployed in large numbers.During recent travels abroad, General Brown has sought to explain the program to C.I.A. and F.B.I. officials based at embassies. Joining him for those talks is a political adviser on full-time assignment from the State Department.Socom also held a conference in Tampa last summer to brief Special Operations commanders from other nations, followed by a session in October for Washington-based personnel from foreign embassies on a range of counterterrorism issues.One former Special Operations team member said the trick to making the program work is to navigate the bureaucratic rivalries within embassies -- and back at the command's headquarters. ""All you have to do is make the ambassador, the station chief and Socom all think you are working just for them,"" he said on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Lee H. Hamilton, who served as vice chairman of the national commission on the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, said that conflict between the C.I.A. and the Defense Department over paramilitary operations has occurred periodically for decades, and that the 9/11 commission had recommended that the Defense Department be given the lead responsibility for such activity.But he said the embassy program raised a different issue. ""If you have two or three D.O.D. guys wandering around a country, it could certainly cause some problems,"" Mr. Hamilton said. ""It raises the question of just who is in charge of intelligence collection.""The cold war presented the military with targets that were easy to find but hard to kill, like a Soviet armored division. The counterterrorism mission presents targets that are hard to find but relatively easy to kill, like a Qaeda leader.General Brown and the Special Operations Command now work according to a concept that has become the newest Pentagon catchphrase: ""find, fix, finish and follow-up"" -- shorthand for locating terrorist leaders, tracking them precisely, capturing or killing them, and then using the information gathered to plan another operation.""The military is great at fixing enemies, and finishing them off, and exploiting any base of operations that we take,"" said one Special Operations commander on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. ""But the 'find' part remains a primitive art. Socom can't kill or capture the bad guys unless the intel people can find them, and this is just not happening.""'"

"'06-03-08,'1','Iran maintains that it has the right to enrich uranium for fuel for nuclear energy, but the United States and the three European nations involved in the negotiations charge that Iran has used its civilian energy program to hide a weapons program. Western experts say even small-scale, experimental enrichment poses a threat.Russia's proposal drew American criticism the moment it came up in Vienna, home of the International Atomic Energy Agency, on Monday. Ms. Rice telephoned Mohamed ElBaradei, the agency's director, who had disclosed that a possible compromise was in the offing, telling him that the United States was opposed to it, various officials said.On Tuesday, the Russian proposal all but disappeared, apparently under American and European pressure. Indeed, Foreign Minister Lavrov said Tuesday, as Ms. Rice nodded in agreement, that no such proposal ever existed.""There is no compromise new Russian proposal,"" he said. The proposal for the joint Iranian-Russian enrichment on Russian soil ""is not a new one,"" he added. ""It was welcomed by all participants of the process, and there is no compromise proposal, and there could not be any compromise proposal.""After Mr. Lavrov's comments, three Western diplomats, asking not to be identified by country because their governments did not want to appear to criticize Russia, said they thought that either Mr. Lavrov was pulling back a trial balloon, or the Russians who had floated the compromise in Vienna did so without authorization.Some said that in their experience, lower-level leaders of the Russian Foreign Ministry were very eager to avoid a confrontation with Iran and to exploit Iran's impasse with the West, while Mr. Lavrov and the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, were more concerned about Iran's nuclear ambitions.Mr. Cheney, speaking to an overflow crowd of nearly 5,000 applauding guests at a meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, used blunt language that seemed to hint of military action or possibly the overthrow of the government in Tehran, though he mentioned neither option explicitly.""For our part, the United States is keeping all options on the table in addressing the irresponsible conduct of the regime,"" he said of Iran. ""And we join other nations in sending that regime a clear message: We will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.""He also said ""America supports as well the democratic aspirations of the people of Iran"" and the removal of what he called its current ""fanatical regime.""Administration officials said Mr. Cheney, one of the strongest advocates of the war to overthrow Saddam Hussein in Iraq, had more recently promoted a drive to bring Iranian scholars and students to America, blanket the country with radio and television broadcasts and support Iranian political dissidents.That $85 million State Department program is being overseen by Elizabeth Cheney, a principal deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, who is also the vice president's daughter.Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday at a Pentagon news conference that Iran had recently been infiltrating paramilitary personnel into Iraq ""to do things that are harmful.""He described the Iranian personnel as members of the Al Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards, which he said conducts terrorist operations. But intelligence officials say evidence of involvement by Iran's paramilitary in the violence in Iraq is not clear.The board of the International Atomic Energy Agency has been meeting in Vienna this week to discuss the issue of Iran. Dr. ElBaradei has, on one hand, assailed Iran for concealing its nuclear activities and said he could not certify that it was not pursuing a weapons program.On the other hand, he has expressed hope for a compromise, fearing that Tehran will walk away entirely from cooperating with the agency.United Nations diplomats say they expect the Council to support a statement by its president calling on Iran to cooperate with the West, rather than passing a formal resolution. Such a statement would not require a vote but would be backed implicitly by all 15 members of the Council.'"
"'06-03-08,'1','""Hollywood Boulevard is a multiheaded beast,"" said John Given, the CIM principal in charge of investment and development. ""There are layers of different uses and user groups on the boulevard and that gives Hollywood Boulevard a 24-7 context.""""We understand that Hollywood is many lifestyles, many cultures and many different demographics,"" he added, ""and that makes it possible for us to acquire buildings in a variety of locations.""The company is trying to respond to the real estate market by noting the changes from block to block within a two-mile stretch of Hollywood Boulevard. That stretch includes familiar tourist attractions like Grauman's Chinese Theater, as well as the bulk of the district's office buildings.National chains like Virgin Records may need a big, splashy location to appeal to both tourists and local residents. Chic new restaurants like Geisha House, and specialty shops like American Apparel, on the other hand, tend to thrive in older low-rise buildings in slightly less-trafficked areas, where they are within walking distance of the growing number of people in their 20's and 30's either living and working in Hollywood, or both.Production companies and other entertainment-related businesses, meanwhile, are trawling the market, often for large-scale office space, but finding little.CIM's approach is ""quite visionary,"" said Helmi Hisserich, the Hollywood regional administrator for the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency, which has jurisdiction over much of Hollywood Boulevard. The firm, she adds, ""really views Hollywood as an entire district.""""They are not tackling it one building at a time, but one big market segment at a time,"" she said.CIM was founded in 1994 by two Israeli-born developers -- Shaul Kuba and Avi Shemesh -- with Richard Ressler, a financial professional and former employee of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment banking firm.The company enjoyed its first big success in Santa Monica, on the Third Street Promenade, a three-block shopping street in a redevelopment area of that oceanfront city, where CIM became the largest single landlord. The Promenade was a mixed-use district, and CIM learned to respond to the market with the type of development that seemed warranted -- housing, shops or office space -- in new and existing buildings.In Hollywood, CIM benefited from good timing and perhaps a bit of luck. Drawing on a fund underwritten by two of the nation's largest public pension funds, the California Public Employees Retirement System and the California State Teachers Retirement System, the company bought its first Hollywood building in 1997, well before the current vogue for the district gathered steam.Formerly shunned by Los Angeles residents, Hollywood Boulevard had a reputation as a mean street where teenage runaways, drug dealers and would-be rock stars wandered in a landscape of tacky souvenir shops. It was easy to dismiss the boulevard as the dark side of the entertainment industry.With an inventory of 10 commercial and residential buildings in Hollywood and an 11th in escrow, CIM is ""the most enthusiastic investor to come into this area in the last 10 years,"" Mr. Tronson said.In February 2004, CIM undertook its largest and perhaps biggest challenge in Hollywood, by buying the 640,000-square-foot Hollywood and Highland complex for $201 million. The developer and seller, Trizec-Hahn of Toronto, took a reported $360 million write-down on the project.The building had opened in 2001 to hostile reviews and lukewarm sales. Many local residents disliked the complex -- a 640-room hotel, retail space, a multiplex cinema and the Kodak Theater, home to the Oscar ceremonies -- that seemed to some an overscaled intrusion of corporate America, with national chain stores dominating the tenant mix.CIM's approach has been to find tenants more in tune with the young consumers Mr. Given identified as one of several pivotal customer groups in Hollywood. Earlier this year, a Virgin Megastore moved into the building. Another new tenant is Lucky Brand Dungarees, while the landlord is in negotiations with Damon Wayans and Keenen Ivory Wayans to open a comedy club in the complex.""You come to Hollywood and hope for something special and they deliver on that,"" Ms. Hisserich said.CIM has also been one of many developers to capitalize on the Hollywood housing craze, converting two former office buildings into 101 rental apartments. Other developers have been building or converting office buildings into condominiums, which are getting up to $800 a square foot.The runaway housing market, in fact, has caused concern among Hollywood watchers, who say Hollywood needs more office space to remain a viable business center. Housing, however, is typically more profitable than office space, and that difference in real estate values threatens to displace office development, Ms. Hisserich said.""There's a lot of pressure from the housing market, and we are somewhat concerned that the big commercial parcels are being snapped up for housing,"" she said.The redevelopment agency, in fact, is prepared to ""fast track"" the normally time-consuming process of obtaining government approvals for any developer who can put together the land for a project. The CIM Group is one of two developers that have agreements with the agency to move forward with office construction. (CIM is in escrow on the property in question and will not comment further.)Currently, Hollywood is viewed as a relative bargain, compared with entertainment hubs like Santa Monica to the west and Burbank to the north.Ms. Hisserich sees a pleasant oddity in Hollywood's apparent ascendancy in the regional office market. ""I am getting calls all the time from entertainment firms looking for space,"" she said.""It's nice to see,"" she added, ""that the entertainment industry has taken notice of Hollywood.""'"

"'06-03-08,'1','LOS ANGELES, March 7 - Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is expected to announce on Wednesday several new agreements to distribute movies made by other producers, according to several people apprised of the announcement.Under the agreements, they said, MGM will distribute movies made by the Weinstein Company, founded by Bob and Harvey Weinstein; Bauer Martinez Entertainment, a producer of little-known fare like ""Modigliani""; and Lakeshore Entertainment, which recently had hits with ""Underworld: Evolution"" and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose.""MGM, owned by a consortium of media companies and private equity investors, is holding a news conference on Wednesday to discuss its plans and is portraying the new relationships as a reinvigoration of MGM. The e-mail invitation sent to the news media featured a roaring lion and the words ""the lion roars again.""But several people informed about the agreements said MGM had no plans to resume making movies of its own besides those it is financing with its partner, the Sony Corporation.Executives from MGM and Weinstein declined to comment.One motive for MGM to distribute others' movies is its agreement to provide movies to the cable network Showtime. MGM has found itself short of movies to fill its time slots and could be subject to penalties if it fails to deliver them. ""Right now there is a giant hole,"" said one of the people, who spoke on condition that he not be named because the agreements had not been announced.'"

"'06-03-08,'1','The company said the new chip for server computers, called Woodcrest, would offer an 80 percent performance improvement and require 35 percent less power; the Conroe chip for desktop computers, which will be released later this year, will offer 40 percent performance improvement and require 40 percent less power. The foundation for the chips is derived from the company's popular Pentium M chip for notebook computers, the company said.Mr. Otellini would not discuss specific business issues because the company is in a quiet period imposed by the S.E.C. before its quarterly earnings report on April 19.But he said, ""these things come in waves,"" in addressing Intel's ability to win market share. ""We've tended to do best when we've had a new microarchitecture,"" he said, pointing to the shift from the 486 chip to the Pentium, and from the Pentium III to the Pentium 4.Intel lost its largest market share in the server computer segment, when A.M.D. began offering a dual-core server processor last year called the Opteron, which essentially places two microprocessors on one piece of silicon.A.M.D. announced on Monday three new server processors in the Opteron line. The new chips, it says, offer 4 to 15 percent faster performance than current Opteron chips without consuming more power.Henri Richard, executive vice president of worldwide sales and marketing at A.M.D., said Intel's problems were its own doing. ""The competition has been failing time and time again,"" he said. ""It was their poor execution and poor product road map that opened up a great opportunity for us.""Mr. Otellini said Intel led in 65-nanometer manufacturing, which allows it to producer faster chips more quickly. The company will have four such manufacturing operations up by the end of the year. A.M.D. has said it plans to begin 65-nanometer manufacturing in the second half of 2006.To help spur demand, Intel executives said Tuesday that the company was working with computer manufacturers to create new functions. Among those being demonstrated this week is a small tablet computer using Intel chips, and based on Microsoft's Origami design for low-priced mobile computers.Shares of Intel declined 24 cents, to $20.06 on Tuesday, while A.M.D. fell $1.12, to $38.27.'"

"'06-03-08,'1','Many Iraqis have lost confidence in Mr. Jaafari, accusing him of having failed to quell the Sunni-led insurgency or improve services, like electricity, since he assumed Iraq's most powerful position almost a year ago.For his part, Mr. Talabani became furious over Mr. Jaafari's visit to Turkey last week. The Kurds have long been wary of Turkish threats of invasion from the north, and often accuse the Turks of trying to undermine Kurdish political goals.American officials fear that a bitter, protracted battle over the formation of the new government will strengthen the insurgency and heighten sectarian strife. The American ambassador has said the bombing of a revered Shiite shrine on Feb. 22 and the sectarian killings that followed pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war.The political maneuvering took place as violence claimed the lives of at least seven people in Baghdad and the north, and as three Western hostages taken last November in Baghdad appeared on a new videotape shown by Al Jazeera.The hostage videotape was dated Feb. 28 and showed three men: James Loney, 41, and Harmeet Singh Sooden, 32, of Canada; and Norman Kember, 74, of Britain. The three work for Christian Peacemakers Teams. An American abducted with them, Tom Fox, did not appear on the tape.The men were shown talking, but the video was silent. Before this, the hostages were last seen on a video, along with Mr. Fox, released Jan. 28. The Swords of Righteousness Brigade has said it was holding them.The Defense Ministry said Tuesday that it was investigating the ambush that resulted in the death of Maj. Gen. Mobdir Hatim al-Dulaimi, the commander of Iraqi Army forces in Baghdad. General Dulaimi was the highest-ranking Iraqi military officer to be killed since the Americans first invaded.Meanwhile, Britain's top army officer in Baghdad raised the possibility that Britain could withdraw most of its 8,000 troops from Iraq before the end of the summer of 2008.""A military transition over two years has a reasonable chance of avoiding the pitfalls of overstaying our welcome but gives us the best opportunity of consolidating the Iraqi security forces,"" The Daily Telegraph on Tuesday quoted the officer, Lieut. Gen. Nick Houghton, as saying.Britain has always said the withdrawal of its troops is contingent on a smooth handover of power to Iraqi forces in the four provinces under British command. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that ""no decisions have been made"" about force levels.Also on Tuesday, a car bomb exploded near an American convoy in western Baghdad, killing at least one civilian and wounding a woman. Additionally, police officials in the northern oil city of Kirkuk said insurgents had ambushed a police patrol and killed one officer and seriously wounded another. The police also said Iraqi and American forces had found two mutilated bodies north of the city.Four Iraqi officers were killed Tuesday in two separate assaults on police patrols in Baquba and Bayji, towns north of Baghdad, The Associated Press reported.In the capital, gunmen killed an employee of Baghdad International Airport as he was driving through the city. A gun battle erupted between guerrillas and policemen near a Shiite mosque in the Sunni-dominated neighborhood of Ghazaliya, leaving one insurgent dead and five policemen wounded, an Interior Ministry official said. A mosque guard was also wounded.In Baghdad, the family and co-workers of General Dulaimi attended his funeral. The general had headed the Sixth Iraqi Army Division and had worked closely with American commanders. A Sunni Arab, he was friendly with Sunni politicians; last Thursday, he visited the office of Adnan Dulaimi, a prominent Sunni leader and fellow tribesman, right after Mr. Dulaimi's convoy was ambushed and one of his guards killed.Brig. Gen. Jalil Khalaf Shwayel, commander of the First Brigade of the Sixth Division, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that he believed General Dulaimi had been killed in an ambush, rather than by a sniper, as first reported.On Monday, the general's convoy came under a barrage of gunfire on a highway in western Baghdad. Four bullets slammed into General Dulaimi's car, and one of them pierced the armor and hit the general in the head, General Shwayel said.General Dulaimi's son, in his early teens, was sitting in the seat next to him. The general often traveled with his son, who carried a pistol clipped to his jeans. ""We lost a very good man,"" General Shwayel said, his voice somber.'"
"'06-03-08,'1','But as dashed-off as Blaue Gans may be, it perfectly suits a certain casual mood and a certain basic appetite, proving that a restaurant needn't be tremendously significant to be significantly appealing.It's for impulsive diners who haven't taken the time to make reservations, which it doesn't accept. For impatient diners who don't want to pore over dozens of relentlessly inventive options, which it doesn't have. For exhausted diners who don't want to study a lengthy, abstruse wine list. Blaue Gans doesn't have that, either.It has a modest regiment of rieslings and a small posse of grüner veltliners. It has boiled beef shoulder with applesauce and, atop the applesauce, freshly grated horseradish. It has a smoked pork sausage with sauerkraut, mustard and horseradish. It has a pork and beef sausage with the same sidekicks.Blaue Gans lets sexier restaurants canoodle with day-boat lobster and diver scallops. It flirts with trout, which appears twice on the menu. For an excellent appetizer, the fish is smoked and packed into a dense cake, the other layers of which include crème fraîche, red onion, apple and -- get ready for this -- horseradish.For a satisfying entree, a whole brook trout is sautéed, festooned with capers, fringed with carrots and bathed in creamed kohlrabi, a turniplike root vegetable. Mr. Gutenbrunner appears to be something of a trout savant: when I ate at Thor, one of the best entrees was brook trout, presented with creamed spinach and caper berries.The similarity between that dish and the trout entree at Blaue Gans suggests the extent to which Mr. Gutenbrunner is cribbing from himself at his latest restaurant, referencing some of his best bits from previous ventures -- Thor, Wallsé in Greenwich Village and Café Sabarsky on the Upper East Side -- and simplifying or rearranging them. You can almost think of Blaue Gans as a culinary version of Barneys Co-op, its merchandise marked down (though not all that much, and arguably not enough) and its niceties scaled back.Service isn't entirely reliable. When a friend and I went for brunch one weekend, our waiter repeatedly forgot to bring us things we'd asked for: a napkin, her second mimosa, her third mimosa (she'd had a rough week). We couldn't always remind him because we couldn't always find him.Dinners proceeded much more smoothly, perhaps because the gracious young Austrian man who works as a combined sommelier, host and floor manager was there. He also lent the restaurant an aura of authenticity with his pronounced accent and Alpine musings.When I arrived one night, he was raptly watching the winter Olympics on a TV above the bar, discussing the beauty of the mountains and reminiscing about his home country. If ever I felt a hunger for schnitzels and strudels, along with a thirst for raindrops on roses, it was then and there.Of the restaurant's many presentations of sausage, two were especially good. A pale pork and veal sausage, served with sweet mustard and a soft, salty pretzel, had the lightness of mousse. A mash of blood sausage and fingerling potatoes was molded into a circle and placed on a roomy bed of sauerkraut.On the schnitzel front, a respectable pork Wiener schnitzel wore a crisp coat of egg, flour and breadcrumbs and came with a terrific potato salad, which was light on vinegar and heavy on fresh dill, an herb that doesn't get its due these days.But a pork jäger schnitzel was better. The meat had been dusted with flour and cooked with veal stock, cream, button mushrooms and bacon. It came with spaetzle, which the sommelier recommended we drag through the tawny sauce. What a wise, sweet man.The food at Blaue Gans isn't exactly dainty, and when it veers in that direction, it winds up in an unremarkable place. Simple fillets of cod and Arctic char seemed less like fully formed dishes than like menu stretchers and sops to lighter eaters.The restaurant does better with robust fare like venison, a recurring special, and pork belly, a menu fixture. It does wonderfully with desserts, one of the best of which is something called a kaiserschmarren, a spongy pancake sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with an apple compote.In another standout dessert, a compote of huckleberries and lingonberries hides beneath a generous cover of meringue, the undulating shape of which is meant, I learned later, to resemble three peaks surrounding Salzburg.The sommelier glanced longingly at it. Was he reconnecting with his native land? Or just looking forward to a reliably satisfying meal at the end of his shift?ATMOSPHERE -- With tiny tweaks, the former Le Zinc space became an Austro-German bistro, still defined by vintage posters and tall red banquettes. SOUND LEVEL -- Loud when crowded. RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Blood sausage; smoked trout; pork and veal sausage; boiled beef shoulder; pork belly; trout; schnitzel with mushrooms; berry compote with meringue; dessert pancake. WINE LIST -- Extremely concise and primarily Austrian and German. PRICE RANGE -- Breakfast and brunch selections, $5 to $19. Three-course lunch prix fixe, $20.

"'06-03-09,'0','DETROIT, March 8 - The Nissan Motor Company said Wednesday that its top North American sales executive was retiring, the highest-level employee to leave as the company prepares to move its American headquarters from Southern California to Tennessee.At the same time, two of the closest associates of Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, were promoted to top positions in its North American operations. It was a sign that Mr. Ghosn, who took responsibility for Nissan's North American operations in 2005, wants his lieutenants in charge.The announcements come as Nissan, which has become one of the biggest threats to American automakers, has recently had trouble maintaining momentum from its record sales of the last two years. And it is still overshadowed by its two biggest Japanese rivals, Toyota and Honda.When Nissan announced late last year that it would move to Franklin, Tenn., just outside Nashville, to save money, the news prompted concerns of a brain drain at the company. Twelve senior Nissan executives have already said that they will not make the move. They were joined on Wednesday by Jed Connelly, 60, Nissan's senior vice president for sales and marketing.Of the employees who have already told the company whether or not they will move, about half have said yes, Mr. Connelly said. The 1,300 people at Nissan's headquarters in Gardena, Calif., have until mid-April to make a final decision.'"
"'06-03-09,'0','Some analysts say that rather than pay tens of billions of dollars to Vodafone, Verizon should use its money to build the technology needed to connect its landline and broadband businesses with its wireless business. They argue that integrating all the services will be particularly important in selling to the lucrative corporate market. After all, this was a big reason AT&T wants BellSouth and full control of Cingular, which is jointly owned by AT&T and BellSouth.""Verizon has to work tighter with Verizon Wireless,"" said Lisa Pierce, an analyst at Forrester Research who tracks telecommunications services at companies. ""As a corporate customer, I really don't want to have to think about where and when I get my phone and data services.""While Verizon is expected to focus attention on corporate offerings, gaining full control of Verizon Wireless would do little to improve Verizon's offerings to residential customers.As it is, Verizon has management control of Verizon Wireless, which is already growing faster than its rivals. In the fourth quarter, the company added two million customers and its subscribers are the most loyal in the industry.There are other potential deals, though. Some investors have been betting that Verizon will buy Qwest, the smallest of the Bell companies. But that seems unlikely, because Qwest has a heavy debt load and no wireless spectrum, and operates in 14 Western states where there are fewer big business customers.There is also speculation that Verizon might pursue a national cable company like Comcast to get into the television business faster. But that could prove very expensive and might also run afoul of regulators who have let the Bell companies get bigger on the assumption that there is enough competition from cable companies.Then there is Alltel, the fifth-largest cellular carrier with 10.7 million subscribers. Verizon has long-standing roaming agreements with Alltel, and their networks use the same C.D.M.A. technology. Many of Alltel's subscribers are in rural areas and smaller cities, which complements the largely urban customers that Verizon Wireless serves.Alltel is also planning to spin off its slower-growing landline division this year, making the remainder of the company a more likely takeover target.But Alltel's shares have risen 15.5 percent in the past year on speculation that Verizon or another suitor will buy the company. Alltel's shares dipped 82 cents yesterday to close at $65.74. Verizon's shares dropped 7 cents, to $33.44.Of course, Verizon has the assets to buy Vodafone. Verizon plans to sell its Yellow Pages directories business, which could bring in at least $15 billion, or it could spin off that business into a separate entity.Verizon could also swap its 23 percent stake in Vodafone Omnitel in Italy with Vodafone, which would drive down the purchase price of the Verizon Wireless stake.Verizon also knows that Vodafone faces its own constraints. Shareholders at Vodafone have pushed for a sale of the Verizon Wireless stake as well as its cellphone company in Japan. (After April 2005, Verizon was no longer obligated under the Verizon Wireless agreement to pay Vodafone a semiannual dividend worth about $500 million.)Even with these options, the price tag for the Vodafone stake remains high, and investors are paying more attention to whether any acquisition solves the company's longer-term business problems.""With any of these mergers, it's important not to get caught up with getting big for bigger's sake,"" said Robin Diedrich, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ""Investors are scrutinizing the price that's being paid.""'"
"'06-03-09,'0','In one, the inspector general has begun looking into the F.B.I.'s use of administrative subpoenas, known as national security letters, to demand records and documents without warrants in terror investigations. Some critics maintain that the bureau has abused its subpoena powers to demand records in thousands of cases.In the other, the Office of Professional Responsibility, a Justice Department unit that reviews ethics charges against department lawyers, has opened inquiries related to the detention of 21 people held as material witnesses in terror investigations.As with the F.B.I.'s use of administrative subpoenas, civil rights advocates assert that the Justice Department has abused the material witness statute by holding suspects whom it may not have enough evidence to charge. The new ethics inquiries are reviewing accusations that department officials did not take some material witnesses to court within the required time, failed to tell them the basis for the arrest or held them without any attempt to obtain their testimony as supposed witnesses in terror investigations, the inspector general said Wednesday.Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, characterized the report as ""yet another vindication for those of us who have raised concerns about the administration's policies in the war on terror.""Mr. Conyers said that ""despite the Bush administration's attempt to demonize critics of its antiterrorism policies as advancing phantom or trivial concerns, the report demonstrates that the independent Office of Inspector General has found that many of these policies indeed warrant full investigations.""For its part, the F.B.I. said in a statement that it had been quick to correct errors in intelligence-gathering procedures when they were discovered and that ""there have been no examples by the F.B.I. of willful disregard for the law or of court orders.""The inspector general's review grew out of documents, dealing with intelligence violations, that were released last year under a Freedom of Information Act request by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a private group in Washington. The inspector general then obtained more documents on violations and included an 11-page analysis of the problem as part of a broader report Wednesday on counterterrorism measures.The inspector general reviewed 108 instances in which the F.B.I. reported violations to an oversight board in the 2004 and 2005 fiscal years.""We're always looking to bring the number of violations down,"" John Miller, chief spokesman for the bureau, said in an interview, ""but given the scope and complexity of national security investigations, that's a relatively small number.""The inspector general's review found that reported violations under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which governs some federal wiretaps, accounted for a growing share of the total, having risen to 69 percent last year from 48 percent in 2004.The duration of the violations also grew in some crucial areas, the review found. Two of those areas were the ""overcollection"" of intelligence -- going beyond the scope approved by the court in authorizing a wiretap -- and ""overruns,"" in which a wiretap or other intelligence-gathering method was allowed to continue beyond the approved time period without an extension.The review found that the average amount of time that overcollections and overruns were allowed before they were discovered and corrected rose to 32 days last year from 22 in 2004. In most cases, the F.B.I. was found to be at fault, while about a quarter of the time a ""third party,"" usually a telecommunications company, was to blame, the data showed.In taking issue with some of the findings, F.B.I. officials said the data were skewed by a number of exceptionally long violations; one wiretap lasted 373 days.'"
"'06-03-09,'0','Samsung wouldn't be the first; Archos and Creative offer Nano clones. And featurephiles await a similarly sized SanDisk Sansa player, arriving later this month, that will have FM radio recording, removable battery and memory card, video playback and 6-gigabyte capacity (a first among memory-based players).But Samsung took one additional step: To design the Z5's software, it hired Paul Mercer, a former Apple employee whose software toolkit was used to design the iPod software. The result is the easiest-to-navigate software since the iPod. Here's the familiar main menu (Music, Pictures, Playlists and so on); here's the center Select button; here's the button at the top that backtracks toward the main menu. If you've ever used an iPod, you'll feel instantly at home. (In fact, at first, I caught myself tracing circles on the Z5's face with my thumb, turning a scroll wheel that wasn't there -- a reflex that Samsung acknowledged isn't uncommon among first-time users of the Z5.)INSTEAD of a wheel, the Z5 has a big square button surrounded by a clickable frame. The frame's four edges precisely replicate the clicky edges of the iPod scroll wheel: Menu at the top, Play/Pause at the bottom, Next Track and Previous Track on the sides.Inside the frame is a touch pad. You step through lists by lightly tapping the pad; you hold down to scroll quickly. The best part is that your thumb doesn't have to move between scrolling and clicking; after scrolling by touching, pushing harder to click -- in exactly the same spot -- does the trick.Samsung has even improved on the iPod's design in several important ways. For example, you can adjust the playback volume even when you're not on the Now Playing screen (such as when you're adjusting the settings or perusing your music list), thanks to dedicated volume buttons. The name of the current song appears at the bottom of every screen, too.More thoughtful touches: Whenever you highlight a song or album name, a thumbnail image of the CD cover appears right there in the list -- a handy visual aid. Holding down the Menu button takes you all the way back to the main menu, so you don't have to tap it repeatedly.And you know that iPod moment of befuddlement when the buttons don't seem to be working -- and then you realize it's because you've engaged the Hold switch? On the Z5, pressing any button makes a tiny padlock icon glow on the screen to help clue you in.Finally, the Z5 plays music for a staggering 35 hours between charges, according to Samsung, which is 2.5 times the duration with the iPod. Unfortunately, that beefier battery means that the Z5 is no Nanoesque wafer. At just under half an inch thick, it's two-thirds thicker than the Nano.Like almost all non-iPod music players, the Z5 is based on Microsoft's music-player software. That is, it doesn't work with the Macintosh. And while the Z5 can't play songs from Apple's iTunes Music Store, it can play songs from Rhapsody, Napster, Musicmatch, MSN Music, Wal-Mart, AOL Music Now, Yahoo Music and other members of the ""MMS-MMS"" consortium (Microsoft-based Music Stores with Minuscule Market Share).Many of the MMS-MMS stores offer something that Apple doesn't: subscription plans. For a flat $12 or $15 a month, you can download as many songs as you like. (The wrinkle is that if you ever stop paying, all of your music self-destructs.)It's also worth noting that unlike songs from iTunes, music from MMS-MMS stores also works on gadgets like the Sonos Digital Music System and Roku SoundBridge, which broadcast music from your computer to your stereo wirelessly.Is the Z5, then, the fabled iPod Killer? Let's review the checklist.LOOKS -- Not quite. It's sleek and nice-looking, but thicker than the Nano. The metal case conceals fingerprints, unlike the mirrored chrome of the Nano. But it doesn't look as classy and doesn't feel as nice in your palm.SCROLL WHEEL -- No. The Z5's controls are thoughtfully designed. But the touch scroller is finicky; perhaps to screen out accidental taps, it registers a tap only if your finger sits on the surface longer than a quarter-second but less than half a second (after which fast scrolling begins). You need the reflexes of a frog's tongue.Worse, you can't control the speed of the scrolling; you can't slow down as you approach one part of the alphabet. How could Samsung have missed this one?SYNCHRONIZATION -- Mostly effortless. But in the case of the iPod, Apple designed the music store, the player and the jukebox software on the computer; no wonder it all works so smoothly. When you use the Z5, you get some jarring reminders that three different cooks were at work. For example, during the Z5's on-screen tutorial, the narrator cheerfully tells you that the Z5's U.S.B. cable might not match the one illustrated on the screen. ""But the connector will match a port on your portable music player,"" she says reassuringly. Well, let's hope so.Similarly, Samsung provides a table called ""How Many Songs Will Fit?"" But it lists 128 megabytes, 256 megabytes, 1 gigabyte, 2 gigabytes and 5 gigabytes (and not 4 gigabytes). Doesn't Samsung know that the Z5 comes only in 2 and 4 gigabytes?Evidently, Paul Mercer was not involved with the help system.MUSIC STORE INTEGRATION -- No. At Samsung's suggestion, I tested the Z5 with Rhapsody's store, which is available directly from the copy of Windows Media Player provided by the Z5's installer. After banging my head on the keyboard for an hour, unable to get it to work, a Rhapsody rep finally let me know that, in fact, Rhapsody's subscription store doesn't work in Media Player -- only with Rhapsody's own software jukebox. (So much for the Microsoft ""Plays for Sure"" logo. Try ""Plays for Some People."")ACCESSORIES -- Not so much a universe as a shelf. You can buy generic adapters for the car and your home stereo. There will soon be a carrying case, and Samsung will sell its own speakers. But there's no remote control of any kind, and the overall accessory situation looks pretty grim -- a drawback of any non-iPod player.The Z5, then, will not cause any discernible dip in iPod market share.It does, however, deserve to be a hit for Samsung. For someone who wants a Nano that's not a Nano, it's a close enough match in looks, sleekness, capacity and crystal-clear software design. In fact, if iPod didn't loom over every conversation as the screamingly obvious point of comparison, the Z5 could be the next little thing.Correction: March 13, 2006, Monday The David Pogue column in Business Day on Thursday, about a new portable music player from Samsung, referred imprecisely to the compatibility of another player, the Sonos Digital Music System, with certain music files. While the Sonos product plays many songs downloaded from Windows-based music services, it cannot currently play those that use the digital-rights protection system that Microsoft calls ""PlaysForSure.""'"
"'06-03-09,'0','""There are gay people who grew up in the synagogues and day schools and summer camps of the Conservative movement who feel the movement has turned its back on them,"" said Rabbi Cohen, a member of Keshet Rabbis, a group of more than 200 Conservative rabbis who support full inclusion of gay men and lesbians. ""There are people who want to become rabbis who can't, couples who want the rabbis of their childhood synagogues to marry them, and they won't.""Rabbi Kassel Abelson, chairman of the law committee, said, ""I'm saddened by the fact that there are people who are hurt by it, but I think we have to take seriously our process and follow it.""Some rabbis said in interviews that the committee might be stalling until the appointment of a new chancellor at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, a position that has traditionally set direction for the Conservative movement.Of the four proposals the committee is considering, two essentially oppose any change to the current law, and one advocates a substantial change of the law. One tries to find a middle ground by permitting gay rabbis and same-sex ceremonies, but prohibiting anal sex, an effort to stay consistent with a Bible passage that says, ""Do not lie with a male as one lies with a woman; it is an abomination.""Rabbi Abelson said the proposal that advocates a substantial change in the law was so ""revolutionary"" that the committee voted to put it in a category that will ultimately make it even harder to pass. The committee declared this proposal a ""takanah"" -- a Hebrew word denoting a ""fix"" of existing Jewish law.A takanah can only be approved with a vote of at least 20 of the committee's 25 members -- a new rule, advocated by the Conservative movement's executive committee. Until last year, a simple majority of 13 members could approve a takanah.The change prompted some more liberal rabbis who learned of it to suggest that the process had been rigged in anticipation of the vote on gay men and lesbians. Rabbi Abelson said the law committee had not approved a takanah in the 20 years he had served on it.The other three proposals would require only six votes for passage, raising the possibility that conflicting rulings could be approved simultaneously.Rabbis who are disappointed by the committee's inaction say they plan to take the issue to the convention of the Rabbinical Assembly in Mexico City this month.'"
"'06-03-09,'0','At that time few analysts thought the drug would return to the market as quickly as it apparently will.The meeting ""was a very moving two days,"" Dr. Burt A. Adelman, Biogen's executive vice president for development, said in an interview. He said the vote supported Biogen's view ""that this is an important therapy and, although there are risks, patients should be able to choose.""Trading of both companies' shares were halted Tuesday and most of yesterday. Shares in Elan, which is based in Dublin, jumped $3.11, or 24 percent, to $15.81 late yesterday after trading resumed. Shares of Biogen, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., rose about 8 percent.Still, most analysts say they no longer believe that Tysabri, also called natalizumab, will be a blockbuster.Before the drug was withdrawn, some had projected annual sales would reach $2 billion or more. Now estimates are generally for several hundred million dollars.""I think it's going to be a relatively slow relaunch, mainly because we just heard two full days of discussion as to all the limitations that have to be put in place to even allow the drug to come back,"" said Joel Sendek, a biotechnology analyst at Lazard. He estimates sales of $48 million this year and $216 million in 2009.Three people who took Tysabri in clinical trials, or about one in 1,000, developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or P.M.L., a rare brain disease caused by a virus. Two of the three patients died and the other was severely disabled.The issue confronting the advisory panel, which met in Gaithersburg, Md., was that there is no good way to predict who would get the brain disease, which has no proven treatment.Biogen executives said that if doctors rigorously monitor patients, they might detect P.M.L. early enough to stop giving Tysabri and avoid death or disability. But F.D.A. officials and advisory panel members said it was far from certain that could be done, especially since P.M.L. could easily be mistaken for multiple sclerosis itself.""It is likely there will be cases of P.M.L,"" the committee's chairman, Dr. Karl D. Kieburtz of the University of Rochester, said at the conclusion of the meeting. ""It is likely there will be deaths from it.""Still, the decision to return the drug to the market seemed relatively easy for the panel. More of its time was spent discussing restrictions on use of the drug.The committee said forcefully that Tysabri should not be used along with other multiple sclerosis drugs, even in clinical trials, because it might increase the risk of P.M.L. That means that sales of Tysabri might eat into sales of Biogen's other multiple sclerosis drug, Avonex, rather than being used alongside it.The committee voted 7 to 5 that the drug could be used as an initial therapy, rather than only after one or more other drugs had been tried without success.All patients getting the drug will be entered in a registry. They and their doctors will have to sign forms acknowledging the risk. Biogen had proposed making the registry voluntary but the F.D.A. staff objected.Drugs will be distributed directly to authorized infusion centers. Before each monthly infusion a nurse will go through a checklist with patients to make sure they have no new symptoms that could indicate P.M.L. Some panel members said they thought patients might cover up symptoms to keep getting Tysabri.Some pharmaceutical executives say the agency has become tougher on drug approvals in response to criticism that it has been lax on safety. The Tysabri decision could indicate a move toward more leniency.But Dr. Robert Temple, director of medical policy in the agency's drug division, told reporters the decision was ""consistent with what we've done before"" because ""the disease in question is a devastating disease.""About 400,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, which can cause paralysis, blurred vision and other problems. Experts say tens of thousands of them are not helped by the existing drugs.Tysabri did better in preventing relapses when compared to placebos than the older drugs did when they were compared to placebos in separate clinical trials. That suggests Tysabri is better, though proof of that would require testing it directly against the other drugs.Still, some of the patients and their family members who testified at the meeting swore by the drug.""Without Tysabri, she is at greater risk of ending up in a wheelchair and becoming a cognitive shell of the woman she once was,"" David Miller, who teaches business ethics at Yale Divinity School, said of his wife, Karen, who has multiple sclerosis. ""This is real risk.""'"

"'06-03-09,'0','The wrenching debate in the 1970's over the abuse of presidential power produced two groundbreaking reforms aimed at preventing a president from using war or broader claims of national security to trample Americans' rights.One was the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which struck the proper balance between national security and bedrock civil liberties, and the other was the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, a symbol of bipartisan leadership. They endured for a quarter of a century -- until George W. Bush and Dick Cheney left FISA in tatters and the Senate Select Committee on its deathbed in just five years.The Senate panel has become so paralyzingly partisan that it could not even manage to do its basic job this week and look into President Bush's warrantless spying on Americans' international e-mail and phone calls. Senator Pat Roberts, the chairman, said Tuesday that there would be no investigation. Instead, the committee's Republicans voted to create a subcommittee that is supposed to get reports from the White House on any future warrantless surveillance.It's breathtakingly cynical. Faced with a president who is almost certainly breaking the law, the Senate sets up a panel to watch him do it and calls that control. This new Senate plan is being presented as a way to increase the supervision of intelligence gathering while giving the spies needed flexibility. But it does no such thing.The Republicans' idea of supervision involves saying the White House should get a warrant for spying whenever possible. Currently a warrant is needed, period. And that's the right law. The White House has not offered a scrap of evidence that it interferes with antiterrorist operations. Mr. Bush simply decided the law did not apply to him.'"
"'06-03-09,'0','""When a market is governed by a large industry, small entrepreneurs have to come in at a higher price,"" said Karim Rashid, a prolific designer who has lent his futuristic look to everything from Prada cream tubes to Sony Walkmans. Requests for his services from small-business owners, he says, have soared in the last few years. ""The only thing they can compete with is the experience of the product itself,"" he said.These businesses range from husband-and-wife partnerships like Skip Hop to booming start-ups with contracts at major chain stores.Simplehuman, for example, a kitchen gadget maker founded five years ago in Los Angeles, has $80 million in sales annually through a slick line of dish racks, pedal-operated trash cans and paper towel dispensers available everywhere from Crate & Barrel to Target.""We wanted to take the most mundane thing that nobody cares about and innovate on it,"" its chief executive and founder, Frank Yang, said. ""So we started with the trash can.""Designers say Simplehuman revolutionized the dish rack industry two years ago with its award-winning stainless steel and frosted plastic version. Competitors have since scrambled to update their offerings.Of course, exceptional design has always helped sell merchandise; entrepreneurs like Steven P. Jobs of Apple and Philip H. Knight of Nike have built empires by getting creative with laptops and athletic shoes.Still, until recently, most company executives cared more about how much a product would cost to manufacture or how long it would take to ship, says Michele Caniato, head of Culture & Commerce, a consulting firm that pairs designers with companies. The names of designers rarely came up in board meetings.That has changed in the last five years, says David Martin, North American head of brand consultancy for Interbrand.Small-business owners are starting to catch on, and securing lucrative shelf space in unexpected store aisles. For example, Method, a manufacturer in San Francisco, used updated packaging to break into the competitive world of detergents.""If you look at household cleaners in the market, you'll find that every bottle has the exact same silhouette,"" said its co-founder and co-chief executive, Eric Ryan, describing an industrial shape plastered in garish ad copy reminiscent of the 1950's. ""They're not bottles you'd want to leave out by the kitchen sink.""To set themselves apart from competitors like Procter & Gamble and Clorox, Mr. Ryan and his partner, Adam Lowry, commissioned Mr. Rashid to create minimally labeled curvy clear bottles filled with candy-colored liquids. They made dish soap look more like perfume.Experts credit the kitchen tool maker Oxo, now a thriving subsidiary of Helen of Troy, for introducing modern design to America's supermarket aisles. Oxo started 15 years ago when its founder, Sam Farber, designed vegetable peelers and jar openers that would spare his wife's arthritic hands. At the time, many doubted that shoppers would spend $6, or triple the market rate, for a kitchen tool meant to be replaced every few years.""Oxo represented an entirely different model,"" said Perry Reynolds, head of marketing at the International Housewares Association. ""Consumers said 'I've been buying these things every couple of years for a while, and I finally want to get a good one.' ""Although Mr. Farber focused more on ergonomics, he also raised the aesthetic bar with his distinctively rounded black rubber handles and red trimmings.Since then, other entrepreneurs have followed his example by improving on the look and feel of the most utilitarian tools: Modo, a company in Oregon, makes medical equipment carts with curved lines and red wheels that evoke Italian strollers. Bright green and orange neoprene bottle totes from Built NY won a design award in 2004.These companies are still an exception, but the trend is gaining momentum. Technological advances, for example, are making it easier to realize even the most complicated designs. Outsourcing gives entrepreneurs without factories access to the tools of mass production.And with fewer rules and decision makers to slow them, small businesses can cater to changing tastes more quickly. While Procter & Gamble might spend two years testing a new dispenser, Method had its bottles for sale within six months after hiring Mr. Rashid.Changing tastes are another factor in new design. Shoppers want objects that not only look cool, but that also speak to them.""Design is a communicating device,"" says Kristina Goodrich, executive director of the designers' society. ""It can tell you how to pick up a stapler; it can show you how to not to touch something that's hot.""While these heavily designed versions of everyday items are easy to spot, defining them is another matter. Experts say well-designed products are heavy on ergonomic comfort and light on superfluous, or purely decorative, detail. But there is also a more elusive quality that some refer to as the ""Wow"" effect.For entrepreneurs, that effect comes at a price. Method's founders were able to afford Mr. Rashid -- one of the world's most expensive designers -- by giving him an equity stake and a four-year contract.As a result, most heavily designed products are more expensive.Even Skip Hop's bottle racks, at over $30 each, will cost more than double the price of a more pedestrian design. But Mr. Diamant says the popularity of the diaper bags proves that shoppers are willing to spend a little extra to escape the teddy bear motif. ""People like that one step up in luxury.""'"
"'06-03-09,'0','No one is talking about a wholesale shift away from the now-common practice of selling singles online ahead of new albums.But even before Ne-Yo's big debut, some music executives fretted that they were offering too many songs too early, particularly from pop and R&B acts.So consumers looking for some hot new songs may have trouble finding them before the corresponding albums are released. ""S.O.S.,"" a rising radio hit from the Caribbean-born ingénue Rihanna (a label-mate of Ne-Yo), is not expected to be available for sale online before her forthcoming album. And Shakira fans will not find her new song, ""Hips Don't Lie,"" for sale at any of the major online music services, music executives said. (Shakira's label, Epic Records, did strike a deal to sell the song to customers of Verizon's V-Cast cellphone service. ""Hips"" is to be included on a repackaged edition of Shakira's recent CD.)The restricted sales are evidence that record companies are a re-examining the fledging digital music field, where consumers have become accustomed to easy -- and early -- access to new stars' work. In the early days of paid digital sales, major labels routinely refused to sell singles or albums online until well after the ""physical"" recording went on sale at brick-and-mortar stores.Since at least 2004, however, record companies have been selling songs online at the same time they begin lobbying radio stations to play them -- generating a bit of cash as each song gained popularity. Holding back on new singles now, critics charge, may end up doing more harm than good in the long run, especially if music continues to be available on free, unauthorized online networks.""The labels are shooting themselves in the foot,"" said Tim Quirk, executive editor of the Rhapsody music service. To the labels, Mr. Quirk advises, ""every single track that you are worried about is available for free whether you want it to be or not.""""You need to take advantage of every possible opportunity for people to pay in legitimate ways,"" he said.But in the case of Ne-Yo, whose real name is Shaffer Smith, the first-week sales figures vindicate their strategy, executives say. It is impossible to know how many fans would have bought Ne-Yo's single as it became a radio smash, but the executives reckon that whatever price Island Def Jam paid in lost singles, it more than made up for in extra sales of the album, which costs more.Contrast the Ne-Yo experience with another new R&B star, Chris Brown. He had a similarly inescapable radio hit with the song ""Run It!"" on the eve of his debut album's release late last year. ""Run It!"" was available for sale online for more than three months before his eponymous CD hit stores. During that time, Mr. Brown's song sold more than 300,000 copies. When the album finally went on sale, it sold roughly 154,000 copies in its first week -- about half the sales of the Ne-Yo recording, according to Nielsen SoundScan.Steve Bartels, chief operating officer of Island Def Jam, a unit of the music giant Universal Music Group, said the early availability of hot singles online could hurt albums of consistent quality throughout.""If you know you have something of depth, you have to be careful about how you bring it into the marketplace,"" he said. ""We're in the business of having consumers believe in an artist. If everything is up and gone before you have a chance to listen to the album, what do you have?""Mr. Bartels added, however, that decisions to hold back singles are being made on a case-by-case basis, and could vary widely depending on genre. He noted that the label is already selling a single from the rock band Damone, even though its album is not expected in stores until May.It is also worth noting that, as analysts said, the single has been still heavily traded on free file-swapping networks for weeks. Ne-Yo's ""So Sick"" was downloaded approximately 3.4 million times on the networks during the week of his album release, according to the tracking firm BigChampagne. By comparison, Chris Brown's ""Run It!"" was downloaded approximately 5.3 million times during the week of his album release last year.Elsewhere, however, as consumers shift into a world dominated by singles, custom playlists and iPod song shuffling, there are efforts under way to preserve the old-fangled album. Fans who are still willing to shell out for a full album are rewarded with exclusive bonus items: Universal Records recently offered a downloadable coloring book to fans who bought its ""Curious George"" soundtrack by Jack Johnson. And fans of the made-from-television band INXS who bought its full album received an exclusive bonus track.Industry caution about early sales of singles, however, actually comes as fans are buying individual songs at such a rapid clip that they are -- for the first time -- regularly offsetting the decline in full album sales. So far this year, album sales have declined about 3 percent from a year ago. But if every 10 singles sold so far were bundled together and counted as albums, sales would be up about 2 percent, according to Nielsen SoundScan.Even so, some music executives insist the ""unbundling"" of the album -- letting fans buy individual tracks -- still spells trouble.Tony Brummel, the owner of the independent rock label Victory Records, says he is not interested in selling individual songs from his albums, though he may give them away to build buzz. The label this week captured the No. 3 spot on the chart with the new album from the emo-rock band Hawthorne Heights. The band's CD sold about 114,000 copies -- a solid figure for an independent rock band, but somewhat less than expected given the label's shipments of roughly 800,000 copies. A rock album, Mr. Brummel said, ""is a work of art.""""If you're buying a Picasso,"" he continued, ""you can't just buy the upper right-hand corner.""'"

"'06-03-09,'0','Both deals were criticized from the start by Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., who unsuccessfully sued to block the bigger deal.And in recent weeks, even the mayor himself appeared to distance himself from the Snapple deal, conceding at a news conference on the risks of gestational diabetes on Feb. 21 that the drinks were no healthier than other sweet items, like sodas.""It's better for you, I suppose, than some of the others -- so the argument goes,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""It's supposedly marginally better for you. I'm not a doctor. But the problem is, you have to have things that people will buy.""The decision to revisit the contract was taken yesterday by the city's Franchise and Concession Review Committee, which voted, 5 to 1, to authorize the renegotiation. Mr. Thompson's representative, Valerie Budzik, cast the lone dissenting vote. The mayor controls four of the six votes, with the five borough presidents sharing the remaining vote. The amended deal is to come up for a final vote in April.Before voting no, Ms. Budzik said she was ""not at all surprised"" that the marketing agency wanted to revisit the contract.""It was a deeply flawed, back-room deal from the start,"" she said. ""It was supposed to bring in $90 million in marketing initiatives and $36 million in sales commissions, but it's still an open question as to whether the deal has produced any real revenue for the city.""City officials were candid yesterday about the shortcomings of the original deal, noting a series of problems. Certain buildings or hallways could not accommodate the machines, and in some places low foot traffic did not justify the costs of refilling and maintaining them.""We were a little bit green, maybe, on the vending business and knowing that it takes electrical outlets and it takes certain traffic,"" said Kevin A. Booth, the chief financial officer of the city's Marketing Development Corporation.The Snapple deal was signed in February 2004 and took effect two months later. It gave Snapple the exclusive rights to sell iced tea, bottled water and chocolate drinks through vending machines on city-controlled properties and concessions. The city was supposed to arrange for installation 3,500 machines, and each machine was to sell five and a half cases -- or 132 cans or bottles -- each week. The machines are in places like City Hall and Rikers Island, but only 700 of them have been installed.The deal was the brainchild of the marketing agency, which was created in July 2003 to use the city's image to raise money. Yesterday, officials at the agency defended the deal and the proposed amendments.""The parties have determined that the focal point of the agreement should be on marketing, not on vending,"" said Bryan X. Grimaldi, the general counsel for the marketing agency. ""Despite poor vending sales, Snapple is willing to relax the case-sale goals previously agreed. The practical effect will be a net better deal for the city.""The deal is governed by a complicated formula in which the city and Snapple essentially market each other through advertisements and special events. Not only was Snapple to promote New York City, and vice versa, but the city also was to garner both fees and sales commissions.The original deal was supposed to generate $90 million worth of marketing programs and $36 million in vending commissions; instead, the amendments call for $30.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively.Mr. Grimaldi said that most of the city's marketing efforts were successful over all, noting recent partnerships with the History Channel, the Country Music Association and Universal Pictures. Kelly Devers, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said its arrangement with Snapple was on track to generate the projected revenues.An official of Snapple, which is based in Rye Brook, N.Y., and is part of Cadbury Schweppes, the British beverage and candy maker, was circumspect about the low sales figures.""We believe that the city is better served by a marketing partnership,"" the official, Jack Belsito, the president of Snapple's distribution arm, said in a statement. ""Snapple's hometown is New York City and we're proud of the work we are doing through the partnership and on behalf of New York City schools.""'"
"'06-03-09,'0','TOKYO, March 8 - North Korea was reported to have test-fired two short-range missiles within its borders on Wednesday, even as six-nation talks over its nuclear program remain deadlocked.The missiles were launched in the direction of China, the Japanese news media first reported, citing unidentified defense officials.

""We have consistently pointed out that North Korea's missile program is a concern that poses a threat to the region and the larger international community.""American officials said that North Korea had test-fired similar short-range missiles in recent years but had refrained from testing medium- or long-range missiles since firing one that passed over Japan in 1998.The commander of the American forces in South Korea, Gen.

"'06-03-09,'0','After going back and checking 9,352 active Sea Link cardholders with New Jersey licenses, the federal agency found that nearly half had possible criminal histories.The more serious criminal cases included cardholders who had been charged with the possession of $5 million in stolen pharmaceuticals, or with trying to smuggle cocaine and Iranian carpets into the United States.In 21 cases as of the end of February, Sea Link cardholders were wanted on outstanding warrants, many on drug-related charges.The investigation, the report said, ""highlights serious port security concerns and possible security gaps exposing vulnerabilities that could be capitalized by terrorist organizations.""Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of the Port Authority, said that Sea Link, which was created in the early 1990's, is focused on efficient movement of cargo and trucks. He agreed that the findings of the report were disturbing.""It is exposing what I think is an important vulnerability,"" he said on Wednesday.The weaknesses in the system are not new, as the Coast Guard in 2003 determined that the Sea Link cards ""do not increase security but rather facilitate access to the port using cards that have been stolen, sold or traded among truck drivers,"" the Homeland Security report said, quoting the 2003 findings. Ports nationwide also do not appear to routinely do background checks on truck drivers, the report said.The federal government is already working on a program that would address many of the problems identified by the new report, which was first disclosed this week by ABC News. The government has been testing a new transportation worker card with a tamperproof element, like a fingerprint.But widespread use of the card has been repeatedly delayed, in part because of industry opposition to the background checks that would be required before a transportation worker could get one.Mr. Coscia said that if the federal government took too long, the Port Authority may ask the New York and New Jersey governments to authorize law enforcement officials to do background checks on port workers, including truck drivers.""It absolutely has to get done,"" he said.

"'06-03-10,'1','In his long and productive career, Mr. Wegman has remained as true as any of his legendary 1970's contemporaries to the belief that the artist's job is to make something that doesn't look like art. For most of his career -- longer than that of most artists his age -- Mr. Wegman, 62, has fearlessly tolerated looking silly, inconsequential or sentimental while making his art with whatever, or whoever, happened to be handy, starting with himself.He has favored wordplay and visual puns of all varieties, disruptions of our eye-to-mind coordination and unexpected punch lines. He was inspired by the Surrealists, as the name of his most famous dog suggests, but also by the radio comedians Bob and Ray and those late-night television commercials made in situ by the owners of used-car dealerships and appliance stores.Mr. Wegman has also been guided by an entertainer's instincts: an infallible sense of the comic potential -- and thus the pathos -- of everyday ideas and objects. In this he is aided by a short attention span, a deadpan manner and a deep-seated penchant for frugality that wastes neither time, materials nor gestures. He has assiduously avoided mastery while operating with the economy of a total pro, and there is something intensely comforting in his comportment.Mr. Wegman was born in Holyoke, Mass., in 1943 and grew up drawing. He studied painting at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston and then joined what he called ""the piece movement."" While earning a graduate degree at the University of Illinois and then teaching for three years at the University of Wisconsin, he specialized in temporary installation pieces that required advanced planning, assistance and quantities of nonart materials. Toward the end of his Wisconsin sojourn, he began to yearn to work alone in the privacy of his studio, and realized that video and still photography could be his liberation.Mr. Wegman secured his place in art history when he became the first person to prove that video art could be laugh-out-loud funny. He accomplished this in 1970, the year he moved to Los Angeles. There he became friends with the artists Bruce Nauman, Ed Ruscha and John Baldessari, who were not without wit themselves.Mr. Wegman was no slouch in front of the camera: he sang with his stomach, appeared in nothing but underpants and handbags (in his role as a door-to-door pocketbook salesman) and demonstrated how a stick and a metal chair might be construed as the latest massage equipment. But his best-known video efforts starred May Ray, who quickly became his collaborator, model and muse.The videos in the Brooklyn show include the 62-second ""Milk/Floor"" of 1970-71, a brilliant little ode to Process Art performance. It opens with Mr. Wegman crawling backward on all fours, dribbling a line of milk from his mouth onto the floor. He disappears through a doorway, and seconds later, Man Ray emerges, moving forward (on all fours), efficiently lapping up the milk, until his nose hits the camera with a thud and the screen goes black. This video fulfills the first rule of classic humor: it is funny every time you see it.Man Ray also figured prominently in black-and-white photographs, but the dog's greatest moment arrived two years before his death in 1982, when Mr. Wegman began working with a large color Polaroid camera. Knowing that his dog was aging and ailing, the artist set about making portraits of him in various guises and poses; the critic Sanford Schwartz compared the series to Robert Frank's classic book of photographs, ""The Americans,"" in its emotional fullness and range. On the scale of Hollywood studio portraits, the photographs bring to mind famous images of Garbo, Harpo, Carmen Miranda and others. The show includes an image of Man Ray seen in profile in a diptych, tinted silver and gold like a Warhol starlet. He's seen again being dusted with flour, which conjures up falling snow, a spotlight or perhaps heavenly rays.The show offers many of Mr. Wegman's small, dashed-off captioned drawings from the early 70's. Thurberesque in word and image, these include ""Toddler Holds Couple Hostage"" and ""X Ray of Peach in Dish,"" whose title justifies the continuation of the circle that is the plate through the circle that is the peach. This cryptic, weirdly spectral image personifies the sensibility encoded in the show's title: an artist who renders funny strange by misspelling it.Even the most devoted Wegmaniac may be surprised by the variety and extent of his altered photographs, notable for their wonderfully upfront dumbness. In ""Cat's Cradle,"" the subject appears between the artist's upheld hands not as string, but as a series of cuts in the surface of the photograph; it is all the more strange for seeming -- for about a second -- to cast an elaborate shadow on the wall and floor. ""Attack Dog"" was once, all too obviously, an image of a Weimaraner leaping to catch a Frisbee; the animal is now chomping down on the arm of a quavering de Kooningesque figure.Just as Michelangelo described his carving process as liberating figures from stone, Mr. Wegman releases the jokes trapped in the images he comes across. In the small, thrift-shop-like gouache on collage titled ""Bob and Ray,"" he ruthlessly converts an innocent family Christmas card into a tribute to his favorite comedians, and then, above the mantelpiece, he adds the familiar painting by Man Ray, the artist, of floating lips. In the pretzel-like compositions of his panoramic postcard paintings, Mr. Wegman simply extends the images from panoramic postcards out across the canvas until they have to be reconciled with the extensions emanating from other postcards.Mr. Wegman's art can seem scattered, but, in fact, he rarely leaves anything behind. The cluttered, mostly green composition of a 1985 painting titled ""Furniture,"" for example, echoes both the humdrum tables and chairs of his videos, and his prevideo installation pieces. It also suggests, as do several canvases here, interesting links to irreverent German painters like Sigmar Polke and Martin Kippenberger.The show closes with some new dog Polaroids that are among the best Mr. Wegman has done since his Man Ray days and emphasize the affinity for color that emerges whenever he abandons black and white. ""Strippy,"" for example, uses a puzzled Weimaraner as an armature for torn strips of brightly colored paper. Its formal verve continues in Mr. Wegman's most recent Polaroids, on view through April 8 at the Senior & Shopmaker Gallery in Chelsea, in which sheets of luminous colored Plexiglas muffle and multiply the Weimaraners' bodies and soulful faces. The Sperone Westwater Gallery, also in Chelsea, is showing a selection of early and recent work that encapsulates the span of the Brooklyn show, through April 22.Mr. Wegman has done it, as the song says, his way. What he lacks in weight and depth when compared with artists like Richard Serra, Mr. Nauman and Robert Smithson, he more than makes up for with a sustained lightness whose profundity sneaks up on you.His best work juggles the many balls of Post-Minimalism -- process, language, performance -- with an amateurish finesse that few of his contemporaries match. He may also be the last artist to hitch a ride on the Pop Art train as it pulled out of the station. Drawing on an even broader, more pedestrian range of Americana than the Pop artists did, Mr. Wegman refused to absorb these elements into high art, or even meet them on their own terms. Instead, he refashioned them into substandard versions -- crude, lame and infinitely touching -- that lay bare their hucksterism and their sincerity. He has not only embraced Americana, but he has also become part of it, and lived to tell the tale.""William Wegman: Funney/Strange"" is at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 501-6134, through May 28.'"
"'06-03-10,'1','Mr. Novak asked Mr. Samit what would have happened had Mr. Moussaoui admitted to that information in August 2001.""I would have asked additional questions about his role in Al Qaeda and his relation to Osama bin Laden,"" the agent replied. ""It would have opened up a whole world of questions.""The testimony provided the most dramatic moments yet in Mr. Moussaoui's sentencing trial as Mr. Samit described his frustration over 21 days in trying to investigate Mr. Moussaoui's motives in taking lessons to fly a large commercial jet.Mr. Moussaoui paid for the lessons, which cost $8,300, with $100 bills.Mr. Samit testified that when he arrested Mr. Moussaoui on Aug. 16, 2001, in Minnesota, the immigration charges were mainly a way to take him out of circulation until officials could learn what was occurring.After failing two times to have superiors seek warrants to search Mr. Moussaoui's belongings and computer because of what they said was insufficient information, Mr. Samit said he settled on a final plan. He said the French government had agreed to have Mr. Moussaoui deported to France, his home country, under terms in which French law enforcement officials would search his belongings on landing in Paris.In the courtroom, some family members of the Sept. 11 victims gasped and sighed when Mr. Samit said he had concluded the agreement on Sept. 10 and was planning to go to his office on Sept. 11 to arrange the deportation. Instead, the agent testified how after the attacks, the authorities obtained an emergency warrant and found materials in Mr. Moussaoui's belongings that matched those of the hijackers, including short-bladed knives and protective body gear.Among the items was a notebook with the alias of and a German phone number for Ramzi bin al-Shibh, considered paymaster of the Sept. 11 terrorists.Because Mr. Moussaoui has pleaded guilty to conspiracy, the jury is hearing testimony just to decide whether he is to be executed or sentenced to life in prison.The prosecution contends that even though he was in jail at the time of the attacks, he was responsible for the deaths because his deceptive answers allowed the plot to go forward.At the end of the day, a defense lawyer, Gerald T. Zerkin, tried to have Judge Leonie M. Brinkema declare a mistrial when a prosecutor apparently went too far in pressing the argument that Mr. Moussaoui's silence caused the deaths.In questioning Mr. Samit, Mr. Novak asked loudly whether Mr. Moussaoui had reached out from the local jail to tell him what he knew about Al Qaeda in the immediate days before the attack. By that time, Mr. Moussaoui had said he would not speak to investigators without a lawyer, and Judge Brinkema ruled the question improper, but said it did not rise to a mistrial.The morning session included testimony from a longtime airline pilot and instructor who told the jury how Mr. Moussaoui first came under suspicion at the Minnesota flight school. School officials called the F.B.I.The instructor, Clarence Prevost, said he was baffled as to why Mr. Moussaoui, who had not been qualified to fly solo in a small private plane, had signed up for expensive lessons with a flight simulator for a Boeing 747-400. Mr. Prevost said he became especially alarmed when he learned how Mr. Moussaoui paid for the lessons.'"
"'06-03-10,'1','Now for the shopping spree.The completion of an extension to the National Football League's collective-bargaining agreement means labor peace for another six years. But it also means a potential bonanza for free agents and draft picks this year. Free agency, delayed twice while the agreement was being negotiated, starts tomorrow, and teams have hit the salary-cap lottery. The cap is set at $102 million for 2006, an enormous one-time leap of $16.5 million over the $85.5 million in cap dollars teams had available in 2005. It will be $109 million in 2007.Leigh Steinberg, an agent who represents the Southern California quarterback Matt Leinart, projected to be one of the top three picks in the April draft, said he anticipated that the N.F.L. could ultimately have contracts comparable to those in baseball and basketball. The N.F.L.'s new television contracts, worth $3.7 billion annually starting in 2006, grow in value in the later years of the agreement. That will put more money into the revenue-sharing stream, giving teams the cash to lavish on the biggest stars. The $37 million in guaranteed money that Atlanta quarterback Michael Vick received in the 10-year, $130 million contract he signed in December 2004 might just be the start.This year, Steinberg said, he would not be surprised if the top pick in the draft received nearly $30 million in guaranteed money. Last year's first pick, San Francisco quarterback Alex Smith, received $24.5 million. Signing bonuses for veterans and rookies are expected to become larger, in part because they can be amortized over a longer period of time under the new deal than if there were no deal. Steinberg estimated that if an extension had not been completed, it would have been difficult to get a contract with $15 million in guaranteed money because the amortization period was shorter.""It's the return of the signing bonus,"" Steinberg said. ""Happy days are here again.""Players already in the league, and the teams that want to sign them, will benefit most from the new deal.""This mega-increase in the cap affords teams the opportunity to do an extreme makeover of their roster,"" Steinberg said. ""It allows a team that was close to the cap to retain the integrity of its roster. But it also allows a team that wants to exploit the ability to dramatically improve itself the ability to be extremely aggressive in free agency. They can do some of what people perceived would happen in an uncapped year, because they have so much cap room.""'"
"'06-03-10,'1','Knight Ridder is attractive largely because its newspapers remain profitable despite the current environment of declining industry revenues. Its overall profit margin in 2004 was 19.3 percent, which is robust.In addition, Knight Ridder has several strong newspaper Web sites and various online ventures that could serve as gateways to a substantial presence on the Internet, from which analysts expect strong revenue. Its assets include CareerBuilder.com, a popular Web site that it owns with Gannett and the Tribune Company.McClatchy, based in Sacramento, is known for picking newspapers in high-growth markets, and although Knight Ridder is in some cities with slow business climates, like Philadelphia, McClatchy could conceivably sell the papers in those markets.Other Knight Ridder papers could provide a good geographic fit for McClatchy. For example, if McClatchy were to acquire The Charlotte Observer from Knight Ridder, it could save on costs by coordinating its coverage and advertising sales, as well as Internet activity, with its paper in Raleigh.McClatchy has a history of buying larger companies. In 1997, it acquired the Cowles Media Company, publisher of The Star Tribune, despite Cowles's being nearly twice McClatchy's size.Analysts and people inside Knight Ridder have long said that McClatchy would be the best fit culturally.In a note to investors, Lauren Rich Fine, a Merrill Lynch analyst, wrote Wednesday, ""We do believe that MNI would be KRI's first choice, everything else being equal,"" referring to McClatchy and Knight Ridder by their ticker symbols.When Knight Ridder's board considers the offers, it is not expected to look only at the highest offer, people close to the board said. Directors will also consider issues related to maintaining the journalistic integrity of the chain's newspapers, as well as how certain it is that a transaction can be completed and how quickly, these people said. The board could also decide to scrap a sale and pursue a stock buyback.Under pressure from its three biggest shareholders, Knight Ridder announced on Nov. 14 that it was considering a sale. After a sharp run-up in early November on word that one of the shareholders -- Private Capital Management, controlled by Bruce S. Sherman -- had demanded a sale, shares of the company have barely moved. They closed yesterday at $62.66, up 20 cents.Knight Ridder was formed in 1974 by a merger of Knight Newspapers Inc. and Ridder Publications. It is different from many other publicly traded newspaper companies in that it has one class of stock, so the founding families do not have a controlling interest that would allow them to block a takeover.'"
"'06-03-10,'1','Amazon.com is in talks with three Hollywood studios about starting a service that would allow consumers to download movies and TV shows for a fee and burn them onto DVD's, according to three people briefed on the discussions.If the advanced negotiations are successfully concluded, Amazon's service would position itself in the media world alongside rivals like Apple Computer's iTunes as a place where people go not just to order goods to be sent by mail, but to instantly enjoy digital wares as well.So far, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Warner Brothers are engaged in the talks, said one person close to the talks who, like the others, asked not to be identified because the negotiations are continuing.Although it is not clear when it might begin, an Amazon downloading service would be sure to send waves through both the media and retail worlds. Players in both industries are racing to offer new ways to give technology-savvy audiences instant access to their favorite shows and songs, in a field crowded with potential rivals using Internet and on-demand technologies.Amazon, which was created as an online bookstore and now sells a wide range of goods, is already among the largest sellers of DVD's and VHS tapes. Other retailers, like Wal-Mart Stores and Target, are also working with the studios on new ways to distribute programming in digital formats.'"
"'06-03-10,'1','MINEOLA, N.Y., March 9 - State aid to public schools might not seem like a salvational issue, but at a gathering that was part tent meeting and part campaign rally, local officials said on Thursday that the inequitable distribution of state aid threatens a very way of life in the suburbs.""This is not just about educating our children,"" said Mitchell H. Pally, a vice president of the Long Island Association, a business group. ""It's about making it possible to educate our children so that companies will want to employ them, and so that our children can afford to live here.""Taxpayers on Long Island send $3 billion more to the state treasury annually than they get back in state services and aid to public schools, said Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, who announced his candidacy for governor nearly two weeks ago. ""This inequity must end,"" he said.In an auditorium at the county police headquarters, Mr. Suozzi and his staff summoned several hundred school board members, civic and business leaders and a few busloads of tax-stressed homeowners invited from centers for the elderly. With almost half the group standing around him at a podium, ready for photographs, and the rest applauding in agreement, Mr. Suozzi said that without reform the suburban taxpayer would be crushed.According to Mr. Suozzi, New York State pays, on average, 37 percent of the per pupil costs in public schools statewide, but in Nassau County, that figure averages only 17 percent. The rest is made up by property taxes.'"
"'06-03-10,'1','Mr. Stack, a Democrat, who also represents the area in the State Assembly, did not return calls seeking comment.The allegations are the latest trouble involving the school construction agency since last year when it reported that it had exhausted the $8 billion it had available after building only a fraction of the schools promised for mostly poor districts around the state. An inspector general's investigation found that the agency was ""vulnerable to mismanagement, fiscal malfeasance, conflicts of interest and waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars.""The suit involving the Union City parcel focuses on a 2,500-square-foot plot on Palisades Avenue, which for the 12 years before 2004 had been a parking lot owned by three brothers, Daniel, Samuel and David Lopez.The School Construction Corporation notified the owners by letter in August 2003 that it intended to condemn the plot and acquire it at fair market value to build Columbus Elementary School. What followed was a hurried, two-month process in which the Lopezes received 10 variances to allow the construction and approval of their site plan, state officials said.In a deposition filed in the case, John Medina, a former member of the Zoning Board, said that he and other board members who were close political allies of Mayor Stack were told by another official acting on the mayor's behalf how to vote on the variances.Lawyers for the state charged in their papers that Daniel Lopez contributed more than $5,000 to one of Mayor Stack's campaign committees after the Zoning Board vote.Daniel Lopez insists that he did not know until May 2004 that the state was intending to build a school on the site, some nine months after the state agency said it notified the family. By then, he said, work was proceeding on the three-story, mixed residential and commercial building he was putting up for $600,000 on the lot.Mr. Medina said that Zoning Board members were never told about the plans for the school by other city officials or any of the Lopezes.In his deposition, Mr. Medina offered his opinion on why the votes of such boards are generally unanimous.""This is the way it's done all over the country,"" Mr. Medina said. ""I mean, you know, in my opinion, most of the people on these boards are employed by the town, and I think that, you know, there's an interest in that, and there's a reason why people are put in those positions.""In another development, Paul Loriquet, a spokesman for the attorney general, said on Thursday that investigators were looking into the circumstances surrounding the construction agency's $4.3 million purchase of a Passaic parcel for an elementary school. The inquiry comes after published reports in The Record of Hackensack that the land was acquired from the wife of a man linked by a 1988 state investigative report to organized crime who had made political contributions to a number of local officials.'"
"'06-03-10,'1','The deal has cast a spotlight on the city's Marketing Development Corporation, the nonprofit group that the city founded in July 2003 to identify branding opportunities to raise money for the city. On Wednesday, the corporation asked a review panel to amend the five-year deal with lower targets, so that the city would get only $17.7 million in cash, compared with the $66 million Mr. Bloomberg estimated when he announced the original agreement.Joseph M. Perello, whom the mayor hired in April 2003 to be the city's first chief marketing officer, said he did not regret the deal's lofty goals.""We were too ambitious,"" he said. ""That's basically it. We were definitely too ambitious. But I will say I'm happy to be guilty of being too ambitious.""Mr. Perello oversees a staff of 23 at the marketing agency, including a lawyer and a paralegal who jealously guard the city's trademarks and pursue companies that make or sell knockoff products that infringe on the city's intellectual property.Mr. Perello, 37, said he would prefer to focus on the corporation's successes, like bringing the Country Music Association's annual award ceremony to New York City for the first time, on Nov. 15, and being the host of the world premiere of Peter Jackson's remake of ""King Kong"" in Times Square, on Dec. 5.""I'm not sorry about all of this,"" he said of the beverage deal. ""I would do it again. Obviously, if I had the chance I'd want to learn and do it better. But if you want to innovate and do new things, you have to be willing to reach and take risks.""The organization began with a loan from the city's Economic Development Corporation. In fiscal 2004, its first year of operation, it lost $692,000, but it had net income of $797,000 in 2005 and stands to make $1.3 million this fiscal year, which ends June 30, according to Mr. Perello. Most of the money received from the licensing deals so far has been put into other marketing projects, and little has made its way to the city's coffers.Mr. Perello -- who worked at MBNA America, the credit-card issuer, from 1989 to 1997, and then for the Yankees, from 1997 to 2000 -- said the agency had moved away from vending arrangements and would now focus on marketing sponsorships, licensing arrangements and promoting its partners through advertising.Under the amended deal, New Yorkers can expect to see many more Snapple ads on bus shelters and phone booths -- the two major pieces of advertising real estate that the marketing agency controls.Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, who is also the chairman of the marketing agency, said yesterday that the Snapple arrangement ""proved more difficult"" than he had anticipated, in part because officials ""assumed it would be easier to get machines located in properties controlled by the city.""Still, he said the arrangement was ""absolutely unprecedented"" and potentially profitable. ""We still generated a lot of money and provided value for the city,"" he said.Not everyone has so rosy a view.Bernd Schmitt, a professor of international business at Columbia Business School, said the arrangement was flawed from the start because it was neither creative nor unique. ""This campaign was wrong in many ways,"" said Dr. Schmitt, who is executive director of the Center on Global Brand Leadership. ""There was nothing special or new about the product -- only the association with the city and its availability in government buildings. The association is with a government campaign, and that's not particularly sexy.""A Snapple representative defended the deal's intent, if not its execution, yesterday. ""It was very visionary,"" said Jack Belsito, the president of Snapple's distribution arm, who negotiated the New York City deal. ""But they were too ambitious on the amount of locations. They didn't have the control over the agencies they thought they had.""Some city agencies refused to accept Snapple vending machines. In other places, machines could not fit in narrow or short corridors or could not be plugged in because there was no electrical outlet nearby.'"

"'06-03-10,'1','""A certain drop is normal after the holidays, but this year it was 40 percent,"" said Nadeem Mumtaz, the owner of Chicken Corner, a KFC knockoff just off northern Place de Clichy. To make matters worse, a new KFC recently opened about a block away, although some customers prefer his food over KFC because it is halal, prepared according to Islamic rules.To counter the slowdown, Mr. Mumtaz, 42, who opened Chicken Corner three years ago, has special offers for children and adults, but to little avail.""Our chicken is safe, there is no risk,"" he said, waving a hand at his empty restaurant, ""but even people you tell that to ask questions, have doubts.""For KFC, the rumblings in Europe are a sideshow compared with the challenges it faces in Asia. Late last year, consumers in China shunned KFC because of the avian flu, which has caused 10 deaths there so far. Around the same time, KFC had to withdraw a soup from the Chinese market after it was found that a vegetable ingredient could result in liver damage, if eaten in large amounts. On top of that, some KFC foods were found to contain the carcinogenic coloring Sudan-1.KFC has withdrawn all those products and ingredients.Veronique Perrin, a spokeswoman for KFC in France, where the company has about 37 restaurants and is expanding quickly, declined to comment on how bird flu is affecting sales or what actions the company might be taking. But the company said in a statement this week that in some of Europe's biggest and most robust markets, sales have not been hurt. In Britain and Ireland, where there have been no cases of avian flu, ""there has been no impact on sales"" at KFC's 680 restaurants.Nonetheless, KFC said it was ready. ""We have procedures in place to ensure that chicken with avian flu cannot enter our supply chain,"" the company said. ""In addition, we have communications plans in place should it become necessary to remind consumers of the World Health Organization statement that eating properly cooked chicken is safe.""In that vein, a recent Times of London article featured the headline ""Lottery Win More Likely Than Avian Flu.""In a narrow KFC at the African food market in the Château Rouge section of northern Paris, Eric Makosso, a restaurant manager, said it was normal to have a drop in sales after the New Year holiday.""People are not upset,"" Mr. Makosso, 25, said. He said the restaurant's chickens come from Brittany, in western France, and its hot wings from Poland. ""For us, what is important is traceability, and what temperature the chicken is at,"" he said. ""I check the chicken's temperature when it comes in, and I know how it's cooked.""Facimata Bà, a homemaker in her 20's who said she went to KFC regularly, had no qualms about the chicken's safety. ""It's a big part of the African diet. It's well cooked. We eat a lot of chicken.""French health experts expect more cases of avian flu in the weeks to come. Philippe Vannier, the director of animal health at the Agency for Health Safety, told a parliamentary committee this week that the cases would not be concentrated in just one region of the country. ""The probability is extremely high,"" Mr. Vannier said. But he added that the government health services were prepared.Restaurant industry experts urge a wait-and-see policy. ""Obviously it's something to watch,"" said Peter H. Oakes, who follows the restaurant trade at Piper Jaffray in New York. In the absence of same-store sales figures, judging the seriousness of the threat is difficult, Mr. Oakes said. But he added: ""It looks like things soften in the winter; at the same time, it's not dramatic.""Asked if she was afraid to eat poultry, Katharina Zollner, who recently visited the new KFC on Place de Clichy with her two young boys, replied: ""Not yet, but if more such cases appear, then I might change my mind.""What frightened her, she said, was the omnipresent pigeons of Paris. ""Dead pigeons,"" she said. ""In recent days, I've seen 10 dead pigeons.""'"

"'06-03-10,'1','The chairwoman of the faculty senate's executive committee at George Washington University said this week that a committee would look into the admission of two players on the men's basketball team.Omar Williams and Maureece Rice of the Colonials , who are ranked No. 6 in N.C.A.A. Division I, played for schools run by Darryl Schofield, the coach who runs Lutheran Christian Academy in Philadelphia. An investigation by The New York Times found that Lutheran was not an accredited school. Four former players at Lutheran told The Times that Schofield was the only teacher at the school and that class attendance was not required.Officials at George Washington stressed that the university was a private institution, that it could admit anyone it wanted and that graduation from high school was not a requirement to attend.However, the chairwoman of the faculty senate's executive committee, Lilien F. Robinson, said: ""This matter is something that the senate committee on athletics will be looking into. Any matter that faculty members are concerned with is going to be something that comes to the faculty senate.""After The Times reported late last month that the players had attended schools with questionable academic standards, Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, George Washington's president, said he was ""embarrassed."" But the university issued a statement later quoting Coach Karl Hobbs as saying that he saw a ""burning desire to graduate"" in both Rice and Williams, who took a combined total of 13 years to finish high school.'"
"'06-03-10,'1','With a couple of priceless scenes as a prosecutor trying desperately to contain his inner canine, Tim Allen turns what could have been an obligatory revisiting into something worth seeing. It helps that the judge is one of today's great and underappreciated comic foils: Jane Curtin, who made John Lithgow look so good in ""Third Rock From the Sun.""Ms. Curtin is one of several examples of quirky casting that make this ""Shaggy Dog"" much more fun than it might have been. Is that Craig Kilborn, the onetime late-night host, playing Mr. Allen's neighbor? It is, and he's darn funny, in a deadpan way.But it's Mr. Allen who pulls the package together. Do not, by the way, refer to this as a remake of the dowdy 1959 Disney film starring Fred MacMurray; the only thing they have in common is the title. For one thing, in the original, it was the son of Mr. MacMurray's character who turned into a dog; here, of course, it is Mr. Allen, a distracted father of two, who, as the story begins, is prosecuting an arson case involving a laboratory where animal research is being done. He manages to be bitten by a Methuselah-like dog from Tibet, and the mutating begins.Mr. Allen makes the most of his chances for subtle physical comedy. (The widely seen trailer of him trying to keep his giant dog tongue in his mouth is not at all representative; much better is his first morning with dog blood, newly appreciating the smells in his kitchen.) In fact, the movie loses steam every time Mr. Allen has to turn all the way into a dog and is reduced to voice-over work.As for the plot, when exactly did People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals acquire a majority share of Disney stock? The lab, whose mad demon is Robert Downey Jr., is doing nefarious things, and Mr. Allen, with the help of his children, sniffs out the truth.Directed by Brian Robbins; written by the Wibberleys, Geoff Rodkey, Jack Amiel and Michael Begler, based on the 1959 film; director of photography, Gabriel Beristain; edited by Ned Bastille; production designer, Leslie McDonald; produced by Tim Allen and David Hoberman; released by Walt Disney Pictures.

"'06-03-10,'1','It cited ""increased harassment, detention and imprisonment"" of people who were viewed as threats to the government.The report also criticized tighter controls on the Chinese press and more assertive censorship of all kinds of media, including the Internet.Chinese diplomats pay close attention to the tone of the State Department report because it often indicates how aggressively the United States will work to censure China at the annual United Nations human rights convention in Geneva, which takes place in April.Though Beijing publicly dismisses the value of the State Department's report, Chinese diplomats often lobby Washington privately to soften criticism and avoid pushing motions for sanctions on Beijing, Chinese and American diplomats say.Human rights discussions between American and Chinese officials have been especially tense this year because China has detained and arrested a number of well-known journalists, lawyers, religious leaders and human rights activists, people involved in the talks said.Police officers and thugs hired by the authorities also have used force to suppress social unrest in the countryside.To ease condemnation of its record, China recently released several people from prison before the formal expiration of their terms.On Wednesday, the same day the State Department report was issued, the Dui Hua Foundation, a San Francisco-based human rights group, said it had been notified by Chinese authorities that Tong Shidong, 72, a physics professor convicted of helping found an opposition political party in 1999, would probably be released three years before his sentence was up.President Hu Jintao is scheduled to make his first visit to the United States as China's top leader in April. Early releases of prisoners and other concessions on delicate human rights cases often precede such trips as good-will gestures.But human rights groups argue that treating political prisoners as bargaining chips has not often heralded lasting improvement in China's human rights record.China defends its progress on rights issues. Qin Gang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Thursday that the government's respect for rights ""not only satisfied the Chinese people but also has been affirmed by the international community.""The Chinese rebuttal to the State Department report, much of which appeared to be compiled from American newspaper clippings, devoted special attention to what it described as the ""chronic malady"" of racism.It said blacks and other minorities had lower living standards and less reliable access to health care and faced discrimination in the workplace. Blacks also received the death penalty more often than whites convicted of the same crimes, it said.The Chinese report also noted a deterioration in conditions for Muslims in America since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and mentioned the use of ""various kinds of torture"" at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and other overseas detention centers where suspected terrorists were held.The unchecked spread of guns in private hands and secret wiretaps authorized by the White House were among the other rights problems in the United States that China cited.'"
"'06-03-11,'0','Cambridge, Mass. - LAW enforcement officials, politicians and social scientists have put forward many explanations for the astonishing drop in crime rates in America over the last decade or so, and yet we remain mystified. Studies have shown that while each of the usual suspects -- a decline in crack use, aggressive policing, increased prison populations, a relatively strong economy, increased availability of abortion -- has probably played some role, none has proved to be as dominant a factor as initially suggested.Perhaps we have been overlooking something obvious -- something that our implicit biases caused us not to notice. My unusual suspect is foreigners: evidence points to increased immigration as a major factor associated with the lower crime rate of the 1990's (and its recent leveling off).Consider what sociologists call the ""Latino paradox"": Hispanic Americans do better on a range of various social indicators -- including propensity to violence -- than one would expect given their socioeconomic disadvantages. My colleagues and I have completed a study in which we examined violent acts by almost 3,000 males and females, ranging in age from 8 to 25, from 1995 to 2003. The study selected whites, blacks and Hispanics (primarily Mexican-Americans) from 180 Chicago neighborhoods ranging from highly segregated to very integrated. We also analyzed data from police records, the Census and a separate survey of more than 8,000 Chicago residents who were asked about the characteristics of their neighborhoods.Surprisingly, we found a significantly lower rate of violence among Mexican-Americans than among blacks and whites. A major reason is that more than a quarter of all those of Mexican descent were born abroad and more than half lived in neighborhoods where the majority of residents were also Mexican. Indeed, the first-generation immigrants (those born outside the United States) in our study were 45 percent less likely to commit violence than were third-generation Americans, adjusting for family and neighborhood background. Second-generation immigrants were 22 percent less likely to commit violence than the third generation.This ""protective"" pattern among immigrants holds true for non-Hispanic whites and blacks as well. Our study further showed that living in a neighborhood of concentrated immigration is directly associated with lower violence (again, after taking into account a host of factors, including poverty and an individual's immigrant status).'"
"'06-03-11,'0','The board of the London exchange said the offer ""substantially undervalues the company, its unique position and the very significant synergies that would be achievable from the combination of London Stock Exchange with any exchange group.""The exchange disclosed the offer after the close of trading in London. Shares of the L.S.E. have risen 82 percent in the last 12 months. Yesterday, shares of Nasdaq surged more than 10 percent, to $43.56, while shares of the NYSE Group fell 2 percent, to $74.55.Markets have been merging because by pooling liquidity -- putting together the trading of groups of stocks, bonds or derivatives -- they can offer better prices to buyers and sellers while making more money on the increased volume of trading.At the same time, many exchanges have converted from member-owned entities to for-profit publicly traded companies and their share prices have soared. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, for example, went public in December 2002 at $35 a share; yesterday, it closed at $428.40.London, a centuries-old exchange that went public in 2001, is a target in part because its market value is small enough to be digested by another exchange. The Deutsche Börse, while lacking the trading volume of London, has a much larger market value, of more than $13 billion, because of its profitable clearing and derivatives businesses.And London has become increasingly attractive as companies, concerned about the stringent regulatory oversight in the United States in the wake of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, have looked to list on exchanges other than the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. Of the 10 largest initial public offerings of the last year, none listed on an American exchange, according to Thomson Financial. Two listed on London.""London is the crown jewel of Europe,"" said Doug Atkin, chief executive of Majestic Research and the former chief executive of Instinet. For Mr. Thain, ""losing this chess piece to Nasdaq is a big deal.""A person close to the London Stock Exchange said New York had not made any formal overtures toward bidding for the exchange.London has an obvious allure for Nasdaq, which historically has lagged the New York Stock Exchange in attracting the largest listed companies. The market capitalization of companies on Nasdaq is $3.6 trillion, compared with $22.5 trillion on the New York Exchange. London has $6 trillion worth of companies listed on it.Nasdaq previously looked at alliances with London in 2000 and 2002, but the new offer is still something of an about-face for Nasdaq. More than a month ago, its chief executive, Robert Greifeld, denied that Nasdaq was in talks to buy the London Stock Exchange. And he has often said in the past that he is focused on trying to capture market share in New York-listed stocks and increase his own exchange's share of over-the-counter stocks.Yesterday, after being rebuffed by London, Nasdaq defended its pursuit: ""Nasdaq believes that bringing together the two organizations would present listed companies, traders and investors with an equity marketplace, based on dynamic industry leadership, to serve their needs unmatched by any other marketplace in the world.""If Nasdaq decides to pursue a hostile bid for London, it is unclear where it will find the financing. Nasdaq has $455 million in cash. It would have to turn to private equity or extend its credit line of $750 million to come up with the money for an all-cash bid.In addition to the Deutsche Börse and Euronext bids, other offers have come London's way in recent years, from Macquarie Bank of Australia and the operator of the Stockholm stock market.Last year, Deutsche Börse shareholders rejected a takeover of the London exchange and ousted its chief executive, Werner Siefert. Macquarie made a £1.5 billion hostile offer in November 2005, but walked away last month after shares of the London exchange soared 50 percent.""Since 2004, people have been trying to buy London without too much success,"" Mr. Herr of Keefe Bruyette said.The London exchange received a letter from Nasdaq on Thursday night. No talks had been going on, and people at the exchange were surprised at the lack of a warning, said a London-based executive who was briefed on the offer.""Clearly, this is unsolicited, unexpected and is unwelcome,"" he said, requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the offer. ""In spite of the travails of the past 15 months, the L.S.E. has been looking to build the business, has been delivering record trading, and developing international primary market.""Nasdaq's interest in London comes at a time when it is still integrating Instinet, the electronic exchange it acquired about the same time the New York Stock Exchange planned to merge with the electronic stock operator Archipelago.J. P. Morgan Chase and Greenhill & Company are advising Nasdaq. The law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher & Flom is also representing Nasdaq. Merrill Lynch is the lead defense adviser for the London Stock Exchange and Lehman Brothers is a co-adviser.Few believe that London's rejection is the end of it. Indeed, Nasdaq's bid is expected to prompt the Big Board to spring into action. A New York Exchange spokesman declined to comment.""I would imagine dinner plans are being canceled,"" Mr. Atkin, the former Instinet chief, said.'"

"'06-03-11,'0','MEMPHIS, March 10 - It was advertised as the great defining event of a campaign that has not really begun.Nearly 2,000 Republicans gathered here to listen to six potential presidential candidates and then pick their favorite in a straw poll on Saturday. No matter that it is 22 months until a single Republican votes: the Southern Republican Leadership Conference quickly turned into a swirling political circus, complete with candidates, senators, governors, consultants and television crews tromping through the ornate lobby of the Peabody Hotel.But on Friday, Senator John McCain of Arizona, one of the party's leading prospective presidential candidates, announced he would instruct his supporters not to vote for him and to instead write in the name of President Bush, as a show of support.The move left supporters of Mr. McCain's main rival -- Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, who had been looking for a big hometown win -- sputtering. And it greatly diminished the importance of an event that was, truth be told, of debatable significance in the first place.""Straw polls are entertaining, my friends, even extremely early ones,"" Mr. McCain said in remarks that were prepared for delivery Friday night and that aides distributed with undisguised glee. ""But I think we have bigger things to worry about. So if any friends here are voting for me, please don't. Just write in President Bush's name. For the next three years, with the country at war, he's our president, and the only one who must have our support today.""Mr. Frist's advisers and the poll organizer suggested that Mr. McCain was acting out fear that he was heading for a drubbing. Asked if Mr. Frist would now do the same thing as Mr. McCain did, an adviser, Jim Dyke, responded in an e-mail message: ""Panic about the outcome?""'"

"'06-03-11,'0','The prosecutors asked the judge to review their papers in his chambers without making them public or showing them to the defense. At midafternoon the judge issued a document announcing that he had entered the classified order denying Mr. Kindlon's request.It is common in federal court for judges to place documents and legal discussions under seal, meaning that the judge and the lawyers can be informed of the proceedings, but the public cannot. In this case, Judge McAvoy's order is classified, a higher degree of secrecy. As of late yesterday, Mr. Kindlon, even though he has a federal security clearance to represent Mr. Aref in the trial, had not been able to see the substance of the ruling.""Frankly, I'm taken aback,"" Mr. Kindlon said. The ruling ""holds out no promise of anything"" for him to see the decision, he said.Christopher Dunn, a lawyer for the New York Civil Liberties Union, which has asked to participate in the case, said such decisions appeared to be rare. Mr. Dunn said his group had no record of a classified decision in a case that it had handled.In his motion, Mr. Kindlon cited an article in The New York Times on Jan. 17 that reported that ""different officials agree"" that the security agency's program had ""played a role"" in the arrest of Mr. Aref and Mr. Hossain. Mr. Hossain's lawyer, Kevin A. Luibrand, joined the request to dismiss the case.Mr. Kindlon asked that all evidence in the case stemming from N.S.A. wiretaps be given to the defense. He argued that the program was unconstitutional and so the evidence should be suppressed.""The government engaged in illegal electronic surveillance of thousands of U.S. persons, including Yassin Aref, then instigated a sting operation to attempt to entrap Mr. Aref into supporting a nonexistent terrorist plot, then dared to claim that the illegal N.S.A. operation was justified because it was the only way to catch Mr. Aref,"" Mr. Kindlon wrote in his brief.Whether or not the program is constitutional is a matter of intense political and legal debate that has not been resolved by the courts. Since the government classified its motions, there is no way at this point to know what argument persuaded Judge McAvoy.The arrest of Mr. Aref, an Islamic scholar who is the imam of Masjid As-Salaam in Albany, and Mr. Hossain on Aug. 5, 2004, came after a yearlong sting operation in which the informant posed as a terrorist. They are accused of agreeing to launder $50,000 in payments for a Chinese missile that he showed them.At first, prosecutors said that both men had ties to a terrorist group known as Ansar-al-Islam. The government soon dropped those claims after it turned out they were based on a bad translation of a piece of evidence by the Defense Department. Mr. Aref was free on bail for 13 months, but he was sent to prison to await trial after the government brought new charges. Mr. Hossain remains free on bail.Mr. Kindlon said Judge McAvoy's action convinced him that there was N.S.A. wiretap evidence in the case. ""If they were not involved, the government would have told me, 'You're delusional,' "" he said.'"
"'06-03-11,'0','BRUSSELS, March 10 - The European Commission on Friday again accused Microsoft of flouting a 2004 antitrust ruling, with an independent monitor calling the company's responses ""incomplete, inaccurate and unusable.""In a letter sent to Microsoft, the commission said its experts had again found that the company had not met the terms of the ruling, which imposed a fine of 497 million euros ($591.7 million) on the company two years ago.Neil Barrett, the commission's independent monitor of Microsoft's compliance, criticized the company's responses. After reviewing Microsoft's latest submission, Mr. Barrett said in his statement, ""Nothing substantial was added to the technical documentation.""Taeus Europe, a unit of an intellectual property analysis firm based in Colorado Springs, was hired to help Mr. Barrett and was equally harsh in its assessment. Taeus described Microsoft's attempt to comply as ""entirely inadequate,"" ""devoted to obsolete functionality"" and ""self-contradictory.""Microsoft responded Friday by repeating that it was not only in compliance with the 2004 ruling, but had exceeded it. ""That documentation meets and surpasses the requirements of the commission's 2004 decision,"" it said in a statement.The company argued that the commission's reiteration of its negative conclusions shows that the formal statement of objections in December ""is fundamentally flawed and should be withdrawn.""'"
"'06-03-11,'0','UNITED NATIONS, March 10 - The United Nations on Friday extended by a week its deadline for seeking approval of a new human rights council that is opposed by the United States but backed by rights groups and a vast majority of the 191 member states.Simultaneously, the Human Rights Commission, which the council is supposed to replace, agreed to postpone by a week the opening of its annual session that was to start Monday in Geneva.The actions came after human rights organizations had mounted a lobbying effort in support of the proposed council, and the European Union had sent Washington a pledge that its members would keep objectionable candidates off the panel.The commission has long been an embarrassment to the United Nations because its members included some of the world's most notorious rights violators.The council was proposed a year ago by Secretary General Kofi Annan with terms that would bar membership to rights abusers, but in the version that emerged this month after long negotiations, those guarantees were watered down.'"

Gen. Mehdi Sabih Hashem al-Garawi, commander of a paramilitary police unit, said Iraqi military officials might also be investigating Iraqna and, if so, could be examining the security company in connection with those inquiries.Spokesmen for Iraqna and its Cairo-based parent company, Orascom Telecom, could not be reached for comment on Friday.Sheik Muhsin Naif al-Faisal, one of the security company's owners and a former member of Parliament, said Friday in a telephone interview that he had not received any information about the condition of his 34 abducted employees and said he was at a loss to explain the raid. ""Everything's possible,"" he said.Mr. Faisal, who was in London at the time of the raid, said that according to witnesses, the assailants appeared to be Interior Ministry police officials on a routine check of weapons and licenses. The ministry has repeatedly denied any involvement in the raid.In Spain, the country's National Court revoked an international arrest warrant for three American soldiers suspected of killing a Spanish journalist in Baghdad during the American invasion in 2003. The court ruled that the Spanish authorities lacked jurisdiction because the case involved a legitimate act of war against a target ""mistakenly identified as the enemy,"" rather than an intentional effort to kill civilians, according to a court official.The journalist, José Manuel Couso Permuy, a cameraman with the Spanish television station Telecinco, was killed in April 2003 when a shell fired from an American tank struck the Palestine Hotel, where he and about 100 other journalists had been staying. Taras Protsyuk, a Ukrainian-born cameraman with the Reuters news agency, was also killed in the incident.'"
"'06-03-11,'0','JUST when natural gas prices seemed likely to hit the moon this winter, much of the United States had the warmest January in history. With gas inventories high, prices plunged. Natural gas is now unusually cheap relative to oil.United States natural gas is also cheap relative to gas in Britain, and traders think that pattern will persist into next winter -- notwithstanding the fact that the weather is notoriously hard to predict.Wild swings in natural gas prices have long been a part of the commodities market. Unlike oil, gas was impossible to ship outside of pipelines. So a surplus of gas in the United States would drive prices down, perhaps at the same time they were soaring in Britain because of a cold spell.But that is starting to change, as the volume of liquefied natural gas transported by ship grows. Those ships can turn around if one market will pay much more than another for gas.""Once it gets really cold, you have both sides of the Atlantic bidding for the same gas,"" said Francisco Blanch, a commodity strategist at Merrill Lynch in London.

"'06-03-11,'0','The election is scheduled for April 9 and 10.Following reports that their investigation was complete, prosecutors in Milan said Friday that they would ask that Mr. Berlusconi and a British lawyer, David Mills, be put on trial for judicial corruption.The prosecutors released no details, but the case has been widely reported in the Italian news media, and centers on whether Mr. Berlusconi ordered $600,000 to be paid in 1997 in exchange for false testimony by Mr. Mills in two other cases against Mr. Berlusconi.Both Mr. Berlusconi and Mr. Mills have denied the charges, but the case has rippled out to Britain. Mr. Mills and his wife, Tessa Jowell, the British culture minister, separated last weekend after a parliamentary commission cleared Ms. Jowell of any impropriety after accusations that the money was used to pay off the mortgage on the couple's house.On Friday, Mr. Berlusconi's allies dismissed the charges. They said that the timing, during the campaign, proved the prime minister's long contention that left-leaning prosecutors have a vendetta against him.His spokesman, Paolo Buonauti, released a statement calling the charges ""false theories -- shameful and impossible.""Prosecutors have been quoted in Italian press reports as saying they needed to act quickly because the statute of limitations for the crimes was shortened under legislation passed by Mr. Berlusconi's government.A judge must hold hearings on whether the case will go to trial, a process unlikely to be complete during the last month of campaigning. Such trials drag on for years, and as has been the case in other corruption cases against Mr. Berlusconi, are often voided because the statute of limitations run out.Later on Friday, the nation's health minister, Francesco Storace, resigned because of a widening scandal over whether he spied on political opponents during a hard-fought regional election last year.Earlier this week, 16 people, including police officers and private investigators, were arrested in the case. There were suspicions that Mr. Storace had ordered video surveillance and wiretapping of opponents as he sought re-election as the president of the Lazio region, which includes Rome. He lost the race, and Mr. Berlusconi later appointed him health minister.In announcing his resignation, Mr. Storace, a member of the National Alliance party, which is aligned with Mr. Berlusconi, released a statement saying that ""the mere suspicion"" of guilt ""hurts me and makes me indignant.""Last month, Mr. Berlusconi's reforms minister, Roberto Calderoli, was forced to resign after he appeared on a television program wearing a T-shirt printed with the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that have caused riots around the Muslim world. He stepped down after more than a dozen people were killed in a violent anti-Italian demonstration in Libya.'"
"'06-03-12,'0','The two drugs are used by fewer than 5,000 patients a year and had combined sales of about $1 million in 2004.Now Ovation has raised the wholesale price of Mustargen roughly tenfold and that of Cosmegen even more, according to several pharmacists and patients.Sean Nolan, vice president of commercial development for Ovation, said that the price increases were needed to invest in manufacturing facilities for the drugs. He said the company was petitioning insurers to obtain coverage for patients.The increase has stunned doctors, who say it starkly illustrates two trends in the pharmaceutical industry: the soaring price of cancer medicines and the tendency for those prices to have little relation to the cost of developing or making the drugs.Genentech, for example, has indicated it will effectively double the price of its colon cancer drug Avastin, to about $100,000, when Avastin's use is expanded to breast and lung cancer patients. As with Avastin, nothing about nitrogen mustard is changing but the price.The increases have caused doctors to question Ovation's motive -- and left lymphoma patients wondering how they will afford Mustargen, which is sometimes not covered by insurance, because the drug's label does not indicate that it can be used as an ointment. When given intravenously to treat Hodgkin's disease, its other primary use, the drug is generally covered by insurance.""Nitrogen mustard has been around forever,"" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. ""There's nothing that I am aware of in the treatment environment that would explain an increase in the cost of the drug.""Dr. David H. Johnson, a Vanderbilt University oncologist who is a former president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said he had contacted Ovation to ask its reasons for raising Mustargen's price.""I'd like to have some evidence from them that it actually costs them X amount, so that the pricing makes sense,"" Dr. Johnson said.""It's unfortunate that a price adjustment had to occur,"" Mr. Nolan said. ""Investment had not been made in these products for years.""Ovation, a privately held company, also needs the money to conduct research on several new drugs for rare diseases, Mr. Nolan said.He acknowledged that Merck still made Mustargen and Cosmegen, an antibiotic that is used to treat a rare childhood kidney cancer, for Ovation. He said he was not sure when Ovation would begin producing the drugs, and a Merck spokesman said that Merck would continue to provide the drugs to Ovation as long as necessary.But people who analyze drug pricing say they see the Mustargen situation as emblematic of an industry trend of basing drug prices on something other than the underlying costs. After years of defending high prices as necessary to cover the cost of research or production, industry executives increasingly point to the intrinsic value of their medicines as justification for prices.Last year, in his book ""A Call to Action,"" Henry A. McKinnell, the chairman of Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, wrote that drug prices were not driven by research spending or production costs.""A number of factors go into the mix"" of pricing, he wrote. ""Those factors consider cost of business, competition, patent status, anticipated volume, and, most important, our estimation of the income generated by sales of the product.""In some drug categories, such as cholesterol-lowering treatments, many drugs compete, keeping prices relatively low. But when a medicine does not have a good substitute, its maker can charge almost any price. In 2003, Abbott Laboratories raised the price of Norvir, an AIDS drug introduced in 1996, from $54 to $265 a month. AIDS groups protested, but Abbott refused to rescind the increase.And once a company sets a price, government agencies, private insurers and patients have little choice but to pay it. The Food & Drug Administration does not regulate prices, and Medicare is banned from considering price in deciding whether to cover treatments.While private insurers can negotiate prices, they have limited leeway to exclude drugs from coverage based on price, said C. Lee Blansett, a partner at DaVinci Healthcare Partners, which works with drug makers on pricing and marketing.""Price is simply not included in whether or not to cover a drug,"" Mr. Blansett said.The result has been soaring prices for some drug classes, notably cancer treatments. In 1992, Bristol-Myers Squibb faced protests for its plans to charge $4,000 a year for Taxol, a breast cancer treatment.Now, most new cancer treatments are priced at $25,000 to $50,000 annually. In some cases, companies are pushing through substantial price increases on already-expensive drugs.Last year, Genentech raised the price of Tarceva, a lung-cancer drug, by about 30 percent, to $32,000 for a year's treatment.In an interview last month, Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, the president of product development for Genentech, said that the company had raised Tarceva's price because the drug works better than Genentech had anticipated.""Tarceva was a more powerful and more active agent than what we understood at the time of launch, and so more valuable,"" she said. In an environment of soaring cancer drug costs, Mustargen's previous price was a comparative bargain, giving Ovation the opportunity to raise it substantially, said Dr. Richard Hoppe, a professor of radiation oncology at Stanford University and an expert in treating cutaneous lymphoma.Mustargen's patent protection expired many years ago, so any company can make it. But because its sales are tiny, no drug maker has invested in a generic version.""There's only one company that makes the drug, and they can decide what it's worth,"" Dr. Hoppe said.Nitrogen mustard was initially tested as a chemical weapon. Its properties as an anti-cancer agent were discovered more than 60 years ago; today, it has been superseded by newer, less toxic medicines, and it is a niche product, with sales of only $546,000 in 2004, according to IMS Health, a market research firm.Still, Dr. Hoppe and other oncologists call nitrogen mustard an effective treatment for cutaneous lymphoma, which initially appears as a rash but can turn deadly if it spreads inside the body. Some patients need only tiny amounts of the ointment, but others must apply it every day across large areas of their bodies.For instance, Ms. Elkins has a severe case of lymphoma and must cover much of her body with Mustargen each day, a process that requires her to refill her prescription every two weeks. She said that the ointment was working, so she and her husband would find a way to pay for it.Mr. Nolan of Ovation said that his company intended to work to improve access to insurance coverage for Mustargen. But Ovation has just begun to petition insurers to cover the drug. Meanwhile, patients are paying Mustargen's new, higher price out of pocket.This is not the first time that Ovation has sharply raised the price of a drug it owns. In 2003, the company bought Panhematin, a treatment for a rare enzymatic disease called porphyria, from Abbott Laboratories. While Abbott still produces Panhematin, Ovation raised Panhematin's price, which had been $230 a dose, to $1,900, according to Desiree Lyon, executive director of the American Porphyria Foundation.""It was a major increase,"" Ms. Lyon said. But she said that Ovation had worked to improve insurance coverage for Panhematin and to find ways for patients to get the drug even if they could not afford it.Ovation also financially supports the porphyria foundation in its efforts to increase awareness of the disease and of Panhematin as a treatment, she said.But many patients who rely on expensive drugs are stuck in a bind. Don Schare of Saratoga, Calif., said he paid $1,260 last month for 200 grams of nitrogen mustard cream, about 10 times what he paid for his prior prescription.Mr. Schare, 69, said he was covered by the new Medicare Part D drug program and by supplemental insurance from AARP, but that neither of his plans covered Mustargen.Jeffrey Malavasic, 58, a retired railroad worker in Florence, Ore., said he had decided to fill only half of his Mustargen prescription when he learned of the price increase. He used the drug sparingly in the past and will be even more frugal, he said.Correction: March 14, 2006, Tuesday A front-page article on Sunday about a price increase for the cancer drug Mustargen referred imprecisely to the pricing of another drug, the colon cancer treatment Avastin, which is made by Genentech. Although Avastin's price could effectively double for patients who use it to treat breast and lung cancer, the reason is that more of the drug would be needed for those diseases, not because Genentech plans to raise the price per dose.'"

"'06-03-12,'0','JACQUES D'AMBOISE, a former star with the New York City Ballet, chuckled when he recalled the famed collaboration between George Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky.""Balanchine would choreograph something, and Stravinsky would sit there and smirk and look pleased and nod his head,"" he said. ""Then they'd talk furiously together in Russian, and it would be over. The two of them would leave and go have a vodka, or something.""But of the two, Mr. d'Amboise said, Stravinsky was the leader. ""I think if there was one person in the whole world that Balanchine in any way kowtowed to,"" he added, ""it was Stravinsky.""Mr. d'Amboise will take part in a panel, ""Dancing Stravinsky,"" with two City Ballet alumni, Allegra Kent and Arthur Mitchell, in the 12-hour ""Wall to Wall Stravinsky"" program at Symphony Space on Saturday. Although many of the performances will be strictly musical, ""The Soldier's Tale"" will be presented with choreography by Carmen de Lavallade.The program, the 37th event in an annual series of composer retrospectives originated by Isaiah Sheffer, presents Stravinsky's output in sometimes quirky fashion. In another dance element, Elinor Friedberg, a belly dancer who performs as Sharita, will dance the ""Chosen One"" solo from her 1999 production ""Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring' Performed as a Belly Dance.""Ms. Friedberg says people are usually nonplused on hearing about the work.

"'06-03-12,'0','I thought of that because, someday far in the future, I want to live on my savings, and a yield of 7 percent would be helpful, to put it mildly. To arrive at that portfolio, I did what I always do. I called my co-author and dear friend, Phil DeMuth, and asked him to do it.A few days later, I was on a flight from Los Angeles to Miami. My fellow passengers were driving me insane. (A plane is a flying asylum these days.) The man next to me was ripping pages from a magazine, making a horrible sound -- why do people do that? The man in front of me had his seat back as far as it would go, so that his dyed orange hair was in my lap. His wife was yakking across the aisle with an accent hideous enough to make Dracula run for cover.I felt as if I were coming down with pneumonia from my stay in the slush. I had to write some notes on a speech I was to give later. Wow, I thought, am I suffering. Wow, I thought, no one appreciates me. Here I am hard at work on a flying madhouse. My wife is at an Oscar party. Our son is at the new apartment I have just rented for him with the proceeds of my hard work -- and, of course, like all American children, he never thanks Mom and Pop for anything. Then I arrived in Miami and my driver did not know his way around. We got stuck in traffic on Interstate 95. Terrible. I felt beaten down. And then, and then.I got to my hotel, the Breakers, and everything was great. The lobby was beautiful. The room was fabulous. The ocean breeze was heavenly. My bed was firm and warm. I turned on the Oscars and, though they make me want to vomit, I was still happy -- and suddenly, I realized that I had been looking at it all wrong.I was working in Placerville in mud and slush. I was not being worked to death, or lined up in mud and slush and shot like three of my grandfather's cousins were by the Nazis. I was not in the Hürtgen Forest dodging tree bursts from German 88's. I was on a set, maybe getting a little cold.The hotel? Well, even though it lacked instant hot water, I had a warm bed and a view of the freeway. And the rude people on the plane? Well, we were on a plane -- not in a cattle car, not in steerage. And my wife? Let's remember that she puts up with me: Enough said. And my ungrateful son? Hey, he's an American child, that's all, and by definition has no clue of how good he has it. And how different is he from me?I love the Breakers; there is no better hotel. But it occurs to me that all of America is like the Breakers compared with what history has dished up, especially to us Jews. I wish I could get that spirit into my son.When I was in college, in my fabulous fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi, we had an Episcopalian prayer before each meal, and it sums up what I think about what makes you really rich: For the gifts we are about to receive, please Lord, make us truly grateful. Because, to be grateful, as Phil DeMuth says, is to get rich not just quickly, but instantly. For the gift that is my work life in America, dear Lord, please make me truly grateful.Oh, and the news about the hats? Here is Phil's portfolio. We don't vouch for the soundness of these securities. And their yield may fall as events unfold and problems occur, so there are risks. Some, as you can see, are European, so there is currency risk, too. But for now, they have a heck of a yield -- though not as high as the yield of gratitude, which carries no risks.Call it the Stein-DeMuth 7 Percent Solution (well, really, the DeMuth 7 Percent Solution). It's sorted by sector, and includes percentage yields for each stock.UTILITIES -- Peoples Energy, 5.9; Enel of Italy, 8.0; UIL Holdings, 6.0; Telecom New Zealand, 11.3; United Utilities of Britain, 6.8.OTHER -- UST, the tobacco company, 5.5; ConAgra Foods, 5.3; the Deluxe Corporation, the printer of checks and business forms, 6.6; and Allied Capital, the business development firm, 7.7.I do not claim that these yield numbers are immutable, but for now you can have a rockin' good time with them. They might actually make up an average yield above 7 percent. Put the excess into hats.'"
"'06-03-12,'0','SANTIAGO, Chile, March 11 - Michelle Bachelet, a Socialist, pediatrician and former political prisoner and exile, was sworn in on Saturday as the first woman to be president of Chile, the culmination of its long and painful journey from repression and dictatorship to democracy.Ms. Bachelet, 54, was elected to a four-year term in January, winning 53.5 percent of the vote in a runoff. Her accession to power here is also a milestone: though six other women have served as presidents of Latin American countries, Ms. Bachelet, a single mother of three, is the first on the continent to be elected who is not the widow of a political leader and has built a career on her own.Ms. Bachelet is the daughter of an air force general who was jailed for treason and died in prison after Gen. Augusto Pinochet took power in an American-supported coup in 1973. She and her mother were also detained in 1974, and Ms. Bachelet was tortured.In a country where the Roman Catholic Church wields great power, Ms. Bachelet is also openly agnostic, and when she took her oath of office she promised rather than swore to uphold the Chilean Constitution.She also has promised a government that focuses on social equality and respect for human rights. Her immediate priorities, she indicated as a candidate, are a more just distribution of income and reform of the country's pension system, which is increasingly unpopular here.'"
"'06-03-12,'0','Congress authorized only $3.8 billion of the $7.1 billion that Mr. Bush requested for flu preparedness, and nearly 90 percent of it is earmarked for vaccines and the antiviral drug Tamiflu. Buying enough ventilators for a flu outbreak like that of 1918 would cost $18 billion.""We only have a certain amount of money to spend on preparedness,"" said Thomas W. Skinner, a spokesman for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ""We can't invest strictly in respirators.""The federal preparedness plan leaves preparations for medical care up to state and city health officials, but the only government agency that amasses ventilators is the Strategic National Stockpile, created in 1999 by the disease centers to store medicine and equipment for use in a terrorist attack or a disaster. But the agency has only 4,000 to 5,000 ventilators, according to a federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a dispute between government health and security agencies about whether the size of the stockpile ought to be kept secret.There is also a shortage of trained personnel, said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.""Ask any respiratory therapist -- you have to adjust the gases, the pressures,"" he said. ""We don't have enough trained people to maintain them.""In a recent emergency drill, said Dr. John L. Hick, a professor of emergency medicine at the Mayo Medical School in Minnesota, the 27 hospitals in his area could come up with only 16 extra ventilators when faced with a hypothetical outbreak of 400 cases of pneumonic plague.""In a pinch,"" Dr. Hick said, ""you can hand-bag people,"" a procedure in which a fat plastic bellows is squeezed to push air into the lungs. ""But in a pandemic, you're stuck.""Dr. Hick wrote a recent paper for The Journal of Academic Emergency Medicine suggesting guidelines to determine in a crisis which patients should be taken off ventilators and allowed to die.In a national emergency, he said, ""it will come down to some really thin cuts on a scoring system.""""Families are going to be told, 'We have to take your loved one off the ventilator even though, if we could keep him on it for a week, he might be fine,' "" he went on. ""How do you think that's going to go over? It's going to be a nightmare.""Representatives of three of the country's largest hospital chains, HCA, Tenet Healthcare and Triad Hospitals, said they were aware of the potential shortage. ""We're considering the feasibility of acquiring additional ventilators, but I can't say we're even close to making that decision,"" said Jeff Prescott, a spokesman for HCA.Steven Campanini, a spokesman for Tenet, said the company had looked at seven models from $40 to $30,000, but had not made any extra purchases. ""There are split camps about whether or not bird flu will mutate,"" Mr. Campanini said. ""But we recognize the threat and, should the need arise, we'll work with state and local officials to meet it.""Dräger Medical, a German company that is the world's largest maker of hospital ventilators, can double its assembly line capacity in a week, said Mandy Hartman, a vice president for marketing. In a year, that would add ""more than 10,000"" ventilators to the world supply, said Ms. Hartman, who declined to be more specific.In interviews, experts in respiratory medicine and emergency preparedness offered other suggestions for dealing with an emergency, including the use of hand bags by teams of volunteers or family members as was done in New Orleans hospitals during Hurricane Katrina. But hand-bagging is exhausting, and flu patients may need assistance for weeks.""You can do it for maybe 10 minutes before your forearms turn to jelly,"" said Amy Nichols, an infection control specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Think of squeezing a mushy football -- that's the kind of pressure you have to create to fill engorged lungs.""A few hospitals are stockpiling disposable emergency ventilators normally used by paramedics and powered by the pressure of the oxygen tank. Their plastic valves can be set to deliver oxygen at various pressures, and they cost $50 to $100 each. They can run for hours if attached to a large bedside tank, or indefinitely on a hospital's oxygen supply.Mark Nunes, an emergency preparedness consultant to the Washington State Hospitals Association, said hospitals in the state had stockpiled about 1,500 of one brand, Vortran Automatic Resuscitators. But doctors said they required care to operate: too little pressure would not deliver enough oxygen to lungs made inflexible by fluid and mucus, while too much pressure could damage them, increasing the chances of fatal bacterial infections.""They'll keep somebody alive,"" Mr. Nunes said. ""But they need to be monitored. You can't just intubate somebody and walk away.""James Lee, a senior vice president of Vortran Medical Technology, said his company had sold thousands of disposable resuscitators to hospitals worried about blackouts, terrorist attacks, storms and other emergencies.""In a $30,000 I.C.U. ventilator, you're paying for a computer with a lot of alarms,"" Mr. Lee said. ""In a pinch, ours can do pretty much everything you need to do -- but they have to be monitored.""Although they are meant to be used only for minutes or hours, he said, models have worked in tests for two months, ""although, obviously, you wouldn't have someone on for that long,"" he added.Another alternative, said Michael Olesen, an infection control specialist at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis, would be the thousands of home machines used by people with sleep apnea and severe snoring.Those machines, which cost $300 to $600 and are known as C-PAP for continuous positive airway pressure, are not ideal because they do not develop the pressures needed to inflate fluid-filled lungs, nor do they release the pressure to let the lungs empty. (They have been likened to breathing with one's head outside a speeding car.)""It's not normal ventilation,"" he admitted. ""But it helps get oxygen to the lungs.""Not everyone takes alternative plans very seriously.Dr. Hick said he thought most ventilators that lacked alarms and fine-tuned pressure controls would be ""worthless"" for seriously ill patients, and Dr. Rex Archer, chief health officer for Kansas City, Mo., and president of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, laughed a bit contemptuously when told of the backup plans and said: ""Yeah, and maybe we should pull out some of the old iron lungs sitting around in museums.""Correction: March 20, 2006, Monday An article on March 12 about the prospect of a shortage of hospital ventilators in a flu pandemic misidentified a type of home ventilator that one expert said could be used in a crisis. It is a bilevel positive airway pressure machine, or BiPAP, not a continuous positive airway pressure machine.'"
"'06-03-12,'0','But to answer criticism from both parties that Iraq cannot be fixed with another good-news speech, Mr. Bush will also try to confront the realities of the war. ""Amid the daily news of car bombs and kidnappings and brutal killings, I can understand why many of our fellow citizens are now wondering if the entire mission is worth it,"" Mr. Bush said Saturday in his weekly radio address, foreshadowing one of the themes of his Monday speech.As Mr. Bush struggles yet again to change public opinion on Iraq, Republicans say there is no escaping the truth that the White House has careered from crisis to crisis in the second term and that the president has yet to develop a coherent agenda.Every development, they say, including Vice President Dick Cheney's accidental shooting of a fellow hunter and the arrest on Thursday of Mr. Bush's former domestic policy adviser, Claude A. Allen, on theft charges, points to a White House that seems to be losing its once-vaunted discipline and control.The ports deal was a case in point, they said. Even White House officials acknowledged that by the time a delegation of Congressional Republicans told Mr. Bush in the Oval Office on Thursday morning that it was a lost cause, Mr. Bush put up no fight.By midafternoon, after the Dubai company had dropped out of the deal, the president just seemed relieved that the storm was over. In a gathering at the White House, Mr. Bush faked a playful punch at Representative Peter T. King, the New York Republican who led opposition to the deal, then pinched Mr. King's cheek.But if the president was determined to project cheer about cutting his losses, the uproar over the ports has set off bleak assessments from both parties in Washington that the White House has lost its focus, energy and political touch.""With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight they should have known it would create a storm,"" said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, speaking of the ports deal, which he had supported.It was only the latest crisis to hit Mr. Bush in a second term that has been dominated by problems in Iraq, Hurricane Katrina, a C.I.A. leak investigation, a secret eavesdropping program and the failure of the president to push forward the centerpiece of his domestic agenda, an overhaul of Social Security.But the Dubai deal exposed as never before the limits of Republican loyalty to a weakened Mr. Bush, whose record low approval ratings, 34 percent in a CBS poll conducted in February, have pushed members of his own party to declare that the White House can no longer call all the shots. By the end of the week, the ports deal had brought to a boiling point years of anger on Capitol Hill about a White House seen as imperious and dismissive of real consultation with Congress.""They have a transmitter but not a listening device,"" said one well-known Republican with close ties to the administration who gets calls from White House staff members. ""They'll say, 'What are you hearing, what's going on?' You tell them things aren't good on the Hill, you've got problems here, you've got problems there, or 'I was in Detroit and boy did I get an earful.' And their answer is, 'Everybody's just reading the headlines, we've got to get our message out better.' There's denial going on, and it starts at the top.""The bottom line, Republicans say, is that the war continues to overshadow the domestic agenda that Mr. Bush put forth in January in a State of the Union address that was supposed to reinvigorate his presidency.""Roughly one out of three people say that the country is on the wrong track, and the reason they give is the Iraq war,"" said Bill McInturff, a leading Republican pollster. ""How will that situation be changed unless Iraq is resolved in the next few months? So the White House can do all the good things they're doing with renewable energy and health care and all their other initiatives, but that doesn't move that chunk of people with very hardened attitudes.""At the White House, senior aides say they are well aware of such polls and of widespread Republican complaints about the isolation of an administration now in its sixth difficult year. ""There's an acute situational awareness of the criticism being leveled at the staff,"" said Nicolle Wallace, the White House communications director.At this point, Republicans close to the White House say, Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, has no plans to step down and in fact is only seven months away from beating Sherman Adams's record under President Dwight D. Eisenhower as the longest-serving chief of staff in history.At the same time, the legal status of Karl Rove, the deputy chief of staff and Mr. Bush's senior political adviser, is in limbo. He is still under investigation in the C.I.A. leak case, although his lawyer expresses confidence that Mr. Rove will be cleared.But the uncertainty surrounding such a crucial member of Mr. Bush's inner circle has fed perceptions that a once politically agile White House is off its game. Republicans say that the port security case in particular has become a case study in how this White House has been slow to react to the unexpected, and how its early warning radar is off.""It's always the same story,"" said an administration official who no longer works in the White House but who would evaluate its problems only on the condition of anonymity. ""They have a plan -- an elaborate plan of the president's message, day by day. But there's something in the system that has a hard time coping with the unexpected,"" the official said, citing Hurricane Katrina, the dispute over Harriet E. Miers's nomination to the Supreme Court, and now the port issue.Mr. Bush's first public comments on the matter -- a defiant veto threat issued to reporters in an unusual briefing on Air Force One, then repeated on the South Lawn of the White House -- antagonized Congress. The White House did not warn House or Senate Republican leaders that the veto threat was coming, aides in both chambers said, and the president's words immediately thrust the dispute into the context of a political battle, with the Republicans on the losing side.What Mr. Bush should have done, Mr. McCain said, was ""get Colin Powell and General Abizaid and Tommy Franks to come out and make public statements about why this is vital.""Although the president had committed himself to supporting the deal, the White House evidently did little to save it. Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who led the effort to keep the acquisition intact, said he had almost no contact with the White House about the matter until Thursday morning.Mr. Warner said he had sought to enlist the administration in creating an alternative structure for the deal that might mollify Congress. ""I was trying to determine if the company came forward with a proposal, would the White House be able to take a look at it and review it?"" Mr. Warner said.Asked if he was surprised that the White House had not worked with the company to defend or restructure the deal, Mr. Warner said, ""I don't get surprised by anything anymore.""'"

"'06-03-12,'0','The 411 West End building opened in 1936, the same year that Wallenstein completed 19 East 88th Street, in a completely different vocabulary and designed by William Dowling. The Times said that both 411 West End and 19 East 88th were ""hailed by builders and realty interests as an omen of recovery.""The Wallenstein project at 88th and Madison had interiors similar to those at 411 West End Avenue -- advertisements for both boasted air-conditioner electrical outlets -- but it also had a noticeably different take on Art Deco.Unlike 411 West End, which is purely vertical, the 88th Street building is an unresolved 16-story battle. Horizontal forms of dark- and light-brick bands tussle with the centrally placed vertical bays of windows.But there is more to look at here than 411's single trick in stainless steel. At 19 East 88th Street, the horizontal terrace grilles on the topmost floors race around the balconies like zipper lights, their curved corners suggesting streamlined ocean liner design. There are several patches of patterned brick, like the huge sawtooth-pattern panels near the top.And, in the rear, there are two flying buttresses, which are not used for the sake of the structure -- as in supporting the sidewalls of a medieval cathedral -- but to enclose vent or plumbing chases as they go up the outside wall and jump in midair across two terraced setbacks.In the morning light, passers-by standing at 89th and Madison can enjoy not only the treat of looking through the arches of these streamlined buttresses but, in the distance, also see the peculiar sculpted head on the top of 2 East 88th Street. Just as good as a croissant and coffee!Wallenstein's advertisement in The Times called 19 East 88th a ""town residence for a selected tenancy."" And the architecture critic Carter Horsley called it ""one of the city's Art Deco masterpieces"" in ""The Upper East Side Book,"" posted at www.thecityreview.com/home.html.Over the years, these two siblings, built as rental apartments, have aged differently.The facade of the Pelham-designed apartment house at 411 West End Avenue looks fairly clean, perhaps because of the scouring winds along Riverside Drive. All of its metal casement windows have been replaced by modern ones meant to evoke, although not match, the originals. This effort is quite presentable, but the aluminum of modern replacements lacks the spiky sharpness of steel. On the other hand, the co-op specified a creamy vanilla color, sympathetic to the softly colored brickwork.At 19 East 88th Street, most of the casement windows are intact. Julian Berkeley, the managing agent, said that although the co-op has suggested replacements, ""people just love those windows"" and most have kept them.The Landmarks Preservation Commission's Carnegie Hill Historic District of 1993 excludes 19 East 88th Street, but includes many other apartment houses in the area. Indeed the bulk of the district's Fifth Avenue frontage is made up of apartment houses. The district map shows a distinct notch omitting 19 East 88th.The building at 19 East 88th Street is now undergoing major repairs to its facade, and workers, with rigging and ladders all over the building, lend a certain interest, like Navy crews repairing a battle-damaged aircraft carrier.In this case, landmark designation would have brought some benefits, at least for passers-by, because in several previous repair campaigns many of the joints have been pointed with bright white mortar, and some brick patches are way off in color.Both 411 West End and 19 East 88th come from a brief period in New York architecture, a blip on the otherwise nearly flat-line graph of the 1930's. Construction did revive somewhat later in the 1930's, but by then the Art Deco looked as old fashioned as a dial telephone does now.The next project on which Dowling and Wallenstein collaborated was another apartment house, at 25 West 54th Street, which was completed in 1939. Like its precursors, it uses cream-colored brick, but there are no stainless steel strips, no sawtooth brick, no flying buttresses -- it is just a plain-vanilla box.'"

"'06-03-12,'0','In a small office overlooking the Ritz, Jean-Claude Colban sits at his desk for hours on end, selecting various shades of purple and pink, examining endless bolts of cloth and living with his shirt and tie designs as a vintner lives with his grapes. Monsieur Colban is the co-president of Charvet, his family's company, which is to men's style what Château Latour is to fine wine.Colban is an erudite man of the old school, well versed in politics and the arts, finance and business, history and food. He speaks of Proust with great warmth (""Oh, indeed! Swann wears a Charvet tie""). He speaks of the competition with polite disdain (""We cannot ask people in the morning to work slow and then to work fast in the afternoon""). And he speaks of the new generation of ""super, super, super-trendies"" who have discovered the pleasure of ordering made-to-measure shirts because ""custom is ideal for the new, narrower suits where the fit of the shirt is key.""But Colban is above all a haberdasher. He knows about cut: how the torso lies when the sleeve moves. He knows the importance of detail: the pearly cuff link, the dimpled knot, the collar stay. And he knows about color: the proper complement of tie and pocket square is his stock in trade.This appreciation of subtle detail has been in the company's genes since 1838, when Christophe Charvet began making shirts for aristocratic members of the Paris Jockey Club. Like all shirtmakers in those days, Christophe toted his fine wares to clients' hôtels particuliers because gentlemen's shops did not yet exist in the capital. But Christophe, whose father looked after the wardrobe of Napoleon I, had amassed too many fine linens for one horse cart and decided to open a store on the Rue de Richelieu.Christophe's son Edouard had his own flair for innovation and moved the shop to Place Vendôme, the city's most fashionable address. Albert, Prince of Wales, became a client, as did just about every foppish blue blood in Europe. After World War I, Charvet introduced fine cottons that could be woven into the beautifully colored stripes that remain a signature of the venerable house. Denis Colban, Jean-Claude's father, saved Charvet from an American takeover in 1966 on a tip from de Gaulle; the prominent textile executive could not bear the idea that Le General's shirtmaker would leave French hands, so he bought it himself.Denis extended the company's offerings to women and established the business of finely made off-the-peg shirts in addition to bespoke. He also decided to pile some 6,000 varieties of poplin, piqué and twill in full view of the customer, where they remain. And there the innovation stops: the Charvet shirts you order today are created with the same handmade care once given the Duke of Windsor, John F. Kennedy and de Gaulle.'"

Huber says from inside the refrigerator. ""Higher than yours and mine put together.""She replays that unforgiving footage, Win seeing her. . .handing her his jacket, telling her to take deep breaths.

Huber laughs. ""Now that for sure ticked him off.""""Another one of your impulsive, high-risk decisions.""He didn't ask her, just did it. Then he told her after the fact because the more she knows, the more implicated she is, that's been his strategy all along.""It did exactly what I said it would."" Huber drinks his beer. ""You threaten him, insult him, try to scare him off a case, and he locks his jaws on it like a pit bull.""She is silent, sips her martini, trapped.She says: ""It wasn't necessary. He's a pit bull anyway.""""Your fault for insisting on talking to him in person instead of over the phone. You should have left him down there in Knoxville."" He pauses, his face twitching.

They look at her, flat, nothing in them.It is dark now, the moon new.Win opens the driver's door of Nana's old Buick, stopped in the middle of the road again, watching Miss Dog wandering aimlessly again, headlights flashing in her old blind eyes.""That's it. The end,"" Win says, furious. ""Come here, girl,"" he coaxes, whistling. ""Come on, Miss Dog. Whatcha doing on the street again, huh? She forget to shut the door? Let you out, too lazy to make sure you got back in? Her son-in-law lowlife kick you again?""Miss Dog's tail droops, her head hangs. She drops to her belly as if she's done something wrong. Win gently picks her up, keeps talking, wonders if she can hear him at all, places her inside the car, drives off, tells her where she's going and what will happen next. Maybe she hears him, maybe she doesn't. She licks his hand. He parks behind Nana's house, and the wind chimes are chiming softly, the night clear, the cool air barely stirring, the chimes quietly chiming as if telling secrets, and he unlocks the back door, Miss Dog draped over his shoulder like a furry sack of potatoes.He follows the sound of the TV.""Nana? We have a new addition to the family.""Sykes has been on the phone for over an hour, getting bounced from one old-timer to the next. Twenty-three years ago is forever. So far no one at the Asheville Police Department remembers Detective Mark Holland.She dials another number as she drives west toward Knoxville, approaching headlights confusing her, reminding her what a rip-off it is to get old. She can't see worth a hoot anymore, can't read a menu without glasses, her night vision awful. Damn airlines. Damn delays and cancellations. The only rental car left one with four cylinders, got the pep of a sea cow.""I'm trying to reach Detective Jones,"" she tells the man who answers the phone.""Been quite awhile since I was called that,"" the voice says pleasantly. ""And who's this?""She introduces herself, says, ""As I understand it, sir, you were a detective with the Asheville P.D. back in the 80's, and I'm wondering if you might remember another detective named Mark Holland.""""Not well, because he'd only been a detective a couple of months when he got killed.""""What do you remember about that?""""Only he'd gone to Charlotte supposedly to interview some witness in a robbery case. You want to know my opinion, he wasn't no accident. I think he just didn't want to take his own life in a place where one of us would've had to work his case.""""You have any idea why he might have wanted to take his own life?""""The way I heard it, his wife was cheating on him,"" he says.Nana is asleep on the couch, in her long black robe, her long white hair loose and splayed over the cushion, Clint Eastwood on the TV, making somebody's day with his big, bad gun.Win sets down Miss Dog, and she instantly puts her head in Nana's lap, animals always reacting to her like that. She opens her eyes, looks at Win, holds out her hands to him.""My darling."" She kisses his face.""You didn't have your alarm on again. So I have no choice but to give you a guard dog. This is Miss Dog.""""Welcome my friend, Miss Dog."" She pets her, gently pulls on her ears. ""Don't you worry, Miss Dog. She won't find you here. That nasty woman, I can see her plain as day, could use a few teeth, couldn't she?"" petting Miss Dog. ""Don't you worry, my little one,"" Nana says indignantly. ""I have ways of taking care of people like her.""If you want to incur Nana's wrath, treat an animal badly, incite her to go out on one of her mysterious missions late at night, flinging 999 pennies in a bad person's yard, a payment to the old-crone goddess Hecate, who knows how to take care of cruel people.""Her hips are hurting,"" she says. ""Arthritis. Gum problems, pain. Depressed. She yells at her a lot, that big, unhappy woman, not a nice person, treats her the same way she treats herself. Terrible. Poor baby,"" petting her as she snores. ""I know all about it,"" she then says to Win. ""It's all over TV, but you're all right."" She takes his hand. ""You remember that time your father beat up that man who lived three streets over?"" She points. ""He had no choice.""Win isn't sure he knows what she's talking about, nothing new. Her world isn't always obvious or logical.""You were 4, and this man's son -- he was 8 -- shoved you to the ground and started kicking you, calling you awful names, calling your father awful names, racist names, and oh, when your father found out, he went to their house, and that was that.""""Not your father. But he ended it. It happens. And you're all right. If you go back and look around, you'll find a knife.""""No, Nana. It was a gun.""""There's a knife. You know, the kind with a handle that's got a thing."" She draws in the air, maybe she means a knife with a guard, like a dagger. ""You look. The one you killed, and you mustn't blame yourself for that. He was very bad, but there's another one. He's worse. Evil. I tried the honey on a muffin this morning. Tennessee is a pure place with lots of good people, not necessarily good politics, but good people. The bees don't care about politics, so they like it there, are joyful making their honey.""Win laughs, gets up. ""I think I'm going to head down to North Carolina, Nana.""""Not yet. You have unfinished business here.""""Will you please set the burglar alarm?""""I have my wind chimes. And Miss Dog,"" she says. ""Tonight the moon is aligned with Venus, has entered Scorpio. Misconceptions abound, my darling. Your perceptions are veiled, but that's all about to change. Go back to her house, and you'll find what I'm talking about and something else.""

"'06-03-12,'0','When the British actor Daniel Craig -- rough, tough and blond! -- was selected to channel the myth of James Bond, there were howls of complaint, as there have been ever since Sean Connery took off his Rolex Submariner watch, drank the last sip of his vodka martini (shaken, not stirred) and handed over the secret-service gizmos to his successors.Bonds have come and gone, yet none have quite captured the laconic, ironic, world-weary glamour that was Connery's interpretation of Ian Fleming's hero. Since then, the agent assigned to chase the evil successors to Mister Big and Pussy Galore has been wooed by so many product-placement sponsors that Bond is a different man. He has changed his early-60's, two-button navy suits (to the Italian elegance of Brioni) and his car, from a classic Bentley to a zippy Aston Martin DB 111 that's morphed into a fighting machine with automobile attached.Fleming himself had early doubts that Connery, the son of a working-class Scottish family, would cut a classy enough figure. And look how that worked out. Craig's edgy, wolfish common touch should be fine in the ""Casino Royale"" remake. (After all, he briefly ensnared Kate Moss, who'd make a suitably kissable Bond girl, ripe for the killing.)In fact, the screen choices over the years have had an uncanny way of reflecting the social shifts of their times. Even if you don't see Pierce Brosnan as an early metrosexual or Roger Moore as a bit of 70's camp, Connery perfectly caught the spirit of the early 1960's, when the snobbish British establishment was opening up. While the literary James Bond was an accurate reflection of the era of the matinee idol -- tall, dark and handsome, like Cary Grant -- Connery's whiff of the outsider was precisely in tune with the Beatles. He was psychologically linked to a London in which the lower-class photographer David Bailey mingled with the aristocratic Lord Lichfield and in which Michael Caine became a cocky, cockney antihero.Current men's wear is fascinated by that era. If the new Bond movie were to go back to a 60's look, there's a plethora of slim two-buttoned suits, blazers and sleek tuxedos, all with high armholes and flat-front pants, that draw inspiration from a time when a sneakered foot never set foot in a casino and a knitted silk tie was more likely to be stained with caviar than crudo.'"
"'06-03-12,'0','While Broadway shows routinely turn to corporate America for financial backing, producers at smaller theaters still hustle around the city trying to persuade local businesses to take out advertisements in their playbills.Lately, though, some smaller productions have found unlikely angels who see more to gain than a few pre- or postshow dinner reservations.""Infertility: The Musical That's Hard to Conceive,"" which recently closed at Dillon's, was sponsored by Serono, a biotechnology company that has developed several fertility medications. Chris Neuner, the writer and one half of the producing team, said that while there were other backers, including ""a pig farmer, a dairy farmer and a psychic"" from his home state of Wisconsin, the company provided the final infusion of cash.Serono became involved after Mr. Neuner and his co-producer, Kathryn Frawley, invited several companies to a reading last June. A Serono representative thought a sponsorship might help raise awareness and, of course, promote the company. Indeed, Serono was prominent in the show's marketing materials and program. ""We were happy to support a fun, creative effort to get more people talking openly about infertility,"" Bharat Tewarie, the executive vice president of reproductive health for Serono, said in an e-mail message.In a similar fashion, Mark St. Germain's ""God Committee,"" opening March 29 at the Lamb's Theater, is being supported by the New York Organ Donor Network. It makes sense: the show dramatizes the decisions of a hospital transplant committee.'"
"'06-03-12,'0','AT one time or another, most serious artists fantasize about what they would put on display if they were in charge of a museum -- the aesthete's version of Dr. Seuss' ""If I Ran the Zoo.""Leave it to William Wegman, best known for dressing up and photographing his Weimaraner dogs, to have a surreal take on this idea: ""Museum,"" a 2005 oil painting included in ""Funney/Strange"" a big retrospective of his career that opened on Friday at the Brooklyn Museum. (The title springs from a drawing in the show.)The work, measuring five feet by seven feet, includes some two dozen stuck-on postcards that Mr. Wegman has collected or been given over the years. Mainly featuring artworks -- a Rauschenberg combine, a Victorian greeting card -- they are combined into a sprawling fantasy gallery.Long before his dog fame, Mr. Wegman was an early adopter of Conceptual art in the 1960's, and he sees ""Museum"" as a challenging intellectual exercise. ""It's like a doll house cutaway,"" the artist, now 62, said recently at his studio in Chelsea.Mr. Wegman said he had no personal connection to the works: most of his energy went into figuring out the complex architecture of the museum, whose attic could have been designed by M. C. Escher. ""I'm very detached when I work with things,"" he said. ""They're not my favorite paintings, they just happen to work for some reason.""'"

By contrast, Wikipedia is built with unending scrutiny and ceaseless editing.He predicts that in the future, it will be Britannica's process that will seem strange: ""People will say, 'This was written by one person? Then looked at by only two or three other people? How can I trust that process?' ""The Wikipedian hive is capable of impressive feats. The English-language collection recently added its millionth article, for example. It was about the Jordanhill railway station, in Glasgow.

But the hive descended and in a week, more than 640 edits were logged.If every topic could be addressed like this, without recourse to specialized learning -- and without the heated disputes called flame wars -- the anonymous hive could be trusted to produce work of high quality.

Congressional staff members have been unmasked burnishing articles about their employers and vandalizing those of political rivals.

He also deserves accolades for keeping Wikipedia operating without the intrusion of advertising, at least so far.Most winningly, he has overseen a system that is gleefully candid in its public self-examination. If you're seeking a well-organized list of criticisms of Wikipedia, you won't find a better place than Wikipedia's coverage of itself. Wikipedia also provides a taxonomy of no fewer than 23 different forms of vandalism that strike it.It is easy to forget how quickly Wikipedia has grown; it began only in 2001. With the passage of a little more time, Mr. Wales and his associates may come around to the idea that identifying one person as a given article's supervising editor would enhance the encyclopedia's reputation.Mr. Wales has already responded to recent negative articles about vandalism at the site with announcements of modest reforms. Anonymous visitors are no longer permitted to create pages, though they still may edit existing ones.To curb what Mr. Wales calls ""drive-by pranks"" that are concentrated on particular articles, he has instituted a policy of ""semi-protection."" In these cases, a user must have registered at least four days before being permitted to make changes to the protected article. ""If someone really wants to write 'George Bush is a poopy head,' you've got to wait four days,"" he said.When asked what problems on the site he viewed as most pressing, Mr. Wales said he was concerned with passing along the Wikipedian culture to newcomers. He sounded wistful when he spoke of the days not so long ago when he could visit an article that was the subject of a flame war and would know at least some participants -- and whether they could resolve the dispute tactfully.As the project has grown, he has found that he no longer necessarily knows anyone in a group. When a dispute flared recently over an article related to a new dog breed, he looked at the discussion and asked himself in frustration, ""Who are these people?""Isn't this precisely the question all users are bound to ask about contributors?By wide agreement, the print encyclopedia in the English world reached its apogee in 1911, with the completion of Encyclopaedia Britannica's 11th edition. (For the fullest tribute, turn to Wikipedia.) But the Wikipedia experiment need not be pushed back in time toward that model. It need only be pushed forward, so it can catch up to others with more experience in online collaboration: the open-source software movement.Wikipedia and open-source projects like Linux are similarly noncommercial, intellectual enterprises, mobilizing volunteers who will probably never meet one another in person. But even though Wikipedians like to position their project under the open-source umbrella, the differences are wide.Jeff Bates, a vice president of the Open Source Technology Group who oversees SourceForge.net, the host of more than 80,000 active open-source projects, said, ""It makes me grind my teeth to hear Wikipedia compared to open source."" In every open-source project, he said, there is ""a benevolent dictator"" who ultimately takes responsibility, even though the code is contributed by many. Good stuff results only if ""someone puts their name on it.""WIKIPEDIA has good stuff, too. These have been designated ""featured articles."" But it will be a long while before all one-million-and-counting entries have been carefully double-checked and buffed to a high shine. Only 923 have been granted ""featured"" status, and the consensus-building process is presently capable of adding only about one a day.Mr. Wales is not happy with this pace and seems open to looking again at the open-source software model for ideas. Software development that relies on scattered volunteers is a two-step process: first, a liberal policy encourages the contributions of many, then a restrictive policy follows to stabilize the code in preparation for release. Wikipedia, he said, has ""half the model.""There's no question that Wikipedia volunteers can address many more topics than the lumbering, for-profit incumbents like Britannica and World Book, and can update entries swiftly. Still, anonymity blocks credibility. One thing that Wikipedians have exactly right is that the current form of the encyclopedia is a beta test. The quality level that would permit speaking of Version 1.0 is still in the future.DIGITAL DOMAIN Randall Stross is a historian and author based in Silicon Valley. E-mail: ddomain@nytimes.com.'"

Anonymous visitors are no longer permitted to create pages, though they still may edit existing ones.To curb what Mr. Wales calls ""drive-by pranks"" that are concentrated on particular articles, he has instituted a policy of ""semi-protection."" In these cases, a user must have registered at least four days before being permitted to make changes to the protected article. ""If someone really wants to write 'George Bush is a poopy head,' you've got to wait four days,"" he said.When asked what problems on the site he viewed as most pressing, Mr. Wales said he was concerned with passing along the Wikipedian culture to newcomers. He sounded wistful when he spoke of the days not so long ago when he could visit an article that was the subject of a flame war and would know at least some participants -- and whether they could resolve the dispute tactfully.As the project has grown, he has found that he no longer necessarily knows anyone in a group. When a dispute flared recently over an article related to a new dog breed, he looked at the discussion and asked himself in frustration, ""Who are these people?""Isn't this precisely the question all users are bound to ask about contributors?By wide agreement, the print encyclopedia in the English world reached its apogee in 1911, with the completion of Encyclopaedia Britannica's 11th edition. (For the fullest tribute, turn to Wikipedia.) But the Wikipedia experiment need not be pushed back in time toward that model. It need only be pushed forward, so it can catch up to others with more experience in online collaboration: the open-source software movement.Wikipedia and open-source projects like Linux are similarly noncommercial, intellectual enterprises, mobilizing volunteers who will probably never meet one another in person. But even though Wikipedians like to position their project under the open-source umbrella, the differences are wide.Jeff Bates, a vice president of the Open Source Technology Group who oversees SourceForge.net, the host of more than 80,000 active open-source projects, said, ""It makes me grind my teeth to hear Wikipedia compared to open source."" In every open-source project, he said, there is ""a benevolent dictator"" who ultimately takes responsibility, even though the code is contributed by many. Good stuff results only if ""someone puts their name on it.""WIKIPEDIA has good stuff, too. These have been designated ""featured articles."" But it will be a long while before all one-million-and-counting entries have been carefully double-checked and buffed to a high shine. Only 923 have been granted ""featured"" status, and the consensus-building process is presently capable of adding only about one a day.Mr. Wales is not happy with this pace and seems open to looking again at the open-source software model for ideas. Software development that relies on scattered volunteers is a two-step process: first, a liberal policy encourages the contributions of many, then a restrictive policy follows to stabilize the code in preparation for release. Wikipedia, he said, has ""half the model.""There's no question that Wikipedia volunteers can address many more topics than the lumbering, for-profit incumbents like Britannica and World Book, and can update entries swiftly. Still, anonymity blocks credibility. One thing that Wikipedians have exactly right is that the current form of the encyclopedia is a beta test. The quality level that would permit speaking of Version 1.0 is still in the future.DIGITAL DOMAIN Randall Stross is a historian and author based in Silicon Valley. E-mail: ddomain@nytimes.com.'"

"'06-03-13,'1','A German drug and chemical company, Merck KGaA, plans to make a 14.9 billion euro ($17.7 billion) hostile bid today for a German rival, Schering A.G., the target company said yesterday. Schering, the world's largest maker of oral contraceptives, said it intended to reject the unsolicited offer.The two companies are not affiliated with Merck and Schering-Plough, both of the United States.Schering said Merck KGaA -- which is controlled by the Merck family -- planned to offer 77 euros a share. It added that the offer ""significantly undervalues Schering and its prospects as an independent specialized pharmaceutical company,"" and that no negotiations were under way.Schering said it had been informed by Merck officials over the weekend that they intended to make their formal offer today. Merck did not return calls seeking comment.Midsize pharmaceutical companies have been consolidating in recent years, and Schering is considered an attractive target. In February, it reported an increase in 2005 earnings and a 17 percent jump in net income in the fourth quarter, to 139 million euros ($166 million). The company, which also makes drugs to treat cancer and multiple sclerosis, attributed the profit increase to higher sales of contraceptive and multiple sclerosis products.The German Merck produces the cancer drug Erbitux as well as generic drugs, chemicals like paint pigments and liquid-crystal displays used in television. Its full-year profit for 2005 was almost even with that the year before, at about $800 million.'"
"'06-03-13,'1','Bridge is a game of mistakes. Everyone makes them, even the best players. But part of the art of being a winner is to take advantage when an opponent errs. Cezary Balicki, a world champion from Poland, did exactly that on the diagramed deal, which occurred during the Hilton Head Regional last month.Balicki's teammates were Carolyn Lynch of Scottsdale, Ariz.; Curtis Cheek of Huntsville, Ala.; Dennis Dawson of Santa Fe, N.M.; Joe Grue of New York; and Adam Zmudzinski from Poland.At the other table, Lynch opened the South hand with three hearts, and Dawson responded three no-trump. He won East's spade lead with his nine and played a diamond to the queen, which East ducked. Now came the club jack from South (the dummy), and West made a fatal error by not covering. After the club jack held, North played a club to his queen, and drove out the diamond ace. His nine tricks were two spades, four diamonds and three clubs.Balicki and Zmudzinski were defending against three hearts. To defeat the contract for sure, West must lead a spade, but Zmudzinski selected a low club, which ran to declarer's jack. South does best to lead the diamond queen, establishing discards for his spade losers. But declarer, hoping to avoid losing a diamond trick, played a club to dummy's queen and called for the club ace.Against many defenders this would have worked. If East ruffs low, declarer overruffs and can either play on trumps or knock out the diamond ace. Balicki, though, ruffed with the heart ace. After declarer pitched his diamond queen, East continued with a low trump, West winning with his jack and shifting to a spade. A finesse of dummy's spade nine lost to East's jack. East played another heart, West taking the trick and leading a second spade. In this way, the defenders took two spades and three hearts for down one.The Lynch team had gained 10 international match points en route to victory in the match.Does the name Lynch ring a closing bell? Carolyn is the wife of Peter Lynch, the former Magellan Fund manager and now a vice chairman of Fidelity. But Carolyn is making a name for herself at the bridge table. In Hilton Head she won 117 master points in three and a half days. She would have won more, but she had to leave after the early arrival of a grandchild.'"

That's all right. I get in there, I do what I can, and hopefully somebody takes notice.""The Mets took notice in 2004, acquiring Keppinger from Pittsburgh in the Kris Benson trade. Keppinger has hit better than .300 in every minor league season except his first, and .284 in a brief stint with the Mets in 2004.Last June 15, he was batting .337 for Class AAA Norfolk and leading the International League with 86 hits when Charlotte's Felix Martinez jammed his cleats into Keppinger's leg on a slide into second, ending Keppinger's season.The timing was awful. Six days later, Matsui went on the disabled list with a bruised left knee.On Sunday, Keppinger was 1 for 3 with a double after replacing an ill Chris Woodward at third base in a 3-2, 10-inning loss to the Orioles. That put his spring average at .316.Still, he cannot seem to make any headway. While still with the Pirates, Keppinger said he once asked a coach why his minor league hitting did not impress people.""He said when it came down to it, I'm not a scout's guy,"" he said.Right now, he does not appear to be Randolph's, either.Pedro Martínez said Sunday that his right shoulder and his big toe felt fine the day after an 83-pitch bullpen session, and he expected to throw again Tuesday, possibly batting practice. He still would not say whether he would make his opening day start. ""I'll let the day dictate,"" he said. ... Kris Benson said he and his wife, Anna, had no hard feelings against the Mets for trading him to Baltimore this winter. ""I enjoyed my time in New York,"" he said. ""There's nothing negative I can say about it."" He said he thought Mets could contend for a championship. ""I think they're going to be great,"" he said. ... Steve Trachsel pitched four scoreless innings in Sunday's loss to Baltimore.

"'06-03-14,'1','For years, many parents have viewed infant walkers, the wheeled contraptions that let youngsters zip around the home before they can walk, as a great way to occupy their children. But they kept a lot of emergency room doctors busy, too.Now a new study finds that safety improvements made to the walkers over the past decade and increased use of stationary play centers have reduced the number of injuries. The study, by Brenda J. Shields and Dr. Gary A. Smith of Columbus Children's Hospital in Ohio, appears currently in Pediatrics.For years, Dr. Smith said, pediatricians warned parents not to use walkers. But for child and adult, they were liberating, letting the youngster amuse himself while the parents got things done. ""They didn't understand that they could cover four feet per second across the floor,"" Dr. Smith said.For thousands of children a year, that journey ended with a fall down stairs, the study said. From 1990 to 1994, an average of 23,000 walker-related injuries occurred each year, most involving stairs and head injuries.In 1997, however, the walker industry voluntarily adopted new safety standards. The devices were widened to 36 inches or greater, so that they could not get through most doors, and a brake was added to stop them if one wheel left the floor. The changes helped contribute to a decline in injuries of about 75 percent, the study found.Even so, the researchers said they agreed with the position of the American Academy of Pediatrics that walkers should be banned. They serve no useful purpose, they said, despite the belief of some parents that they teach walking earlier. (They may actually delay motor skill development, the study said.) And they still lead to injuries, as when an infant uses them to reach a stove or other dangerous object.'"

"'06-03-14,'1','""It is a system that seems designed to pit school districts against each other in a 'sky's the limit' contest to recruit and retain top personnel,"" investigators wrote in their 71-page report. ""All too often, the result is an unseemly spectacle reminiscent of sports teams and their competition for free-agent athletes -- with the cost, of course, underwritten not by fans and corporate sponsors, but by taxpayers.""The report, whose findings were drawn from payroll and other records from a sampling of 71 of the state's 616 school districts, said lax enforcement of pension guidelines and poor oversight of local school boards had cost New Jersey residents millions of dollars in unjustified expenses.The state provides about $7.7 billion in taxpayer money each year to help pay for public education. About $20 billion of the roughly $34 billion collected through property taxes each year is also used for schools.The report suggested that state officials take measures to ensure that expenditures by school districts are reasonable and appropriate and that citizens are adequately informed about how their money is spent.Those who advocate property tax reform could not agree more. ""It smells like corruption,"" said Bill Brown, a resident of Glen Rock and a member of the New Jersey Coalition for Property Tax Reform when told of investigators' findings. ""Far too much is spent on administration and to cut these excesses in administration would probably mean savings to taxpayers or produce more money to spend on students needs.""Through a spokesman, Gov. Jon S. Corzine promised a thorough review of the report and its recommendation that school boards and pensions be held to greater oversight.""This report raises significant and troubling issues of systemic abuse that occurred before Governor Corzine took office,"" said Anthony Coley, Mr. Corzine's press secretary. ""The administration will analyze these findings thoroughly and will work with the appropriate authorities to ensure that public dollars are spent appropriately and wisely.""The leader of a state group of school administrators argued that the compensation packages simply reflected the market value of the state's best school leaders.""In response to an argument that they are overpaid, I can only say that they are paid at the level the local board believes they should be compensated,"" said Barry J. Galasso, executive director of the New Jersey Association of School Administrators.He said the market for school officials was driven by several factors, including the vacancy rate -- there are now as many as 50 superintendent openings around the state, he estimated -- and the removal of a tenure provision in state law in 1991 that allowed administrators to shop themselves around more freely.""The bottom line is that superintendents didn't have this kind of mobility"" until the early 1990's, Dr. Galasso said.Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, said the report offered a stark look at how at how salaries and benefits had grown in the years since the tenure provision was removed. He suggested that a limit on compensation by the State Legislature, was in order.Investigators found that from 1997 to 2004, the average salary paid to top administrators rose by 31 percent, more than twice the increase in the average teacher's salary -- 14 percent -- over the same period.The reported cited the compensation package of John Greico, the superintendent of the 25,000-student Bergen County vocational school district, who received $580,000 for unused sick time and vacation from 1999 until his death in 2004. Mr. Greico's estate was paid $327,881 from a tax-deferred annuity after he died.There was also the compensation given to Thomas C. McMahon, superintendent of the Barnegat Township School District, which serves about 2,200 students in five schools.According to investigators, Dr. McMahon's base salary was $166,228. In that same year, he was given nearly $100,000 in additional compensation, including about $43,000 for work as the district's business administrator, more than $15,000 for cashing in unused leave and an $8,000 payment to a tax-deferred annuity.""It's a demanding job, 24 hours a days, seven days a week,"" Dr. McMahon said in an interview Monday when asked about his earnings. ""It raises the question: 'What's education worth?' ""Dr. McMahon, who said he also favored a compensation limit, deflected the suggestion that his school board had tried to hide the size of his compensation package. ""My salary is published every year on the front page of The Asbury Park Press,"" he said.'"

"'06-03-14,'1','There are some legitimate fears about letting Wal-Mart into the banking business. For much of the 20th century, the federal government didn't allow banking to mix with other forms of commerce, and this prohibition may well have contributed to American economic stability.But the prohibition doesn't exist anymore. Given that, I think there is more to gain from a Wal-Mart bank than there is to lose. To understand why, it helps to review some of the history.At the heart of the Wal-Mart fight is a 50-year-old law that separated banking from other kinds of business. In the 1950's, banking was still a highly local business. So a company that owned a bank could potentially block its rivals from getting a loan. If a five-and-dime owned the only bank in town, it might be able to drive other stores out of business.In 1999, however, Congress amended the 1956 law, which has been known as the Bank Holding Company Act. Banking was no longer a local business, and the fears about concentrated bank power seemed outdated. The economy is awash in credit today, as you have probably noticed from your mail. If that five-and-dime - or its modern equivalent, Wal-Mart - denied a loan to a rival, the rival would be able to get a loan elsewhere.But Congress did not go all the way in 1999. It allowed only other financial-service companies - some of the most generous campaign donors, it should be noted - to own banks. In fact, the same law that rolled back the 1956 law also retroactively barred Wal-Mart from buying an Oklahoma bank.'"
"'06-03-14,'1','This 30-second spot for Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for governor, is his first of the 2006 campaign. The spot, ""Voice,"" began an open-end run last night on network and cable television stations across the state.PRODUCER: Moxie Pictures THE SCRIPT: A male announcer says: ""For every New Yorker whose husband or child has to go somewhere else just to get a job. For every New Yorker drowning in property taxes. For every New Yorker who's been ignored, left out, who's been told you can't fight City Hall so many times they've come to believe it. For every New Yorker without a voice -- listen: There's one strong enough for all of us.""Mr. Spitzer (voice-over): ""I represent the people of the State of New York.""ON THE SCREEN: The spot unfolds with a soft, pleasing score of piano and strings that takes an uplifting turn toward the end. As the announcer delivers each sentence, a different image appears. The first shot focuses tightly on the face of a young white woman outside a modest, wooded home, with two young children playing behind her. The next shots show a small-town diner with a ""For Rent"" sign in the window; an older black man holding a cane; an attractive young couple sitting on the floor; a woman on a farm; two young white males; and a stoic-looking woman with two young girls in a laundromat. When the announcer says ""Listen,"" a black man turns his face to the camera. When Mr. Spitzer's voice-over begins, applause is heard, the screen fades to black, and the words ""Spitzer for Governor"" appear in blue. When the announcer speaks again, the words ""Bring some passion back to Albany"" appear on the screen.ACCURACY: High property taxes are a major political issue for voters and candidates of both parties. Job losses and shuttered businesses are chronic problems across upstate New York.SCORECARD: Mr. Spitzer is well known to voters after seven years of prosecuting fraud cases against Wall Street titans. This ad, with its high production values and emotionally stirring music and images, tries to humanize that image. It suggests that Mr. Spitzer's reputation as a fighter -- not to mention his well-publicized fits of temper -- arise from a ""passion"" that will serve voters in Albany, that much-maligned capital of dysfunction. The spot also portrays Mr. Spitzer as a champion of women, minorities, and rural voters -- groups from whom his advisers want greater support. Some voters may be moved by the ad; the weary-looking faces of women, who seem to be struggling to raise kids or to get by, are hard to forget. And the fact that no picture of Mr. Spitzer ever appears, with only his confident voice pledging to represent ""the people,"" is effective in highlighting and elevating the needs of voters.

"'06-03-14,'1','But critics here mock New Urbanism as being impractical and ignorant of the preference of most Americans for privacy over community, and as creating towns that often look like film sets rather than real communities.""A lot of people there are more into the arts and come from other areas,"" said Mayor A. J. Holloway of Biloxi, speaking of Ocean Springs and its preference for a smaller bridge with a bicycle lane. ""And I don't see people riding bikes 85 feet in the air.""Officials from Biloxi and Gulfport, robbed by the hurricane of their fishing docks and antebellum homes and emboldened by new legislation that permits gambling on land, believe their cities' futures lie in rows of casinos, high-rise condominiums and a new multilane bridge. Officials deride the idea of trolleys replacing cars on busy roadways and suggest that such ideas are preferred by people who come from, as they say here, ""away.""Pass Christian, once a haven for retirees and people with second homes, is now warily weighing offers from the condominium developers it once avoided, as all the town's businesses have been swept away, leaving its coffers empty.Other places are equally desperate; Waveland and Bay St. Louis, neighboring cities with distinct cultures and histories, are considering a merger.And as with New Orleans, which Mississippi residents say has overshadowed the narrative of their plight, the struggle to rebuild here is also a struggle for a future identity, as the culture, physical landscape and industries of the region face inevitable change.The historically rich, laid back, slightly tawdry Mississippi coast has always stood apart from the otherwise largely provincial state. With its French colonial history, the coast has carried few of the historical burdens wrought by cotton plantations, slaves and the civil rights movement.The state government, which has long encouraged local control, is not poised to dictate a uniform rebuilding agenda for its coastal region, even though state planners may support the smaller approach. And so commerce seems poised to drive the decision making instead.""The coastal communities are different, but they are linked, and that is the complexity of it,"" said Charles Reagan Wilson, the director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi. ""But it is going to be difficult for each town to preserve the character they have had before Katrina. The model for the future of the coast to me seems to be the Florida Panhandle, with condos and things like that. That is the private, economic, capitalistic future.""The devastation of the coast here remains shocking to the uninitiated eye; towns where people have clearly worked night and day just to remove debris look as though they were hit by a hurricane six days ago, rather than six months.In Pass Christian, where nary a house is standing and bedsheets are still threaded through the trees, the order to boil water only just ended. Its municipal government, like many in the region, is housed in a doublewide trailer.Biloxi is still a tangle of crumbling buildings, bent signs and silent streets. But all that changes in the parking lots of the three casinos that have opened on land, where drivers are lucky to find a space. Crowds appear within the casinos from seemingly nowhere, as if planted in place, with people holding cocktails and clutching room keys that double as casino entry cards in the cavernous, smoke-fogged halls.""Biloxi is going to be high-rises and condos,"" said Duncan McKenzie, president of the Chamber of Commerce and a vice president of the Isle of Capri casino. ""People refer to what happened here as a tragic opportunity."" Even before the storm, casinos were Biloxi's second-largest industry after the military, employing 15,000 people and generating $19.2 million in taxes.But now there are few places for the lowest-paid casino workers to live. In the western part of Biloxi, the mom-and-pop motels and low-income apartment buildings were destroyed, and developers have been buying up land for large condominiums, Mayor Holloway said.""Low- and moderate-income housing was a problem before Katrina,"" Mr. Holloway said. ""And it is an even bigger problem now. We are working with the casinos to see if they are interested in developing housing for their workers.""In light of these many problems, Mr. Holloway, casino executives and others believe that it is in the best interest of Biloxi to have a functioning bridge that links workers to homes, gamblers to casinos and the city to the rest of the coast as soon as possible.The State Department of Transportation wants to build an eight-lane, 85-foot-tall bridge to replace the decimated four-lane structure, paid for with federal funds unleashed after Hurricane Katrina.But officials in Ocean Springs deplore the notion of a large bridge dumping traffic into its tree-lined town. They prefer a bridge half the size, with a bicycle lane. The chasm between Ocean Springs and Biloxi in some ways can be accounted for by the relative damage of each. The beachfront homes in Ocean Springs -- one of the oldest cities in America, founded in 1699 -- took a beating. But its downtown was more or less unscathed, which has led the town to not only survive, but flourish.Once a quiet bedroom community with a number of artists, upscale women's sportswear shops and picturesque restaurants and candy stores, the town is now dotted with new restaurants and bars that are filled with volunteers, contractors and neighbors who do not want to take the long route into Biloxi now that the bridge is out. Just as important, it has the one thing that separates the surviving towns from the sinking ones: a still-standing Wal-Mart.""We've been a place for people to escape,"" said Donovan Scruggs, the planning and development director in Ocean Springs. ""Pre-Katrina, there was not much of an after-7 crowd downtown. Now we have a vibrant little nightlife downtown. Our revenues increased 50 percent in November over the same period in 2004.""There is a similar chasm between Waveland and Bay St. Louis, which are considering the merger. Bay St. Louis has fewer resources than Waveland and about half its budget, and it sees a future more oriented toward tourism. Waveland, which is resisting the merger concept, wants to rebuild its downtown like a miniature French Quarter.""I am hard-pressed to see where combining would benefit the people of Waveland,"" said Mayor Tommy Longo of Waveland, as he ate a barbecue sandwich recently in City Hall (yes, a trailer), trying to get through another day of negotiating insurance claim complaints, Army Corps of Engineer problems and out-of-state deliveries.Residents say they just want their old town back, name and all.""Waveland has always been Waveland,"" said Cindy Peterson, folding laundry in her government trailer. ""We should go back to what it was. Nothing like Katrina will happen again in my lifetime anyway.""'"

"'06-03-14,'1','Stu Bykofsky, a columnist at The Philadelphia Daily News, which is also one of the 12 papers back on the block, said he understood that of all the entities that had expressed interest in Knight Ridder, McClatchy was the best. He was disappointed the company was selling the Philadelphia papers so quickly.""It's like death by drowning instead of death by fire,"" Mr. Bykofsky said. ""McClatchy, which was portrayed as this savior, will turn around and sell us to the highest bidder. That's not a confidence-builder for us.""McClatchy, which owns 12 papers -- including the Bee papers in Central California, The Star Tribune in Minneapolis and The News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C. -- will become the nation's second-biggest newspaper company, behind Gannett, if it completes the $4.5 billion acquisition.The Gannett Company, which publishes USA Today, did not make a bid for Knight Ridder, but analysts said it remained a possible buyer for some of the 12 papers that McClatchy does not want.Other possible buyers include William Dean Singleton, chief executive of the MediaNews Group, which publishes The Denver Post and The Salt Lake Tribune, and who presided over the shutdown of The Houston Post. Eight of the 12 papers are unionized, which could make them less desirable acquisitions. The Newspaper Guild has also expressed interest in buying them.Analysts said Mr. Singleton, who has taken on difficult markets like Detroit, was likely to be in strong pursuit of at least some of the papers, particularly in California, where he already owns several small papers as well as The Los Angeles Daily News. He visited some Knight Ridder newsrooms in the last several weeks but did not make a final bid for the company.""We believe Gannett and MediaNews Group will be buyers in some of these newspaper divestitures,"" a financial analysis by J. P. Morgan stated. ""The outcome reinforces that Gannett is a highly disciplined acquirer.""Gary B. Pruitt, chairman and chief executive of McClatchy, said yesterday that he was open to all possible combinations of sales, and might sell some papers individually or several together.He also said that he had already been contacted by potential buyers, whom he did not identify and that he wanted to sell the 12 papers on the same day -- sometime this summer -- that he closes the deal to acquire the 20 other Knight Ridder papers.""McClatchy would not operate those papers for even one day,"" he said.Mr. Pruitt said he was confident that he could sell the 12 papers and that they would fit into the strategies of other newspaper companies, confidence that analysts said suggested that Mr. Pruitt might already have lined up buyers for some or all of them.Mr. Pruitt said he was aware of concern among employees that if a private equity firm were to acquire the papers, it would most likely strip them down and eventually resell them. He did not rule out any potential buyers, but in an indication that he would not sell to someone loathsome to journalists, he joked that ""Slobodan Milosevic died over the weekend, so he's out.""""We care who we sell to,"" Mr. Pruitt said, adding that ""obviously price will be an important factor, but it won't be the only factor."" He said ""speed of execution will matter; we don't want to prolong this.""""We think newspaper companies are out there that can do well by these papers,"" he said.Nonetheless, Wall Street reacted negatively to news of the sale. Knight Ridder closed down $1.08 in trading yesterday, at $63.92, and McClatchy closed down $1.51, at $51.55. Because of the decline in McClatchy shares, the value of the deal to Knight Ridder shareholders declined to $66.38 from $67.25.A spokesman for P. Anthony Ridder, the chairman and chief executive of Knight Ridder, said Mr. Ridder was disappointed that McClatchy was not keeping the chain intact.""He's upset about the dissolution of the company that he has spent more than 40 years with,"" said Polk Laffoon, the spokesman. ""It's been very difficult for him emotionally to see the company sold and particularly now to see it not sold as a whole.""Potential buyers for the 12 papers on the block were the talk of the newsrooms.""I think people are generally pretty terrified of Singleton,"" said Dominic Papatola, the theater critic at The Pioneer Press in St. Paul, who has worked there since 1997. He said he did not see a private equity firm ""coming in because McClatchy has cherry-picked the most lucrative titles.""""The chains that took a pass on us whole,"" Mr. Papatola said, ""may find that what's left is less desirable.""Goldman Sachs, which advised Knight Ridder on the sale, said in a research report that McClatchy's acquisition made strategic sense. But, Goldman said, ""many questions remain on the financial implications of the deal,"" in part because the sale price of the 12 papers is unknown.Wall Street will be watching closely, Goldman said, until McClatchy -- with shares already down 28 percent over the last year -- demonstrates it can increase profitability at the 20 papers it is buying and sells the 12 at a price close to what it paid per share for Knight Ridder.Under the terms of the deal, Knight Ridder shareholders are to receive $40 in cash and 0.5118 of a McClatchy Class A share for each of their shares. To finance the deal, McClatchy secured commitments for a $3.75 billion loan from J. P. Morgan Chase and Banc of America Securities, according to the companies' merger agreement.The agreement, filed with regulators late yesterday, seemed to hold open the possibility of Knight Ridder's accepting a higher offer should one come along before its deal with McClatchy is concluded. If the deal falls apart, McClatchy would receive a $171.9 million termination fee from Knight Ridder.McClatchy is moving quickly to meet with Knight Ridder employees. Mr. Pruitt has begun making a barnstorming tour of his new papers, starting today with a visit to The Miami Herald.Howard Weaver, McClatchy's vice president for news, visited Knight Ridder's Washington bureau yesterday and, according to employees, said there would be ""no layoffs and no shrinkage."" He said McClatchy's 15-person bureau would be combined with Knight Ridder's 45-person bureau and David Westphal, McClatchy's Washington bureau chief, would succeed Clark Hoyt, Knight Ridder's Washington editor, as the senior person.McClatchy will also keep Knight Ridder's 10 foreign bureaus.But these reassurances offered little solace at the papers set for a fast resale.Mike Antonucci, a reporter at The San Jose Mercury News for 28 years, said there was so little information that it was impossible to pinpoint any single mood prevailing in the newsroom.""There are families and lives and loans and benefits and mortgages and careers on the line, and that's why we'd like the uncertainty resolved in a positive way,"" he said. ""But we don't even know when the uncertainty is going to be resolved or how positive it is going to be.""And at The Daily News in Philadelphia, there was anger at repeated assumptions by analysts that whoever bought that paper would shut it.""We have been living under anxiety and trepidation for months,"" said Kitty Caparella, a longtime organized-crime reporter for The Daily News. ""It doesn't help that know-nothing stock analysts keep predicting the close of The Daily News.""'"
"'06-03-14,'1','""China has now established itself as the paramount regional power in Southeast Asia,"" said Milton Osborne, a former Australian diplomat and scholar on the region at the Lowy Institute of International Affairs in Sydney. ""This is widely recognized in Southeast Asia, however people choose to express the idea.""Before leaving Washington, Ms. Rice sounded a cautionary note about China, with a harder edge than much of what is heard in Southeast Asia.She warned of China's military buildup. It has been a favorite topic of the Pentagon lately, in particular the development of Chinese submarines designed to block American military access to Taiwan. She spoke of China's possible long-term ""negative"" role, and she seemed to suggest that the United States might be recruiting partners, particularly Australia and Japan, in an effort to contain China, a notion that analysts in the region say seems passé.""I think all of us in the region, particularly those of us who are longstanding allies, have a joint responsibility and obligation to try and produce conditions in which the rise of China will be a positive force in international politics, not a negative force,"" Ms. Rice said.In Indonesia, China has turned on the charm, transforming a relationship that was once fraught with suspicion into a blossoming economic partnership. China's state energy companies have bought into Indonesian oil and natural gas fields in Java and Papua and are expected to bid on tenders for new power plants. Indonesian exports to China in 2004 increased by 232 percent from the previous year.American oil companies have long held operations in Indonesia, and Exxon Mobil, after a protracted battle with successive Indonesian governments, announced Monday that it will develop the significant Cepu oil field on Java. But in a measure of the sensitivities about American corporate interests in nationalistic Indonesia, American businessmen said they expected Ms. Rice to try to avoid any public comment about the deal.""These are some major new important competitors for business,"" James Castle, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia and a longtime business consultant here, said of the Chinese. ""If America wants to maintain a presence, it's going to have to work a lot harder. The Chinese are a big player.""In Australia, where until a few years ago China was regarded with distrust, its strides are even more pronounced, especially given the hardy alliance between John Howard, Australia's conservative prime minister, and President Bush.The enduring economic boom in Australia is almost solely a result of exporting natural resources to China: huge amounts of iron ore and alumina, and soon natural gas. Australia, which has 30 percent of the world's uranium deposits, is expected to sign a deal next month to sell uranium to China for its nuclear power plants.Australia said it made the agreement because China had signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and talks are under way to produce a guarantee that China will not use the uranium for military purposes.Gilding the hard economic gains from its exports to China, Australia is going through a kind of China fever. Mr. Howard pointed out recently that Chinese has become the most widely spoken foreign language in Australia. More Chinese tourists visit Australia now than Japanese, according to recent figures.All this points to a need for Ms. Rice to address the issue during her first visit to the region, where the United States has been long accustomed to being the sole superpower.In an important speech about China's power last month, the veteran Singapore ambassador to the United States, Chan Heng Chee, said of her region, ""Many countries are comfortable with the current status quo of asymmetrical multipolarity with the United States as the dominant pole and are not inclined to sever or change existing alliances.""But Ms. Chan, who represents America's most stalwart ally in the Southeast Asia, warned, ""Whether these sentiments are retained in the coming decades depends on what the United States does in alliance maintenance and what the U.S. does in foreign and economic policy internationally.""'"
"'06-03-14,'1','""This reflects openly what has been talked about quietly for some time,"" said Angela Knight, chief executive of the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers, a group with about 70 corporate members here.Shares of the London exchange closed at £11.49, up £2.69, and 21 percent above Nasdaq's indicated offer of £9.50. Shares of Nasdaq slipped 0.6 percent yesterday, while the Big Board's parent, the NYSE Group, surged 9 percent.The market's ""valuation is beginning to reflect current realities,"" Michael Taylor, head of equities at Threadneedle Investments, the London exchange's largest investor with 13.8 percent of the shares, said in a statement yesterday.""We are now willing to discuss proposals with interested parties."" Another big shareholder, Scottish Widows, also said it was ready to discuss a takeover.A tie-up with a leading American exchange is considered by many shareholders to be the preferred outcome for the London market. Attempts in the past to combine with the Frankfurt stock exchange and a pan-European player, Euronext, were quashed by politics, disagreements about price, management and where such an exchange would be based. A Macquarie bid was dismissed as too low.As the market in Europe's leading financial center, the London exchange has always managed to corner a lot of Europe's equity listing business. But its emphasis on attracting emerging-market clients in recent years has given it the edge over its New York counterparts, making a cross-Atlantic pairing more attractive.Companies from Russia and China have spurned New York listings for the London exchange in recent months. In addition, London's small-capitalization market, AIM, has been booming, and at the end of 2005 had almost 1,400 listings with a combined value of £56.6 billion.Part of the reason those companies are coming, though, lies in the differences between London and New York, differences that London exchange shareholders say will need to be preserved if any deal goes through.The greater regulatory oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission and others in the United States since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed in 2002 has proved unpopular with international companies. Any deal between New York and London would need to carefully spell out regulatory boundaries, London investors said.American bidders for the London exchange ""shouldn't underestimate how much the S.E.C, is going to be considered a detractor,"" Ms. Knight warned. When it comes to accounting standards and regulation of public companies, she said, ""the rest of the world is neither like America nor does it see America as the country it needs to emulate.""The London market is a ""critical part of London's financial infrastructure,"" said Michael Charlton, chief executive of Think London, the city's foreign direct investment agency. An important factor in getting an bid through is assuring shareholders and local officials that the London exchange will ""keep that international focus,"" Mr. Charlton said.But others close to the political process were happy to entertain the general idea of a New York takeover. ""The whole success of the City of London over the years has been its openness,"" said Michael Snyder, the chairman of the policy and resources committee of London's financial center. ""The business will still be done here as long as it stays competitive and efficient.""Negotiations about price are expected to be tough. European stock exchanges traditionally trade at substantially lower multiples than their American counterparts, vexing European investors and market managers. Before the Nasdaq bid, for example, the London market was trading at 20.8 times estimated 2006 earnings, and the Nasdaq at 68.1 times estimates.""No European exchange is going to want to accept anything below the multiple where their American counterparts are trading,"" said Guy de Blonay, the manager of New Star Asset Management's financials fund.The London exchange, for its part, had no official comment yesterday. One executive there, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about the discussions, said that ""we are not for sale, but there is a price at which we might be forced to consider"" reaching a deal.'"
"'06-03-14,'1','The online magazine Salon is challenging the identity of a man profiled by The New York Times in a front-page article on Saturday who says he is the iconic hooded figure in a published photograph who was abused by Americans at Abu Ghraib prison in 2003 and 2004.Salon bases its challenge on an examination of a set of 280 Abu Ghraib photographs it has been studying for several weeks and an interview with an official of the Army's Criminal Investigation Command, known as the C.I.D., who says the man identified by The Times is not the detainee in the photograph.On Monday, Chris Grey, chief spokesman for the investigations unit, asked about the challenge, confirmed to The Times in an e-mail message: ""We have had several detainees claim they were the person depicted in the photograph in question. Our investigation indicates that the person you have is not the detainee who was depicted in the photograph released in connection with the Abu Ghraib investigation.""As always, we will take this information into consideration in the course of our investigative duties to determine if there is any credibility to the person's allegations.""The man identified by The Times, Ali Shalal Qaissi, often called Haj Ali, was also interviewed and described as the hooded man forced to stand on a box attached to electric wires in an article in Vanity Fair and a broadcast on PBS.'"
"'06-03-14,'1','The affected areas include programs for high schools and graduate fellowships.It is far too early to determine the effects of the changes on the presence of minorities in higher education and how far the pool of money for scholarships and similar programs will stretch.Firm data on how many institutions have modified their policies is elusive because colleges and institutions are not eager to trumpet the changes. At least a handful are seeking to put more money into the programs as they expand the possible pool of applicants.Some white students are qualifying for the aid. Last year, in response to a legal threat from the Education Department, Washington University in St. Louis modified the standards for an undergraduate scholarship that had been open just to minorities and was named for the first African-American dean at the university. This year, the first since the change, 12 of the 42 first-year recipients are white.Officials at conservative groups that are pushing for the changes see the shift as a sign of success in eliminating race as a factor in decision making in higher education.""Our concern is that the law be followed and that nobody be denied participation in a program on account of skin color or what country their ancestors came from,"" said Roger Clegg, president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity, which has been pressing institutions on the issue.""We're not looking at achieving a particular racial outcome,"" Mr. Clegg added. ""And it's unfortunate that some organizations seem to view the success or failure of the program based simply on what percentage of students of this color or that color can participate.""Advocates of focused scholarships programs like Theodore M. Shaw, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., challenge the notion that programs for minority students hurt whites. ""How is it that they conclude that the great evil in this country is discrimination against white people?"" Mr. Shaw asked. ""Can I put that question any more pointedly? I struggle to find the words to do it because it's so stunning.""Mr. Shaw said protecting scholarships and other programs for minorities was ""at the top of our agenda.""Travis Reindl, director of state policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, said hundreds, if not thousands, of scholarship and fellowship programs historically used race as a criterion. Mr. Reindl estimated that as many as half of the four-year colleges in the United States had reviewed or modified such programs.Neither the Justice Department nor Education Department, nor organizations on all sides of the discussions over affirmative action, have gathered statistics tracking the trend. In January, The Chronicle of Higher Education named more than 12 institutions that had made the changes.Mr. Clegg said that since 2003 his center had sent 200 challenges to colleges and universities over race-based scholarships and other programs, warning of legal action if changes were not made. He said more than 150 institutions had broadened their programs in response.The two Supreme Court affirmative action decisions that are worrying the institutions involved the University of Michigan. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the court upheld the use of race in admissions decisions at the law school. It found that there had been a ""highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant's file"" in which race could be properly considered.In Gratz v. Bollinger, the court struck down the use of race in undergraduate admissions, finding that those applications used a scoring system that should not have awarded points based on race.""When the Gratz and Grutter decisions came down, that was really kind of a mixed bag,"" Mr. Reindl said. ""It's still a very murky environment, and it's also a very contentious environment.""The effects of the decisions, in June 2003, were almost immediate. After the summer of 2003, Princeton closed a seven-week program for minority high school juniors. Begun in 1985, it focused on strengthening skills in economics, statistics and other areas. Princeton restarted the program, the Woodrow Wilson School Junior Summer Institute, last summer. Now it is open to all students showing an interest in public service and commitment to ""cross-cultural issues.""Changes have also come at institutions like St. Louis University, which widened a scholarship program for blacks in 2004 to include all students and named it after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Three years ago, Williams College opened a graduate fellowship and a prefreshman program to all races. Officials at several institutions and scholars emphasized that scholarships and fellowships open to all students could, if thoughtfully created, still achieve diversity in classrooms and on faculties.""The objective is still to make good kids excellent,"" said William F. Elliott, vice president for enrollment at Carnegie Mellon University, which three years ago broadened a full-tuition scholarship for minority students and a summer program in mathematics and science for minority high school students.Now, the university also considers diversity to include other factors like whether students are the first in their families to attend college.A big question is how far the money can stretch. At SUNY, officials have requested additional New York State money for the two modified fellowships, the Empire State Minority Honors Scholarship Program, which distributes $649,000 a year to 898 students, and the Underrepresented Graduate Fellowship Program, which distributes $6.2 million in financial aid to 500.More money would make it possible, said Peter D. Salins, provost of the SUNY system, to offer more fellowships and help offset any potential adverse effects on minority students.""All over America, universities are adjusting their policies, and this is simply our instance"" of doing so, Mr. Salins said. At Southern Illinois in Carbondale, the modifications in the consent decree affect three graduate fellowships involving 85 students that offered tuition plus stipends. At Washington University in St. Louis, which modified the undergraduate fellowship named for the former black dean, John P. Ervin, officials said they remained committed to increasing diversity. ""In some ways, this makes our objectives more difficult,"" said James E. McLeod, director of the scholarship program and dean of the college of arts and sciences at the university. ""It will take more time, it will take more creativity.""Correction: March 16, 2006, Thursday A front-page article on Tuesday about colleges and universities that have opened minority scholarships and other programs to whites included an erroneous reference from Princeton to eligibility for a seven-week summer program. It is for college juniors, not high school juniors.'"

""He was at the top of our list before the two wins in the tournament, but those wins helped sell him to people back here.""Trent Johnson, a former Stanford assistant, took Nevada to the Round of 16 in the 2004 tournament. Two months later, he was hired by Stanford after Mike Montgomery left to coach the N.B.A.'s Golden State Warriors.Bruce Weber emerged as a prime candidate during the 2002 tournament, when 11th-seeded Southern Illinois beat No. 6 Texas Tech and No. 3 Georgia. A year later, he was hired by Illinois.Stan Heath was the coach at Kent State in 2002 when the 10th-seeded Golden Flashes beat No. 7 Oklahoma State, No. 2 Alabama and No. 3 Pittsburgh to advance to a regional final. Representatives from Arkansas and West Virginia were waiting to talk to him immediately after Kent was eliminated by Indiana in the Round of 8.""The body of work is big, but the tournament was the biggest thing for me,"" said Heath, who had been a head coach for just one season before going to Arkansas. ""To be a giant killer is huge. You have a team that is a midmajor and people don't think you are going to do a whole lot and, all of a sudden, when you go to the Sweet 16, then the Elite 8, that grabs people's attention. The attention from other schools is focused on what's happening with these basketball teams in the N.C.A.A. tournament.""Mike Alden, the athletic director at Missouri, said tournament success was only part of the package in selecting a coach. ""You have to look at the entire body of work,"" he said. ""If they upset some teams and do really well, it just enhances that body of work. That, in itself, should not be the defining element.""From a fan-base standpoint, the N.C.A.A. tournament enhances the exposure of a coach. They have seen somebody on a national level and it gets them excited, so it enhances your ability to market that coach early on.""Some of the coaches expected to attract attention in this tournament are Mark Fox of Nevada, Mark Turgeon of Wichita State, Chris Lowery of Southern Illinois and Mike Anderson of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Athletic directors with openings know they must move quickly because the same coaches have appeal to other universities. Virginia also had an opening when Tennessee was eyeing Pearl, so Hamilton did not want to miss his chance.Pearl, 42, said the Tennessee job was an opportunity to guide a bigger program and receive a big payday, but he also had family considerations and had to be persuaded that he was making the right move.The Volunteers were 14-17 last season. They improved to 21-7 and earned a No. 2 seeding this season under Pearl, and Tennessee gave him a raise last week to $1.1 million and extended his contract through 2012. Hamilton said the contract also included a $1 million buyout if Pearl left Tennessee, a safeguard against another university luring him away.Mississippi's athletic director, Pete Boone, said he had several coaches of midmajor teams on his radar.""You are looking for people that can win the big game; there is no question,"" Boone said. ""In the Big East, the Big 12 and the SEC, we think all of our conference games are big games. For a coach to be able to motivate his players and then coach and make the right decisions in a big-time game like the N.C.A.A. tournament or an SEC game is very important.""Boone said it was crucial that Mississippi move quickly, considering all the openings in Division I.""We certainly want to honor every school's right to finish out the season"" Boone said. ""I have not called any athletic directors of people I am thinking about, but I am certain I will next week. It is important that the people we have on our radar screen hear our story before they start talking to other people, too.""And if a coach can pull off an upset or two in the N.C.A.A. tournament -- a job audition before a national audience -- several suitors will line up to tell their stories.'"

"'06-03-15,'1','Today a committee appointed by Gov. Jon S. Corzine to study the problems of the Schools Construction Corporation released its report and recommendations for changes. The governor is reviewing the report, officials said in a conference call with reporters today.The governor's special counsel for school construction, Scott A. Weiner, said one of the reasons the agency fell short was that ""speed was the driver for the program.""""This was a program and a corporation that was organized around speed and not the priorities of educational policy as articulated by the court, by the Legislature in the act, not by sound management, fiscal or management controls, but by how fast a building or project could be commenced and finished,"" Mr. Weiner said. ""The legacy of that approach is something that is well known.""The committee, it seems, had its work cut out for it. Recent reports by the state auditor and the inspector general found lax fiscal oversight at the agency and fiascos in school construction: a partly built school now scheduled for demolition on a contaminated site in Trenton; a planned school just yards from a theater that had featured pornographic films in Passaic; and property in Union City, intended for a school, which quadrupled in price after an apartment building rose on it.A report by the state auditor released last week found that even basic safeguards of the public's money were not maintained, with the agency relying heavily on private contractors to manage projects. In those firms, the report found, ""direct salaries were marked up by 94 to 192 percent for the cost of employee benefits, indirect costs and profit.""The report, which covered the period since April 2005, also noted that in two cases, construction managers were paid 40 percent of their construction supervision fees before construction contracts were awarded. It also found that 60 change orders, totaling $45 million, were allowed, using questionable interpretations.Its recommendations sounded more like steps one might take to establish a construction agency, rather than to reform one, and include items that might have been obvious to a first-year accounting student, like creating a strategic plan; paying for work after it is completed, not before; keeping track of checks; and actually cashing them.Land acquisition for a school should come before architectural drawings, it noted: ""It would be more prudent to decide what and where to build before it is designed.""But it is hardly the only document critical of the agency. In a Jan. 12 report, the Office of the Inspector General cited a case in which a vendor may have been paid up to $3.4 million more than the fee approved by the agency's board.The inspector also found that school construction employees had created false documents indicating that board approval was not required for the fees stipulated, and that the employees had also expedited a bill from the management firm for $1.6 million by breaking it into four invoices, for which no documentation was provided.Neither the auditor's office nor the inspector general's office would release the names of specific vendors or projects, saying the investigations were continuing.Assemblyman William D. Payne, who represents most of Newark and all of Hillside, called it criminal that the state could not yet provide adequate educational facilities for poor children almost 40 years after the beginning of the Abbott v. Burke case, a state Supreme Court decision that ordered the state to increase financing for urban districts to bring them up to a par with suburban districts.""Money was wasted because of a lack of proper management and tremendous inefficiencies, and there was no oversight,"" he said, adding that management costs for schools in Abbott districts under the construction corporation were 45 percent higher than in other districts.""They went into the candy jar and took out as much as they could,"" he said.The Schools Construction Corporation was created in 2002 by Gov. James E. McGreevey after the state Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that school facilities in poor districts should be comparable to those in rich districts. But in March 2005, the inspector general recommended that the agency stop spending money until it made internal changes, saying it was ""vulnerable to mismanagement, fiscal malfeasance, conflicts of interest and waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars."" In July, the agency announced that it was running out of money after building just an eighth of the schools on its list.Mr. Weiner, who on Monday took over as the transitional chief executive of the corporation — its fourth leader in five years — said the agency had built ""a very credibly reliable system of financial management and control"" since last summer, when Gov. Richard J. Codey turned his attention to problems in the agency.The report released today includes recommendations to tighten the controls further, and to reorganize the Schools Construction Corporation, ""in, but not of,"" the Department of the Treasury.""No additional funding should be authorized for school construction activities until the corporation's operations and management have been further strengthened and new systems developed to address issues of enhancing cost control and collaboration with boards of education and their communities,"" the report said.But for Dr. Robert Holster, superintendent of the Passaic public schools, who is waiting for four schools to be built, the clock is ticking. Fewer than half of his elementary schools have libraries, he said, and few have labs.""We've got to be on the same playing field as every other child,"" Dr. Holster said.'"

"'06-03-15,'1','As usual in Iran, there are mixed signals, and the government does not always speak with the same voice.On Tuesday, both Mr. Ahmadinejad and the nation's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, insisted in public speeches that their country would never back down. At the same time, Iranian negotiators arrived in Moscow to resume talks -- at Iran's request -- just days after Iran had rejected a Russian proposal to resolve the standoff.Average Iranians do not seem uniformly confident at the prospect of being hit with United Nations sanctions.From the streets of Tehran to the ski slopes outside the city, some people have begun to joke about the catch phrase of the government -- flippantly saying, ""Nuclear energy is our irrefutable right.""Reformers, whose political clout as a movement vanished after the last election, have also begun to speak out. And people with close ties to the government said high-ranking clerics had begun to give criticism of Iran's position to Ayatollah Khamenei, which the political elite sees as a seismic jolt.""There has been no sign that they will back down,"" said Ahmad Zeidabady, a political analyst and journalist. ""At least Mr. Khamenei has said nothing that we can interpret that there will be change in the policies.""But, he said, ""There is more criticism as it is becoming more clear that this policy is not working, especially by those who were in the previous negotiating team.""There are also signs that negotiators are starting to back away, however slightly, from a bare-knuckle strategy and that those who had initially opposed the president's style -- but remained silent -- are beginning to feel vindicated and are starting to speak up.A former president, Mohammad Khatami, recently publicly criticized the aggressive approach and called a return to his government's strategy of confidence-building with the west.""The previous team now feels they were vindicated,"" said Nasser Hadian, a political science professor at Tehran University who is close to many members of the government. ""The new team feels they have to justify their actions.""Ayatollah Khamenei, who has the final say, issued a strong defense of Iran's position on Tuesday.""The Islamic Republic of Iran considers retreat over the nuclear issue, which is the demand of the Iranian people, as breaking the country's independence that will impose huge costs on the Iranian nation,"" he said.""Peaceful use of nuclear technology is a must and is necessary for scientific growth in all fields,"" Ayatollah Khamenei said. ""Any kind of retreat will bring a series of pressures and retreats. So, this is an irreversible path and our foreign diplomacy should defend this right courageously.""In a speech in northern Iran, Mr. Ahmadinejad called on the people to ""be angry"" at the pressure being put on Iran.""Listen well,"" the president said to a crowd chanting ""die"" as they punched the air with their fists. ""A nuclear program is our irrefutable right.""When Mr. Ahmadinejad took office, he embraced a decision already made by the top leadership to move toward confrontation with the West about the nuclear program. From the sidelines, Mr. Ahmadinejad's opponents remained largely silent as his political capital grew.Iran's ability to begin uranium enrichment, and to remove the seals in January at least three nuclear facilities without any immediate consequences, was initially seen as a validation of the get-tough approach.But one political scientist who speaks regularly with members of the Foreign Ministry said that Iran had hinged much of its strategy on winning Russia's support. The political scientist asked not to be identified so as not to compromise his relationship with people in the government.The political scientist said some negotiators believed that by being hostile to the West they would be able to entice Moscow into making Tehran its stronghold in the Middle East. ""They thought the turn east was the way forward,"" the person said. ""That was a belief and a vision.""The person added, ""They thought, 99 percent, Russia would seize the opportunity and back the Iranian leaders.""The route forward remains unclear as Iran tries to regain a sense of momentum.There is a consensus here that Iran has many cards to play -- from its influence with the Shiites in Iraq to its closer ties to Hezbollah in Lebanon, to the prospect of using oil as a weapon. But the uncertainty of appearing before the Security Council, and the prospect of sanctions, has led some here to begin to rethink the wisdom of fighting the West head-on, analysts said.Professor Hadian said he believed that for Iran to fundamentally change course the situation for Iran would have to first grow much worse.""There are concerns to keep the situation calm,"" said Mr. Zeidabady, the journalist. ""We have received orders not even to have headlines saying the case has been sent to the Security Council. Although the situation is very critical, they want to pretend that everything is normal. They do not want to show the country is coming under pressure and lose their supporters.""'"

"'06-03-15,'1','HONOLULU, March 14 - One person was killed and as many as seven were missing on Tuesday morning after an earthen dam burst on the North Shore of Kauai, sending a wall of water from the mountains toward the ocean, ripping up a highway and lifting several houses off their foundations.State Representative Hermina M. Morita said the body of a man was found after the dam, which held back the Kaloko Reservoir, burst in the early morning.Ms. Morita, a Democrat whose district includes the dam, near Kilauea, said the victims were asleep in their homes when the dam burst. It was about 40 feet high and 800 feet along and captured runoff from several small streams.The water raced down a stream, ripping up asphalt and closing Kuhio Highway. ""It took two houses completely off their foundations, leaving just the concrete slabs,"" said Dave Curtis, a spokesman for the Hawaii Department of Civil Defense.Kuhio Highway, the only road to two North Shore communities, Princeville and Hanalei, will remain closed until state transportation officials can inspect the stability of a second dam downstream from the reservoir.Ray Lovell, a spokesman for the State Department of Civil Defense, said: ""It's a small island, and this is a pretty big disaster.""The Coast Guard used a C-130 plane and two H-65 helicopters to search about 9,200 square miles of coastline and ocean for the missing people, said Chief Petty Officer Marsha Delaney.'"
"'06-03-15,'1','The market price usually sags after a PIPE deal is announced, and any investor who buys such an investment and waits for the shares to be registered, usually within a matter of days, risks discovering that the market price of the stock will have fallen below the purchase price.To avoid that, it is good to short the shares as soon as possible. But to do that in the United States, a trader is supposed to first borrow the shares. And, the S.E.C. says, it is illegal to use the shares obtained from the PIPE to repay the shares borrowed, since that would amount to having sold the PIPE shares too early.The investor is supposed to buy other shares to cover the short position, and then sell the PIPE shares separately. If the shares are illiquid, there is a risk that prices will move, leaving the trader with a loss.In addition, the S.E.C. says, it is illegal insider trading to sell the shares short if the seller knows a PIPE deal is coming, but that fact has not been announced to the public.The complaint against Jeffrey Thorp and three hedge funds he ran -- Langley Partners, North Olmstead Partners and Quantico Partners -- says that in 22 deals, PIPE shares were improperly used to cover short positions, often with elaborate ruses aimed at making the tactic hard to discover. In six of those cases, and one other, Mr. Thorp was accused of illegal insider trading by shorting the stocks before the PIPE deal was disclosed to the public.Mr. Thorp, 42, of New York and the funds settled the case without admitting or denying the S.E.C. allegations. Mr. Thorp also agreed to talk to the S.E.C. when asked.No phone number could be found for Mr. Thorp or his funds. His lawyer, Andrew G. Gordon of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison did not return a telephone call.The S.E.C. allegations indicated that unnamed brokers in the United States and Canada worked with Mr. Thorp to cover up what he was doing.Asked if the brokers would face charges, Mr. Friestad of the S.E.C. said the commission would ""look to see whether brokers had any responsibility for this and bring charges if appropriate.""The S.E.C. said that in the PIPE trades from 2000 to 2002, the defendants realized profits of $7 million. Their tactics included selling shares short without borrowing them, a practice known as naked shorting. But that shorting was done in Canada, where the practice is legal, and no charges were brought over that.Instead, the charges dealt with fake or prearranged trades intended to make it look as if the funds had bought other shares to cover their short positions.The S.E.C., in its complaint, described the PIPE market gently, saying companies issue such securities ""when more traditional means of financing, such as a registered repeat offering, are for various reasons impractical.""One thing that limits the size of the offerings is that buyers are reluctant to place large orders, out of fear that they will not be able to legally short the shares in time. But the S.E.C. said the tactics Mr. Thorp used led him to seek very large allocations.Few buyers of PIPE securities invest because they believe in the long-term prospects of the company, so the burden ends up falling on those who buy common stock.They rarely do well. Of the 23 PIPE deals covered in the S.E.C. complaint, it appears that in 21 cases the common stock is now trading, if it is trading at all, at a price below that paid by the PIPE buyers. Since that price was below the public price at the time, the common shareholders did even worse.There was one major exception, a company known as HealthExtra. It prospects grew worse, and its sale price fell, in the months after the PIPE deal was sold in 2001. But its business later improved and the share price has risen sharply.But the rarity of such good outcomes explains why it is usually a good strategy to sell any investment in a company that issues a PIPE as soon as the deal is announced.'"
"'06-03-15,'1','Ms. Martin, 51, is a former flight attendant at World Airways, where she often flew between the United States and Germany because she spoke German. She began working at the Federal Aviation Administration before she completed law school at American University's Washington College of Law in 1989.Ms. Martin has almost no experience in criminal prosecutions because most of her work has involved defending the government in civil lawsuits. She moved to the Transportation Security Administration when it was created in 2002.Some lawyers who have worked with Ms. Martin in other cases said they were stunned by the events in the Moussaoui case.""She's articulate and forceful and aggressive and smart,"" said Thomas J. Whalen, an aviation lawyer at Condon & Forsyth who has worked on her side in some cases and against her in others. ""I'm really surprised about what's happened. It's more than being tough and aggressive.""In the Moussaoui case, her communications with witnesses, and new evidence that surfaced Tuesday that she told some witnesses not to cooperate with defense lawyers, puts the prosecution in the position of having to investigate and sharply criticize a government lawyer who has worked on the case.In a different case, in which Ms. Martin tried to keep vital evidence out of the hands of a lawyer on the ground that he had been associated with a civil rights group, she was accused by the other side of overstepping court boundaries and running roughshod over standard courtroom procedure in a zeal to protect national security.Ms. Martin's mother, Jean Martin Lay, said she spoke to her daughter Monday night.""She was so devastated,"" Ms. Lay said in a telephone interview from her home in Knoxville, Tenn. ""She said she just didn't hear the judge.""Ms. Lay said her daughter was in the courtroom when Judge Brinkema issued the order on handling witnesses, but was probably concentrating on something else ""instead of being mindful.""The judge's written order was issued last month, and Ms. Martin's contact with the witnesses occurred last week, according to e-mail messages made public by the court. The order was meant to sequester witnesses so their testimony would not be corrupted. It barred the witnesses from receiving the testimony of other witnesses or receiving any news accounts of the trial. The e-mail messages and the recent testimony show that Ms. Martin provided testimony and advice to seven witnesses.Ms. Martin's mother said her impression was that her daughter found her work at the Transportation Security Administration ""not the most satisfying or rewarding type job"" because it did not involve any big cases. Her current salary, according to a government employee database, is about $120,000 a year.Others, some speaking for attribution and others not, said they could see why Ms. Martin would find herself in trouble.Claudio Manno, who at the time of the Sept. 11 attack was the assistant administrator for security at the F.A.A., testified Tuesday that Ms. Martin had taken up too much time second-guessing him and bombarding him with e-mail messages and requests.""She tended to go off target and wasted our time,"" Mr. Manno said. ""We didn't think it was pertinent.""A. P. Pishevar, a Maryland lawyer who tangled with Ms. Martin in another case, said her conduct in that case ""sticks out like a sore thumb.""According to court records, she led an effort on behalf of the government to try to intervene in a defamation, discrimination and malicious prosecution lawsuit brought against Lufthansa by one of Mr. Pishevar's clients. The client was Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, an Iranian-born doctor, now an American citizen and associate professor of medicine at U.C.L.A. who was arrested and spent a night in jail after complaining about discriminatory treatment by Lufthansa officials at Dulles International Airport.Lufthansa tried to have the case dismissed by filing a secret motion that said it had detained Mr. Kalantar to follow a secret F.A.A. security directive. According to court records, Ms. Martin urged Lufthansa to withhold the summary judgment motion and the security directive from both Mr. Kalantar and his lawyer, Mr. Pishevar.Court records show that Ms. Martin said to one Lufthansa lawyer that ordinarily much of the evidence would be available to lawyers for a plaintiff. But she said the government sought to keep all the material from Mr. Pishevar, an American citizen and member of the bar in Washington, Maryland and the United States Supreme Court, because he had worked for an organization that fights discrimination in the United States against Iranians.Judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr. of the Federal District Court in Washington ultimately denied the effort to dismiss the case and directed the government to turn over the material, which remains under seal, Mr. Pishevar said. The case has not yet been set for trial.Mr. Pishevar said he still felt numb from his experience with Ms. Martin, who he said was ""from behind the scenes, trying to pull many of the strings.""Told about the latest developments in the Moussaoui case, Mr. Pishevar paused, then said, ""Res ipsa loquitur,"" a Latin legal term meaning, ""The thing speaks for itself.""Others describe a more positive experience with Ms. Martin.One of her earliest assignments was to monitor the trial brought by the survivors of those who died when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. Her main job, according to a news account at the time and a lawyer involved in the case, was to get the judge to close the courtroom any time sensitive information was to come out.James P. Kreindler, an aviation lawyer representing the survivors, said he could not account for what had happened in the Moussaoui trial. ""When one is caught up in a massive bureaucracy, you may lose part of your perspective,"" Mr. Kreindler said. ""She may have lost a proper perspective on the proper role for any attorney involved in either the criminal or the civil justice system.""""Carla is in my experience certainly not a bad person,"" he added, ""and this is a very, very unfortunate thing to see happen.""'"
"'06-03-15,'1','How big a loser could depend on which of several versions of the idea, ranging in cost from $162 million to $600 million, is selected. The so-called fare-box recovery -- the percentage of operating costs paid by fares -- would be only 11 percent under a $291 million plan advocated by the state's Transportation Strategy Board. The State Department of Transportation expects a total of 2,428 people to ride the 62-mile line each day by the year 2025, though some estimates say ridership could reach 5,000.A scaled down version of that proposal by Mrs. Rell, a Republican, would cost just $162 million, with $16 million coming from the federal government. Her aides said her version would save money by refurbishing older cars instead of buying new ones and putting off plans to build a maintenance facility for the line.The more expensive the project, the higher the operating costs. For instance, operating costs under Mrs. Rell's plan would be about $8.5 million each year, and $9 million under the strategy board's proposal.Mrs. Rell's plan follows a $1.3 billion measure she pushed through the legislature last year that added 342 new cars to the Metro-North New Haven Line, spent $300 million for a new rail maintenance facility for that line and paid for improvements to some interstate highways.Connecticut is currently served by the New Haven Line, which has branches to New Canaan, Danbury and Waterbury, and by Shore Line East, which runs from New Haven to New London. No commuter lines serve the Hartford area, which one transportation consultant famously called a ""cul-de-sac.""Despite the predictions of low ridership, supporters and some experts say similar projects across the country have generated new riders through the business and housing development they stimulate and by providing frequent, reliable service that eventually persuades suburban drivers to take the train, even if their destination is not a center city.Planners say the new rail line is critical to creating what they call a ""virtuous cycle"" -- helping reduce suburban sprawl by encouraging ""transit-oriented development"" around new commuter stations while helping the state compete in the region with New Jersey, where commuter rail lines lace the state.Some advocates see the proposed commuter line as a vindication of rail over the Interstate highway system, which expanded so rapidly here and elsewhere in the 1950's.Wayne Drummond, the president of the New Haven Railroad Historical and Technical Association, said ""it was kind of a shocker"" when Mrs. Rell backed the new rail line in her budget address. For years, he said, ""Everybody wanted to lay concrete. Everybody wanted a car. Now the roads are all filled up.""Mr. Drummond, a retired New York police officer who fell in love with trains while growing up in the Bronx, echoed some of the same points planners make when they promote the new rail line: ""No eminent domain, no condemnation of properties, no one screeching about the environment.""For all its ambition, Mrs. Rell's transportation proposal, which also includes a $300 million commuter ""busway"" between New Britain and Hartford, may be the most modest one at the Capitol this year. James A. Amann, the House speaker and a Democrat, wants to spend more than $5 billion on projects ranging from the new rail line to busways to highway construction and improvements to Metro-North. The president pro tempore of the Senate, Donald E. Williams Jr., also a Democrat, supports the rail line as well as expanding rail freight.'"
"'06-03-15,'1','The collaboration between a government-subsidized company from Europe and state-owned aircraft manufacturers in China would be a striking example of the new prominence of state enterprises worldwide -- a development that has worried some critics in the United States.The recent uproar over a Dubai-controlled company that was blocked from acquiring the operations of six American ports illustrates the political sensitivities of such cases. The company, DP World, defused an outcry in Congress by agreeing to divest itself of its American holdings.Aircraft technology has long raised security concerns in the United States because of its capacity for military use. Putting an assembly line in China would add to those concerns, analysts said.""Any major investment in Chinese production facilities by Airbus will be used in the U.S. Congress to demonstrate a dangerous looseness in the sharing of sensitive technology,"" said Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute, a policy lobbying group in Arlington, Va.""No matter what they say,"" he added, ""it is one step further down the path toward Chinese technology parity with the West.""Airbus, owned by an alliance of European aerospace companies and based in Toulouse, France, has said it is well aware of these arguments, but that a final assembly line in China would not pose a danger.Publicly, Airbus has said only that it is considering a number of Chinese cities for a plant to produce A320's. It has not said which cities, nor has it committed itself to an agreement.""We are looking at sites,"" a spokeswoman for Airbus, Barbara Kracht, said. ""Locations are being investigated, and until things are finalized, we won't discuss the various options.""The plant would essentially clamp together parts of the A320, a small part of the manufacturing process. More than half the components, including technology-rich elements like the cockpit, would be made in Europe and flown to China. The two senior executives close to Airbus said the portion of work at the China plant would represent 4 percent to 5 percent of the value of the aircraft.Even some traditionally sharp critics of China, like Larry M. Wortzel, the chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said the final assembly of A320's in China would be unlikely to transfer militarily important technology to the Chinese.If anything, he said in an interview, it might teach China's aviation industry better quality control.The transfer of secrets for the fabrication of high-grade alloys for jet engine manufacture or of certain composite materials -- not moves that Airbus has said it would consider -- would be more of an issue.""It would not pay to transfer that technology to China, but assembly -- I don't have a problem with that,"" Mr. Wortzel said.Airbus has put China at the center of its expansion plans, aiming to capture half of a market that it thinks could nearly double, to 1,790 aircraft, by 2022. Airbus has 344 planes in service in China, Hong Kong and Macao, but Boeing still dominates, with nearly two-thirds of the market.In December, China placed an order for 150 A320's with a list price of close to $10 billion. China and Airbus announced the order during a visit to France by China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, when Airbus pledged to consider the production line.Analysts interpreted the announcement as a quid pro quo, showing the lengths to which Airbus has had to go to break into the Chinese market, despite being active there since 1985.George Behan, a spokesman for Representative Norman Dicks, a Democrat from Washington State, where Boeing's commercial aircraft division is based, said he saw little surprise in Airbus's moves: ""This is Airbus's modus operandi, the way they intend to compete with Boeing internationally.""Boeing has no plans to build a production line in China, but it has still won orders to supply 150 of its 737's to Chinese carriers. Seventy of those are firm contracts and the rest commitments. Like the A320, the 737 is a single-aisle aircraft suitable for short-haul domestic routes.Boeing has also booked orders from the Chinese for 60 of its new medium-size double-aisle plane, the 787 -- with parts of it to be manufactured in Japan. The carriers include Air China, Shanghai Airlines, Hainan Airlines, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines.For Europe, Airbus is also a potent tool to cultivate commercial ties with China. Chinese leaders and President Jacques Chirac of France have celebrated visits to each other's capitals by signing aircraft deals.Beyond the assembly line, Airbus has pledged to buy more aircraft parts from Chinese manufacturers, increasing its procurement to $120 million a year by 2010 from $14.5 million in 2003. Airbus and the China Aviation Industry Corporation have opened an engineering center, which will eventually employ 500 engineers, working on a new Airbus plane, the A350.Analysts said, however, that Airbus might not gain much profit from assembling a plane like the A320 in China. Single-aisle planes tend to have thinner profit margins, and less advanced technology, than twin-aisle planes like the new A380 super-jumbo or Boeing's 787 and 747.The demand for planes in China is so strong, said a person close to Airbus, that it could run its Chinese assembly line at full throttle and still have to supply A320's from its European factories.Airbus, however, will have to contend with workers in France and Germany, who fear the loss of skilled jobs to China. Anticipating that, the company said last month that it would add 1,250 jobs in Germany this year, mostly at its Hamburg plant, where it also assembles A320's.Unlike cars, planes cost very little to deliver -- they are simply fueled and flown there. But shipping bulky aircraft parts long distances to assembly plants can be very expensive.So while automakers like Toyota and Honda have built factories in the United States, aircraft manufacturers have generally preferred to keep production near their bases of operations -- Seattle in Boeing's case, and Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany, in Airbus's case.""Everything else being equal, you would never choose to put a production line in China,"" said Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.While tirelessly marketing its planes in China, Boeing has shown no enthusiasm for assembling jetliners there. But like Airbus, which buys emergency exit doors for the A320 from a supplier in Shenyang, Boeing sees good reasons to buy a range of parts in China for single-aisle jets.It is buying 737 horizontal stabilizers, made in Shanghai, and Boeing 737 vertical fins and trailing edge wing ribs, manufactured in Xian.As Robert Laird, Boeing's vice president for sales of commercial aircraft in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and the Philippines, puts it: ""We have seen the strategic importance of China both for our aircraft and as a supplier for parts.""'"
"'06-03-15,'1','But that plan was upset by the American decision to vote no, announced by John R. Bolton, the United States ambassador, on Feb. 27.Since then, major human rights groups had mounted a global lobbying campaign to try to persuade the United States to reconsider, and the European Union had sent pledges that its members would keep objectionable candidates off the panel.Mr. Bolton said the text should be renegotiated, but Mr. Eliasson resisted the idea, predicting that such action would open a ""Pandora's box"" of suggestions from countries that oppose stricter human rights standards.The council was proposed a year ago by Secretary General Kofi Annan with terms that would effectively bar such countries from joining the panel, but in the version that emerged last month after long negotiations and refinements, those guarantees were weakened.The proposal calls for a council of 47 members instead of the current commission's 53. It would have new restrictions on membership, the means to make timely interventions in crises and a year-round presence, with three meetings a year lasting a total of at least 10 weeks.The Geneva-based commission meets once a year for six weeks, and this year's session, scheduled to have begun Monday, was postponed until next week to permit negotiators in New York to try to settle the dispute with the United States.The council proposal calls for direct elections of members by the General Assembly and sets up ways of evicting those found guilty of abuse. But it dropped a crucial element of Mr. Annan's original plan: a requirement that new members be elected by two-thirds of those voting.Developing nations objected to that provision, and Mr. Eliasson negotiated a compromise: approval by a majority of Assembly members -- or 96 votes -- replacing the current simple majority of those voting.Mr. Burns said that while the United States would not back the council's creation on Wednesday, it would not shun it in the future.""Despite the fact that we aren't going to be able to vote for creation of the council, we do want to support human rights at the U.N.,"" he said. ""So we will work with the council, we will seek to support it when we can, to strengthen it, and we certainly won't do anything to harm it.""'"

"'06-03-15,'1','On Wednesday, Gov. Jon S. Corzine is expected to propose changes to the Schools Construction Corporation, when he releases a report from a committee he appointed to study its problems.The committee, it seems, had its work cut out for it. Recent reports by the state auditor and the inspector general found lax fiscal oversight at the agency and fiascos in school construction: a partly built school now scheduled for demolition on a contaminated site in Trenton; a planned school just yards from a theater that had featured pornographic films in Passaic; and property in Union City, intended for a school, which quadrupled in price after an apartment building rose on it.A report by the state auditor released last week found that even basic safeguards of the public's money were not maintained, with the agency relying heavily on private contractors to manage projects. In those firms, the report found, ""direct salaries were marked up by 94 to 192 percent for the cost of employee benefits, indirect costs and profit.""The report, which covered the period since April 2005, also noted that in two cases, construction managers were paid 40 percent of their construction supervision fees before construction contracts were awarded. It also found that 60 change orders, totaling $45 million, were allowed, using questionable interpretations.Its recommendations sounded more like steps one might take to establish a construction agency, rather than to reform one, and include items that might have been obvious to a first-year accounting student, like creating a strategic plan; paying for work after it is completed, not before; keeping track of checks; and actually cashing them.Land acquisition for a school should come before architectural drawings, it noted: ""It would be more prudent to decide what and where to build before it is designed.""But it is hardly the only document critical of the agency. In a Jan. 12 report, the Office of the Inspector General cited a case in which a vendor may have been paid up to $3.4 million more than the fee approved by the agency's board.The inspector also found that school construction employees had created false documents indicating that board approval was not required for the fees stipulated, and that the employees had also expedited a bill from the management firm for $1.6 million by breaking it into four invoices, for which no documentation was provided.Neither the auditor's office nor the inspector general's office would release the names of specific vendors or projects, saying the investigations were continuing.Assemblyman William D. Payne, who represents most of Newark and all of Hillside, called it criminal that the state could not yet provide adequate educational facilities for poor children almost 40 years after the beginning of the Abbott v. Burke case, a state Supreme Court decision that ordered the state to increase financing for urban districts to bring them up to a par with suburban districts.""Money was wasted because of a lack of proper management and tremendous inefficiencies, and there was no oversight,"" he said, adding that management costs for schools in Abbott districts under the construction corporation were 45 percent higher than in other districts.""They went into the candy jar and took out as much as they could,"" he said.The Schools Construction Corporation was created in 2002 by Gov. James E. McGreevey after the state Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that school facilities in poor districts should be comparable to those in rich districts. But in March 2005, the inspector general recommended that the agency stop spending money until it adopted internal reforms, saying it was ""vulnerable to mismanagement, fiscal malfeasance, conflicts of interest and waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars."" In July, the agency announced that it was running out of money after building just an eighth of the schools on its list.Scott A. Weiner, the governor's special counsel for school construction, who on Monday took over as the transitional chief executive of the corporation -- its fourth leader in five years -- said the agency had built ""a very credibly reliable system of financial management and control"" since last summer, when Gov. Richard J. Codey turned his attention to problems in the agency.The report being released by Governor Corzine on Wednesday is expected to include recommendations to tighten the controls further, and possibly to reorganize the Schools Construction Corporation, perhaps within another state agency.But for Dr. Robert Holster, superintendent of the Passaic public schools, who is waiting for four schools to be built, the clock is ticking. Fewer than half of his elementary schools have libraries, he said, and few have labs.""We've got to be on the same playing field as every other child,"" Dr. Holster said.'"
"'06-03-15,'1','The American Family Association claimed responsibility for Ford's move, and the automaker did little at first to challenge the claim. But after discussions with representatives from gay and lesbian groups, Ford reversed its decision.The American Family Association and 43 other groups then accused Ford of breaking its word and called on the company to stop the ads and end contributions to gay causes.""We cannot, and will not, sit by as Ford supports a social agenda aimed at the destruction of the family,"" the groups wrote in a letter to the chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr.On Monday, the family association and 18 other groups reinstated the boycott. ""Ford reneged on the agreement to stop funding homosexual organizations and activities and advertising in homosexual media,"" the association chairman, the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, said in a statement.But so far, Ford plans to keep its policy regarding advertising in the gay media as is. ""We've always been open to dialogue, but our position is that we will continue treating all with respect,"" a Ford spokeswoman, Kathleen Vokes, said.Boycotts are a common technique for groups to show disapproval of corporate policies, but the actions often struggle to garner support.While conservative groups have said their boycotts have persuaded corporations to change their marketing techniques, their influence seems questionable. Despite an announcement from the American Family Association last year that Procter & Gamble was no longer advertising on ""Will & Grace"" and ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,"" the company continued to advertise on the shows.""We didn't change anything,"" a Procter & Gamble spokesman, Doug Shelton, said.Ford has also rejected the association's claims that it persuaded the automaker to change its position on advertising in gay media. In May, the association started its first boycott of Ford for its support of gay causes. The group started a Web site called BoycottFord.com, which has been reactivated, and said it sent out 2.2 million e-mail messages urging people not to buy Ford cars and trucks.Ford then reached out to the group, which agreed to suspend the boycott while the two sides talked. Late last year, the company withdrew its Jaguar and Land Rover ads from gay publications but left its Volvo ads unchanged, and the family association declared victory.After an outcry from gay advocacy groups, Ford reversed itself, saying it would run corporate ads that showcased all eight of its brands -- Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin and Mazda -- in gay media. It also reaffirmed its support of gay causes.Advertising in gay media has been on the rise. Rivendell Media, an advertising representative for gay and lesbian media outlets in Mountainside, N.J., said spending in publications aimed at gay audiences rose 2 percent in 2005, to $212 million. From 2003 to 2004, spending increased 28 percent. This year, Rivendell expects another large increase.""Smart companies would say it's all about being inclusive anyway,"" the chief executive of Rivendell, Todd Evans, said. ""Its so funny how laissez-faire it is now to advertise to this market.""'"

"'06-03-16,'1','Not that Benjamin Millepied, 27, a principal with New York City Ballet, is necessarily near retirement. But he seems to be a restlessly curious artist, and Tuesday night he put himself before the public as dancer, choreographer and impresario in a generous program consisting of four world premieres. The run of his Benjamin Millepied & Company continues at the Joyce Theater through Sunday.The Joyce is normally a bastion of modern (and sometimes, non-Western) dance, but this event attracted the ballet crowd. The reason was Mr. Millepied's own ballet career and his ability to round up dancers from City Ballet and, from American Ballet Theater, Gillian Murphy and Ethan Stiefel, though Mr. Stiefel had to withdraw with the same tender-knee problem that had curtailed his role in the recent ""Kings of the Dance"" program.The result was not quite the hybridization of ballet and modern technique that some might have expected or dreaded.The most complete blend came at the end, in the weakest piece of the night, ""Phrases, Now"" by Andonis Foniadakis. Mr. Foniadakis spent two years with Maurice Béjart in Lausanne, Switzerland, then six with the Lyon Opera Ballet. Europeans seem to like their music loud and their lighting stark and dark, and Mr. Foniadakis did not disappoint. Set to an annoyingly simplistic (if loud) score by Julien Tarride, the dance consisted of four City Ballet men -- Tyler Angle, Craig Hall, Sean Suozzi and Mr. Millepied -- and one woman, Ula Sickle, who has worked in mostly modern companies all over Europe.The five were dressed in sparkly tops (a minidress, in Ms. Sickle's case) and dark pants (underpants, in Ms. Sickle's case). At first it looked like a typically brutalist exercise of the men beating up on the woman. Then it seemed that everyone was beating up on everyone else. In the end, two of the men were left collapsed and Ms. Sickle walked off in cool triumph. It was all kind of cheesy.'"
"'06-03-16,'1','Now, though, these reluctant suitors are being drawn together by the fear that Europe's biggest share market, the London Stock Exchange, may soon be swallowed up by an American market.The London exchange rejected an informal offer of $4.1 billion from Nasdaq last Friday. But Nasdaq's campaign is just starting. Its executives are traveling to London to meet with the exchange's largest shareholder, Threadneedle Investments, to try to win support for their offer.The New York Stock Exchange is also on the prowl for acquisitions, and because it recently began to trade as a public company, the NYSE Group, it has a ready currency for deals. Analysts and others say it is waiting in the wings. ""Anything could happen at this stage,"" said Guy de Blonay of New Star Asset Management in London.Europe's major markets, he noted, have managed to maintain an uneasy power balance for the last few years. The same conflicts that have thwarted a Deutsche Börse-Euronext deal so far have scuttled several efforts by Deutsche Börse to acquire the London Stock Exchange.But the economic logic behind mergers is compelling: by pooling the trading of groups of stocks, bonds or derivatives, the exchanges can offer lower prices to buyers and sellers while making more money on the increased trading volume. They can also extract savings by combining operations. The moves to consolidate also reflect the increasingly borderless nature of stock and bond trading in a time of digital technology.An acquisition of the London Stock Exchange would upset the balance in Europe, analysts said, by leaving the Continent's exchanges at a distinct disadvantage in their ability to cut costs.Adding to the pressure, Deutsche Börse and Euronext each have hedge funds as shareholders. Last year, the funds engineered a successful campaign to oust Deutsche Börse's chief executive, Werner G. Seifert, after he mounted a $2.5 billion takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange.Merging Euronext and Deutsche Börse would not revive those concerns, a senior executive at Deutsche Börse said, because a deal would probably involve a swap of shares rather than cash, and then adding, ""The business is so big that there is a lot to go around.""Analysts say the hedge fund shareholders would support this merger.So, apparently, will political leaders in Germany and France, which is no small consideration at a time when Europe faces resurgent protectionism. France, Spain and Poland are trying to block foreign takeovers of their companies. On Tuesday, though, President Jacques Chirac of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany gave their blessings to this cross-border plan.Deutsche Börse, with a market value nearly double that of Euronext, is likely to insist that the headquarters of the merged company be in Frankfurt. But it has floated the idea of consolidating the derivatives operations in London, where Euronext's derivatives subsidiary, Euronext.liffe, is based.Derivatives would be by far the biggest franchise of a combined Deutsche Börse and Euronext. With annual trading volume now estimated at 1.54 billion contracts, the successor company would be solidly ahead of its next larger rivals, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.For trading firms, the size of the market is much more important than where the senior management is based. ""As long as we can access it, I'm perfectly happy,"" said Steven Wood, the head of trading at Schroders in London, which uses brokers in dealing. ""Everything is pretty virtual at the moment. If there is a consolidated exchange, it makes it easier for us and the brokers.""'"

Joining the United States were Israel, the Marshall Islands and Palau. Belarus, Iran and Venezuela abstained.Secretary General Kofi Annan, who first proposed the council a year ago, hailed the decision, saying, ""This gives the United Nations the chance -- a much needed chance -- to make a new beginning in its work for human rights around the world.""But John R. Bolton, the United States ambassador, said the proposed council was ""not sufficiently improved"" over the commission, which has been faulted for permitting notorious rights abusers to join.""We must not let the victims of human rights abuses throughout the world think that U.N. member states were willing to settle for 'good enough,' "" Mr. Bolton said in a statement after the vote.

"'06-03-16,'1','Oxfam International, the relief organization, said yesterday that it had temporarily suspended its operations in a district at the northwestern tip of Sumatra, in the Indonesian archipelago -- the region hardest hit by the tsunami in December 2004 -- after a routine internal audit uncovered financial irregularities there.The group said it had started an investigation to try to learn exactly what happened in the district, Aceh Besar, and promised to do everything it could to recover any money determined to be missing. A spokeswoman for the group said it estimated losses in the tens of thousands of dollars out of a 2005 budget of about $48 million.""Because Oxfam strongly believes in transparency and accountability, we decided not to wait until completing our investigation before making the matter public,"" the group said yesterday in a statement. It said it was continuing critical relief work in the area, such as distributing potable water and removing rubbish, but had frozen the work of rebuilding houses and restoring the livelihoods of tsunami victims. ""We expect to have restarted our work within a few weeks at most,"" Oxfam said.It is rare for any nonprofit group to make such problems public, much less before exhausting internal queries, but more organizations are striving to demonstrate their attention to good stewardship because donors have placed a premium on knowing how their contributions are spent and regulators have begun to intensify oversight.""Give Oxfam credit for discovering the problem through their own procedures and then reporting it publicly as one of the steps toward rectification,"" said Rick Cohen, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a research and watchdog group. ""That's not the usual process among nonprofits.""Oxfam's field office in Aceh Besar was one of six in Aceh Province. The other five continue to operate and appear to be free of the problems found in Aceh Besar, Oxfam said.'"

"'06-03-16,'1','The World Health Organization has confirmed 173 cases of the avian flu virus in humans, most of whom had close contact with diseased birds. Of those, 93 people died, almost all of them in Asia. Vietnam has been particularly hard hit. In January, though, the first human cases were confirmed in Turkey -- far from the origin of the virus in central China.And in recent weeks, officials in several European and African countries have confirmed the virus in wild or domestic flocks of birds. While avian influenza does not now readily infect humans or spread among them, scientists are worried that the virus could soon acquire that ability through normal biological mixing, setting off a human pandemic.Yet despite this threat, many companies have only rudimentary contingency plans in place. In a survey of more than 100 executives in the United States by Deloitte & Touche, released this January, two-thirds said their companies had not yet prepared adequately for avian flu, and most had no one specifically in charge of such a plan.""Business is not prepared for even a moderate avian flu epidemic,"" the report concluded.In contrast, corporations in Southeast Asia have made more headway, in part because the avian influenza virus has been circulating in birds in Asia for years. Also, Asian companies learned in the 2003 outbreak of Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, that even a small infectious outbreak could have devastating consequences, bringing commerce in Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing to a near standstill.A recent survey of 80 corporate officials at an avian flu seminar held by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong found that nearly every company had someone in charge of avian flu policy, and 60 percent had clearly stated plans that could be put in place immediately. These included provisions for employees to work at home to prevent the spread of disease in the office, and for relaying warnings to workers by text messages to mobile phones.The lack of corporate preparedness elsewhere has ""enormous implications,"" the Deloitte report said.""A pandemic flu outbreak in any part of the world would potentially cripple supply chains, dramatically reduce available labor pools,"" the report said. ""In a world where the global supply chain and real-time inventories determine most everything we do, down to the food available for purchase in our grocery stores, one begins to understand the importance of advanced planning.""Among the prepared, HSBC, a global bank that started as the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and remains the dominant bank in Hong Kong, has an especially detailed plan for avian flu, drawing on its experience with SARS. The company has been making preparations for employees to work from home, but is also preparing to divide work among multiple sites, an approach that appeared in only 37 percent of the plans in the American Chamber survey.The hope is that if the flu races through the staff at one site, another site may be spared. During SARS, the bank activated an emergency center at the opposite end of Hong Kong's harbor and sent 50 bond traders there with instructions that they were not to see anyone from the head office even at social occasions.In the survey of companies conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, provisions of corporate contingency plans ranged from allowing some employees to work from home -- the most popular strategy, included in 72 percent of avian flu contingency plans -- to the outright closing of offices, included in 32.5 percent of plans.Other methods to prevent spread include canceling face-to-face meetings in favor of teleconferencing, and installing germ-killing hand washes in offices. Many companies also proposed more stringent health monitoring of employees, families and company visitors. In Singapore, throughout the SARS outbreak, many businesses required temperature checks before entering buildings, as a way to screen out those who might be ill.Some of the most important planning involves not employee health, but how to continue to deliver vital services in a crisis. Time Warner's Cable News Network is making preparations to stay on the air from different locations.""If there should be something that quarantines the production center here in Hong Kong, we could hand off to London and Atlanta,"" Stephen Marcopoto, president of Turner International Asia Pacific, a Time Warner unit in Hong Kong, said.Time Warner is also working to create a mechanized cart that could automatically load tape after tape into a satellite transmission system, so it could keep stations like Cartoon Network on the air -- a boon if children were homebound for months.But many corporate plans are painted in fairly broad brush strokes, part of general disaster planning. And many companies refuse to discuss details.""As other global players, we have a global business continuity program in place that covers a wide range of contingencies, including flu pandemic,"" said Klaus Thoma, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, who said that details were privileged company information.Likewise, FedEx, the express delivery service, has been ""monitoring the situation for some time,"" said Sandra Munoz, a spokeswoman for the company in New York, noting that FedEx had ""the flexibility within our system to make the necessary adjustments to minimize any impact to our customers, regardless of the situation."" Without going into details, FedEx said that it had developed contingency plans ""down to every district or market here in Asia Pacific,"" said John Allison, a company representative in Hong Kong.But Mr. Layton says he is worried that many companies are not thinking about the problems that pandemic flu raises. ""They are adapting existing risk-management strategies, which are fine, but they really have to go beyond that,"" he said.But even in hot spots in Asia, not all companies are readying themselves for an outbreak. In Guangdong Province in south China, which was the epicenter of SARS and where avian flu is already widespread, a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce found that 54 percent of members had made no preparations.""We're trying to push them to develop plans,"" said Harley Seyedin, the Guangdong chamber's president.'"
"'06-03-16,'1','With hurricane season less than three months away, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said in an interview that he too was worried about the situation. Not only are the trailers lightweight, they are often placed next to partly reconstructed homes and debris that can turn into dangerous projectiles when the wind picks up, Mr. Chertoff said.Since the travel trailers used by the Bartholomews and others are intended to be portable, they are mounted on wheels so they can be pulled by large pickup trucks until, on reaching their destination, they are jacked up and mounted on concrete blocks. Designed initially for recreational use, the units -- 35 feet long, 8 eight feet wide and weighing about 6,000 pounds -- are much smaller, lighter and less expensive than so-called mobile or manufactured homes, which are typically emplaced permanently.More than 87,100 families in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama are living in the FEMA trailers, while only some 2,300 are in the sturdier mobile homes.FEMA ordered far more travel trailers than mobile homes after the hurricane because the trailers could be towed to a homeowner's property and quickly dropped into place. Being portable, they are not generally covered by building codes and not explicitly banned in flood zones.For further security along the windy Gulf Coast, FEMA secured the trailers to the ground with steel straps that connect to four corner anchors, although many homeowners have installed their own trailers, in some cases without anchoring them at all.The added security for the FEMA trailers means that while they may vibrate or rock in the wind, they should not be vulnerable to tipping over until winds exceed 75 miles per hour or so, said Mark C. Smith, a spokesman for the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. That speed is typical during intense tropical storms, extremely severe thunderstorms and all hurricanes. (FEMA agrees that 75 m.p.h. should be the threshold for evacuation, although Eddie Abbott of Gulf Stream Coach, a trailer manufacturer, said he thought an anchored trailer would be stable at higher wind speeds.)By comparison, new coastal homes must be able to withstand winds of up to 110 to 150 m.p.h., depending on location, said Gene Humphrey, an official in the Mississippi fire marshal's office.The potential hazards with the trailers are obvious across the gulf region. In Myrtle Grove, La., north of Port Sulphur, FEMA trailers sit on the ground below houses that are suspended on stilts to avoid routine floodwaters that would swamp the trailers. Elsewhere, they have been installed just a few feet away from homes that remain ripped wide open from Hurricane Katrina.Add wind, and the environment can quickly become treacherous. Jimmy Cappiello, a retired oil platform operator who now lives part time in a Port Sulphur trailer, saw sheet metal, trash, wood planks and even the carport from a nearby house flying during a recent storm. He waited it out in his pickup, which he felt was more solid than the trailer.""I ain't taking no chances,"" Mr. Cappiello said. ""I don't feel safe in it.""In early February, the New Orleans police reported that at least one FEMA trailer was ripped from its anchors when a tornado passed through. And last July, in Pensacola, Fla., a number of trailers installed after a 2004 hurricane were damaged or flipped when Hurricane Dennis hit.Mr. Humphrey, from the Mississippi fire marshal's office, said he realized that many families wanted a trailer next to their damaged houses. But FEMA, he said, made a mistake in installing the lightweight trailers, instead of the heavier mobile homes, in this high-wind zone on the coast.""This is pretty serious,"" he said. ""It never should have happened.""With so many trailers and damaged homes along the gulf, and with some levees weakened, local officials will most likely call for coastal evacuations more frequently this year, said Mr. Smith, the Louisiana official. ""The key,"" he said, ""is going to be trying to figure out how to word it so people don't get a false sense of security, but people don't panic, either.""Mr. Chertoff said he had already spoken with officials at FEMA and the Defense Department to make sure that federal agencies are ready if needed to help in evacuations.""We are going to say, 'We want to see the plan, and we want to see what the capabilities are,' "" Mr. Chertoff said. "" 'And if you don't have the capabilities, we need to know that, because we are going to make sure we have those capabilities in place.' ""In recent weeks, some coastal cities, including Biloxi and Ocean City, Miss., have decided that when severe storms approach, they will open temporary shelters where people living in travel trailers or damaged homes can wait out the bad weather.""We have to be on our toes sooner,"" said Ashley Roth, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. ""The trailers are just not safe to stay in, in the event of severe weather.""Some trailer residents along the coast in Mississippi and Louisiana said they would not be reluctant to head for more solid shelter. ""They won't have to tell me -- we will be moving out,"" said Daisy Lightell, 57, of Happy Jack, La., north of Port Sulphur, who lives in a FEMA trailer with her husband. ""Otherwise, we could end up in 'The Wizard of Oz.' ""Above all, officials want to discourage residents from trying to evacuate with their trailer in tow, a circumstance that could create an even worse hazard.""I imagine there are going to be some people who consider it,"" said Jesse St. Amant, emergency preparedness director for Plaquemines Parish, La. ""But I hope they think better of it. Trying to haul a travel trailer during an evacuation would be cumbersome and dangerous.""'"

Kalikow, the president of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, responded angrily yesterday that the dispute should be resolved through binding arbitration.Mr. Kalikow also criticized the state's Public Employment Relations Board, which can order arbitration, for not doing so immediately after the January vote by Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union.""While I am always hopeful a voluntary agreement can be reached, the fact is that two months have already been wasted and the public is entitled to know that an orderly process pursuant to state law is under way,"" Mr. Kalikow said in a statement. ""Put simply, this dispute should be sent to arbitration.""Mr. Kalikow's remarks did not rule out the possibility that the union's 33,700 subway and bus workers would be allowed a second vote on the contract. ""I wouldn't say he is saying, 'No way,' "" said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the authority.Roger Toussaint, the president of Local 100, suggested a second vote on Tuesday amid a petition drive and widespread calls from his members urging him to do so. He is expected to submit his proposal to the union's executive board on Friday.Officials of the labor relations board did not respond to telephone requests for comment yesterday.Mr. Kalikow's comments, which could signal an intent to stake out a forceful position if more direct negotiations take place with Local 100, also reflected frustration over discussions on Tuesday with state mediators, according to an M.T.A. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private.Those discussions had been called by the state panel to give both sides one last chance to come to terms before arbitration was ordered. The talks were not conducted between union and management negotiators, but were instead a series of back-and-forth exchanges in which the mediators met independently with both sides.'"
"'06-03-16,'1','The government is also under substantial pressure from the European Union to hand over the former commander of the Bosnian Serb army, Gen. Ratko Mladic, as a condition for continuing talks on admitting Serbia to the Union.A mass outpouring of grief for the man widely blamed for the loss of as many as 250,000 lives and the destruction of Yugoslavia would be the worst message to the West, in the minds of many government officials. It would seem that in death, Mr. Milosevic, a onetime Communist Party functionary, is still angering opponents who blame him for provoking three Balkan wars.Political analysts here say they fully expect the Socialist Party to try to capitalize on any pro-Milosevic sentiment, though the party received barely 5 percent of the vote in the latest Serbian parliamentary elections, in 2003, after dominating the republic throughout the 1990's.The ultranationalist Radical Party, a former Milosevic ally and now holder of the largest number of seats in the Serbian Parliament, has also lent its weight to the funeral preparations. The party's leader in Serbia, Tomislav Nikolic, called on retired members of the police and army to pay their respects in uniform.""They will bring people in from all over Serbia,"" said Bratislav Grubacic, the editor of the VIP news agency and a political commentator. He added, ""And with coverage from all the foreign TV networks, we shall look like complete idiots,"" pining for a leader whom a majority of Serbs voted out in 2000.But on Wednesday evening it was not clear where or even if the government would allow the body to be displayed in public.Socialist Party officials warned that there was nothing the government could do to stop its preparations. ""The government cannot interfere with people freely expressing their respects for the late president,"" said Vladimir Krsljanin, Mr. Milosevic's former foreign policy adviser.The funeral itself has been the subject of debate, with the Milosevic family vacillating between a burial in Serbia or in Moscow, where his widow and son live.Lawyers for the family sought guarantees from the government that it would not arrest his widow, Mirjana Markovic, who is accused of selling apartments illegally. Although a warrant for her arrest was temporarily withdrawn on Tuesday, the requirement that she appear in court was not, but ultimately the family decided to hold the funeral in Serbia. Ms. Markovic will not attend.Mr. Milosevic's death appears to have reinforced the already strong hostility on the part of Serbs to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.Even Serbia's leading reforming politician, President Boris Tadic, said in an interview on Tuesday with The Associated Press that he held the court responsible for the death, although he added that it would not affect the country's cooperation with the tribunal.Mr. Tadic's view appears to have gotten some support from Dr. Leo Bokeria, a Russian heart surgeon reviewing the results of an official autopsy conducted by Dutch doctors. Dr. Bokeria, director of the Bakulev Center for Cardiovascular Surgery in Moscow, told reporters in The Hague that Mr. Milosevic's death could have been prevented.""That's my opinion, that his death was preventable,"" the doctor said. ""Absolutely. Because he had a pathology which is treated at anyplace in the world at the moment.""The Russians, strong allies of the Serbs, agree. In Moscow, the Russian Parliament passed a declaration dismissing the work of the Hague tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and requesting that its operations halt immediately.But Mr. Grubacic, the editor and commentator, said that over time, ""Milosevic's death won't change the direction of the government.""""You'll see -- in two weeks' time you will have the same pressure to hand over Mladic,"" he said. ""Everything will have gone back to normal.""'"
"'06-03-16,'1','So Cuba, the team that was almost not allowed to compete in this inaugural tournament, the team that looked overmatched while losing by 10 runs to Puerto Rico last Friday and the team that revels in being outsiders, is now an insider. The Cubans, who believe they are the premier team in the world, are only two victories away from proving it.""For you, this might be a surprise,"" Manager Higinio Velez said. ""For us, it's not.""The color of their uniforms worked for the superstitious Cubans, but if they had lost, they would have blamed two men in blue. Two disputed calls helped energize the Puerto Ricans and gave them opportunities to tie the game or grab the lead in the seventh and eighth innings. But Puerto Rico did not capitalize on chance after chance against four pitchers.""I guess, in the end, they played a little better than us,"" Puerto Rico's Carlos Delgado said.With Cuba leading, 4-1, in the seventh and runners on first and third, Ricky Ledee chopped a ball to the second base hole. Second baseman Yulieski Gourriel threw to second for a possible force, but Umpire James Hoye ruled that shortstop Eduardo Paret had pulled his foot off the base before catching the ball. One run scored.The Cubans were outraged. Velez, with a translator by his side, sprinted onto the field shouting, ""No, no."" While Velez screamed, several players popped out of the third-base dugout and yelled, too. Velez was ejected. Replays indicated that Hoye made the correct call.But, after wobbling, the Cubans did not crumble. Bernie Williams hit into a double play that the Cubans felt should have ended the seventh. After Carlos Beltran's run-scoring single to center was bobbled, Ivan Rodriguez, who was on first, was nabbed trying to score the tying run.With singles by Jose Cruz Jr. and Delgado in the eighth, Puerto Rico was percolating again. Pitcher Vicyhoandry Odelin fielded Jose Valentin's roller near the mound, but bounced his throw to first baseman Joan Carlos Pedroso. Pedroso did not catch the ball, but cradled it near his left arm for an error, so Valentin was safe and the bases were filled again.Pedroso jumped up and down and the Cubans complained again, although not as vehemently. Replays seemingly indicated that Pedroso did not have control of the ball. Odelin rebounded and got Alex Cintron to tap into a double play. The Puerto Ricans went quietly in the ninth, with Odelin whiffing Rodriguez to end it.""The Puerto Rican team left their blood on the field,"" Pestano said.Cuba scored on two walks and two groundouts in the first, but Williams responded with a lead-off homer for Puerto Rico. The Cubans scored three in the fourth, including two unearned runs after shortstop Cintron's throwing error.Jose Oquendo, the Puerto Rican manager, said the Cubans had ""five good players any major league team"" would want. Even though the Cubans had security officers shadowing the players, from the hotel to the stadium and park, Velez scoffed at the notion that they were trying to prevent defections.""Whoever wants to go into exile can walk away or stand next to a policeman,"" Velez said. ""We don't have prisoners. Simply, our athletes are besieged because people want to turn them into merchandise. But they want to play for their country.""The Cubans still have the chance to continue playing for their country in this tournament. They wore red uniforms so they could feel, think and play like champions. Now the Cubans have to win two more games to be the champions.'"

"'06-03-17,'1','Dr. Schneider said some patients might conclude from the results of the latest study that Aricept and similar drugs like Reminyl, Exelon and Tacrine were too risky for them or for family members.In the study, the difference between the number of deaths in the group taking Aricept and the comparison group that took placebo pills was statistically significant, meaning the difference was unlikely to have occurred by chance.Aricept is sold by Pfizer and by Eisai, a Japanese pharmaceutical maker. Pfizer reported that the drug had $346 million in sales last year. A Pfizer spokeswoman referred callers to Eisai, which conducted the study.Judee Shuler, an Eisai spokeswoman, said the study results were a statistical fluke. Patients given placebos in the study were unusually healthy, she said, making a comparison with the group taking Aricept unfair. Aricept remains safe, Ms. Shuler said, and the company is not recommending any changes to the drug's label.The study's results are similar to those of a study done some years ago on Reminyl, made by Johnson & Johnson, a drug similar to Aricept. In that study, 2,000 patients with early signs of Alzheimer's disease were followed for two years. Far more of the patients given Reminyl died than did those who received placebos, Dr. Schneider said.No other large trials have found a similar risk, but that does not mean such a risk is absent, Dr. Schneider and other experts said. Few trials have followed patients for long enough, or included enough patients with serious heart problems, to uncover a mild increase in heart risks, the experts agreed.Dr. Rudolph Tanzi, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, said more research was needed.""This study is a concern and should be looked at,"" Dr. Tanzi said, ""but we shouldn't get alarmist quite yet. For people who are treating their loved ones with Aricept, I don't want them to be overly scared.""Even before this latest news, many physicians recommended against giving Aricept, Reminyl, Exelon and Tacrine — which all act similarly — to Alzheimer's patients because they believed that the drugs did not provide enough benefit to merit their expense or risks.Most studies have shown that the drugs can produce small improvements in scores on mental tests, but these gains may not translate into anything helpful in real life.A British study last year found that therapy with Aricept does not delay the onset of disability or the need for nursing home care. The researchers concluded that Aricept had ""disappointingly little overall benefit"" and was not cost-effective.'"
"'06-03-17,'1','Steve Rucchin called it the biggest goal of the Rangers' season.""Hopefully, my most important goal is going to come later this season,"" Jaromir Jagr said after his league-leading 45th goal at 7 minutes 8 seconds of the third period at Madison Square Garden gave the Rangers a 5-4 victory over the Washington Capitals last night, ending the Rangers' season-worst losing streak at six games.With the teams skating four-on-four, Jagr took advantage of the open ice to drive like a freight train around Washington defenseman Shaone Morrisonn and then beat Capitals goaltender Olaf Kolzig for a magnificent goal.Jagr crashed into the end boards after scoring the goal. ""After you score, it doesn't hurt that much,"" he said. ""If he would have made the save, I would have probably cried.""Had the Rangers lost again, they all probably would have done the same.""If we don't get a win here, regardless of what it looks like, I'm not sure where our team's psyche would be,"" Rangers Coach Tom Renney said. ""So it's a very, very important goal, to say the least. And it certainly came from a guy whose back we've been on significantly.""Coming into this season, the Rangers were expected to receive much of their offense from Jagr.Part of the reason the team has been struggling since the Olympic Games break is that Jagr has been hurting (with a sore groin and abdomen) and not scoring nearly as much. Last weekend, Jagr placed the blame for the Rangers' long losing streak squarely on himself.'"
"'06-03-17,'1','Carl Braden was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison, but he served just over seven months before the verdict was overturned in 1956. Anne Braden's case never went to trial.Ms. Braden's account of the case, ""The Wall Between,"" was a finalist for a National Book Award in 1959. In 1999, the University of Tennessee Press published the book in a new edition, with a foreword by Julian Bond.Anne Gambrell McCarty was born in Louisville on July 28, 1924. Her father was a feed salesman, and Anne grew up in Anniston, Ala., where his job took the family. The household was traditional, middle-class and thoroughly invested in the status quo.""The parents were so much like your average white Southerner of that generation,"" Ms. Fosl, a historian at the University of Louisville, said last week in a telephone interview. ""They were just very accepting of Southern racial politics.""In 1954, Anne earned a bachelor's degree in English from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Va., and embarked on a career as a journalist. After stints on Alabama papers, she took a job with The Louisville Times. There, she met Carl Braden, a fellow reporter who was active in progressive politics. They were married in 1948.Ms. Braden, who had begun to embrace liberal humanist ideas as a teenager, joined her husband in politics. Together, they worked on Henry Wallace's campaign for the presidency on the Progressive Party ticket in 1948. In 1957, the couple joined the staff of the Southern Conference Educational Fund, a civil rights organization. Ms. Braden edited its newspaper, The Southern Patriot, until 1974.The Bradens were repeatedly accused of being Communists, and, in 1958, Carl Braden was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Atlanta. Refusing to testify, he was sentenced to a year in prison. Dr. King led the drive for clemency, and Mr. Braden was released in 1962, after serving nine months. Throughout her life, Ms. Braden publicly declined to confirm or deny their membership in the Communist Party.In 1967, the Bradens were again indicted on charges of sedition, for helping to organize a protest against strip mining in eastern Kentucky. That year, in connection with the case, a federal court in Lexington declared the state's antisedition law unconstitutional.Ms. Braden is survived by a son, James, of San Francisco, and a daughter, Elizabeth, of Austin, Tex. Another daughter, Anita, died in childhood.In recent years, Ms. Braden had taught civil rights history at the University of Louisville and at Northern Kentucky University. In 1990, she was the first recipient of the Roger Baldwin Medal of Liberty from the American Civil Liberties Union, awarded for her lifetime contribution to civil liberties.Correction: March 20, 2006, Monday An obituary on Friday about Anne Braden, a civil rights activist of the 1950's, misstated the year of her graduation from Randolph-Macon.

"'06-03-17,'1','At the conference, Microsoft gave a series of demonstrations of the capabilities of its new products. These included phoning in for e-mail and having messages read back using voice recognition and translation technology, searching corporate databases, creating virtual workspaces that automatically sync documents and calendars for team members, and analyzing worldwide sales patterns from an Excel spreadsheet.Several corporate technology executives said the range of capabilities demonstrated was impressive, though they noted that it would require a sizable further commitment to Microsoft products.Ken Bisconti, a vice president in I.B.M.'s software group, said the Microsoft demonstrations, which he saw on a Webcast, were a display of ""more functions than people need or want in a pure Microsoft software environment.""While a huge services company, I.B.M. is also the world's second-largest software company, after Microsoft, with $15 billion in yearly revenue. I.B.M.'s Lotus Notes and Workplace Web-based offerings compete with several of Microsoft's desktop products.Building momentum in the marketplace for Windows Vista and Office 2007 is crucial for Microsoft. The last major release of its Windows desktop operating system was six years ago, and three years ago for the Office suite. Microsoft needs to add new capabilities to stay ahead of free alternatives to its desktop offerings, like the Linux operating system and OpenOffice applications.Microsoft's stock price has barely moved in years, even though its profits have grown by more than 10 percent annually since 2000. Despite its strong performance, investors question its growth prospects.In the long run, products like Microsoft's Xbox video game console could be big winners, Mr. Ballmer said in an interview. ""But for the next two or three years, the real big growth for Microsoft is going to come from the products and scenarios we showed here,"" he said.Microsoft's marketing campaign uses the phrase ""people-ready software"" to describe its new products, meant to underline the long-time Microsoft theme that its software helps individuals do their work more efficiently. Yet the new marketing program is aimed mainly at so-called business decision makers, who determine technology strategy in companies, instead of individual computer users.""This is about explaining the business value proposition of the Microsoft brand,"" said Mich Mathews, senior vice president for marketing.The campaign began yesterday with eight-page advertisements in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and other newspapers. The $500 million to be spent over the next year will include ads on television, newspapers, magazines and online, and for Microsoft-sponsored events. Microsoft's advertising agency is McCann Worldgroup in San Francisco, a unit of McCann Erickson, which is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.Corporations, unlike consumers, can take months or even years to decide what products to buy. So any payoff for Microsoft's marketing investment could stretch out over years. Shares of Microsoft slipped 9 cents yesterday, to close at $27.27.'"
"'06-03-17,'1','HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., March 16 - In what could mark the beginning of a showdown over the Long Island cable television market and potentially over the wider metropolitan New York market, Verizon Communications has filed a formal application to provide cable service in Hempstead, the largest town on the island.The bid would place Verizon in head-to-head competition with Cablevision, which started here more than 30 years ago and serves about three million homes in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.It is not the first time Verizon has challenged Cablevision on its home turf. Last year, it won a franchise in the tiny village of Massapequa Park on Long Island's South Shore.But Hempstead, with 750,000 residents, is a much larger combat arena, and if the Verizon service is added, Hempstead will be the first incorporated township in the state with more than one cable TV provider, according to Kate Murray, the Town of Hempstead supervisor.""Casting no aspersions on Cablevision,"" Ms. Murray said, ""the bottom line is that when competition is introduced, you many times get better pricing and a better array of choices. Choice is always a positive.""'"
"'06-03-17,'1','The idea of using the seminary as the jumping off point for other, seemingly unrelated pursuits, is not new; just the number of people doing it is.George Rupp, for instance, graduated from Yale Divinity School and served as president of Rice and Columbia Universities before becoming president of the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian aid group. Thomas M. Chappell, co-founder of the Tom's of Maine line of soap and toothpaste, completed Harvard Divinity School. And Al Gore attended Vanderbilt Divinity School for a time before switching to law.""Theological education has a lot of uses, like a legal education does,"" said Barbara G. Wheeler, president of Auburn Theological Seminary in New York and director of its Center for the Study of Theological Education. ""It's good to have people with a theological education doing lots of things. It's a perspective that helps.""Maggie Kulyk, 43, graduated from Candler in 1996. In divinity school, she thought she might go into academia or be ordained in the Episcopal Church. She is now a financial planner in Atlanta, helping clients with socially responsible investing.""There's a sense that it's the kind of education that invites you to go deep into your own interior life and explore your own sense of what matters and doesn't, and if such-and-such matters, how do you behave in the world?"" Ms. Kulyk said. ""Knowing how to ask questions is infinitely helpful: it helps you take clients through the process, where you ask: 'What is this money for? How do you want your life to be?' ""Though mainline denominations have shrunk considerably over the last 35 years, enrollment in mainline divinity schools rose 20 percent from 1990 to 2004, according to the Association of Theological Schools. Part-time study programs and interest from minority applicants and women contributed to the gains.At the same time, seminary graduates drifted away from becoming pastors. Among United Methodists, about 70 percent of seminary graduates in a recent survey said they would enter pastoral ministry, compared with more than 90 percent of graduates in 1970.Mainline seminarians, including the Methodists, now largely fall into two age groups: those over 40, who are embarking on a second career in ministry, and those under 30, who are more likely to choose another profession.At Candler, a United Methodist divinity school with about 500 students from various denominations, a majority of students is under 30, according to Cynthia Meyer, assistant dean of students. Only about half the graduates say they will become church pastors, she said.Mr. Reynolds opted out of parish ministry after his first year at Candler despite a long commitment to the United Methodist Church, the inspiration of local pastors in his youth, his summers working with children in Belfast under the church's auspices and his wife's imminent ordination as a Methodist minister.""Parish ministry offered job security; it was what everyone did and it seemed logical,"" said Mr. Reynolds, who expects to graduate in May and will apply for jobs after his wife is assigned a parish. ""But I felt that preaching and having a role of authority in the community was not who I was. Still, being at seminary felt right.""The young candidates are exploring, said the Rev. Jonathan Strandjord, director for theological education at the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. ""Young people are thinking about possibilities, about blue-sky possibilities. Older people have mortgages and responsibilities, and their goal isn't to invent a form of ministry or find something that is really out there.""Often, seminary education, with its focus on personal spiritual growth, theology and social justice, introduces students to the idea that one's calling need not be answered in church every Sunday.Ronald Galvin enrolled in Candler because he ""wanted to make a difference in the world in some way."" Since graduating in 2000, he has worked as a community activist, most recently at the Center for Working Families Inc. in Atlanta. Many of the poor people he encounters think he must be a minister and call him Reverend, he said.""Seminary really gave me the space and the moment of pause that I needed to develop the skills to analyze the world,"" said Mr. Galvin, 37, who was raised Catholic. ""It expanded my faith, gave me a greater appreciation for folks who are struggling, and showed that there are many sacred ways and that God is with us no matter where we are.""So far, the shrinking interest in pastoral ministry has not created a shortage of ministers in the mainline denominations, partly because they have adapted. The United Methodist Church has added licensed ministers, who have completed training programs rather than the seminary and who can perform the functions of an ordained minister except for participating in the denomination's decision-making bodies. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has long required seminary graduates to do three years of pastoral ministry.The clearest impact has been the aging of the clergy in the mainline denominations. For example, the average age of ordination for Episcopal ministers is 44; in 1970, it was 29.The older people entering pastoral ministry often say they needed years of other work and maturity before they could imagine leading a church. Arlindall Burks, 52, spent 26 years in the Navy and worked as a counselor at a community college in Florida before entering seminary.Ms. Burks, an African-American who grew up Baptist in Gary, Ind., recalls becoming alienated from religion after encountering racism and rejection in society. Seven years ago, though, she began attending United Methodist churches, moved by the denomination's commitment to social justice. Now in her last term at Candler and on her way to becoming a Methodist minister, Ms. Burks said she understood why younger people often rejected pastoral ministry.""I don't think I could have done this at 25,"" she said. ""I had too much baggage. I was too angry. I was mad at God. I don't think I could have heard God then.""From the pulpit, she says she can do what she loves: teach and inspire people to act for social change.""I think all that I did before this was preparation for this call,"" Ms. Burks added. ""I don't think that I would have had the patience, the passion, the compassion before.""'"
"'06-03-17,'1','Some critics say the plan is technically unworkable, unfairly undermines Apple and opens the door to more piracy by crippling technology that protects copyrights. Supporters see France setting a long-overdue legal precedent that opens Apple's closed iPod-iTunes digital music system to competition.Apple would not comment on the legislation. Led by Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive, Apple persuaded the world's major record labels in 2003 to sell songs over the Internet at 99 cents each through the iTunes Music Store.But the price of making it inexpensive, easy and attractive for consumers to buy online -- rather than sharing songs on the Internet without compensating record companies or musicians -- was the use of Apple's proprietary formats, making song buyers beholden to Apple and its players, which account for more than 70 percent of all devices sold.The broad backing of Apple by music industry executives has turned into public and private griping over the company's control over the price of iTunes downloads and the domination of the highly profitable iPod, at what they see as the industry's expense.The amendments proposed by the government, tacked onto what is being called the author's rights law, originate in part from a European view of the economy that makes it more acceptable there than in the United States for governments to order competition in the marketplace for the benefit of consumers.Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, the minister of culture, told the Paris newspaper Libération, ""I want to give the Internet world and the cultural industries a secure legal structure to permit a real development -- or even explosion -- of online cultural offerings."" He added, ""Everyone will be able to choose.""France is the third-largest digital music market in Europe, after Britain and Germany, according to GfK, a market research company based in Nuremberg, Germany. Downloads in France last year totaled 20 million songs worth $23.3 million, while 4.7 million digital music players were sold, the company said.As of Thursday, the copyright bill still had more than 400 amendments, many of them having to do with how devices interoperate. The most prominently affected device would be the iPod, but Sony's Walkman digital music players operate on a similar principle. In both cases, purchased online music can be transferred to the hardware only from a site owned by the same company -- the iTunes Music Store for iPods and Sony Connect for the Walkman. Sony declined to comment.The development is especially rich in irony for Microsoft, a target of European antitrust action, which licenses its digital music format, called WMA, to any company willing to pay for it. Most non-Apple digital music players, like those produced by Samsung, Creative and Archos, allow WMA songs, while most online music merchants, like Rhapsody from RealNetworks, Music Now from America Online and Napster, sell songs in that format.But technically, the French government's aim of making music playable on all digital devices is challenging at the least, said Mark MacGann, director general of the European Information and Communications Technology Industry Association, a trade group in Brussels whose members include Apple, Microsoft and Sony.In addition, the cross-border implications are enormous, he said. ""Governments cannot operate in a technology policy vacuum with a global industry,"" he added, saying that decisions should be made at least on a European level. ""You cannot decide overnight to create a nirvana.""TECHNOLOGY Correction: April 4, 2006, Tuesday An article in Business Day on Thursday about a British trademark suit against Apple Computer referred imprecisely to the ability of the Apple iPod to play tunes from online music stores other than Apple's, an issue in a French political debate. (The error also occurred on March 17 in an article about the French debate.) While Apple's music store makes tunes available in a proprietary format, iPods can play music purchased at certain other stores, usually in MP3 format.'"

I was just surprised at all those rumors going around, but it never affected him, so it never affected us.""But Seton Hall had clearly sagged of late. The Pirates lost five of their last eight games going into Thursday's game. And they were facing a Wichita State team eager to prove it belonged in the N.C.A.A. tournament in its first visit since 1988. There had been criticism of the midmajor Missouri Valley Conference, which received four bids to the tournament this year.""I think that by showing that we can win against bigger schools, it bodes well for the selection committee,"" said the senior center Paul Miller, the M.V.C. player of the year who had 15 points against the Pirates.The Shockers showed that they belonged from the start, never trailing in the first half and quickly building their lead to double figures. At one point late in the half, the Shockers had a 40-20 advantage before Seton Hall crawled back to 40-24 by halftime.Wichita State sophomore guard Sean Ogirri, who came into the game averaging 11.9 points, had 12 by halftime. He finished with a game-high 23 points.The closest Seton Hall came in the second half was 55-44, but Wichita State never blinked down the stretch.""We played like we've been here 20 years in a row,"" Wichita State Coach Mark Turgeon said. ""We didn't feel any pressure for the Valley as players and coaches to win.""As for Orr, he did not talk Thursday about the pressure he has been under this season.

Key, said he had had no choice: ""It goes without saying that when you have a videotape that clearly shows a police execution, it's just screaming for prosecution.""If Sergeant Anders had not agreed to plead guilty, Mr. Key said, federal prosecutors, concerned about the possibility of acquittal by a state jury, were prepared to try him under a civil rights statute that could have sent him to prison for life. His guilty plea carried a sentence of up to seven years; the one year the judge gave him was the lightest possible term.In truth, Sergeant Anders said, he should not have been on duty the night of Dec. 18, 2004. It was his 11th wedding anniversary, and he was fighting off a case of stomach flu. But when a call came in to 911 reporting a quarrel and shots fired 10 miles east of Cloudcroft, he insisted on joining his partner and best friend, Deputy Robert Hedman.The call took them to a cabin rented by Mr. Flippen, a 38-year-old career criminal whose ""white pride"" tattoos proclaimed his membership in the Aryan Brotherhood.Shortly before the deputies pulled up, Mr. Flippen had shot to death his 30-year-old girlfriend, Deborah Rhoudes, then eight months pregnant, and rolled her body into a rug for loading into his waiting hatchback. Ms. Rhoudes's 3-year-old daughter, Victoria, was also there.In the interview on March 9, which began at the cabin, now sealed off, Sergeant Anders said a shirtless Mr. Flippen, barring the two officers from entering, had explained the bloodstains as coming from a deer he had killed, and had then slammed the door. Sergeant Anders radioed for backup, while Deputy Hedman crept to the back of the house.When he heard a shot from the back, Sergeant Anders rushed the cabin. But Mr. Flippen, who in the darkness had slipped through the front door unseen with Victoria, popped up from behind the hatchback and fired a shot from his .357 Magnum Peacemaker at the startled sergeant, who was just feet away.""It felt like a Civil War cannon in my face,"" Sergeant Anders recalled. ""I thought the left side of my head was gone."" Actually the bullet had torn through his jacket, searing his left arm.In 31 years as a law enforcement officer, he said, he had never fired his weapon on duty, but now he pulled the trigger of his Glock semiautomatic four times, striking Mr. Flippen in the forehead and left hand and arm.At this point, the sergeant's recollections and the videotape diverge. Repeating what he had told investigators, he said he recalled having seen Mr. Flippen squirming on the ground with the Magnum nearby and having shot him again in the body. Afterward, he said, he moved the gun out of reach and handcuffed him.But the videotape and its audio from the sergeant's body microphone tell a different story. After downing Mr. Flippen, Sergeant Anders handcuffs him as Victoria, whom Mr. Flippen was helping to raise, wails nearby, over and over: ""Don't shoot my daddy!""He tells Mr. Flippen, ""You lay there, buddy,"" and rushes to the back of the house, shouting: ""Bob! Bob!"" He finds his partner's body -- draped over a railing, a bullet in the head -- and gasps, ""Oh God, Bob!""Then he returns to Mr. Flippen, shoos the little girl inside and fires a single shot into his chest.The next police officer on the scene, Terry Flanigan, said he had found Sergeant Anders all but catatonic, propped up on his truck. He found Ms. Rhoudes's body ""stuffed in a closetlike garbage,"" and the little girl, who had minor wounds from a bullet fragment, crying that her sister was still in the house. Officers later realized she had meant her dead mother's unborn baby.When investigators played the videotape for Sergeant Anders three days after the shootings, he seemed stunned. He said he had no memory of shooting Mr. Flippen after handcuffing him.""I remember being afraid,"" he said, according to transcripts of interviews with the investigators. ""I remember being worried for Bob. I remember the little girl screaming and carrying, you know, carrying on, being upset. But, God, I don't remember that.""Later, when Sergeant Anders was indicted and turned himself in, the Otero County sheriff, John Blansett, a mammoth, easygoing man, wept.Fifteen months after the shooting, the case still bruises Cloudcroft, not simply because of Deputy Hedman's death but also out of concern for Sergeant Anders and an appreciation for the hellish circumstances of that night.By all accounts at the sentencing hearing, Sergeant Anders was more than a standout officer. He was a model citizen known for a warm demeanor and for using humor to defuse dangerous situations.""Billy was one of the greatest and most compassionate cops we ever had,"" said Willie Walker, a former colleague with the San Antonio Police Department, where Sergeant Anders spent 23 years as a patrol officer and SWAT team commander before retiringas a captain and moving to Cloudcroft with his wife in 1998.As Sergeant Anders made his farewell rounds through Cloudcroft on March 9, residents turned out to wish him well. A man in a cowboy hat clapped him on the shoulder, enfolded him in a crushing embrace and said, ""Behind you, brother.""'"

The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose modestly, though the Nasdaq composite index fell. [Page C6.]The Fed's rate-setting committee is scheduled to meet on March 27 and 28, and is widely expected to raise its benchmark short-term rate by another quarter-point, to 4.75 percent. Many on Wall Street are now betting that the new Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his colleagues may stop after that or engineer only one more rate increase, to 5 percent, before taking a rest.""There is certainly nothing from the core inflation numbers to egg the Fed on to keep tightening,"" James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS, said.Investors bid up the price of United States Treasury securities yesterday in response. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 4.64 percent from 4.73 percent late Wednesday.Energy prices dropped 1.2 percent in February after jumping 5 percent in January, as gasoline prices were down 1 percent and natural gas fell 4.5 percent. But they have since moved back up a bit.And while inflation pressures faded last month, some analysts cautioned that the mild consumer price report did not eliminate the risks of further price increases in coming months.One category drawing more attention recently is rents, which increased 0.3 percent last month from January and 3.1 percent from a year earlier. Stronger hiring and slowing home purchases appear to be driving down high vacancy rates for apartments and forcing up rents. Clothing prices are also expected to rebound, and there is lingering concern that businesses will feel freer to pass on the high costs of energy and transportation to customers as the economy strengthens.""This was a pretty tame report,"" said David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, ""but there are at least a few categories that are going to show some acceleration going forward.""In housing data, the number of new homes started by builders fell 7.9 percent last month, to an annual pace of 2.12 million, after rising 15.7 percent in January, when the temperature, taken on a national average, was the warmest on record for that month.Analysts had expected an even bigger drop in housing starts in February, given the weather patterns and reports from several builders that they were offering more incentives to sell homes as interest rates rose and buyers were becoming more selective. An index that measures applications for home mortgages has fallen 23.8 percent since the summer, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.""It's a market that is trying to find its footing,"" said Nicholas Buss, a senior vice president at PNC Financial Services' real estate finance group. Mr. Buss expects home sales to fall by about 10 percent this year.Still, the number of homes under construction in February increased 0.6 percent, to 1.43 million, its highest level since February 1974, an indication that home building is strong by historical standards. Rebuilding in the Gulf Coast areas hit by hurricanes, an effort that is only now getting under way on a large scale, is also likely to bolster construction in coming months, Mr. Buss said.The number of housing permits issued, an indication of future construction activity, fell 3.2 percent, to an annual pace of 2.15 million, after rising 6.8 percent in January.Separately, the number of new unemployment insurance claims filed last week rose by 5,000, to 309,000, the Labor Department reported. For the week ended March 4, there were 2.4 million total outstanding jobless claims nationwide, down some 7.6 percent from a year earlier.'"
"'06-03-18,'0','A former graduate student at Columbia University whose research is at the center of three papers retracted by a leading chemistry journal is disputing accusations that her experiments cannot be reproduced.The former student, Bengu Sezen, who finished her doctorate last year and left the university, said in an e-mail message on Thursday that she had not known of any controversy about the papers until a reporter asked her about it.Dr. Sezen said that before the papers were published, other scientists in the group successfully performed the same experiments, even when she was not in the laboratory.Dalibor Sames, a professor of chemistry at Columbia, retracted two articles and part of a third that had been published in 2004 and 2005 in The Journal of the American Chemical Society. The research was part of efforts by chemists to transform simple hydrocarbon molecules like methane into more complex and useful molecules like those in plastic.Columbia has begun an inquiry into the research.Dr. Sezen said in her message that ""I was unaware of the situation until I received your e-mail"" and that neither Dr. Sames nor anyone else at Columbia had consulted her about the retractions.Although the reporter's query did not list the three articles in question, Dr. Sezen noted them in her reply. She said that other researchers in Dr. Sames's group had reproduced the experiments with the same results reported in the two retracted papers.

For the third, partly retracted paper, Dr. Sezen said her role was ""limited to an intellectual one.""'"
"'06-03-18,'0','Even if Congress does nothing, protecting credit information is going to become more complicated and inconvenient as more states pass laws that try to balance protecting consumers and protecting the credit-reporting industry.Before we get to the advice, let's take a look at what is at stake here. The New Jersey law, which went into effect in January, permits any resident to freeze access to a credit report free. A thaw costs the consumer $5 an agency. The law also calls on the agencies to set up technology allowing credit to be thawed as quickly as 15 minutes after notification. Utah recently passed a bill, as yet unsigned by the governor, that would require the credit agencies, by 2008, to switch a lock on or off in 15 minutes.The lag time is important because a three- or five-day delay could prevent a person from making a spur-of-the-moment purchase. Merchants may lose sales if they have to wait several days before they can verify a customer's creditworthiness. By then the consumer's urge to buy may pass -- which, for some people, might not be such a bad thing.Getting Americans to spend less and save more is not what the credit-reporting agencies are after. And there is no technological barrier that makes a quick unlock impossible. They are concerned that each state will have different rules and prices. That is already happening. Nevadans pay the most: $15 to lock and $18 to unlock. It is free in Illinois, Texas, Washington and Vermont, but only fraud victims can do it.The agencies also dislike laws like New Jersey's because they fear that making it too easy to lock a credit report may ruin their business in the way that the Do Not Call list decimated the phone solicitation business. The companies' main business is selling credit information to potential lenders, insurers and even employers.The ability to turn credit reports on and off is a ""false promise,"" said Stuart Platt, president of the Consumer Data Industry Association, the trade group that represents the credit reporting industry. He said it could damage an industry that has helped to reduce the cost of credit by helping lenders manage risk.Locking reports, however, does not stop credit card solicitations. That can already be done by calling 888-5OPTOUT (888-567-8688). The ban lasts five years.Congress will not take a vote on the full Financial Data Protection Act until fall. In the meantime, the confusion in the current system presents an opportunity for businesses to charge consumers who want to protect themselves. They have already scared Americans with statistics like, nine million Americans were victims of identity theft. Never mind that most cases labeled identity theft are simple fraud resulting from a lost or stolen credit card, according to Federal Trade Commission statistics. A consumer's liability is limited to $50 in those cases.But the marketing campaigns seem to be working. Ten million Americans already pay about $100 a year to protect their credit information. In other words, it is already a $1 billion industry. Consumers will probably be paying more, though they don't always need to.There are various levels of protection. Every year, a person can go to annualcreditreport.com for a free copy of all three credit reports or space them out over several months. There is no reason to ever pay for this service. Look it over for errors. (Making sense of credit scores, which determine your rate of interest, may be getting easier. This week, the three agencies said they had created a VantageScore, a single scoring system that each company will use.)If you are worried about someone opening accounts in your name, you can call or write one of the agencies to put a fraud alert on your account. Each has the responsibility to alert the other two. The protection lasts 90 days. An additional 90 days are available but you will have to write to each credit bureau and ask. You have to keep doing this for as long as you want lenders to double-check with you.When this fraud alert works correctly, lenders are supposed to take extra precautions before extending credit, but they do not have to do this. It could be a simple as asking for additional identification, but others may want to call you and ask for other information.One drawback of fraud alert is that you may find it difficult to take advantage of instant-credit offers at stores. (Though this, too, might not be a bad thing. Opening too many lines of credit in a short period of time will harm your credit score.) Sometimes you may be denied credit because the lender does not want to go through the extra verification.Another drawback is that while it is simple to sign up for a fraud alert, it is difficult to get off the list when you find it more trouble than it is worth. You have to make the request in writing and provide documents attesting to your identity.An alternative is credit monitoring, but these services will cost you. TransUnion's TrueCredit offers three-bureau credit monitoring for $15 a month, while Equifax's Credit Watch Gold is $13 a month, also for three bureaus. A consumer is notified by e-mail after a new credit card has been issued or when a chunk of a home equity line of credit has been used. But after a while, those messages sound like the little boy who cried wolf and you might start ignoring them.""They tell you after the fact,"" says Scott Mitic, vice president for business development at TrustedID, a start-up company that intends to take advantage of the confusion surrounding the protection of credit information. ""It is this reactive system that irked us.""Mr. Mitic, a former executive with Fair Isaac, the company that created the formulas for computing credit scores, and Omar Ahmad, chief technology officer at TrustedID, were introduced on what they call an ""entrepreneurial blind date."" They discovered a shared interest in identity theft and they came up with a way to profit from it.""No one will confuse the credit bureaus' customer service with Nordstrom's,"" said Mr. Ahmad, a former chief information officer at Napster.TrustedID plans to automate the process of locking and unlocking credit reports. When you want your credit locked or unlocked, for instance, when you intend to buy a car or apply for a mortgage, TrustedID will send the agencies all the paperwork and the fees and charge you $8 a month or $90 a year.You could do it yourself for far less, especially if you live in one of those states where the service is free. But the company is counting on the process being so onerous that you would pay them to do it instead. Indeed, the notion that people will pay extra for the convenience of protecting their credit reports is so compelling that the company has attracted financing from one of Silicon Valley's top venture capital firms, Draper Fisher Jurvetson.The bottom line: Those few people who have been victimized by identity thieves -- not credit-card thieves -- and continue to be vulnerable should take the extra precautions. For everyone else, all these services are just going to be one more hassle.'"
"'06-03-18,'0','Back then, flying was dangerous; no radio guidance, no instruments for bad weather, no de-icing equipment or radar to reveal thunderstorms. Flying was all contact, meaning that you stayed in visual contact with the ground. Trying to see ahead when fog or low clouds forced the pilot lower and lower, with no visibility; pilots lost their lives running into hillsides or unseen obstructions.In exchange for risking life and limb, pilots were well paid. In 1924, the top salary was $8,000 a year, or close to $1 million in today's dollars. In 1938, when I started flying DC-3's for Transcontinental and Western Air (later Trans World Airlines), we still were paid more for flying at night and over mountains.As flying became safer, pay was reduced but still remained high. How? The pilots formed a union, the Air Line Pilots Association, in 1931. The key man was David L. Behncke, a retired United Airlines pilot, who fought the airlines' attempt to have one industry-wide contract for pilots. By seeing to it that pilots had individual contracts with each airline, Behncke ensured that each negotiation could build on the one that came before it.He also helped to keep salaries high by emphasizing productivity as well as safety. Behncke argued that a pilot hauling 400 passengers should make more than one transporting, say, 70 passengers. This was a winning tactic, though I was never certain that it was entirely accurate. Smaller planes are not necessarily any easier to fly. A 747 pilot, for example, takes off from New York and lands in Paris: one flight. A regional jet pilot, by comparison, can wind up making five stops during one day, or night -- or making all his flights in the same lousy weather system.People think that computers have made flying easier -- you just turn on the autopilot and relax. Not so. Computers do many things, but they don't know what to do when a line of severe thunderstorms blocks the flight path, nor do they worry about marginal weather at destinations and what to do about reserve fuel and a host of possible situations that can be resolved only through human intelligence informed by experience.There are simply too many situations that demand a professional in the cockpit. I've flown for a long time, and I can't begin to count the number of times I've heard a colleague say (or felt myself), ""I earned my year's pay on that flight.""Here's just one story. In June of 1970, I was piloting a TWA 747 from Paris to New York. Forty minutes into the flight, TWA's Paris dispatch office called to tell me I had a bomb on board. According to the warning call they had received, the bomb was due to go off in 45 minutes.We turned around and dived toward Paris. We started dumping fuel to get our weight down, but we didn't have time to reduce the weight to the legal landing limit.Decision time: land and risk going off the end of the runway, or circle around dumping fuel before the bomb goes off? Landing a plane that's overweight takes up runway space. I visualized what was off the runway's end: farmland. I concluded that it was probably worth the risk, even though we'd knock out lights at the end of the runway as we slammed through.Thankfully, we landed safely. The passengers were evacuated down the slides while still far from the terminal. (Officials didn't want us nearby in case we blew up.) The only injury was a fracture in a flight attendant's ankle. They never found a bomb.Airline pilots go through stuff like this all the time. This is why they deserve to be paid decently (if not extravagantly). It's for this reason that I hope the union will remain strong as it works with Delta and Northwest (and whoever's next) on problems of pay, retirement and safety. As they talk, pilots, I know, will do their job of getting airplanes from departure to destination safely. After all, the pilot is on board, too -- a fact that should be respected, but not taken for granted.Op-Ed Contributor Bob Buck is the author of ""North Star Over My Shoulder: A Flying Life.""Correction: March 21, 2006, Tuesday An Op-Ed article on Saturday, about pay for airline pilots, misstated what the top salary for a pilot in 1924 would be in today's money. It would be about $93,000, not $1 million.'"
"'06-03-18,'0','MOSCOW, March 17 - Russia has been holding up an entry visa to William F. Browder, who controls a $4 billion hedge fund in Moscow and is the largest foreign investor in the country's stock market.Mr. Browder has been living in London for the last four months waiting for a visa.While minor delays are common, a delay of four months would suggest an intentional refusal on the part of the Russian government to allow Mr. Browder to travel to Russia.The delay was also unusual for such a high-profile investor. Authorities have often meddled with permits, or more aggressively, staged tax police raids on Russian businesses, but foreign investors have largely been spared direct government pressure.Still, the Kremlin is seeking foreign investment in several large energy companies and would seemingly have no incentive to expel a hedge fund manager helping to channel capital into Russia.A spokesman for the foreign ministry, which processes visa requests, declined to comment after working hours on Friday, asking that questions be faxed to a more senior press official.Mr. Browder, the chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, said he could not immediately discuss the details of the delay, but would later explain what happened.'"
"'06-03-18,'0','I didn't say it was a science.But the bad news (for us) is that even using the half-age calculations, we are paying slave wages.A 2005 survey of almost 1,500 children by Yankelovich, a research firm, found that the most common weekly allowance for 6- to 11-year-olds was $5 to $9, and $10 to $19 for 12- to 17-year-olds. Around 15 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds received $20 to $49.Forty-one percent of those surveyed said they bolstered their allowance by doing extra chores around the house or jobs like baby-sitting; interestingly, more than 40 percent of children in all age categories said they received no allowance.But ""allowance figures are pretty squishy,"" said Janet Bodnar, deputy editor of Kiplinger's Personal Finance and author of ""Raising Money Smart Kids: What They Need to Know About Money -- and How to Tell Them,"" (Dearborn, 2005).That is because everyone means something different when they refer to allowances. For some it is a weekly sum that their child -- particularly as she enters the teenage years -- is supposed to spend on luxuries above and beyond the basics. That could include movies, eating out, must-have jeans or DVD's, and other optional activities.For a smaller child, that could mean paying for his own baseball or Pokéman cards or CD's.For others, an allowance might be substantially higher, but the child is expected to buy all her own clothes as well as, say, presents for friends' birthdays, and pay her own cellphone bill.Ms. Bodnar has worked out her own system. Several years ago, when her two older children were teenagers, they received a $200 clothing allowance in the spring and in the fall to buy all clothes except outerwear like coats and shoes. They would receive a $20-a-week gasoline allowance, but would have to pay for anything over that. They also had to pay for parking tickets or fender-benders.Her teenage son still gets $20 for gasoline, even though prices are so much higher, but she said he has found a gas station that still gives a discount for cash payments.""If I had been paying, he wouldn't have cared,"" she said. ""But it was his dime, so he was very careful when buying his gas.""She and her husband pay for the cellphones, but her children have to cough up for minutes beyond the plan's allocation and text message charges.""Philosophically, in whatever form, an allowance should be a fixed amount they receive in regular intervals that they have the responsibility to use for their own expenses,"" Ms. Bodnar said.It defeats the purpose, she said, if in addition to an allowance, parents give their children money for the mall or movies.Some parents also choose to lay down rules on how the allowance can be spent (is that my older son saying, ""But it's MY money?) I'm glad Ms. Bodnar reassured me that, in fact, it's MY money and we can tell him -- er, discuss with him -- how it is necessary to learn some discipline by putting a certain percentage in the bank and not spending the entire amount on basketball jerseys (cool as they are.)Some parents have their children divide their allowance into a portion for savings, a part for charity and some they can spend right away. But Ms. Bodnar warned that the whole process should not be too complicated or everyone will get confused and frustrated.One of the big questions that always comes up when discussing allowances is: Should they be tied to chores or not?On one side are those who say that children should not be paid to do chores; household tasks are part of being a family and they should not be compensated for what they must do anyhow. An allowance, these parents say, is to teach money management.On the other side of the ring we have those who absolutely believe that money and jobs should be linked.""It seems to me that guaranteeing a kid a certain amount of money may mean kids grow up with a sense of entitlement,"" said Lewis Mandell, a professor of finance and managerial economics at the State University of New York at Buffalo.Professor Mandell is also the principal researcher for the JumpStart Coalition for Financial Literacy surveys given to high school seniors every two years. The survey, which began in 1997, consists of about 30 multiple-choice questions testing students on their basic knowledge of personal financial management, including life insurance, credit cards, savings programs and sales tax.The 2004 survey, the last one with figures available, queried about 6,000 teenagers on the way they learned about finances when growing up. One question specifically geared to allowances discovered that 59 percent said they did not receive a regular allowance; 30.4 percent said they received an allowance that depended on the completion of some chores; and 10.6 percent said they were given a regular allowance that was not based on chores.The survey has also shown that in general, teenagers do not have strong financial knowledge, and that whether or not they received an allowance did not seem to make much difference in their financial literacy.Although all the scores were within a few points of each other -- and all were fairly dismal -- those who were not given a regular allowance, Professor Mandell said, scored somewhat better on the test than those whose parents gave them a regular allowance that was not linked to chores. Children who said they received a regular allowance that depended on completing certain tasks scored the best on the exam.""People seem to have some idea of what to do to turn out a money-smart child, and most have turned out to be wrong,"" he said.Ms. Bodnar disagreed. It all depends, she said, on how you define financial literacy.""The Social Security system, the safeguards if you lose your credit cards -- these are macroeconomics,"" she said. ""But an allowance is an excellent teaching tool for microeconomics, for money management. When their money is on the line, it's a whole different thing.""One crucial element of the allowance paradigm is to be sure to give it on the same day, whether it be once a week or once a month. It should be like a paycheck, because eventually your employees -- I mean children -- should learn to plan and budget with it.Otherwise, it becomes less like a regular stipend and more like arbitrary pocket money.You also can fall into a trap like my friend Nina, who, despite all her good intentions, consistently forgets to give her sons their allowances. Then she is presented with a bill for close to $200 for all the missed weeks.Fortunately, they haven't started to charge interest yet.'"
"'06-03-18,'0','The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said in a report released yesterday that the risk from the tritium-contaminated water leaking from the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor is so small that it is unlikely to affect the health of plant workers or the public.The leak was discovered last fall next to the spent-fuel pool for Indian Point 2, which is in Westchester County, as workers dug a new foundation for a crane that will take fuel out of the pool for storage in dry casks.Water in the pool is contaminated with tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen that is incorporated into the water just as normal hydrogen is. Several weeks ago, samples from a new monitoring well found that the tritium has come closer to the Hudson River than previously believed, although the presumption since the leak's discovery was that the tritium would eventually reach the river.In its report, the commission said it had ""not found any condition that indicates that occupational or public health and safety have been, or likely will be, affected by the current onsite groundwater contamination.""The commission said it had reviewed, and did not dispute, an estimate by the plant owner, Entergy, that the largest direct exposure that a member of the public could receive from the leaking tritium was less than one ten-thousandth of 1 percent of the maximum that the plant is allowed to cause by leaking liquids. The figure refers only to the leak, and not from the routine, planned releases of slightly radioactive liquids into the Hudson River. Those are far larger than the amount being leaked, but still well below legal limits, plant operators say.The dose would be minuscule compared to background doses from natural sources, according to radiation experts.'"

"'06-03-18,'0','If you are going to write a play about the tortuous rite of passage of a charmingly precocious adolescent, using ""The Catcher in the Rye"" as the central reference is not necessarily the most propitious strategy. It invites a comparison that is virtually impossible to satisfy.That said, Suzanne Bradbeer's ""Full Bloom,"" produced by the Vital Theater Company, has a lot going for it, starting with some excellent performances. And though it is hardly Salinger, it is well-written enough to be consistently engaging.The action centers around 15-year-old Phoebe (named, of course, after Holden Caulfield's little sister). The newly nubile Phoebe (an overmature-looking Jennifer Blood) just can't seem to get comfortable with herself in a world full of mixed messages and questionable adult behavior. It doesn't help that her father has just dumped her mother, Jane (perfectly portrayed by Jennifer Dorr White), for a much younger woman. Or that Crystal, the attractive actress who is her neighbor and surrogate aunt (well played by LeAnne Hutchinson), is subjecting herself to plastic surgery.So Phoebe comforts herself with soliloquies aimed at the moon, with which she feels a bond because, she explains, Phoebe was the goddess of the moon in classical mythology. She also skips school to make frequent trips to the Museum of Modern Art, where she is convinced that the orange line in her favorite Barnett Newman painting is disappearing.The dramatic trajectory is foreshadowed early, in Phoebe's first conversation with an equally precocious young black schoolmate, Jesse (played with considerable charisma by William Jackson Harper). The two share a love of Holden and baseball, particularly Roberto Clemente."" 'If a body catch a body coming through the rye' -- I love that guy,"" says Jesse, quick to identify the source of her name. Phoebe asks: ""I've been wondering. Do you think he ever gets out of that asylum?"" When Jesse explains that Holden is actually in a sanitarium, she retorts, ""Whatever it is, I hope he gets out,"" poignantly expressing her fear that she won't survive childhood.'"
"'06-03-18,'0','Mr. Khodorkovsky, the founder of the Yukos oil company, set up Open Russia in 2001. Once Russia's wealthiest man, he was convicted of fraud and other charges last year, and is serving an eight-year prison term in Siberia. He and his supporters contend that the charges against him were contrived by the Kremlin as punishment for his political activities. Mr. Khodorkovsky remains chairman of Open Russia.The foundation, which claims to be the country's largest, has advocated for human rights and political freedoms, in part by providing grants to partner organizations throughout Russia. It had planned a budget of $11 million this year and maintained its accounts at Trast Bank, Ms. Yasina said.Its activities have been the subject of intense government interest, including a raid on its offices here last fall and at least five tax inspections last year, she said. On Friday, much of the suspense about Russia's intentions ended.Dmitry V. Chukseyev, a spokesman for Trast Bank, said an official from the general prosecutor's office arrived in the morning with a court order stipulating that the accounts had been frozen ""in relation to a criminal matter against Khodorkovsky, Lebedev and other unidentified people."" Platon Lebedev was a business associate of Mr. Khodorkovsky and was convicted with him.The order, Mr. Chukseyev said, ""immobilizes any movements of money"" without the prosecutor's approval. It did not make clear the nature of the criminal activity, he said.The general prosecutor's office made no public statement about the case.Mr. Yasina said that the accounts contained several million dollars, and that the assets were frozen on a day that Open Russia had planned to distribute funds to organizations it helps underwrite. She said the move was another example of Russia's backsliding on human rights, even as it holds the rotating chairmanship of the Group of 8 industrialized nations.Mr. Khodorkovsky's supporters said Friday that he had been sentenced to serve a week in a punitive cell because he had been drinking tea outside an approved prison area. Officials of the prison service could not be reached for comment.Almost all aspects of Mr. Khodorkovsky's business and public activities have faced government pressure since his arrest in 2003. His oil company is in ruins, after being drained of assets by enormous tax judgments against it and by having its core business auctioned off by the Russian authorities. Mr. Khodorkovsky himself still has several years to serve on his prison term.Ms. Yasina said the events on Friday signaled to her that Open Russia, like Yukos, would not survive.""Now it is absolutely clear,"" she said. ""I had some hope, even today in the morning. Now I understand that we are stopped.""'"

"'06-03-18,'0','Officer Raspanti was taken to New York Methodist Hospital in Park Slope, where he was treated for a flesh wound. Doctors at the hospital said he was not badly hurt but would remain at the hospital overnight for observation. He has been with the department for nine years.Mr. Givens continued running after the shooting but was arrested by other officers 30 yards away in front of a car wash, said Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner. Mr. Kelly said the shooting was still under investigation and would be the focus of a customary review by a firearms discharge review committee. Charges were pending last night.He said that the police found a gun on Mr. Givens, and that it was a .38-caliber Smith and Wesson that had been stolen in Prince Georges County, Md., in 2004.Although Mr. Kelly said the police officers acted appropriately by firing at Mr. Givens, several witnesses questioned the Police Department's account, including James Green, 64, who lives in the housing complex and said he saw the shooting unfold.""I didn't see him turn around at all,"" Mr. Green said. ""He was running too fast to turn around.""Steven Givens, the teenager's father, said his son was a high school dropout who stayed home and baby-sat for his younger brother and sister and coached basketball each summer.""I've never never ever seen my kid with a gun,"" he said. ""And if anybody started shooting, I'd run too.""The police said someone reported hearing six shots fired at 177 Sands Street in Fort Greene about 2 p.m.Fifteen minutes later, a woman who was taking a bus to work reported seeing a man holding a gun in front of a restaurant a few blocks away on Myrtle Avenue.""Officers responded to the location and saw the individual fitting the description there,"" said Mr. Kelly, referring to Mr. Givens. They drove up to Mr. Givens in a van. ""They shouted for the suspect to stop, but he fled eastbound on Myrtle Avenue.""The group of officers, who were all in street clothes, got out of the van and eventually fired six shots at Mr. Givens about two-thirds of the way down the block, the police said.'"
"'06-03-18,'0','General Motors, meanwhile, was busy on another front. Negotiators for the company, the United Automobile Workers union and Delphi planned to work into the weekend in talks on buyout packages for thousands of U.A.W. members at Delphi. Union officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a deal could be reached in the next few days. But it would be only a part of a bigger agreement involving the companies and the union.G.M. spun off Delphi in 1999, but has responsibility for retirement benefits for former Delphi workers. In its announcement Thursday, G.M., which originally said that its Delphi liability could be zero to $11 billion, revised that to $5.5 billion to $12 billion.G.M.'s record of financial excellence began long ago. It provided investors with audited financial statements long before it was required in the 1930's. In 1953, when Moody's and Standard & Poor's first rated the company, it received the coveted triple-A rating, conveying that it was the best possible credit.The company's financial reputation began to fray 25 years ago. It lost its triple-A rating in 1981 and the next year liberalized some accounting practices. The new policies matched practices of some competitors, but the change heralded other moves. The company soon became a constant presence at hearings of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, arguing for weaker accounting standards.At one hearing, G.M. told the accounting rule makers that it should not be required to follow revised pension accounting rules because they conflicted with its union contract. The rule makers were unimpressed. Today, G.M.'s generous pension policies are one reason it is in trouble.In 1984 and 1986, when it made two major acquisitions, buying Electronic Data Systems and Hughes Aircraft, it used tracking stock, which it invented. Those shares were supposed to trade based on profits of the acquired subsidiaries. Abraham Briloff, an accounting professor at Baruch College, complained that G.M. was overstating those profits because they ignored good will charges, but G.M. made no changes.Then in 1987, G.M. decided that it had been too conservative in evaluating the useful lives of many of its assets. By stretching out the depreciation of the assets, it increased pretax profits that year by more than $1 billion. But a few years later, it had to write down the value of many assets.The latest announcement, coming just when G.M. had planned to file its annual report, seemed to indicate that the company may have been in an argument with its auditors from Deloitte & Touche. It cited consultations with Deloitte as a reason for one change. A Deloitte spokeswoman declined to comment.Some of the changes may also have reflected changes at the top of the company. In December, G.M. announced that John M. Devine, who had been chief financial officer since 2001, would step aside and be succeeded in January by Frederick Henderson, who had been running the company's European operations. That move came weeks after the company said it had uncovered accounting errors that would be detailed in the annual report.While the changes will raise its stated loss for 2005 by $2 billion, those additional losses do not affect cash flow and attracted less attention than the issue that was new, and that the company said had delayed the filing of its annual report.The new issue concerned the cash flows from its mortgage subsidiary. The cash flow accounting for such things is not new, or controversial. When a company makes a loan, or has it repaid, the cash flow belongs in investing activities. Interest payments go into operating cash flow. But G.M. said that some cash flows that should have been classified as investing showed up as operating.""The question is, What causes this fundamental type of miscalculation to occur,"" said Gary J. Previts, an accounting professor at Case Western Reserve University. ""It seems pretty clear."" But he said that despite the series of restatements, ""I think they are still a quality shop"" when it comes to accounting.Other changes G.M. is making, some of which it had previously disclosed without giving exact numbers, indicate that it took advantage of hundreds of millions of dollars of supplier discounts it had not yet earned in 2000 and 2001, and also failed to record a $55 million expense in 2001, instead treating it as a reduction in shareholders' equity.Mr. Mulford of Georgia Tech had previously criticized that accounting, and G.M. had defended it. But now it plans to change it.Another change that G.M. disclosed also made its previous accounting seem questionable. In 2000 it recorded a $27 million gain when it sold precious metals that had been in its inventory. But it now says it had agreed to repurchase the inventory in 2001. That made the transaction a financing, not a sale, and no income should have been reported.The net result of all the changes, G.M. said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, is that its profits from continuing operations will be reduced for every year from 2000 to 2002, increased by a small amount for 2003, and left almost unchanged for 2004.The more important change for the future is that G.M. will now have $548 million in a deferred credit for the supplier discounts it previously reported but had not earned. That means that pretax profits in 2006 and later will be that much higher because the credits it wrongly took earlier will now be available again.""We call that déjà vu earnings,"" Mr. Mulford said.Investors reacted calmly. G.M. stock, which had closed as high as $93.62 in 2000, when it reported the profits it is now changing, fell 5 percent yesterday, to $21.13. But that was still well above the recent low of $18.33, set Dec. 29, when worries over how the company would meet its retiree health care obligations were high.While its bonds sagged, they, too, remained above recent lows. A bond issue due in 2033, with an 8.875 percent coupon, fell to 71.5 percent of par value. That raised its yield to maturity to 11.92 percent, from 11.40 percent a day earlier. But that bond traded as low as 61.25, for a yield of 13.89 percent, on Dec. 29. (Prices and yields move in opposite directions.)Moody's, which may cut ratings again, now rates them B2, which it defines as bonds that ""lack characteristics of a desirable investment.""G.M. said it would file the annual report within two weeks, after it quantifies the cash flow issues.""Accounting problems and restatements are never good, and they certainly don't inspire confidence in management and corporate controls,"" wrote Shelly Lombard, a bond analyst with Gimme Credit. ""But this restatement, while G.M. says it may be material, sounds like a reclassification of cash flows, not a reduction.""She added that while a delayed filing of G.M.'s annual report was not likely to lead to a bankruptcy filing, ""G.M. has enough other reasons to file bankruptcy eventually, and we remain negative on G.M. bonds.""G.M., which had a triple-A rating for 28 years, and an investment- grade rating for another 24, was dropped to junk status less than seven months ago. The fact that analysts now think a bankruptcy is possible is a mark of how far the mighty have fallen.'"
"'06-03-18,'0','This week, after the online magazine Salon raised questions about the identity of the man in the photograph, Mr. Qaissi and his lawyers insisted he was telling the truth.Certainly, he was at Abu Ghraib, and appears with a hood over his head in some photographs that Army investigators seized from the computer belonging to Specialist Charles Graner, the soldier later convicted of being the ringleader of the abuse.However, he now acknowledges he is not the man in the specific photograph he printed and held up in a portrait that accompanied the Times article. But he and his lawyers maintain that he was photographed in a similar position and shocked with wires and that he is the one on his business card. The Army says it believes only one prisoner was treated in that way.""I know one thing,"" Mr. Qaissi said yesterday, breaking down in tears when reached by telephone. ""I wore that blanket, I stood on that box, and I was wired up and electrocuted.""Susan Burke, a lawyer in Philadelphia who is representing Mr. Qaissi and other former prisoners in a lawsuit against civilian interrogators and translators at Abu Ghraib, said that Mr. Qaissi had been abused in the same way as the man in the photo. ""The sad fact is that there is not only one man on the box,"" she said.Using a name that Mr. Qaissi is often called, she said, ""Haj Ali is but one of many victims of the torture by Graner and the others.""In the interview for the article, Mr. Qaissi pointed to his deformed hand and said it matched the hand in the photograph. A close look at the photograph, however, is inconclusive.Whether he was forced to stand on a box and photographed is not clear, but evidence suggests that he adopted the identity of the iconic man on the box, the very symbol of Abu Ghraib, well after he left the prison.Records confirm that Mr. Qaissi became inmate 151716 sometime after the prison opened in June 2003, but do not give firm dates; Mr. Qaissi, a 43-year-old former Baath Party member and neighborhood mayor in Baghdad, said he arrived at Abu Ghraib in October 2003 and was released in March 2004, two months after the Army began an investigation into the abuse.And he suffered mistreatment and humiliation at the hands of the same people who photographed the man on the box: photographs investigators seized show him forced into a crouch, identifiable by his mangled hand, with the nickname guards gave him -- ""The Claw"" -- scrawled in black marker across his orange jumpsuit.But if he was the hooded man on the box, he did not mention it on several key occasions in the first months after the scandal broke.In the spring of 2004, Mr. Qaissi approached Muhammad Hamid al-Moussawi, the deputy director of the Human Rights Organization of Iraq, and proposed that the men set up a group for prisoners of the occupation, Mr. Moussawi said this week. Yet Mr. Qaissi never claimed at the time that he had been the man in the photograph, Mr. Moussawi recalled.A journalist who interviewed Mr. Qaissi three times that May and June about what happened at Abu Ghraib similarly said he never mentioned the pose or the photograph. The journalist, Gert Van Langendonck, said Mr. Qaissi mentioned the other cruelties he described in the Times profile.A lawsuit Mr. Qaissi joined, filed on July 27, 2004, also made no allegation that he was shocked with wires or forced to stand on a box. That allegation appeared only on an amended version of a complaint he later joined, filed last month, which said he had been forced to stand on the box and fell off from the shocks of the electrocution: ""They repeated this at least five times.""Another man had already been publicly identified as the man on the box in May 2004, when documents including logbooks and sworn statements from detainees and soldiers were leaked to The Times.On May 22, 2004, The Times quoted the testimony of a detainee, Abdou Hussain Saad Faleh: ""Then a tall black soldier came and put electrical wires on my fingers and toes and on my penis, and I had a bag over my head. Then he was saying, 'Which switch is on for electricity?""'Specialist Sabrina Harman, one of the soldiers later convicted of abuse, identified the man by his nickname, Gilligan, in her statement.She left some room to believe that others were subjected to the same treatment. ""The wires part,"" she said, was her idea, but she said Specialist Graner and Staff Sgt. Ivan Frederick II had forced detainees to stand on a box to stay awake, and did so at the request of military intelligence officials. Abu Ghraib photographs show more than one example of a hooded man forced to stand on boxes.But Chris Grey, a spokesman for the Army's Criminal Investigation Command, said that the military believed that Mr. Faleh had been the only prisoner subjected to the treatment shown in the photo. ""To date, and after a very thorough criminal investigation, we have neither credible information, nor reason to believe, that more than one incident of this nature occurred,"" he said.Mr. Qaissi's lawyer, Ms. Burke, countered, ""We do not trust the torturers.""Mr. Qaissi seems to have first begun identifying himself as the hooded man in the fall of 2004, by which point he had started his prisoners' group out of a politically charged mosque in Baghdad.In an article in the February 2005 issue of Vanity Fair, Donovan Webster identified Mr. Qaissi as Haj Ali, the likely man on the box, based on an extensive investigation of military records. Soon, Mr. Qaissi was featured in numerous profiles, including in Der Spiegel, reprinted by Salon, as well as on the PBS current affairs program ""Now,"" where he described being shocked: ""It felt like my eyeballs were coming out of my sockets.""With his soft voice and occasionally self-deprecating humor, he has impressed interviewers as affable and credible. He told his story with a level of detail that separated it from that of many others.Most of his assertions and details could be confirmed, Mr. Webster and others stress. In his three-hour interview with The Times, Mr. Qaissi did not veer from reported details and appeared confident in his discussion, punctuating his story with bitter laughter and occasionally, tears. But he never raised the possibility that another man may have also been photographed in the same pose.Human rights workers were compelled by his story, as well. Reporting the Saturday article, The Times relied in part on their statements that he could well be the hooded man, as well as on prison records and interviews with friends and his lawyers, who say they have Mr. Qaissi's blanket, the same one, they said, draped over the man in the photograph. Army officials at the time refused to confirm or refute Mr. Qaissi's claims, citing privacy protections in the Geneva Convention.Abdel Jabbar al-Azzawi, who now lives in Baghdad and says he was in the prison with both Mr. Qaissi and the man named Gilligan and has joined the lawsuit, says he saw Mr. Qaissi wearing the blanket fashioned into a poncho depicted in the photograph, though he did not see the photographs being taken.Mr. Qaissi's lawyers also stress that the iconic photograph is not the basis of his case. In court papers, he also says he was punched, kicked, hit with a stick and chained to his cell while his captors poured cold water over his naked body.Meanwhile, it is not clear what happened to the real hooded man, Mr. Faleh. An Army spokesman said he was released from American custody in January 2004. Tribal leaders, and the manager of a brick factory next to the address where prison records say he lived, said they had never heard the name. Besides, they said, detainees often make up identities when they are imprisoned. Mr. Qaissi's attorneys said they have not attempted to search for him.'"

"'06-03-19,'0','Q. My co-op building recently refinanced the building's mortgage, increasing the amount owed. Personally, I would prefer trying to pay off the mortgage instead of borrowing more. Is there a way I can pay off my own share of the building's mortgage? Jean Savanyu, ManhattanA. Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said there is no practical way -- or legal justification -- for an individual shareholder to pay off his or her ""share"" of a co-op building's mortgage.""The building mortgage represents a debt of the co-op corporation as a whole,"" Mr. Weinstein said. ""And the cost of meeting all of the co-op's obligations are passed on by the corporation to its shareholders in proportion to the number of shares owned by each shareholder.""Indeed, he said, since mortgage refinancing decisions involve many factors -- including old and new interest rates, possible prepayment penalties and, perhaps, a need to raise capital -- it is likely that this board weighed all the appropriate factors and decided it was in the best interest of the co-op to refinance for more than the amount owed on the original mortgage.Rent Increase Is Pegged To Building's New PlumbingQ. For 35 years, we have lived in a prewar building on the Upper West Side that is a mix of rent-regulated and market-priced apartments. There have been problems with the plumbing system for decades, and about three years ago the landlord did a much-needed repiping of the building. Now the owner wants to claim a Major Capital Improvement increase and raise everyone's rent. Does this qualify as an upgrade, or is it simply maintenance? Anne Larsen, ManhattanA. Dov Treiman, a New York lawyer who is publisher of The Landlord-Tenant Monthly, said that in order for work in a building to qualify as a Major Capital Improvement under the rent laws, the system being replaced must have outlived what the law calls its ""useful life"" which, for copper plumbing, is 30 years. In addition, Mr. Treiman said, the improvement must benefit all residents -- either directly or indirectly -- and the cost of the replacement must be depreciable under the tax laws and must not be considered an ordinary repair for tax purposes.""From the question, it sounds as if this change will qualify as a Major Capital Improvement and lead to legal rent increases,"" Mr. Treiman said. Generally, the increase is apportioned on a per-room basis. The amount is calculated by dividing the cost of the improvement by 84 (spreading the monthly payments over seven years), and by then dividing the result by the total number of rooms in the building.'"
"'06-03-19,'0','Many of the biggest companies bulked up during a wave of mergers at the end of the last decade. Mr. McVey said they had disappointed investors since then because their real returns on equity weren't as high as chief executives predicted when they announced those mergers.Although Mr. McVey agrees with many other market strategists that megacaps are relatively cheap compared with the broader stock market, he said he didn't think that lower price-to-earnings ratios alone would spark their revival. ""The catalysts will be simpler business models, greater alignment of executive pay with company performance and better use of capital,"" he said.Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management, said there were many explanations for megacaps having underperformed the market for six years.Initially, he said, megacaps were simply too expensive. By the end of 1999, the 50 largest stocks in the S.& P. 500 had outperformed the index by 4.6 percent a year, on average, during the prior six years. But in the six years since the turn of this decade, the 50 largest stocks have underperformed the index by exactly the same amount, 4.6 percent a year on average.""In 2000, megacaps were overvalued because expectations were too high,"" Mr. Schweitzer said. But when stocks started rebounding in 2003, he said investors began pouring money into small caps, which usually do better coming out of a recession. Now, he said, smaller stocks are overpriced. ""It's the mirror image of 1999,"" when megacaps were too expensive and small caps were cheap, he said.Mr. Schweitzer said he thought that megacaps would shine again ""when it's cloudy out."" If the market hits a rough patch, megacaps would probably fare better than small caps, he said. Megacaps might also benefit if the dollar declined, he said, because they earn much more of their profits overseas than most other United States companies. For instance, the 50 largest companies in the S.& P. 500 earn about 40 percent of their revenue outside the United States. The rest of the companies in that index earn on average less than a quarter of their profit abroad.Mr. Schweitzer said he didn't favor any particular sectors or stocks within megacaps. ""To split them up into sectors, then it becomes very stock-specific,"" he said, since there are often just two or three true megacaps in any one industry. He advises owning a basket of megacap stocks. ""That's a relatively diversified way to have exposure to quality names at a cheap price,"" he said.Michael Metz, chief investment strategist for Oppenheimer & Company, said this was the cheapest he has seen megacap stocks relative to small and midcap stocks. ""That's because the market's been dominated by entrepreneurial investors, rather than typical mutual fund investors,"" he said.Mr. Metz said he thought that individual investors were starting to move money back into equity mutual funds, which he said could benefit larger stocks. Mutual fund investors ""had their fling with the Internet bubble and Enron,"" he said, ""now, when they come back to the market, they'll come back to the names they trust.""But, he added, it takes a lot of money to lift megacap stocks. He believes they will begin to turn the corner this year, but it may take a few years for them to catch up to smaller stocks in terms of price-to-earnings valuations.Wendell Perkins, who co-manages the JohnsonFamily Large Cap Value Fund, says the average size of the stocks in his portfolio has doubled over the last five years, to around $60 billion today. ""We've been steadily climbing the market cap scale,"" in search of undervalued stocks, said Mr. Perkins, who is also the chief investment officer at the fund's adviser, Johnson Asset Management, which is based in Racine, Wis.Johnson's large-cap fund -- which has returned 6.5 percent a year, on average, over the last five years -- includes stocks like Citigroup and Dow Chemical, which have been a drag on total returns. But the fund also has a hefty dose of megacap energy and military contractor stocks, like ConocoPhillips and Northrop Grumman, which helped it beat the S.& P. 500 over the last five years, when the fund's megacap bias and its value-style of investing were out of vogue.Mr. Perkins said he thought that most small-cap stocks, and even many midcap stocks, were overpriced now. And he said this was true across all the major industries. For instance, he said Citigroup and J. P. Morgan have lower price-to-earnings ratios than many regional banks now. Citigroup, the fund's largest holding, closed at $TK.tk on Friday, giving it a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of TK. J. P. Morgan, which the fund also owns, closed at $TK.tk, giving it a P/E ratio of TK.WITHIN the pharmaceutical industry, he said Pfizer and Merck were widely perceived as having weak product pipelines. But he said Johnson & Johnson's stock was cheap now, although it had a pristine balance sheet and a good product pipeline. Johnson & Johnson closed at $TK.tk on Friday, with a trailing P/E ratio of TK.""I think that investors shouldn't underestimate the power of market share,"" Mr. Perkins said. ""These companies are megacaps because they have a lot of advantages of scale and scope and efficiencies.""Like the other market strategists, Mr. Perkins said he thought it might take megacaps a few years to beat the market soundly. ""But there will come a point in time when megacaps excite investors again,"" he said. ""It may be a few years away, but as long-term managers, we're positioning for the future.""SUNDAY MONEY: INVESTING Correction: March 26, 2006, Sunday An article last Sunday about prospects for large-capitalization stocks omitted market data for some such issues as of March 17. Shares of Citigroup closed that day at $47.41, giving it a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 12.40. J. P. Morgan closed at $41.40, giving it a P/E of 17.39.

"'06-03-19,'0','In Hungary, Zsuzsa Racz's ""Stop, Mamma Teresa!"" -- which has sold 130,000 copies in a country where novels typically sell in the low four digits -- follows its idealistic heroine from the provinces to Budapest, where she shares a two-room apartment in a rough neighborhood with her recovering drug addict brother and tries to prevent her desire to help everyone -- her Mother Teresa complex -- from driving her boyfriends away. ""To become the modern, urban, fashionable, independent individual, Kata must change, yet she cannot reject her Mamma Teresa attitude,"" the Hungarian academic Nora Sellei wrote in an essay in the ""Chick Lit"" anthology. In the new order -- where both feminism and social consciousness are considered a relic of Communism -- the line between independence and self-centeredness can be blurry.In Poland, chick lit often features tragic elements, like kidnapping or the specter of suicide. Malgorzata Warda's popular ""Never to Paris"" centers around four young women (including an artist and an interior decorator) who grew up together in Gdansk. Two stay in their home town and two move to Warsaw, but all see themselves in relation to Nina, an anorexic who made it to Paris but returned to Poland. The book has a subplot involving rape and murder -- a far cry from ""Bridget Jones,"" in which romantic disappointment is the worst imaginable fate.Meanwhile, Scandinavian chick lit seems marked by a certain existential angst. The protagonist of Kajsa Ingemarsson's Swedish best seller ""Small Yellow Lemons"" believes she has everything -- a loving boyfriend, a supportive family, a job and close friends -- but then they start slipping away. The Swedish actress Martina Haag's best-selling ""Wonderful and Loved by All (And Things Are Great at Work),"" is about an actress struggling with her career. (Haag will soon star in the movie version. ""So finally she gets the big role!"" said Maria Enberg at the literary agency that represents Haag.)In Finland, the chick-lit genre is still emerging, but there are a few popular titles. Niina Hakalahti's ""Breathless"" is about a writing teacher who lives near Lapland and whose boyfriend has gone to New Guinea to seek enlightenment; its Finnish title can also mean ""feeling out of sorts spiritually,"" said Terhi Isomaki, who handles foreign rights for the book's Finnish publisher. In Pauliina Susi's ""Rush Year,"" a 30-year-old student contends with having a baby, building a house and finishing her master's thesis in one frantic year.The Italian market is saturated with chick lit imports, though a few home-grown titles have emerged, most notably ""Something's Hot in the City,"" by Camilla Vittorini, published by Red Dress Ink, a chick lit imprint Harlequin Mondadori established in 2002. Set in Milan, it follows Sabrina, a feisty and fashionable ad copy writer in her early 30's with a boyfriend who won't commit, close yet difficult women friends and a penchant for Milan's famous aperitivo hour. The novel is lively and believable, with one exception: it takes all the way to Page 24 for Sabrina's mother to call her. It's sold about 9,000 copies, quite respectable in Italy, where the readership in fiction is much smaller than elsewhere in Europe and a significant percentage of books are sold at newsstands, not bookstores.While ""Le Journal de Bridget Jones"" has been popular in France, the country hasn't produced many of its own chick lit authors. (Either readers are too sophisticated or, with a 35-hour work week, maybe they just can't relate.) Nor is chick lit terribly popular in Japan, where women lean toward weepy adolescent love stories or darker literary fiction that deals with the ""isolation and the meaninglessness of modern urban life; boredom and frustration with men and relationships and marriage, and the constraints put on women in Japanese society,"" according to Hamish Macaskill, a literary agent in Tokyo.Meanwhile, there are signs of daring writing by young women in some unexpected corners of the world. In Indonesia, a genre called ""sastra wangi"" or ""fragrant literature"" -- a name some of its authors find condescending -- has been gaining popularity since the fall of the authoritarian Suharto regime in 1998. The genre isn't chick lit per se, although it's quite frank in its treatment of sex and politics. But ""the really interesting thing,"" said Helen Fielding, ""would be to see chick lit coming out of Africa."" Not to mention another great frontier: Neither ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" nor any of Fielding's other books have been translated into Arabic.ESSAY Rachel Donadio is a writer and editor at the Book Review.'"

But an extremely rare glimpse at how these agreements can be orchestrated emerges from Garry Shandling's confidential 1997 settlement with Linda Doucett, his one-time fiancée. Ms. Doucett, an actress on ""The Larry Sanders Show,"" sued Mr. Shandling after he fired her following their breakup in the mid-1990's. Details of their secret settlement were recently obtained by The New York Times.Ms. Doucett got $1 million from Mr. Shandling, who was represented by the Hollywood lawyer Martin D. Singer. She also got a one-page script of what to say should nosy reporters come a calling -- with a few eyebrow-raising lines.Mr. Singer did not respond to a call to his office. Ms. Doucett's lawyer, Raymond L. Friedlob, recalled that she had rejected a few lines that even she couldn't pull off. ""If there are things in the agreement that sound a little corny or far-fetched, you can live with them,"" he said. ""But there are some things she wouldn't say."" DAVID M.

"'06-03-19,'0','As travelers develop ties to their favorite destinations and look for ways to give back to the communities they have visited, a new field called travel philanthropy is starting to develop.Humanitarian adventure travel companies that organize trips to remote, developing regions and deliver aid as part of the journey are beginning to emerge. Relief Riders International, a two-year-old company founded by Alexander Souri, takes clients on 15-day horseback riding adventures through rural Rajasthan, India (above right), to deliver supplies like antibiotics, educational materials for local schools and goats for families. Relief Riders is working with the Red Cross to develop an H.I.V./AIDS information campaign in India and last month helped treat 87 patients in the desert with eye surgery. The cost is $5,400 a person, based on double occupancy, not including airfare; on the Web: www.reliefridersinternational.com.Rural Education and Development, or READ, established by Antonia Neubauer, the president of the Myths and Mountains travel company, has helped communities in Nepal build 39 libraries throughout the country since 1992. This year, the company is working on expanding the project to other developing regions in Vietnam, Nicaragua and India. In October, Ms. Neubauer plans to lead a 14-day trip to Nepal for travelers interested in visiting the libraries and learning more about the program.

""That's what killed her. Blunt force."" Clink. ""And she had pattern injuries."" Clink. ""Win says she had holes punched in her skull, like maybe somebody went after her with a hammer."" Clink. ""So I'm learning about it anyway, even if I missed class.""""You've missed drug-abuse deaths, SIDS, child abuse,"" Tom goes on, moving through the grass, clinking more brass into the bucket.""You know I'll make it up."" She's not sure she can, and Win isn't here to help her.""You've got to."" Tom gets to his feet, stretches his back, his young face serious, maybe more serious than he really feels.He's not the hardhead he pretends to be. Sykes knows. She's seen him with his kids.""What about the P.D., exactly?"" he then says.She explains about Jimmy Barber's basement, about a case file that should never have been taken home and now is missing, tells him about what is seeming like an incredibly careless and inept investigation of an incredibly vicious murder. She's a bit emphatic, hoping he'll understand the importance of what she's doing instead of focusing on what she's not doing.""I don't want to make anybody look bad,"" she says. ""And if I just drop all this and walk away?. . . If Win and I do?""""Don't make excuses for him. He can answer for himself. If we ever see him again. And it's his case, Sykes. His department put him on it.""It may be his case, but that's not how it's feeling. Seems to her she's doing all the work.""And the K.P.D. isn't going to look bad. That was a long time ago, Sykes. Law enforcement has changed dramatically in the past 20 years. Back then all they had was ID techs, nothing like this."" He looks around at his students.""Well, I don't think I can turn my back on it and walk away,"" she says.""Our academy students don't turn their backs and walk away from anything,"" Tom says, almost kindly. ""Tell you what. Tomorrow's gunshot wounds, we'll be working with a couple of ballistic gelatin dummies.""""Well, hell."" She likes shooting up jelly men, as she calls them, even more than the ugly-bastard targets.""Not as crucial as some other things. I can let it slide, find some time later to get you back out on the range. But all next week is bloodstain-pattern analysis. That you can't miss.""She takes off her dark blue cap, wipes the sweat off her brow, watches the other students walking off toward the field house, toward the trucks, toward their futures.""I'll give you until Monday,"" he says.""Nothing,"" Win announces as he creaks down the creaking wooden stairs, remembering how loud they sounded only a few early mornings ago, when his entire life changed.""I told you. We really did play detective and look around after the fact,"" Sammy says from a wing chair near a fireplace covered with a stained-glass screen. ""No other areas of the house were involved. It fits with what she said. He came in behind her, forced her up to the bedroom and that was it, thanks to you.""""That wasn't it, unfortunately."" Win looks around.Lamont's glass fetish doesn't end in her office. Win has never seen anything quite like it. Every light fixture is the same kind he shattered in her bedroom, an exotic half-moon suspended from a hammered-iron chain, hand-painted in vivid colors, signed Ulla Darni, expensive as hell. Her dining-room table is glass, and there are crystal bowls and figurines, art-glass mirrors and vases everywhere.""You know what I'm saying."" Sammy gets up slowly, sighs, as if he's too tired to move. ""Man, oh, man. I need a new back. You satisfied? Can we go now?""""Already been in there. Nothing.""""I haven't been in there.""""Whatever you want,"" Sammy says, shrugging, and out the door they go.In the 1800's, it was a carriage house, brick, a slate roof, now a bit tired and half hidden by the low branches of an old oak tree. Sammy finds the key to the side door, realizes the lock is broken, has been pried open.""It wasn't like this when I was here.. . ."" Sammy slides out his gun. Win's already got his out.Sammy shoves the door open and it bangs against the inside wall, and he lowers his pistol, returns it to its holster. Win lowers his .357, stands just inside the door, looking around, noticing oil stains on concrete, noticing dirty tire tracks, what he would expect inside a garage. Hanging from pegboards are the usual yard and garden tools, and in a corner is a lawn mower, a wheelbarrow and a plastic gallon gas can, half full.""Doesn't look like the gas can came from in here,"" Sammy remarks.""Never thought it did,"" Win replies. ""You plan on torching a place, usually you bring your own accelerants.""""Unless it's an inside job, like a domestic situation. Seen my share of those.""""That's not what this is. Roger Baptista sure as hell wasn't a domestic situation,"" Win says, looking at a rope hanging from the exposed-beam ceiling, a pull-down ladder. ""You already check?"" Win asks.Sammy looks up where Win is looking, says, ""No.""The windows of the imposing Tudor home glint in the sun, the Tennessee River bright blue and gracefully bending in either direction as far as Sykes can see. She climbs out of her old VW Rabbit, figures she looks like a harmless, middle-aged Realtor in a denim pantsuit.The businessman who owns the house where Vivian Finlay was murdered isn't in. Sykes checked, wonders if anyone has bothered to tell him that 20 years ago a 73-year-old woman was beaten to death inside his ritzy house. If he was told, he must not care. That's something. Sykes wouldn't live in a place where someone was murdered, not even if it was given to her. She starts walking around, wondering how Mrs. Finlay's killer got in. There's the front door, and on both sides of the house plenty of windows, but they're small, and it's hard for her to imagine someone climbing through a window in the middle of this neighborhood in the middle of the day. Another door closer to the back of the house appears to lead into the basement, then facing the river is one more door, and through windows on either side of it is a handsome modern kitchen with stainless-steel appliances and lots of tiles and granite.Sykes stands in the backyard taking in the flowers and lush trees, the low wall built of river rock, then the dock and the water. She watches a motorboat roaring past, pulling a hot-dog skier, calls a number she stored in her cellphone as she was driving over here after an academy class that might be the last one she ever attends.""The business office, please,"" Sykes says, and the call is transferred. Then, ""Missy? Hi. Special Agent Delma Sykes again.""""Well, I can tell you this much,"" Missy says. ""Vivian Finlay was a member from April 1972 until October 1985.. . .""""October was probably when her family got around to canceling her membership. These things can take awhile, you know, people don't even think about it.""Sykes feels stupid. What does she know about country clubs or memberships of any type?""Had a full membership,"" Missy is explaining, ""meaning it included tennis and golf.""""What else you got in that file?"" Sykes asks, sitting on the wall, wishing she could look at water without trespassing or going on vacation. Must be something to have so much money you can help yourself to a river.""I mean, old itemized bills that might give some details as to what she bought and did, maybe? For instance, if she ever bought tennis clothes in the pro shop?""""We don't throw away business files, but they wouldn't be here in the office. We have a storage facility.. . .""""I need her old bills, all of them for '85.""""My word, 20 years' worth to dig through. That could take.. . ."" Dismay, an audible sigh.""I'll help you look,"" Sykes says.The upper story of Lamont's garage has been converted into a guest room that doesn't appear to have been used except for the indentations and a little dirt left by feet tracking around the dark brown carpet. Fairly big feet, Win notes. Two different tread patterns.The walls are painted beige and hung with several signed prints -- sailboats, seascapes. There is a single bed covered with a brown spread, a bedside table, a small dresser and a swivel chair and a desk that has nothing on it except an ink blotter, a green glass lamp and a brass letter opener that looks like a dagger. The furniture is inexpensive maple, a small bathroom with a stacked washer-dryer, very neat and clean, looks unlived in, except, of course, for the footwear indentations all over the carpet.""What you got up there?"" Sammy yells from the bottom of the pull-down plywood stairs. ""Want me to come up?""""No need, and there's no room,"" Win says, looking down through the opening at the top of Sammy's graying head. ""Doesn't look like anybody's been staying here, working here. Or if they were, they moved out and cleaned up pretty well. For sure, someone or maybe more than one person has been walking around.""Win pulls a pair of latex gloves out of a pocket, puts them on, starts opening drawers, all of them. He gets down on his hands and knees, looks under the dresser, looks under the bed, something telling him to look everywhere, not sure what for or why except if someone has been in and out of the apartment, obviously since it was cleaned and vacuumed last, then why? And who pried open the locked door downstairs? Did someone come here after Lamont was almost murdered, and if so, what was the person looking for? He opens a closet, opens cabinets under the sinks in the kitchenette and the bathroom, stands in the middle of the living room, looks around some more, his attention wandering to the oven. He walks to it and opens the door.On the bottom rack is a thick manila envelope with the handwritten address of the D.A.'s office and a Knoxville return address, lots of stamps pasted on crooked, hastily, more postage than needed.The envelope has been slit open, and he looks at the letter opener on the desk, the one that reminds him of a dagger. He pulls out a thick case file bound with rubber bands.""You got to be kidding me,"" he exclaims.""The case. She's had it here all along."" Then he's not so sure. ""Or someone has.""Sammy holds on to a rope railing, doesn't climb up any farther, says, ""Huh?"" again.Win holds up the file, says: ""She's had it for three damn months. Since before I started the academy, before she'd even told me I was going. Christ.""""That doesn't make sense. If Knoxville P.D. sent it to her, wouldn't they have mentioned that when you started looking for it?""""No name,"" Win is reading the label again, ""just the address, which I don't recognize. Postmarked June 10. ZIP code's 37921, the Western Avenue, Middlebrook Pike area. Hold on.""He calls Sykes, gets his answer, goes calm the way he does when everything is unraveling. The return address is Jimmy Barber's.""Looks like his roller-derby wife dug in the basement long before you did,"" Win says to Sykes. ""Sent the Finlay file up here, where it's been hiding in an oven.""""A what? The slut lied to me!""""That depends. Did you ever tell her exactly what you were looking for?"" Win asks.""Sykes? You there? Did you tell her?""""Well, not exactly,"" she says.At half past 2, he parks Nana's old Buick behind her house, can see her wind chimes in daylight, their long, hollow tubes moving in the trees and from the eaves and not quite as magical as they are at night. Another car is parked near the basketball hoop, almost in the bushes, an old red Miata. He needs a land line, and right now his apartment seems like a bad idea. He has a feeling about it and has decided to heed it, wouldn't be far-fetched to suppose cops or someone who pries open locks might be patrolling his neighborhood. He knocks, then walks in through the back door, into the kitchen, where Nana sits across from a distraught young woman who is cutting the deck of tarot cards into three stacks. Nana has made hot tea, a house specialty with sticks of cinnamon and fresh slivers of lemon peel. He notices a jar of Tennessee honey on the counter, a spoon nearby.""Guess what we tried, my darling,"" Nana says to him, reaching for a card. ""Your special honey made by joyful bees. This is Suzy. We're taking care of that husband of hers who thinks he doesn't have to abide by the restraining order.""""He's been arrested?"" Win asks Suzy, in her 20's, delicate looking, face puffy from crying.""My boy's a detective,"" Nana says proudly, sipping her tea as nails click and Miss Dog wanders in.Win sits on the floor, starts petting her, and she wants her tummy scratched, and Suzy is saying: ""Twice. Don't do any good. Matt just bails himself out, shows up like last night at my mama's house, waiting behind the hedge, and gets in my face as I'm getting out of the car. He'll kill me. I know it. People don't understand.""""We'll see about that,"" Nana warns.Win asks her where her mama lives, notices Miss Dog is looking remarkably improved. Her sightless eyes seem full of light. She seems to be smiling.""Just down the road,"" Suzy tells him with a question in her voice. ""You should know."" She looks at Miss Dog.He gets it. Suzy's mother is Miss Dog's owner, that figures. ""Miss Dog's not going anywhere,"" he says, and that's that.""I don't care, won't say a word. Mama's awful to her, Matt's worse. I've been telling her the same thing you have. She's gonna get run over by a car.""""Miss Dog's doing just fine,"" Nana says. ""She slept in my bed last night with both the cats.""""So Mama doesn't protect you from Matt?"" Win gets off the floor.""Nothing she can do. He cruises past her house all he wants. Walks right in if he wants. She doesn't do anything.""Win heads into the living room to use the phone. He sits among his grandmother's crystals and mystical clutter and asks to speak to Dr. Reid, a geneticist who works for the DNA lab in California that is analyzing the bloody clothing in the Finlay case. He's told Dr. Reid is on a conference call, can get back with Win in half an hour, and he walks out of the house, starts walking toward Miss Dog's house, her former house. He's seen Matt before, pretty sure of it, small, fat, lots of tattoos, the type to be an abusive bully.""Don't bother me. I'm about to get into a fight,"" he says.""Well, I didn't want to tell you. But if you and me aren't back in class by Monday, we're getting kicked out of the academy.""It will disappoint her more than it will disappoint him. The Massachusetts State Police has its own crime-scene investigators, doesn't need Win out there gathering evidence himself, and he doesn't give a damn about being director of the crime labs or anything else at the moment. It enters his mind that maybe he's lost his enthusiasm, because he suspects the only reason he was sent down South to school was to set him up to work the Finlay case, to position him for selfish, political and, at this point, unknown purposes. And he's no longer sure who is behind what.The house is in sight, about a block up ahead, on the left, a white Chevy truck in the drive.""Don't worry,"" Win says. ""I'll take care of it.""""You can't take care of it! I'm going to be in so much trouble with the T.B.I., probably get fired. I wish you wouldn't keep saying you'll fix something you can't, Win!""""I told you I'm going to take care of it,"" he says, walking faster as Matt emerges from the back of the house, heading to the pickup truck, that brazen, stupid loser.""I should tell you the other thing,"" Sykes says dejectedly. ""I checked with Ms. Trailer-Park-Barber. Soused again, by the way. And you were right.""""She sent the case to the D.A.'s office about two months ago, said some guy, sounded young, kind of rude, called her, gave her instructions. She didn't mention it to me because I didn't ask, says a lot of people call about stuff. I'm sorry.""He grabs the truck's door as it is shutting, and the fat little bully looks at him, shocked, then furious.""Get your damn hands off my truck!""He's mean, stupid, stinks like beer and cigarettes, his breath so bad Win can smell it as he opens the door wide, stands between it and the front seat. He looks into the small, cruel eyes of Suzy's worthless husband, who's probably been hanging around here, waiting for her to show up or, if nothing else, waiting for her to drive past and see him and speed off in terror.""Who are you, and what do you want?"" Matt yells.Win just stares at him, a trick he learned a long time ago on the school playground, after he got bigger, got tired of being picked on. The longer you stare at somebody and don't say anything, the more freaked out the person gets, and Matt's eyes seem to be retreating like little clams digging into the sand, hiding. He's not so tough now. Win stands there, blocking the door, staring at him.""Now just go on, I'm not doing nothing to nobody."" He's spitting as he talks, so scared he just might soil himself.Then Win says, ""I hear you're into kicking dogs and abusing your wife.""""Whoever said that's lying!""Then, ""I just want you to remember my face,"" Win says very quietly, staring, not a trace of emotion. ""You bother Suzy one more time, ever hurt an animal one more time, and this face is going to be the last one you ever see.""THE FUNNY PAGES: III: SUNDAY SERIAL Previous chapters are online at www.nytimes.com/funnypages.'"
"'06-03-19,'0','Inside his friend's decrepit third-floor loft, Mr. Gay parked himself in front of the tall windows, transfixed by the view. Powerful currents swirled the East River, and across the water, a long line of housing projects dominated the panorama of Manhattan. He was mesmerized.""Let me know if you hear of any apartments opening in this building,"" he said to his friend, as so many other New Yorkers have said to so many friends before.His friend laughed. ""It's impossible to get a space in this building,"" he told Mr. Gay.Dejected, Mr. Gay returned to Manhattan and his $500-a-month studio at Bleecker and Sullivan, which he described as ""the noisiest drunken intersection in the world.""But that was a step up from his first living space in New York, a $400-a-month couch in the apartment of a not-too-successful fashion model.His thoughts kept returning to the waterfront views in Dumbo. ""Growing up in Barcelona I was surrounded by water, and looking out those windows I realized how much I missed that,"" Mr. Gay said.Fall arrived, then winter, and one day Mr. Gay's friend called, his voice filled with disbelief. He had seen the single notice in his building offering to sublet a loft that he and Mr. Gay might be able to share.""Tear the sign down so no one else will see it,"" Mr. Gay remembers saying.He went to his friend's place, and they dialed the number. They heard the phone ringing in the loft upstairs and footsteps clomping over to answer it. The woman who held the lease invited them up.The space was a 2,500-square-foot loft, and like all the spaces in the building, it was zoned for commercial use only. But for decades, this building had been filled with residential tenants, although in a tacit ""don't ask, don't tell"" pact, the landlord and the tenants were careful never to use the words ""apartment,"" ""kitchen"" or ""roommates"" during lease negotiations.The woman who was subletting wanted $15,000 in ""key money"" to transfer the $1,400-a-month lease, which the landlord might -- or might not -- renew when it expired in two years. Mr. Gay, who was finding it difficult to cover his expenses, was discouraged. But the leaseholder wouldn't negotiate.""After all,"" she told Mr. Gay, ""someone tore down my sign in the hallway, so there must be a lot excitement over this.""It turned out that no one would meet her price, and three weeks later she told Mr. Gay and his friend that she would drop the demand for key money if they would tack on an extra $200 a month, for a total of $1,600. They quickly agreed.""Suddenly, my monthly rent had gone from $500 to $800,"" Mr. Gay said. ""I don't know how I did it, but somehow I managed to pay it.""The apartment was a like a dream. Mr. Gay loved returning to quiet Dumbo after spending the day in Manhattan applying makeup to fashion models and celebrities like Brooke Shields, Deborah Harry and Isabella Rossellini. His neighbors were mostly artists and other bohemians. He would stargaze on the roof at night and pass sunny afternoons on the riverbank. Once a huge sack of cacao beans washed up; another time he found many little bottles of honey.His building's meandering hallways turned out to be catacombs of treasures. Tenants stored things in the broken-down hallways, often attaching a note saying, ""Please don't take this."" But if there was no note, the object could be yours.""Whenever I thought of something I needed, I'd find it in the building,"" Mr. Gay said. Over the years he has discovered a television, tables, chairs, lumber and artwork.To shop in those early days, Mr. Gay had to walk up dark streets to Brooklyn Heights. There was no dry cleaner or shoe repair shop, let alone a sushi bar.But in the last few years Dumbo has evolved into the Brooklyn version of SoHo, with boutiques, $3 million apartments and a grocery store selling heirloom tomatoes.Mr. Gay took over the loft's lease after his friend moved out three years ago. But the rent has gone up steadily, along with the area's new luxury high-rises.To cope with the increases, about three years ago Mr. Gay subdivided the loft. He kept 1,500 square feet for himself, with an extra bedroom for a roommate and a separate 1,000-square-foot rental loft next door. He did all the work himself, using many materials he found in the hallways.But now Mr. Gay -- a boyish 38, with braces on his teeth and two tiny titanium studs in one nostril -- is calmly facing what many New Yorkers would consider an impending disaster: he believes he will be priced out the neighborhood.He is saving money to buy a place, but given the current prices for waterfront apartments in New York, he is resigned to giving up his valuable river view. Although the waterfront has long satisfied a deep-seated need to connect with nature, he hopes to find a garden where he can meditate.

"'06-03-19,'0','Ms. Dearing said the incubator project was talked about for years, but started taking tangible shape in 2004. Detailed plans for the site were unveiled last October.The building is intended to have 12,000 square feet of space on two floors. An anchor tenant like a retail store or professional office would occupy the ground floor and pay market rent, allowing the second floor to be used by start-up businesses owned by women and members of ethnic and racial minorities. The second-floor incubator tenants would pay discounted rents and would share resources and costs with their neighbors while they establish themselves.The economics of the project make finding an anchor tenant crucial, Ms. Dearing said -- so crucial that construction has been delayed until one can be signed.Some doctors' and lawyers' offices showed interest in the first floor but then backed off, she said. A bank is another possibility, though Citibank, which has a small branch across the street, has decided not to move.As the project has lingered, Ms. Dearing's anxiety has grown along with the project's estimated cost, now at $2.4 million from $1.7 million originally, she said.But hopes are rising that the incubator will become a reality. In what Ms. Dearing described as a change of strategy, Steven C. Bellone, the supervisor of the Town of Babylon, which owns the land and has overall responsibility for the project, said that the town would seek construction bids next month and begin building this summer, with or without an anchor.""At some point, you do have to take leaps of faith in order for a community to grow and come into its own,"" Mr. Bellone said.Leaps of faith are nothing new for embattled North Amityville. Community leaders, worried about a slip back to the bad old days of national notoriety for ""the Corner,"" have pushed for an incubator on the site. They rejected proposals for a laundry, a car wash and a fast-food restaurant on the property, worrying that such uses might encourage loitering and a resurgence of drug trading, Ms. Dearing said.""We didn't want to go back to where we were,"" she said. ""It was a very difficult time. People started leaving the community, abandoning their homes. No one wanted to live here. The whole community was going down.""The police substation occupies a storefront where there was once a bar, in one of two strip shopping centers that served as cover for the drug dealers, said Officer Jim Hillgardner, the one officer assigned to the station on a recent weekday. He said he remembered officers chasing dealers through the lot where the business incubator is planned. At the peak of police activity in the 1990's, Officer Hillgardner said, the 12 officers assigned to the neighborhood made hundreds of drug-related arrests a year. These days the numbers are much lower, he said, as he sat behind his desk thumbing through a newspaper.One of the shopping centers, the one with the police station, has been renovated and is now home to a Tutor Time day care center and the Citibank branch. The other was razed in 1989 and has been replaced by a large Rite Aid pharmacy. A gas station is on another corner. The incubator would complete the redevelopment of the intersection.Some in the area wanted parks built instead, Ms. Dearing said, but that would have been too inviting to the drug dealers. And unlike parkland, new businesses can have a positive economic impact on the area, she added.The redevelopment project has also attracted some political opposition, Ms. Dearing said, because the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, has put his reputation behind it, committing $1.5 million in county money for water and sewer improvements and $100,000 in additional financing. The county also gave land to the town.Mr. Levy said he hoped the North Amityville incubator would become a model for redeveloping other depressed areas, like those in Bellport and Huntington Station, though he declined to name specific sites. Incubators, he said, have ""the ability to enhance economic development, provide needed services and, most importantly, provide a sense of hope for growth in these locales.""If it succeeds, the North Amityville incubator could create 50 jobs and $5 million a year in economic activity, said Martin R. Cantor, the director of economic development for the Long Island Fund for Sustainable Development, which has promoted the plan along with Ms. Dearing's group, the county and the town.Incubators, which offer fledgling businesses a controlled low-cost environment in which to grow, are rare on Long Island; most are meant to foster technology start-ups and are associated with colleges or research laboratories. In predominantly nonwhite or Hispanic areas like North Amityville, they are even rarer. But few have gathered support from as wide a spectrum of political leaders as the North Amityville project.Representative Steve Israel, a Democrat from Dix Hills, lined up $67,000 in federal money for design. Charles J. Fuschillo Jr., the Republican state senator from Merrick, arranged for $150,000 in state money for construction, and Robert K. Sweeney, the Democratic assemblyman from Lindenhurst, arranged for $100,000. The Town of Babylon, Mr. Cantor's organization and various foundations and private lenders are financing the rest.""It sounds like you've got the right people poised to help,"" said Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business advocacy group. ""Now you have to have the right businesses.""There are many potential tenants. Ms. Dearing, whose organization would screen the applicants, said that more than 40 local business people, ranging from a dietary-supplement seller to an oil distributor, had expressed interest. There would be room for up to seven tenants at a time, occupying offices of 250 to 1,000 square feet; they could stay for up to three years before moving out to make room for new tenants.Selecting the most promising businesses is a concern for any incubator, said Dr. Kamer, who serves on the board of the Broadhollow Bioscience Park, a technology incubator at Farmingdale State University.But Mr. Cantor said the challenges are greater for the North Amityville project.""A minority-business incubator will definitely have a bigger hurdle to overcome,"" Mr. Cantor said, ""only because of the prejudice of the business sector against minority businesses, and also the lack of networking that minority businesses have, as compared to the networking with your traditional business sector.""Given the challenges, there is increasing urgency to break ground in North Amityville. Mr. Cantor said he was close to securing gap financing from New York State to cover projected increases in construction costs from the original budget.Though he expects the project to go ahead, he said, ""If the thing went to three, three and a half million dollars, I would tell you it's not going to happen in the short term, because we've got to go raise the money.""Without vigilance, the momentum for redevelopment in North Amityville could stall, said Mr. Bellone, the Babylon supervisor. Earlier this month, the landscaping on the one-acre lot was starting to fray, ""Season's Greetings"" signs had not been removed, a sign announcing a 2005 Babylon planning board meeting lay on its side, and garbage was beginning to collect in places.Mr. Burgess, the letter carrier, said the drug dealing he had seen lately was less flagrant than in the past, but still identifiable to people who knew what to look for. Inspector Robert G. Cassagne of the Suffolk County Police Department's First Precinct acknowledged that it remains a problem in the area.Ms. Dearing, who lives two blocks from the incubator site, said her group was redoubling its efforts, sprucing up the site and installing a sign promoting it to prospective tenants.Assemblyman Sweeney said the community had shown remarkable perseverance. ""A lot of people didn't give them much chance of accomplishing what they've accomplished so far,"" he said. ""But here they are all these years later. I wouldn't sell them short on anything they put their mind to.""'"

"'06-03-19,'0','TransFair describes its logo fees as amounting to just pennies on the pound. The pennies add up. Last year, it generated $1.89 million in licensing fees from companies that used the logo. It also spent $1.7 million on salaries, travel, conferences and publications for the 40-employee organization.Some critics find such expenses excessive. ""Farmers often receive very little,"" said Lawrence Solomon, managing director of the Energy Probe Research Foundation, a Canadian firm that analyzes trade and consumer issues. ""Often fair trade is sold at a premium, but the entire premium goes to the middlemen.""Fair trade programs, which promise a ""fair wage"" to family farmers, have grown rapidly. Today, 35,000 retailers and restaurants nationwide, including some McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts stores, carry products bearing the fair trade label, an increase of 60 percent in three years.Since 1999, more than 100 million pounds of certified Fair Trade coffee, cocoa, tea, rice, sugar, bananas, mangoes, pineapples and grapes have been imported to the United States. Sales of fair trade coffee tripled in that time, making it the fastest-growing part of the specialty coffee business.""There are now 800,000 small-scale farmers benefiting from fair trade,"" said Rick Peyser, director of social advocacy at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in Waterbury, Vt., which has watched its fair trade coffee products grow two to three times as fast as its conventional lines. Fair trade coffee now makes up 23 percent of its $161.5 million in annual sales.Still, it can be difficult for consumers to quantify the benefit they bring to farmers or to understand the complexities of the programs they ostensibly support. As many as 137 food labels, from ""salmon safe"" to ""ozone friendly,"" try to appeal to socially conscious consumers like Mr. Terman.Fair Trade labels don't list the amount paid to farmers; that sum requires research. The amount can vary depending on the commodity. An analysis using information from TransFair shows that cocoa farmers get 3 cents of the $3.49 spent on a 3.5-ounce chocolate bar labeled ""organic fair trade"" sold at Target. Farmers receive 24 cents for a one-pound bag of fair trade sugar sold at Whole Foods for $3.79.The coffee farmer who produced the one-pound bag of coffee purchased by Mr. Terman received $1.26, higher than the commodity rate of $1.10. But whether Mr. Terman paid $10 or $6 for that fair trade coffee, the farmer gets the same $1.26.""There is no reason why fair trade should cost astronomically more than traditional products,"" Nicole Chettero, a spokeswoman for TransFair USA, said. ""We truly believe that the market will work itself out as Fair Trade certified products move from being a niche market to a mainstream option. As the demand and volume of Fair Trade certified products increase, retailers will naturally start to drop prices to remain competitive.""In Europe, where fair trade is more pervasive, some critics complain that retailers have taken advantage of consumers who are not price-sensitive. At one point, Britain's largest chain of coffee shops, Costa Coffee, added 18 cents to the price of a cup of cappuccino brewed from fair trade coffee. Yet the coffee cost the chain just one or two cents extra, according to research by Tim Harford, author of the book ""The Undercover Economist."" The chain has since reduced its price for the drink.""Fair trade products make a promise that the producers will get a good deal,"" Mr. Harford said. ""They do not promise that the consumer will get a good deal. That's down to you as a savvy shopper. You can find out how much farmers are getting and reward retailers who don't try to charge you something on top.""Each fair trade commodity has its own fair trade price, or the lowest price farmers will receive even if conventional commodity prices fall. That price is meant to allow them to cover their cost of production and improve their lives -- by, for instance, providing money to be invested in their farms and in schools.Yet a price that is fair in one country may not be in another. In Brazil, ""$1.26 per pound for coffee is a fortune,"" said Kevin Knox, a coffee consultant in Boulder, Colo. ""In the forest in the mountains of Mexico, the money barely is enough to justify doing it. Their yields are small, and the costs of production are higher.""In some cases, the individual farmers may receive less than fair trade rules require because the money goes to cooperatives, which have their own directors who decide how much to pass on to farmers.""We did a breakdown and saw that sometimes, what they're paying farmers is only 70 cents to 80 cents a pound"" for coffee instead of the entire fair trade price of $1.26, said Christy Thorns, a buyer at Allegro Coffee, a roaster in Thornton, Colo., that is owned by Whole Foods. ""There are so many layers involved.""Transfair, she said, doesn't ""clearly communicate that to consumers.""Allegro is among a number of coffee and tea companies setting up their own systems to work directly with farmers and protect the environment. Allegro buys some of its coffee from fair trade farmers, but mostly it buys directly from other farmers, paying them based on quality, not market prices. In some cases, Allegro pays farmers as much as $2.25 a pound, Ms. Thorns said.Starbucks, which bought 11.5 million pounds of fair trade coffee last year, has created a buying program called CAFE, for Coffee and Farmer Equity Practices, and tries to ensure quality and protect the environment as well as maintain equitable relationships with farmers.The company plans to buy most of its coffee through this program, which is overseen by Scientific Certification Systems in Emeryville, Calif. Starbucks requires suppliers to provide receipts showing how each party in the supply chain was paid, but it has no fixed price for the coffee. Starbucks' Web site tells consumers about the program.Still, the fair trade system, which is independent of the food industry, carries weight in the mind of Shel Horowitz, a writer in Hadley, Mass. He buys fair trade products when he can, especially cocoa, after he read a report that much of the cocoa produced in Ivory Coast uses child slave labor.""When I found out about it, I was horrified,"" said Mr. Horowitz, who asked his wife to return a package of conventional cocoa to the store. ""I didn't want to be party to that. I try to minimize the impact of my consumerism on people who have very little.""The Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International in Bonn audits cocoa farms to make sure children's rights are protected.SHOPPING activism in the United States has helped funnel $67 million to fair trade farmers and farm workers throughout Latin America, Africa and Asia since 1999, according to TransFair. Without fair trade, supporters say, some farmers have no access to market information and can often be duped into selling to middlemen at below-market prices or, if prices fall, can be forced to quit farming.Ms. Chettero acknowledges the fair trade system is not perfect but said it is a step toward farmers improving their lives. If not for consumers and the fair trade system, she said, ""Who else is going to do it?""'"

"'06-03-20,'0','The AT&T-BellSouth deal ""doesn't change anything for us,"" Mr. Seidenberg said, sitting in his lower Manhattan office that, in an odd coincidence, used to house the old New York Telephone Company, which hired him as a cable splicer's helper in 1966. Today, he said, Verizon ""is all about trying to invest in technology so we can create new growth.""Turning Verizon into a fast-growing technology company represents a huge gamble for Mr. Seidenberg, 59, who will go down in corporate history either as the man who took a stodgy carrier into the next century or as someone who reached too far too fast. His success or failure at revamping Verizon will also provide some clues about how viable traditional phone companies will be in the years ahead.Last year, Wall Street punished Verizon's stock because Mr. Seidenberg's plan to run fiber optic lines to as many as 16 million homes, or nearly half of Verizon's phone customers, by 2010 was considered reckless. The cost of installing fiber — now about $2,000 a home — was so high that investors sent Verizon's shares tumbling 26 percent last year. (The shares, however, have risen 13 percent this year, closing at $34.41 on Friday.)The fiber network will undoubtedly offer premium service, but industry analysts remain deeply skeptical that millions of consumers will drop their cable or satellite services to sign up with Verizon. Still, in some towns in Texas where Verizon started selling television service last year, the reception has been positive; about one-third of the homes offered it signed up.Either way, Mr. Seidenberg has proven his critics wrong before. About five years ago, when investors urged him to grab more wireless customers by cutting prices, as rival companies were doing, he chose instead to spend heavily to build a national cellular network that could be upgraded easily.That strategy has paid off. Verizon Wireless is now signing up record numbers of new subscribers and they are the most loyal in the industry, largely because Verizon's network is considered better than others. While Cingular, which is owned by AT&T and BellSouth, has more subscribers, Verizon Wireless has more advanced multimedia services.At the same time, Mr. Seidenberg plans over time to shed millions of local phone lines, withdrawing from a business that is being eroded by wireless phones and Internet-based phone services. He sold off 700,000 lines in Hawaii in 2005 and has said he is willing to sell Verizon local lines in other parts of the country where it does not do much business.He also dismissed speculation that Verizon would acquire Qwest Communications, the smallest Bell company, which serves 14 Western states.His top priority now is to buy the 45 percent of Verizon Wireless held by Vodafone; the stake is worth between $38 billion and $43 billion, according to analysts' estimates. Mr. Seidenberg said he was ""a willing buyer"" because Verizon would be able to book 100 percent of the profits from Verizon Wireless.To make the deal, he said in an interview last week that Verizon was willing to buy Vodafone's shares in several chunks rather than in one piece, and even to revise the dividend it pays Vodafone during that process.But he rejected talk that Verizon might pursue Alltel, the fifth-largest cellphone company, which uses the same technology as Verizon Wireless and covers many parts of the country that Verizon does not. Alltel, he said, would only make Verizon bigger, not necessarily faster-growing.Mr. Seidenberg's emphasis on growth over size is one way he hopes to differentiate Verizon from AT&T in investors' minds. His wary approach to mergers sets him apart from Mr. Whitacre, who has been an open and aggressive buyer over the past decade.""They both understand their businesses well, but they have different styles,"" said Robert Rock, a telecommunications analyst at John Hancock in Boston. ""With Ed, what you see is what you get, where Ivan is a more strategic thinker.""Mr. Seidenberg has not been shy about buying companies either, just more nuanced in doing so. As chief executive of Nynex, he sold the company to Bell Atlantic in 1997. Instead of leaving, he became vice chairman and waited until Bell Atlantic's chairman, Raymond W. Smith, retired.Two years later, he had full control of Bell Atlantic, which he merged with GTE in 2000 and renamed Verizon. Again, he took a subordinate role, this time to Charles R. Lee, GTE's chairman. In 2002, Mr. Lee became chairman and Mr. Seidenberg became the sole chief executive. Two years later, Mr. Seidenberg became chairman after Mr. Lee left the company.Though Mr. Seidenberg joined New York Telephone as a cable splicer and spent a decade in a series of engineering jobs, he started on the road to upper management when he joined AT&T's regulatory department in 1976.The dozen or so years Mr. Seidenberg spent dealing with lawmakers in Washington, some analysts say, taught him to be cunning and flexible.Consider the handling of the debate over whether the Bell companies should be allowed to charge Internet content providers for faster connections to their customers.Mr. Whitacre of AT&T drew loud criticism in November when he told Business Week that ""for a Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes free is nuts!"" The comments galvanized consumer advocates and Internet content providers and pushed a once-obscure issue into prominence.Though Verizon wants similar freedom to adjust its services, Mr. Seidenberg has largely been quiet, letting his lawyers in Washington do most of the talking.Regardless of which public relations approach they take, Verizon and AT&T share the same basic problem. With the number of traditional phone lines shrinking, they hope to compete with cable providers on cable's turf — selling television service.To offer that service, Mr. Whitacre is taking a less costly — but also less proven — approach to his fiber network rollout than Mr. Seidenberg. AT&T is stringing fiber lines to neighborhoods and using the existing copper lines to connect the rest of the way to homes. It is expected to spend about $12 billion on its network by 2010 to serve nearly 32 million homes (including those of BellSouth customers), according to Bernstein Research.Verizon will spend about $18 billion by 2010 to run fiber lines into people's homes, Bernstein says. The Verizon network will serve half that number of customers, but will offer more bandwidth than networks run by AT&T and the cable companies.Mr. Seidenberg insists that the cost of running fiber to individual homes is declining, and says that in a few years, investors will see the wisdom of spending more now to generate growth later. While smaller competitors are cutting into his phone business, he says, Verizon has the tools to strike back.""We're big, but we take big steps,"" he said. ""So we can catch them pretty quickly.""'"

"'06-03-20,'0','The chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, was criticized for not doing enough to stop the carnage. He has since been accused of not doing enough to bring people who committed crimes to justice.Cases were swiftly closed by the police, and reopened only after intervention by the Indian Supreme Court. Mr. Modi's own popularity in this heavily Hindu-majority state does not appear to have suffered. He was re-elected by a handsome margin in December 2002.[The remains are not the only unresolved mystery surrounding the Gujarat violence. An official government inquiry, led by a retired Supreme Court judge, concluded in early March that the train fire that started the chain of death was not an arson, as initially reported, but an accident that began in the train.[The chief author of the report spoke to reporters about his conclusion. But the report itself has not been released yet because of the angry political arguments it set off. Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist party has denounced it, not least because the inquiry was initiated by one of the party's chief political opponents, Lalu Prasad Yadav, a lower-caste politician from Bihar who now is the federal railway minister. The report's critics say it is politically motivated.]The police maintain that no one came forward to claim the bodies of the Pandarwada dead, and so they had them buried. The victims' relatives tell another story.""I went to the police station 8 times to inquire about my brother's dead body and 21 times to collect the police report and post-mortem report,"" insisted Hussain Bhai Shaikh, a day laborer who had watched the mob butcher his brother, Bismillah Habib Shaikh.Eventually, Mr. Shaikh said, the police gave him the autopsy report, and the state paid the family about $3,125 in compensation. But he never saw his brother's remains, nor did he receive any clues as to where they were buried.Teesta Setalvad, the secretary of Citizens for Justice and Peace, the lead advocacy group fighting for justice for the Gujarat riot victims, accused the police of ""complete callousness.""J. K. Bhatt, who took over as police chief of Pandarwada's district late last year, said that he was not aware of the details of what happened immediately after the March 2002 massacre, only that the police had buried the victims as quickly as they could.""None of the family members came forward to claim the bodies as per our records,"" he said. ""Maybe all the formalities were not done at that time because police was very much busy in riot control at that time.""Ameena Bibi had hidden in the wheat fields with her entire family. The mob had already looted her house and burned it down. Then the hard-liners hacked to death her 24-year-old son, Ayub Habib Saiyed.Several times, Ms. Ameena Bibi said, her family went to the police to ask about his body. Never, she said, did they get a straight answer.Late last year, on Dec. 27, villagers, on a tip from an unidentified municipal worker, began digging around a garbage pit surrounded by wild shrubs. Three feet down, they found five skulls and the remains of what Ms. Ameena Bibi insists is her son's chocolate-brown shirt.She is waiting for the government laboratory to complete the DNA tests. If the remains are those of her son, she said, she will finally do what she has been unable to for four years.""I will collect every single bone of my son and give him a dignified burial in Muslim graveyard,"" she said.'"

It occurred on March 8 during a knockout team event at the Grand Island Regional outside Buffalo.At the other table, South passed as dealer, permitting West to open his 11-point hand with one diamond. That resulted in East's buying the contract in four hearts, which went the obvious down one.Here, South opened one club. I agree with this bid. First, it pays to open. It is like winning the toss in overtime in a football game -- there is no guarantee of victory, but it improves your chances. Second, the hand contains a good five-card suit, two tens and three nines (high spot-card count -- the total of the spots on all of the nonpicture cards -- is good), and there is no rebid problem. (I have one other criterion for a thin opening: the hand should contain at least either one ace or two kings. This hand passes muster there, too.) West passed, North responded one diamond, and East made the straightforward four-heart overcall. After two passes, North doubled, saying that he had too many points to pass but no clear-cut bid available. Especially with that ""soft"" heart holding, it looks normal to pass with the South hand -- and win 2 international match points -- but he removed to four spades.West, John Duquette of Oshawa, Ontario, led his singleton heart. East, Dan Gerstman of Buffalo, won with his ace and returned the heart deuce, a suit-preference signal screaming for a club return.Now West found the only winning defense: he ruffed with the spade ace. West then cashed his club ace and gave his partner a club ruff for down one and a gain of 3 imps.'"
"'06-03-20,'0','The records include international financial transfers from the Emirates Red Crescent Society as well as budget and program reports from its Jerusalem branch, which handles programs in the Palestinian territories. They show differences between American and Emirate views of Palestinian violence, although President Bush has said the countries see eye to eye on fighting terrorism.In 2002, according to a spreadsheet of the annual budget, the U.A.E. Friends Society in Jerusalem, the local branch of the Red Crescent, designated $100,000 to pay 50 annual stipends of $2,000 under a ""martyrs' families sponsorship"" program.Officials from the government and the Red Crescent Society said ""martyrs"" referred to any Palestinian who had died in the conflict with Israel, including civilians and armed fighters. In a news release on May 5, 2002, Mohammed Hamad Saif, a representative accompanying a 40-ton shipment of Red Crescent relief supplies, said ""the priority"" of that aid would be ""the needy and families of the wounded and martyrs.""In one case, the documents show, the Emirates Red Crescent provided cash payments to the wife and two children of Anwar Awni Mustafa Abdel Ghani, who was identified in a news release on Feb. 15, 2002, from Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant organization, as a mujahid, or fighter, for the group. The news release, and news reports from that date, indicate that Mr. Abdel Ghani was killed in a clash that day with Israeli forces in a village near Tulkarm in the West Bank.Emirates government and Red Crescent officials confirmed that the martyrs' family support continues, including payments for at least one of Mr. Abdel Ghani's children.There are sharp differences between American and Emirates officials over assistance to ""martyrs."" United States officials say payments to families of violent militants constitute direct support for their cause and encourage others to join.Officials of the Emirates government and the Red Crescent Society said the payments helped create possibilities for younger Palestinians. They said most of the beneficiaries were relatives of civilians who had been killed, and that the society handed out cash payments only for Palestinians under 18. Spouses and older children receive coupons for food, medicine and housing materials.""What is the fault of the orphans?"" a government official said, referring to children in the martyrs' program. ""By helping them, you are pulling them away from extremism.""Daniel Glaser, a deputy assistant Treasury secretary, said the Emirates was ""one of our primary partners"" in the Middle East in combating financing of terrorist groups. He said the Treasury had a close working relationship with the Emirates central bank, and that financial officials there had provided concrete cooperation in recent investigations.Mr. Glaser said he was not familiar with the details of Red Crescent programs. But as a general matter, he said, ""Charities that are supporting terrorist activities, including by supporting family members and orphans -- we consider that to be terrorist financing.""The documents contain no evidence that the Emirates provided direct aid to armed militant groups.In the ports controversy, President Bush hailed the Emirates as a like-minded ally in fighting terrorism. He cited support from the sheiks who lead the Emirates for American efforts in Iraq, including a United States military air base there.But in Israel, some Palestinians regarded as terrorists by the United States are viewed as resistance fighters and martyrs by the Emirates officials.The Emirates government condemns suicide bombings and terrorist attacks on civilians, and officials said the Red Crescent Society had taken increasingly strict precautions to avoid providing relief to Palestinian groups engaging in such attacks, or to social groups linked to them or to bombers' families.After ""bad experiences"" during the mayhem of 2002 and 2003, when some Emirates Red Crescent money ended up in militants' hands, the organization has used modern controls to track its donations and vet its staff, the government official said.The official said there was no direct cooperation between the Emirates Red Crescent Society and Hamas. He requested anonymity, saying he did not want to awaken new controversy between the Emirates and the United States.Documents from before 2004 show that the Red Crescent made donations through the Tulkarm Zakat Committee, identified at that time by American officials as a Hamas front. A top administrator at the Red Crescent's Jerusalem offices was Najih Bakirat, whom Israel has identified repeatedly as a Hamas member.But the Emirates officials said they had stopped sending money to the Zakat Committee and had cut ties with Mr. Bakirat when questions arose about his political activities.The secretary general of the Emirates Red Crescent, Sanaa Darwish al-Kitbe, said the goal of its Palestinian programs was to ""influence the negative atmosphere"" to build peace. ""By building homes and helping people to have a better life,"" she said, responding to written questions with a statement sent by e-mail, ""you are creating some hope in the middle of all this suffering,"" allowing young Palestinians to ""concentrate on the positive and move away from extremist views and actions.""'"

"'06-03-20,'0','Andrew Sherratt, a British archaeologist whose explorations of animal husbandry and other civilizing practices shed light on European prehistory, died Feb. 24 near his home in Witney, Oxfordshire. He was 59.The cause was heart failure, said a spokeswoman for the University of Sheffield, where Dr. Sherratt became a professor of Old World prehistory last year.A researcher of eclectic interests, he studied the use of alcohol and narcotics in prehistory and the monumental arrangements of standing stones known as megaliths, but was most widely known for his work with the origins of animal products like milk and wool.Dr. Sherratt and others theorized that renewable products from animals brought on a lasting shift in Europe's prehistory, beginning around 3500 B.C.Animals had probably been domesticated about 3,000 years earlier, but were then used chiefly as sources of meat, bones and hides. At the end of the Neolithic period and the beginning of the Bronze Age, Europeans began to value animals as a sustainable resource for secondary products and agricultural labor.'"
"'06-03-20,'0','Randall David Cook's new play, ""Sake With the Haiku Geisha,"" a collection of five anecdotes inspired by the playwright's own experience as an English-language teacher in Japan, is an often observant, witty evening about the ways in which other cultures can unexpectedly impinge on our own individual experience. When Mr. Cook reaches for broader statements about humanity, though, those strengths of observation and humor fall by the wayside.This elegant and precise production by the Gotham Stage Company, staged by Alex Lippard, combines Western realistic and Japanese Noh theater techniques. It is at its best in the first half of the 100-minute, intermissionless evening, as three 20-something English-language teachers are invited to share their stories on the last night of their visits to Japan. The uptight British graduate of Oxford, the gay but virginal American Southerner, and the hostile and sarcastic Canadian woman reveal small epiphanies that have affected their ways of dealing with loss, isolation and death, epiphanies that have their origins in the confusing culture in which they find themselves.The three instructors are in Japan because they are ""running from themselves,"" but the grace of the playwright's language and observations happily obscures this pedestrian insight. The other two anecdotes of the evening are less fortunate. As the Japanese host tells the story of his own family's decision to embrace English as a second language, Mr. Cook's powerful description of the effects of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs becomes lost in a vague if well-intentioned plea for communication. The anecdote about the Haiku Geisha herself, a traditional hostess who speaks only in the poetic form most associated with Japanese culture, turns out to be a predictable tale of true love confronting the threat of an arranged marriage.Among the seven-member cast, Fiona Gallagher brings a free, comic but touching ferocity to her role as the emotionally wounded Canadian teacher, David Shih is a commanding but complex presence as the Japanese host and Angela Lin makes a most mysterious impression in the title role. David Newell's set provides an unexpected, effective and entirely welcome coup de théâtre in the middle of the show.""Sake with the Haiku Geisha"" continues through April 8 at the Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444.'"
"'06-03-20,'0','SAN DIEGO, March 19 - After the Cuban baseball team declined to make its players available to talk about opposing Japan in Monday's championship of the World Baseball Classic, speculation started to swirl that someone might have defected.When Pedro Cabrera, a spokesman for the team, was asked Sunday if a player had left the team to pursue political asylum, he laughed and said, ""There have been no defections.""The Cubans did not work out at Petco Park, but players lifted weights in an area off limits to reporters. As the players strolled through the bowels of the stadium to reach the team bus, they looked relaxed. Manager Higinio Velez gave Cuban pins to stadium employees.Two members of Major League Baseball's security detail have been with the Cuban team throughout the tournament. Kevin Hallinan, the senior vice president for security, said his officers would know if a player had defected.""I just came from a staff meeting 10 or 15 minutes ago and I haven't heard anything like that,"" Hallinan said. ""I know nothing at all about something like that happening.""'"
"'06-03-20,'0','More important, perhaps, is the feature that allows Expo users to choose to view only listings from people in their MSN Messenger contact list or personal e-mail groups. MSN Messenger users will see a pulsating star next to the name of anyone on their list who has recently placed a new item for sale on Expo or made a new posting on MSN Spaces, Microsoft's popular blogging service.With 205 million people signed up as Messenger users, and another 40 million users of MSN Spaces (and 100 million Spaces visitors in the last 16 months), the company already has a strong network of potential classifieds customers, said Garry Wiseman, Microsoft's product unit manager for Windows Live Expo.""I've seen some sites attempt to create these kinds of services, but they have to build it up, which takes forever,"" Mr. Wiseman said. ""We already had this massive network.""Mr. Wiseman said Microsoft would not charge for classified listings in the short term, but might charge businesses to post job or auto listings, as Craigslist does. He also said Microsoft was exploring a way to distribute the ads in print publications owned by other companies, and share in the revenue.Ms. Li, the Forrester analyst, said Microsoft was wise to use the array of services within Windows Live to help users sell goods and services more easily. ""It's a fantastic idea,"" she said. ""People love eBay so much because it's about community. Expo has the potential to have it, whereas classifieds don't have that soul.""Fans of Craigslist -- many of whom bare their most intimate thoughts on the site's discussion boards -- would disagree, and perhaps reel at the notion of Microsoft having more soul than their beloved, humble servant of a Web site, with its staff of 19.Whatever the label, Microsoft may find that the wheels of commerce will roll more even quickly among people who are more closely connected than the like-minded strangers who congregate on Craigslist.Of course, Microsoft's idea has been tried before, back when Friendster was the future star du jour. Tribe.net, a social networking site, received backing from three major newspaper chains in 2003 on the logic that it might help them win back some of the classified advertising revenue that has migrated online in recent years.But social networking sites have so far failed to generate nearly as many classified advertising listings as Craigslist, analysts said, partly because users have seen those sites more as places to hook up for romance or friendship than for local commerce -- an area Craigslist has increasingly ruled in the last year.Just as eBay has built a sizable lead against competing services because it has exponentially more merchandise to offer, so too has Craigslist become a go-to site for anyone looking for housing and other products and services in markets like San Francisco and New York. Likewise, sellers now flock to the site in those markets because that's where the buyers are.According to comScore Networks, an online consultant, 8.5 million people visited a Craigslist Web site in February, up from 3.7 million a year earlier. The closest competitor was the Trader Publishing Company, a Norfolk, Va.-based publisher of classified ad magazines and Web sites largely devoted to certain categories of goods, like boats, automobiles and luxury homes. Tribe, meanwhile, attracted 740,000 users. The stakes are high for the category winner. Forrester predicts that online classifieds will generate $3.1 billion in sales this year -- a 17 percent jump from last year -- and will reach $4.7 billion by 2010. Newspaper classifieds, by contrast, will reach about $15 billion, up just 5 percent from last year.Craigslist, which is privately held, does not disclose revenue. Its growth has come from its expansion into new locations -- as of last week, it had 205 sites covering cities in every state, as well as cities in 35 foreign nations.Jim Buckmaster, the chief executive of Craigslist, said the company was concentrating more on starting multilingual sites than other features or services.""We can't match them resource for resource, even if we were so inclined,"" Mr. Buckmaster said of his competitors. ""But we don't try to match them in technology bells and whistles, since that's not the kind of thing our users request.""Craigslist has, Mr. Buckmaster said, sustained its growth rate despite Google's recent introduction of Base, which many people have used to post classified ads (Base's numbers, which Google would not disclose, are still small enough not to register on commonly used Internet statistics), and the introduction in foreign cities of classified sites by eBay's Kijiji unit. (Ebay own a 25 percent stake in Craigslist). ""The need for this kind of service is so vast that many companies can address it together,"" he said. ""I don't think it has to be a zero sum game.""Still, Mr. Buckmaster suggests he could be wrong.""Now at least we'll get to see whether our philosophy and way of running things is as important as we think it is,"" he said. ""Who knows? Maybe incremental technological bells and whistles mean a lot. But the experiment has begun.""'"
"'06-03-20,'0','The Zurich American Insurance Company, a unit of the Swiss insurer Zurich Financial, agreed yesterday to pay $171.7 million in cash to settle allegations of commercial insurance price-fixing and bid-rigging with Texas and eight other states.Zurich American is the first of 25 insurers and brokers to settle in a lawsuit in Federal District Court in New Jersey.Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, said that Zurich and other firms worked with Marsh & McLennan, the insurance broker, which devised an ""anticompetitive scheme"" to ""artificially inflate premiums and pay improper commissions"" to those who brokered insurance deals.Mark Tobey, the Texas attorney general's chief of antitrust enforcement, said $151.7 million of the settlement would go to policyholders who were overcharged.

"'06-03-21,'0','Scientists who have read the book say that somehow, Ms. Goodman has managed to write a tale about life in a science lab that rings so true and includes details so accurate and vivid that they say they are left reeling.How could an outsider, someone who has not been bathed in the culture and mores of science, get it so right?""I think it's a unique book because it completely nails this world,"" said Dr. Jerome Groopman, an oncologist and a professor of medicine at Harvard and the director of a laboratory there.""It understands the psychology, the dynamics, the processes and pressures that exist in the current culture of science,"" Dr. Groopman, who reviewed ""Intuition"" for the online magazine Slate, said in a telephone interview. ""I was stunned. I was really stunned.""At its base, ""Intuition"" is a novel about scientific fraud. A postdoctoral student becomes suspicious that another postdoc's dazzling discovery might not be all it seems. His data seem too good to be true.It is a tale that evokes the famous case in the 1980's, when a postdoctoral student, Margot O'Toole, accused a researcher in David Baltimore's lab, Thereza Imanishi-Kari, of faking data published in the journal Cell. As in the Baltimore case, the allegations in Ms. Goodman's novel end up with an investigation by the National Institutes of Health, hearings in Congress and an appeal. (In the real case, Dr. Imanishi-Kari was exonerated.)But Ms. Goodman's novel is neither science history nor anthropology. She did read a book on the Baltimore affair, by the historian Daniel Kevles of Yale, but her aim was not to write a thinly disguised rehash of that painful episode.Instead, Ms. Goodman says, she wanted to write about character and motives and ambiguity. Her book, she said, is about a family — a professional family, the family of a lab — that was, in the end, destroyed.""I knew science was a great topic, with its rituals and hierarchies and moral ambiguities and dysfunctions,"" Ms. Goodman said.She added: ""People write about kings and queens and the important part of society. To me, the scientists, that's the nobility. The questions they work on are so fundamental.""Ms. Goodman, a 38-year-old car-pooling mother of three grade school boys and a 3-year-old girl, is not a complete stranger to science. Her husband, David Karger, is a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her sister, Dr. Paula Fraenkel, studies zebrafish at Harvard Medical School. Her mother, Madeleine Goodman, was an epidemiologist at the University of Hawaii. Some of her friends are scientists, and she has seen their struggles and triumphs, but at a distance.Ms. Goodman was always the literary one in her family. At 15, she was obsessed with John Donne. She received a Ph.D. from Stanford in English literature in 1997.She delves into contemporary literary fiction and loves classic writers, like George Eliot and Charles Dickens. ""Intuition"" began with a literary notion — the idea of a couple whose relationship becomes poisoned by suspicion.She envisioned one member of the couple becoming convinced that the other is cheating, but not being completely sure.""I am not interested in adultery,"" Ms. Goodman said. ""That's been done.""Instead, she said, ""I thought of moral ambiguity.""She thought of science, and the gray areas, the times when experiments stopped working or results were questioned and it was so hard to figure out what had happened. Was it human error? Was it sloppiness? Was it a natural human tendency to believe in a hypothesis so strongly that somehow data that do not seem to fit are edited out? Or was it fraud?Ms. Goodman started reading accounts of scientific fraud and saw, she said, ""how dry they were,"" although, she added, ""their essence was compelling.""What I was interested in was not the mechanics but the motives,"" Ms. Goodman said.Five years ago, as she started research for the book, an acquaintance of her brother-in-law gave her some advice.""Allegra,"" he told her, ""what you have to capture is the bitterness of being a postdoc.""She laughs in telling the story. Bitterness, she says, she can do. She is a novelist, she understands bitterness. What she had to learn was the minute, telling details of how a lab actually works. That meant that she had to go to a lab and observe and then write about it so vividly and accurately that scientists would feel she must be one of them.She knew that researchers would be nervous with her hanging around, taking notes, and she did not want to impose on her family or friends. So she found friends of friends who let her into their laboratories at the Whitehead Institute, not far from her home in Cambridge.Ms. Goodman visited the labs only a few times in the late winter of 2001 and early spring of 2002, ""an afternoon here and there over a few months,"" she said. ""I was trying really hard to make the most of whatever time I had there.""She kept detailed notes, printing names and dimensions of equipment in a notebook, drawing little pictures of what a mouse's cage looked like, where the water bottle was, noting what was on the bottom of the cage and what the food smelled like — ""slightly fermented granola just going bad.""She asked how the scientists punched holes in the animals' ears to attach tags that identified them. She jotted down that the mice had ""tiny pink toes."" She watched an autopsy of a female mouse and noticed that female mice have rows of mammary glands that go up to their chins. She noticed that when mice are anesthetized their bodies go limp but their ears are erect. She drew a picture. And she drew a map: 36 cages on a rack, 300 mice in the room.""I wanted to take the reader there, to give the reader that concrete sense of process, people working,"" Ms. Goodman said.Once, she saw a sign that had been posted by a postdoctoral student: ""DO NOT use my NaOH!! STOP!!!!""""I copied that. It was just too good,"" she said. The sign shows up in her book.She also noticed the routine, casual ways that the scientists would deviate from their protocols. There was a laminar flow hood in the lab to allow researchers to work with the mice and not spread any viruses from the mice into the room, possibly infecting other animals. The researchers often ignored that hood.""There is the theory and then there is the practice,"" Ms. Goodman says. ""All that was very, very interesting to me.""When it came to writing the novel, Ms. Goodman mapped out each chapter with detailed outlines in notes that looked much like a script for a play. She diagrammed scenes; a few pages away from a drawing of a mouse cage in one of her notebooks is a sketch of the annual picnic that the laboratory held on the grounds at Walden Pond.(She also clocked her husband swimming back and forth across the pond so that when her characters did the same thing, she could get the timing right.)When she finished a second draft, Ms. Goodman showed the manuscript to Tom Schwarz, a researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston. Friends with Dr. Schwarz's wife, Ms. Goodman wanted his opinion: was the science right?Dr. Schwarz said he began to read the book and could not believe it. Ms. Goodman had not interviewed him, and she had not been to his lab. But, Dr. Schwarz said, ""I saw myself and I saw things I knew, everything from the greasy falafels from the truck parked outside to the characters.""He recalled a scene in which a young postdoc, Cliff, on the verge of being dismissed from the lab, suddenly has astonishing results. He presents them to his colleagues at a lab meeting.""The researchers were all staring: intent, admiring, jealous,"" Ms. Goodman wrote. ""These were Cliff's siblings. They had been his peers here at the wood-grain table, they'd drunk bad coffee with him at these meetings.""Now everything was changed and, Ms. Goodman continued, ""their emotions became much more complex.""Reading the scene, Dr. Schwarz said: ""I had a tingle in my spine. How did she know?"" The book, he noted, ""also beautifully puts its finger on the ideals of science"" the tension between the need to tell the truth and the need to present research in its most promising light.Dr. Schwarz said he got a dose of this when he was a young Stanford professor in the early 1990's. He wrote a draft of a paper and showed it to a colleague who, Dr. Schwarz recalled, said, ""If you want to send it to Nature, you have to take the hemline up a few inches.""For Ms. Goodman, the trick was not so much getting the nuances of science right as recognizing what a lab can reveal about jealousy and aspirations and, yes, nobility.In one scene in her book, Dr. Mendelssohn's husband considers the drama playing out: ""As far as Jacob was concerned, his wife's work was basic science. Cancer was her instrument, not her enemy. The disease was her reveal, framing and displaying the workings of the cell.""Ms. Goodman says that """"The starting point for me is always the character.""The lab was her reveal.'"
"'06-03-21,'0','Mr. Samit was a witness for the prosecution, which is trying to have Mr. Moussaoui executed for the deaths that occurred on Sept. 11. In his direct testimony more than a week ago, he bolstered the prosecutors' case by saying that had Mr. Moussaoui answered his questions honestly when he arrested him for immigration violations, it would have set off a chain of inquiries that could have foiled the Sept. 11 plot.But under Mr. MacMahon's questions, Mr. Samit provided much new evidence and testimony suggesting strongly that the more significant factors in the failure to learn of the plot from Mr. Moussaoui involved the decisions of senior F.B.I. officials.Mr. Samit's testimony paralleled the complaints of Coleen Rowley, an agent and lawyer in the Minneapolis office who sent a letter on May 21, 2002, to the bureau director, Robert S. Mueller III, bitterly criticizing the performance of F.B.I. headquarters agents in handling the Moussaoui case.But unlike Ms. Rowley, who has since left the bureau, Mr. Samit remains an agent and tried on Monday to adopt a defensive posture on its behalf. Nonetheless, his testimony provided a vivid condemnation of the bureau, as he was obliged to confirm how he had told investigators of his belief that his superiors had tried to sidestep their responsibilities.Mr. Samit said two senior agents had declined to provide help in obtaining a search warrant, either through a special panel of judges that considers applications for foreign intelligence cases or through a normal application to any federal court for a criminal investigation.As a field agent in Minnesota, he said, he required help and approval from headquarters to continue his investigation. He acknowledged that he had asserted that Michael Maltbie, a supervisor in the bureau's Radical Fundamentalist Unit, had told him that applications for the special intelligence court warrants had proved troublesome for the bureau and that seeking one ""was just the kind of thing that would get F.B.I. agents in trouble.""Mr. Samit wrote that Mr. Maltbie had told him that ""he was not about to let that happen to him."" During that period, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had complained about improper applications from the bureau.Mr. Samit also acknowledged that he had asserted to investigators that David Frasca, Mr. Maltbie's superior, had similarly blocked him from seeking a search warrant under the more common route, a criminal investigation. Some of the special court's complaints dealt with the idea that law-enforcement officials were sometimes exploiting the lower standard required for warrants in intelligence investigations and then using the information that they obtained in criminal cases.Mr. Frasca, Mr. Samit explained, believed that once the Moussaoui investigation was opened as an intelligence inquiry, it would arouse suspicion that agents had been trying to abuse the intelligence law to get information for a case they now believed was a criminal one.Mr. Samit's comments, which were made to investigators for the Justice Department's inspector general and in a subsequent memorandum to the F.B.I., had not been made public before. The report by the inspector general on the bureau's Sept. 11 performance was released in June 2005 but had substantial deletions.Mr. Samit said senior bureau officials had even been told he was trying to prevent someone from flying a plane into the World Trade Center.William Carter, an F.B.I. spokesman, said that neither the bureau nor Mr. Maltbie nor Mr. Frasca, who are still employed there, would have any comment.The cross-examination of Mr. Samit was delayed after his initial testimony when the trial was interrupted following disclosures that a government lawyer had improperly coached several aviation security officials who were to testify.Judge Leonie M. Brinkema ruled that because of the coaching, the prosecution would be unable to use those witnesses to make the case that security could have been bolstered, possibly foiling the plot, if Mr. Moussaoui had told Mr. Samit about his knowledge of plans by Al Qaeda to fly planes into buildings.Judge Brinkema's sanctions on the prosecution for Ms. Martin's behavior nearly wrecked the government's case. But on Friday, Judge Brinkema ruled that the government could try to find new untainted aviation security witnesses.'"
"'06-03-21,'0','For the last couple of years, software developers and start-up companies have been using the freely available Ajax building blocks to construct all kinds of programs quickly and inexpensively.Those programs range from sophisticated e-mail and collaboration systems to offerings that tie together Web services, like www.housingmaps.com, which links Google's mapping software with property listings on Craigslist, the online bulletin board, to display houses and neighborhoods.Microsoft executives stressed that its Ajax toolkit will work with browsers and operating systems other than Microsoft's.But the demonstrations at the conference by partners like MySpace, the popular social networking Web site, and the British Broadcasting Corporation's Web site, showed the Ajax technology working on Microsoft Vista.The MySpace feature allows a user to put MySpace profiles of friends on the Windows desktop, while the BBC used an Ajax application on Vista as a gateway to the network's programming, allowing for search, download or the sending of copies of programs to friends.Microsoft has not yet profited from Internet services nearly as much as rivals like Google and Yahoo, which have strong businesses selling ads on their sites. Microsoft competes with them not only on its MSN Web site, but is also developing online software services, Windows Live and Office Live, which will sell ads.In the competition for online advertising, Microsoft is betting that it can gain an edge by wooing developers with superior software tools. ""Neither Google nor Yahoo has a developer framework,"" Mr. Gates said in an interview. ""We think that a lot of advertising will cluster around the software tools that help people.""But software rivals question whether Microsoft's traditional strategy will prevail as more software is delivered as a service over the Internet.In the past, Microsoft was typically the low-cost supplier, undercutting competitors on price and outselling them.Yet the new Internet software is often distributed free, or at very low cost for monthly service fees. Conventional software is improved in cycles that stretch on for years, while Internet software can be continuously debugged and upgraded.""This time, things are very different, and it won't be easy for Microsoft to compete as it has in the past,"" said Scott Dietzen, president and chief technology officer of Zimbra, a start-up that uses Ajax technology to make e-mail systems.But Microsoft said that it would pick up the pace of product development on its Internet-related products.The company showed off the next version of its Web browser, Internet Explorer 7, which will be released later this year. It has features for alerting users if they are about to tap into Web sites known for spyware or phishing. Its new print feature allows users to preview the Web page and make sure they print the entire page, instead of having words on the right-hand side of the page not printed.Internet Explorer 6, the previous version, was released five years ago. ""We're doing a mea culpa saying, hey, we waited too long,"" Mr. Gates said.The Microsoft moves, some analysts say, suggest that the company is moving in step with technology and market trends -- and those could work to its advantage.Microsoft, Richard Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report yesterday, ""seems to be adapting to the new market dynamics in a way that could be complementary to its traditional business. The Web will be an extension of the desktop in a way that becomes more seamless, extending the capabilities of the desktop outward.""'"
"'06-03-21,'0','""The fact is that talk therapy techniques for this age group are evolving rapidly, and we have several techniques that address common sources of depression, such as grief and social isolation,"" Dr. Kennedy said.Dr. Charles Reynolds, the lead author of the new study, said in an interview that the type and amount of psychotherapy that study participants received after they first recovered -- one session a month, focused on managing personal relationships -- might not have been appropriate, given their age.""I think that in many patients this age there may be some cognitive impairment, and treatments involving family members and caregivers, or problem solving techniques, might be more effective,"" Dr. Reynolds said.The evidence supporting talk therapy in older people is modest but encouraging, experts say. In a recent review, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, identified 16 rigorous trials of talk therapies for depression in elderly people.The researchers determined that the treatments worked as well as they did in younger adults. About a third of the people recovered, a third improved noticeably but not entirely and the other third remained depressed. Results from drug trials are comparable.Given that the elderly are likely to be suffering from chronic, emotionally exhausting ailments like heart disease, arthritis and diabetes, these results are reason for optimism, said Patricia Arean, an associate professor at U.C.S.F.""We found improvements not only in people's mood but in how well they function, whether they have more energy, how they're sleeping, whether it's any easier to get the groceries, to do chores,"" said Dr. Arean, a co-author of the study, with R. Scott Mackin. ""These are very important concerns in this age group.""Take the seemingly simple act of driving, which can be more adventurous at 70 than it is at 40 for a parent racing between basketball and soccer practices.Helen Schwartz, 79, a retired businesswoman and singer living in Yonkers, describes her frequent drives to take her husband to the local Veterans Affairs clinic as a study in stress management.Her husband, Benjamin, 85, used to be the primary driver until symptoms of Parkinson's disease set in. He becomes very tense on these trips, Ms. Schwartz said.""He doesn't really say anything but he makes sounds, he gasps, he reacts, because he's not in control, and this just makes me more nervous,"" she said in an interview. ""Me, I've got arthritis, and especially when I'm in pain, I don't like anyone talking to me or distracting me when I'm driving.""Brief, anxious episodes like these, combined with the still-jarring sight of her husband looking so fragile, can sink Ms. Schwartz into periods of gloom, and she has visited Dr. Kennedy regularly for years to keep herself strong, she said.In the time, she said, he has taught her techniques to anticipate when she will be anxious, to prepare and physically calm herself, and to recall that she has coped with far more stressful periods.Ms. Schwartz, who has periodically used antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs, said that the therapy sessions were her most important hedge against depression. ""You can't live on pills alone, because once the drug wears off, where are you?"" she said. ""You need a deeper understanding of what's happening to you and how to cope with it.""Therapists who work with older people make use of a growing number of talk treatments to address specific late-life problems that can bring on or worsen depression.In an approach called problem-solving therapy, people list the specific problems in their lives -- whether with a balky water heater, confusing bank statements or demanding siblings -- and then develop their own solutions, with the help of the therapist.Acting on these plans can itself lighten despair in elderly people.Another kind of therapy helps people understand, express and resolve longstanding feelings of grief over losing a husband or loved one.The most scientifically studied technique, cognitive behavior therapy, teaches people to identify and dispute self-degrading thoughts -- ""I have been an awful parent"" -- that can feed on themselves and cause people to sink into despair.""One thing you find with older people is that they have a lifetime of experience in solving problems, and this experience is much more powerful than they usually know,"" said Dr. Aaron Beck, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.Whether they favor drugs, talk therapy or a combination, therapists agree that simple case management -- helping connect people with community services, get treatment for physical problems and complete chores -- can also help them turn the corner.""I must say my life is good now, better than most my age, I think,"" said Audrey Nicholson, 77, who has struggled with recurrent depression but has been far better while being treated at the University of Pittsburgh.""I just had hip replacement surgery, and I've been fine through all that,"" she said. ""Between the medicine and the therapy, they've come a long way in how they can treat this.""'"
"'06-03-21,'0','Velez first managed the national team in 1987 but left the position and didn't return to it until 2001. A Cuban reporter said that Velez went to Italy to run a Cuban training program there, explaining that he needed an easier position because he was stressed. My Cuban colleague didn't use that word, but that's what it sounded like.If Velez was stressed then, when he was 19 years younger, think of his emotional state when he gets home and has to explain to Fidel's sports lieutenants what happened here. Steinbrenner, of course, wouldn't have waited for his manager to get home. He would have called him in his office after the game and told him not to get on the plane.Anyway, here was Cuba poised to embarrass the United States, Castro's most bitter enemy. Here was a propaganda prize waiting to be snatched along with the 30-pound Tiffany trophy. Here was Castro prepared to deliver yet another two-hour address celebrating the triumph of communism over capitalism. And Velez and his pitchers blew it.Because Cuba played in the final and the United States didn't even reach the semifinals, because Cuba played in the final and major league players from four W.B.C. teams earning $471 million this year didn't, Castro can still extol the virtues of his system, but it won't be the same.Where did Velez go wrong? Let us count the ways.First he started Romero. Never mind that Romero started and won two games earlier in the Classic, allowing one run in eight and a third innings. The guy is 38 years old, the oldest player on the team. He would have been better off at home in Santiago de Cuba, drinking a glass of warm milk.And when it was obvious that Romero was teetering on ancient legs, Velez summoned Odelin, who in one start and two relief appearances had allowed six runs (five earned) in eight innings. Had Steinbrenner owned this team, Odelin would have never dressed for the championship game. Steinbrenner would have told him he injured his arm and ordered him to go directly to the disabled list.Romero lasted only four batters and 23 pitches. He started off well, retiring the first batter, but then Japan loaded the bases on two infield singles sandwiched around a walk. Velez yanked him in what surely must have been the quickest hook of the l Classic.The suddenly stressed-again manager called for Odelin, who lasted 4 batters and 19 pitches. He hit the first batter, forcing in the first run, struck out the next but then walked the third batter he faced, sending home another run.Toshiaki Imae was the fourth batter for Odelin, and he became the last when he singled to center field for two more runs and a 4-0 Japanese lead.Norberto Gonzalez became the third Cuban pitcher in what turned out to be a 30-minute first inning, and he was brilliant compared with his two compatriots. In their 42 pitches, Romero and Odelin gave up four runs, three hits and two walks and hit a batter while getting two outs. In his first 42 pitches, Gonzalez allowed no runs, one hit and one walk while getting eight outs.The Cubans never caught up. They tried valiantly, staging a comeback that should have made Fidel proud. Despite hitting into double plays at critical moments in the sixth and seventh innings, Cuba almost caught up. Frederich Cepeda smacked a two-run home run in the eighth, closing the gap to 6-5.In assessing the Cuban players and saying he thought four of them could play in the major leagues in this country, Peter Bjarkman, who as an author of three books is an expert on Cuban baseball, said Cepeda, one of the four, ""is probably my favorite player on this team.""Cepeda, a switch-hitter, is ""a big-money player,"" and a very patient hitter, Bjarkman said, adding, ""He's been a big player in tournaments for them.""Cepeda also doubled home a run in the sixth, but his big hits weren't enough to overcome the pitches of Romero and Odelin. Nor those of the three relievers who gave up the final four runs in the ninth.'"

Citing reports from the scene, Dr. Friedman said Dr. Root was riding in a canoe in the Tuli Nature Reserve, on the eastern border with Zimbabwe, when he was attacked by the crocodile. His wife, Rita, was in another canoe behind and witnessed the attack, Dr. Friedman said.Dr. Root was on a two-month assignment to teach and provide medical care for patients, most of them infected with HIV, at the Princess Marina Hospital in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana. He was there at the invitation of Penn and the Botswana Department of Health.Dr. Root was most recently a professor and vice chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of Washington and chief of medical service at the medical school; he had held emeritus status since December 2002.He previously was the chairman of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.

"'06-03-21,'0','The stakes are enormous. United States poultry producers like Tyson, Pilgrim's Pride and Gold Kist sell 26 billion pounds of chicken each year. Restaurant chains -- chief among them McDonald's, KFC and Wendy's -- sell 45 percent of that.Sales of chicken are growing. Over the last 10 years, consumption of chicken has increased by 22 percent, while beef consumption has remained flat, according to the Department of Agriculture.If Europe and Asia are any indication, chicken sales could take quite a hit. In February, after avian flu was discovered in wild swans, poultry consumption declined 70 percent in Italy. In France, sales are down 30 percent since avian flu hit a turkey farm last month. In some areas of India, sales are down 40 percent since last month's discovery of avian flu in chickens.These declines came even though none of the 175 human cases of avian flu confirmed by the World Health Organization since 2003 resulted from eating poultry.Dick Thompson, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said most of the cases of humans contracting avian flu have been from people coming into direct contact with infected poultry, though one case in Vietnam appears to have been a result of someone drinking infected duck blood.Public health officials consider it unlikely that people will catch the virus from eating chicken. Chicken producers say that any sick birds would immediately be destroyed and would not enter the market. While the deadly strain of avian flu, called H5N1, now hitting Europe and Asia can reside in poultry meat, the virus is killed by the temperatures normally used to cook poultry.Nonetheless, a Harvard School of Public Health nationwide telephone survey of 1,043 adults in January found that 46 percent of respondents who eat chicken said they would stop eating it if avian flu hit the United States poultry industry.In October, Yum Brands, which owns KFC, told investors that, based on its experiences with avian flu in China, it estimated that in the worst situation, chicken sales would drop 10 percent to 20 percent if there were widespread concerns about avian flu.Chicken processors and restaurant chains are already working feverishly to minimize any sales declines. Companies are working on communications strategies that can be set into motion at a moment's notice. These plans deal with avian flu in birds and not the feared hypothetical mutation of the virus into a human-to-human form. Future mutations could make avian flu contagious among humans, and possibly generate a pandemic.Tyson, Pilgrim's Pride, KFC, Chick-fil-A and Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits all say they have formed internal avian flu task forces that meet regularly and include top executives and leaders from different departments. These executives have been meeting with government health officials, discussing what information should go on the companies' Web sites and when, and devising sales loss projections.Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits, the country's No. 3 chicken chain behind KFC and Chick-fil-A, said its task force met weekly, often in conjunction with the Ledlie Group, an Atlanta-based crisis management agency. KFC said that it had created TV and print ads aimed at convincing people that eating fully cooked chicken was safe. The ad campaign, which was produced by Creative Alliance, an agency in Louisville, Ky., where Yum Brands is based, is ready to go if a crisis strikes.""It's on the shelf collecting dust,"" said Jonathan Blum, a Yum spokesman.Tyson, the country's largest chicken producer, is working on an ad campaign that will run if chicken sales decline, or if consumers start to get nervous.McDonald's, the country's largest restaurant buyer of chicken, said it had been working on avian flu contingency plans, but declined to discuss details.At many chain restaurants, including McDonald's, chicken has helped bolster sales more than any other menu item. In presentations to analysts and investors, McDonald's has credited its new line of higher-priced premium chicken sandwiches and its chicken-topped premium salads with increasing sales at outlets in the United States that have been open for more than a year.Arby's, which is known for its roast beef sandwiches but gets 15 percent of its sales from chicken products, said it was spending more money than it had for any other new product to promote its new line of so-called chicken naturals. Chicken naturals are all chicken, with no added water or chemicals.Some analysts think avian flu in birds, like mad cow disease in beef, may turn out to be a nonissue for consumers. Since mad cow was first discovered in the United States in late 2003, beef consumption has remained constant, according to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.""In the U.S. I think we generally have a greater trust in the government to ensure food safety than they do in Europe and Asia,"" said John Glass, an analyst at CIBC World Markets. ""I'd be surprised if U.S. consumers really react to this.""But some in the chicken industry worry that avian flu will be much more frightening to consumers than mad cow. ""I get asked about it all the time,"" said Steve Gold, vice president for marketing at Murray's Chicken, a producer of humanely raised chicken. ""I think people have this idea that it's going to be like Alfred Hitchcock with all these birds flying into their community and everyone getting sick.""Mr. Gold notes that unlike mad cow, avian flu is highly contagious among birds and has the potential to travel long distances in unpredictable patterns.He and others in the chicken industry are busy honing a message that the nation's chicken populations are well protected from wild, migratory birds that may be the initial carriers of the disease.A Web site set up by the National Chicken Council, the National Turkey Federation and the Egg Safety Center (www.avianinfluenzainfo.com) promotes the industry's modern system of enclosed, confined chicken growing as an effective line of defense against the spread of avian flu.The 20,000 to 24,000 birds that reside in a single growing house on the average industrial chicken farm lack access to the outdoors, or even to sunlight -- something that has long drawn criticism from animal welfare activists and has helped fuel the growth in free-range and humanely produced chicken. The virtue of isolating chickens, said Richard Lobb, a spokesman for the National Chicken Council, is that no chicken is likely to come into contact with wild birds that may be infected.""Things here are not like they are in Asia where chickens are running around outdoors in people's backyards,"" Mr. Lobb said. ""It's much more controlled.""He added that while thousands of free-roaming and backyard chickens were infected in Thailand in 2004, none of the country's large-scale, commercial chicken flocks in enclosed facilities were hit.Mr. Lobb said chickens sold as free-range or organic, meaning they are allowed access to the outdoors, may be more susceptible to avian flu transmission, but this group represents less than 1 percent of the chicken production.The Egg Safety Center said that consumers should not worry about eggs being infected with the avian flu virus because sick hens either stop laying eggs or lay poor-quality eggs that would not be acceptable for sale.Some government officials said that if avian flu arrived on United States shores, it would probably be from migratory birds.Susan Haseltine, assistant director for biology at the United States Geological Survey and an expert on bird migration, said government scientists had their eyes on the bird pathways from Asia to Alaska. ""One species with high potential is the pintail,"" Ms. Haseltine said. ""It migrates from Alaska to the southern U.S., to the Gulf Coast and Southern California. They have the ability to fly long distances.""The Department of Agriculture said that since 2000, 12,000 tests had been done on birds in western Alaska and none had been found with the deadly version of avian flu. Ms. Haseltine said there was little bird passage across the Atlantic from Europe.Other experts say that avian flu is more likely to reach the United States through the illicit trade of poultry from infected countries. Importing birds or poultry meat from countries that have had outbreaks of avian flu is banned, but Rob Fergus, science coordinator for the National Audubon Society, said there were probably instances of smuggled products. ""There are a lot of holes in biosecurity in our ports. I'm much more concerned about poultry shipments than wild birds,"" he said.There is, of course, still the small chance that North America may be somehow spared from avian flu. But companies like Chick-fil-A are not counting on that. ""The question is not if, but when,"" said Don Perry, a spokesman for Chick-fil-A. ""You can't put big nets in the sky to prevent birds from flying here.""'"
"'06-03-21,'0','The Iraq Insurance Company, a state-owned group, has sold about 200 individual terrorism policies in the last year, and is now negotiating with several government ministries and private companies for group policies that would cover thousands of employees.The idea of insuring ordinary people in what may be the most violent place on earth came from Abbas Shaheed al-Taiee, an executive at the Iraq Insurance Company.""It is a kind of gift to the Iraqi people,"" said Mr. Shaheed, 53, a big, heavyset man with terribly serious eyes and a reputation as a master salesman. ""We have expanded the principles of life insurance to cover everything that happens in Iraq.""Amazingly, the company has yet to pay out on a single claim.""We have sold policies in Dawra, Ramadi, Falluja,"" Mr. Shaheed said, naming some of the most dangerous places in Iraq. ""The contract is a good luck charm.""Mr. Shaheed (whose name means martyr in Arabic) emanates a gravitas that must be an asset in his line of work. He manages a sales staff of about 50 across Iraq, but also sells the policies himself, traveling from one workplace to another, like a kind of bureaucratic Grim Reaper.He says the terrorism policy makes no distinctions between who fires the shots or detonates the bombs. He would be perfectly willing to insure an insurgent, though he has not done so to his knowledge, he said.""It is a market here; there are no differences,"" he said, in his grim baritone. ""We evaluate people's pockets.""In the United States and Europe, insurance companies offer customized policies to organizations sending employees to dangerous places, including Iraq (some news organizations, for example, insure their reporters this way). But those policies are highly tailored to each company's activities and risks, and they are generally expensive.The idea of a standardized, terrorism life insurance policy appears to be unprecedented, said Robert Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute in New York.Some other insurance experts agreed that the policy was a novel one, but said they would hardly call it a good deal. ""In an American context, it's very overpriced,"" said Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, an association of consumer rights groups. ""In America, you could probably get $100,000 worth of life insurance coverage for maybe $125 to $150,"" especially a healthy 23-year-old, he said. ""And that would cover you no matter how you died.""Selling insurance in Iraq has never been easy. The first insurance companies here were established in the 1950's, when they competed with Western companies. But the idea never gained wide acceptance, in part because some Islamic authorities disapprove of insurance, considering it akin to gambling.Also, many Iraqis preferred to rely on their tribes or families in case of accidents or deaths. The state also played a powerful paternal role: during the Iran-Iraq war, for instance, the government generously compensated the families of soldiers who died, sometimes with a car or property as well as money.After the Persian Gulf war in 1991 the market shrank further, because foreign reinsurance companies pulled out, forcing Iraqi companies to depend only on their own assets, said Aziz Hassan, a former deputy finance minister.Strangely, Iraqi insurance companies have done relatively well since the fall of Saddam Hussein, despite a stagnant economy and the uncertainty over Iraq's future. Six private insurance companies were founded in 2004, and now compete with the two state-owned companies.The Iraq Insurance Company has renovated its offices -- they were looted and burned after the fall of Baghdad in April 2003 -- and the company now employs between 250 and 300 people. They have sold at least 2,700 life insurance policies since the fall of the Hussein government.In 2005, the company's net income was about $2.5 million at current exchange rates. ""We broke records,"" said Bassim Mahdi Saleh al-Sheikhli, the company's managing director. ""Business has never before been so good.""The company attributes much of its success to salesmen like Mr. Shaheed, who now operate more freely -- albeit more dangerously -- than they did in the past.""From my point of view, sales is an art,"" said Mr. Shaheed, who has worked at the Iraq Insurance Company for 18 years. ""For instance, talking to a father with children is different from talking to a man still single. You have to bring out his passion to protect his family.""Because the salesmen carry money and travel, their own jobs are unusually dangerous. They do not carry guns. Many have bought terrorism insurance themselves, including Mr. Shaheed.One rule applies to all prospective clients. ""When we talk about death and risks, we refer to ourselves: 'I might die tomorrow,' "" Mr. Shaheed said. ""When we talk about the payment, we say, 'The company pays you.' ""Once a client has agreed to buy a policy, a price is negotiated. It ranges from 60,000 dinars for the safer professions -- teachers, businessmen and the like -- to 125,000 for policemen and translators for Western companies. The payout is the same regardless.On a recent afternoon, Mr. Shaheed sat at a desk in his second-floor office, chatting quietly with a potential client. Nearby on the couch sat Basmel Nafaa, a 48-year-old businessman with a bald head and an impish grin. Mr. Nafaa had already bought an ordinary life insurance policy, and was considering buying terrorism coverage too.""He's the best we have here in Iraq,"" Mr. Nafaa said of Mr. Shaheed. ""He's a good hunter.""Mr. Nafaa recounted how Mr. Shaheed had approached him at the wholesale market where he often works, as if by chance. The salesman chatted amiably about mutual friends, and then began telling a story about a man who had died without leaving anything for his wife and children. Before long, Mr. Nafaa was sold.""He hardly even needs to remind you of the dangers you face,"" Mr. Nafaa said. ""We see it everywhere.""Mr. Nafaa began offering examples. A few months earlier, his 12-year-old son Joseph was standing outside the family home waiting for a school bus that never came. The boy persuaded his mother to give him money for a taxi. Minutes later, he said, a suicide bomber in a car exploded right next to the bus stop, which is across from the home of a high-level government official. Six people were killed.Mr. Nafaa showed photographs of his house, which was badly damaged. ""I had no insurance at that time,"" he said.Then Mr. Nafaa gestured across the room at his cousin, Baseem Makadsi -- the other prospective client -- who still has a crease on the back of his skull from where a bullet crashed through the window of his car and grazed him while he was driving to the market with his son.""If he had not leaned over to speak to his son, he would be dead,"" Mr. Nafaa said. ""He lost a lot of blood.""Mr. Makadsi was not yet sold on terrorism insurance. He was thinking of taking his family out of Iraq.But Mr. Nafaa persuaded himself. ""I will buy it,"" he said. ""There is a big probability to be killed by insurgents here. Higher than anywhere else in the world.""'"

"'06-03-21,'0','Many major league players have been helping to grow the game this month by sacrificing time from their preseason preparation, launching what has been an appealing international tournament, though one with inherent scheduling flaws. While far from the only player to skip the Classic, Matsui might have been the most surprising, given his stature in Japan. Godzilla, as Matsui is known there, towers above Ichiro Suzuki, another homegrown star who sought fame and fortune in the United States and found it.Some fans and critics in Japan and New York were rankled by Matsui's decision, though in the latter case probably more because he appeared to be buckling to Scrooge Steinbrenner's wishes that the Yankees not participate. When asked yesterday if not playing was a concession to the Boss, reciprocation for the four-year, $52 million contract Matsui was given after the expiration of his original three-year deal, he said: ""The contract had nothing to do with my decision. I've said all along it was the strong feeling of wanting to win a championship and knowing this time of season is very important in preparing yourself.""Buy his logic or not, the last thing Matsui deserves is to have those contrived charges of athletic treason thrown under his chin, given all he has done for the reputation of Japanese baseball.""He plays for Japan every day,"" said Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager. ""Three hundred and sixty-five days a year, this is one of the guys who goes above and beyond.""Twelve months of satisfying sportswriters is too much to ask, even of Matsui, but let there be no doubt about his accountability to those who have shadowed him from his first day in pinstripes. Even with last night's conclusion of the Classic in San Diego, there were still more than a dozen Japanese reporters breathlessly waiting for Matsui (who did not travel with the Yankees to Lakeland for yesterday's game with the Tigers) to finish his workout and beguile them on a day as routinely uneventful as Florida sunshine.Whether he doubles in the winning run or strikes out looking with the bases loaded, Matsui faces the music, answers the questions. We could all name his teammates -- and other superstars from a variety of sports and nations -- who, under these conditions, would have by now dug secret tunnels under Legends Field, all the way to their condominium developments.""We all knew we were getting the Japanese Michael Jordan, and everyone predicted it would be a huge distraction because there would be so many extra people here,"" Cashman said. ""But the reality has been like you almost don't feel them here because Hideki goes out of his way so much to make sure they're taken care of.""In the process, while competing on baseball's most pressurized stage, Matsui has, with Ichiro, merely given lie to the belief that the everyday Japanese player can't compete in the major leagues. He has hit with more than adequate power. In three seasons with the Yankees, he has not missed a game. He has become part of the bedrock of their lineup, and may be their most reliable 100-plus run-producer, given Jason Giambi's trials and tribulations, Alex Rodriguez's existential angst and now Gary Sheffield's contractual distractions.Matsui deserves the benefit of the doubt -- and even praise -- for making a priority of winning the World Series, which, in case people hadn't noticed, is beginning to look as diverse as the Stanley Cup finals. Whoever said that a sports event has to be about nationalism to be global?He has watched some, not all, of the Classic, enough to identify one of the problems that made for the Americans' undoing. ""Japan and other countries, they practice more of the fundamentals,"" Matsui said. ""No doubt about that.""And no one, he added, should question his fidelity to his country and the elevated appreciation of Asian baseball over all. ""I have no regrets in making the decision that I made, but as a Japanese citizen I'm very happy,"" he said. ""I'm still a fan.""A fan figuring that he would ""catch up"" on the game last night, given that it wouldn't end until early morning, with Japan winning.Even Godzilla can only eat -- and tolerate reporters -- for so long.'"
"'06-03-21,'0','JERUSALEM, March 20 - Israel reopened the main freight crossing to the Gaza Strip on Monday to allow delivery of flour and sugar to the Palestinians. But it abruptly closed the crossing after just a half-hour, citing security threats.Israel has kept the Karni Crossing shut for most of the past two months, saying it has intelligence that Palestinians are planning to attack the goods terminal, which has often been a target.But with Gaza's food stocks running low, the United States ambassador to Israel, Richard H. Jones, arranged for talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians on Sunday night, and Israel agreed to allow food supplies into Gaza on Monday.""The shortage of basic foodstuffs was weighed against the terror threat, and the logical decision to open it for a limited amount of time was made with the hope the Palestinians will uphold their commitments,"" Amos Gilad, a Defense Ministry official, told Israel Radio.But shortly after he spoke, Karni was again closed. The military said there were security alerts, but did not provide details.Salim Abu Safiya, who handles border crossing issues for the Palestinians in Gaza, told Reuters, ""The Israelis need to stop using this silly method and these silly alerts.""'"
"'06-03-21,'0','""The World Series is still, whether we have a different name for it, the World Series,"" Selig said during the sixth inning of last night's game. ""However, having said that, as the World Classic gets bigger as the internationalization of the sport develops even more, that's an interesting dilemma, but it's a dilemma I'll be glad to face.""Many of us have spent our childhoods and adult lives indulging the fantasy of the World Series. We played along because the United States had the world's greatest ballplayers and the best baseball teams. Major League Baseball was the sun and the moon.Now it's merely the sun.On Sunday night, I attended a screening of the documentary ""La República de Béisbol: Los Gigantes Dominicanos"" (translated as ""The Republic of Baseball: The Dominican Giants of the American Game""). It traces the hard road that the first wave of Dominican players had in reaching the major leagues. Several of the pioneering Dominican players were in the audience.After the film, when someone asked what the players thought about the World Baseball Classic, the former major leaguer Jesus Alou said: ""I believe that finally, baseball made a breakthrough. All through my career -- and I played in two World Series -- I kept telling myself, This is not the World Series.""I asked Alou what he thought happened to the United States and whether there was a lesson to be learned. ""There's no lesson,"" he said. ""The players got caught off guard. They were not prepared for the greatness of the event. Next time, they will be.""The World Baseball Classic might have had another unanticipated effect. The public perception of certain major league players who chose not to represent their countries was damaged.During a news conference Sunday, I asked Sadaharu Oh, the legendary Japanese player who now manages Japan's team, whether Hideki Matsui's decision to stay with the Yankees for spring training would affect his popularity in Japan.""For the Japanese fans,"" Oh said through an interpreter, ""they might have that kind of opinion, that Matsui should have been in this tournament playing for the Japanese team.""Oh added that a strong performance by Matsui this season could offset any bad feelings fans might have. ""Matsui hasn't played a real game yet this year, so I'm sure he will have a lot of opportunities to win back his popularity back in Japan,"" he said.Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners, on the other hand, has gained by playing. He raised his stature even more during the title game, when he drove in the first of Japan's four runs in the ninth inning.""There was a wrong impression of Ichiro that he was sort of selfish,"" Oh said. ""But as the people can see, he really committed himself to this team and he put so much time into this. Now he's one of the leaders of the team as well. I'm sure his popularity went up once again in Japan.""Later Sunday, I asked Alou and the former major league catcher Ozzie Virgil about Dominican players like Alex Rodriguez and Pedro Martínez, who chose not to play under the Dominican flag. (Rodriguez played for the United States, where he was born; his parents are Dominican.)""It's sad that some of our player making all the money have so many complaints,"" Virgil said, adding: ""I felt their presence in the game -- without even playing. They could have given the Dominican players a boost.""Alou said he could detect a slight change in attitude among Dominicans. ""You can compare these guys to soldiers of their countries,"" he said. ""When they go out there to battle, they want their best soldiers to go. At least for the Dominican Republic, we didn't have that.""He added, ""They're going to regret that for the rest of their lives.""The inaugural World Baseball Classic is in the books. There will be fine-tuning: when to play, how to bring in umpires from around the world.But the major adjustment has to come from Major League Baseball. There must be a change in how we refer to the October ritual when the best teams from the American League and the National League play a best-of-seven series.Call it the Fall Classic, call it the M.L.B. Championship.Just don't call it the World Series anymore.'"

"'06-03-22,'1','Paul Offit, a virologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new reports made a lot of sense in explaining why the H5N1 virus, though it can infect people, does not easily spread from one person to another, making its outbreaks very limited.Virologists agree that another flu pandemic will happen sooner or later as one of the 16 types of flu virus in the animal world, probably one that infects birds, will manage to switch hosts and grow and spread in humans. But they differ as to whether H5 is the likeliest candidate to make this switch. Previous known pandemics have been caused by H1 type viruses (the 1918 pandemic), H2 (the 1957 Asian) or H3 (the Hong Kong flu of 1968).The H5 strain of avian flu has been infecting people since the late 1950's but has so far failed to develop a form that is easily transmissible from one person to another. Some virologists believe it could easily do so because it may only need better transmissibility to set off a pandemic. That could be obtained simply by switching its preference from the cell receptor found in the lower lung, known as alpha 2-3, to the receptor found on cells in the upper airways, known as alpha 2-6.A team of scientists at the Scripps Research Institute reported in Science last week that only a couple of mutations might be needed to enable the H5 virus to make this switch to the alpha 2-6 receptor. This is about the same number of mutations as made by the H1, H2 and H3 viruses when they learned to infect people. Since viruses mutate quickly, a two-mutation step is not so big a hurdle.Because the H5 virus has killed about half of the 187 people it has so far infected, ""a lot of its genes are already optimized for virulence,"" said James C. Paulson, a member of the Scripps team. For H5 to become pandemic, ""The key gene that needs to be mutated is the HA gene,"" he said, referring to the hemagglutinin gene, which makes the probe used by the virus to latch on to a cell's receptor sites.But though H5 might seem only a couple of easy steps away from transmissibility among people, many virologists believe mutations in several other genes would be necessary as well. Viruses find it very hard to switch hosts, and though they may quite often cause outbreaks in just a few individuals, ""viruses that produce a self-sustaining chain of transmission in the new host appear rare,"" Dr. Kawaoka wrote recently in the Annual Review of Microbiology,The H5 virus has been present in the human population since the late 1950's, but has never acquired the full set of mutations needed to set off a pandemic. The epidemiological evidence ""should make us feel safe that there's a substantial barrier,"" Dr. Offit said.Dr. Offit said it was a good thing to worry about the next pandemic, given that about three can be expected every century. ""What's not good is to try to sell the public on their fear of pandemic flu being this particular bird flu, since if it's not, crying wolf will lose you credibility,"" he said.Peter Palese, a virologist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, said he did not believe the H5 virus could infect people, except when they were exposed to very large doses, such as by sleeping with chickens in the same room. ""I feel strongly that H5 has been around in humans for a long time and never caused a pandemic, suggesting that this is not the virus which is likely to be the next pandemic.""But like Dr. Offit, Dr. Palese said he fully supported plans to get better prepared for the next flu pandemic. ""People have to understand we are not really prepared should it come,"" he said.'"
"'06-03-22,'1','""Everyone who has a strong family history and is negative should be considering how negative that result really was,"" said Dr. Judy E. Garber, director of the cancer risk and prevention program at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.The new study, being published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, is likely to increase the pressure on Myriad Genetics, which offers the test.The company, based in Salt Lake City, has long been the focus of controversy because its patents give it a monopoly on the test, for which it charges as much as $3,000. Some geneticists say the monopoly has slowed development of better testing.""A fuller testing process would include more than one technology, and competition would enable that to develop,"" Mary-Claire King, a professor of medicine and genome sciences at the University of Washington and senior author of the paper, said in an interview.Professor King said a technique that could detect many of the missed mutations was already available in Europe but not in the United States, except in research projects.Dr. Gregory C. Critchfield, president of the genetic testing division of Myriad Genetics, denied that the company's monopoly had impeded progress. The company hoped to have a more thorough test available by the end of the year, Dr. Critchfield said.Five percent to 10 percent of breast cancers in white women in the United States stem from inherited mutations in the BRCA genes. Tens of thousands of women a year get the test, Myriad Genetics said.Women with a mutation have a much higher risk of getting breast or ovarian cancer than the general population. Such women usually undergo more frequent screening to try to catch the cancer early, when it is more treatable. Some women opt to have their ovaries or breasts removed to prevent the disease.Experts have long known that Myriad Genetics's test misses certain types of mutations it is not designed to detect. But the new study is believed to be the most extensive effort to quantify how often that occurs.""We've known parts of the story but she's pulled it together very well,"" Dr. Lynn Hartmann, a professor of oncology at the Mayo Clinic, said of Dr. King.Dr. King and her co-authors studied 300 women who had negative test results and who came from families with four or more cases of breast or ovarian cancer. The authors used various testing techniques beyond the one used by Myriad Genetics and found mutations in 35 of the women. None of the 30 Jewish women in Dr. King's study were found to have mutations undetected by Myriad Genetics.Dr. Critchfield of Myriad Genetics said only 6 percent of the women who got the test came from such high-risk families. If the test is wrong for 12 percent of them, he said, then the rate of false negatives for all women tested is less than 1 percent.The Myriad Genetics test looks for mistakes in the sequence of genetic letters in parts of the gene that contain the recipe for proteins. But it can miss errors in other parts of the gene, or deletions and duplications of chunks of DNA.'"
"'06-03-22,'1','Mr. Rolince said Mr. Samit's ""suppositions, hunches and suspicions were one thing, and what we knew"" was a different matter.Despite his efforts to recover, Mr. Rolince became the second witness for the prosecution in two consecutive days at the sentencing trial for Mr. Moussaoui to give testimony that appeared to provide clear benefits to the defense.Mr. Samit, who was cross-examined by Mr. MacMahon on Monday, testified, albeit reluctantly, that he had told investigators after the attacks that he believed that his superiors at the bureau in Washington were guilty of ""criminal negligence"" and had ignored his increasingly dire requests to obtain a search warrant in order to protect their careers.He said that they had taken a gamble that Mr. Moussaoui was not going to have any valuable information and that they had lost a wager that proved to be a national tragedy.The government has argued that Mr. Moussaoui, the only person to go to trial in the United States in connection with the deaths of Sept. 11, should be executed because when he was arrested three weeks earlier on immigration charges, he lied to investigators about his knowledge of plans by Al Qaeda to fly planes into buildings.Because Mr. Moussaoui has already pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks, the sole question before the jury is whether he should be executed or spend the rest of his life in prison.Mr. Samit and Mr. Rolince were called as witnesses by the government to press the argument that had Mr. Moussaoui told Mr. Samit and other investigators what he knew, the F.B.I. could have taken steps to foil the plot. Mr. Rolince testified as to how the government disrupted a plan to blow up Los Angeles International Airport when another man, Ahmed Ressam, was arrested at the Canadian border in 1999 and agreed to cooperate with the authorities.But he seemed to unwittingly reinforce the defense's counterargument that Mr. Moussaoui's silence was not as important as the inability of law enforcement authorities to react to leads like those given by Mr. Samit.Mr. Rolince also testified that he had a ""hallway"" conversation, lasting about 20 seconds, with one of the supervisors at headquarters whom Mr. Samit has identified as blocking his efforts. He said the supervisor, David Frasca, briefed him on an alternate plan to have Mr. Moussaoui's belongings searched by extraditing him to France and having French authorities do the search.That plan, Mr. Samit has testified, was to go into effect on Sept. 11, 2001.'"
"'06-03-22,'1','Escalating rents, especially in prime Manhattan neighborhoods, are helping to drive out traditional supermarkets. On Third Avenue and Broadway, banks -- Commerce Bank, Washington Mutual and Wachovia, among others -- are willing to pay $250 a square foot a year or more for storefronts that once commanded a fraction of that rent.""This last deluge of bank expansions has escalated value of retail space, almost everywhere, way past what a normal retailer can pay,"" said C. Bradley Mendelson, an executive director at Cushman & Wakefield.Supermarkets are a low-margin business, in part because a large proportion of their stock consists of perishable goods. A decade or so ago, a supermarket would pay an amount equivalent to 2 percent of its sales in rent in affluent neighborhoods, Mr. Catsimatidis said. Now, it has to pay as much as 8 percent of sales, he said. To hold onto a store on University Place and Eighth Street, Mr. Catsimatidis said, he had to agree to twice the previous rent.One small supermarket chain, Morton Williams Associated Markets, would like to expand -- the company has 10 New York stores, 8 of them in Manhattan -- but has been unable to find space it can afford, said Morton Sloan, one of the owners.Food City Markets once had six stores in Manhattan and is now down to one, at Columbus Avenue and 94th Street. ""When a supermarket decides to pay big rents, they've got to get big prices in the store,"" said Jeffrey L. Berger, the chief executive of Food City, which has two stores outside Manhattan. ""The customers don't understand. You don't make any friends."" High rents, however, are not the sole reason traditional supermarkets are disappearing.Supermarkets are having a tough time everywhere. In the suburbs, they are being squeezed by competition from discount retailers like Wal-Mart. In New York, particularly Manhattan, much of the pressure is coming from the opposite direction -- upscale markets like Whole Foods Market and Citarella that cater to less price-conscious customers and carry a large selection of prepared foods, which can be marked up higher, making them more profitable for store owners.""You're dealing with a city with an incredibly large affluent population that can afford to shop on a regular basis at specialty shops,"" said Benjamin Fox, an executive vice president at the real estate firm Newmark Knight Frank.In contrast to the older chains, most of these specialty shops employ nonunion labor. Pat Purcell, the director of organization for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1500, which has 23,000 New York area members, said that as specialty stores had come to play a more important role, the proportion of unionized supermarket employees had declined to about 50 percent, from 70 percent a decade ago.Many Manhattan customers have been all too willing to desert their local supermarket, with its narrow aisles cluttered with cartons, dirty floors and indifferent service, retail specialists say.""The supermarkets have been inferior for decades,"" said Burt P. Flickinger III, the managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting group.Often, co-op boards and developers would prefer to have a gourmet store as a tenant, or, better still, a retailer outside the food industry. ""The buildings don't want the vermin; they'd rather have a drugstore,"" said Jeff Winick, the chief executive of the Winick Realty Group, a brokerage company that has represented Duane Reade in about 250 lease transactions in the last 10 years.FreshDirect, the online grocery service, has also made a big impact in the New York area since it opened its Long Island City plant in 2002. The company has about 150,000 customers and takes in about $200 million a year -- as much as 80 percent of it coming from Manhattan, a spokeswoman said.""FreshDirect is putting a dent into everybody -- a big dent,"" Mr. Sarf said. He estimated that Manhattan grocery shoppers spend $2.1 billion a year.Some supermarket chains, like Mr. Sloan's, are trying to compete with the gourmet stores by offering more takeout food. A.& P. recently announced plans to upgrade its 16 Food Emporium stores in Manhattan.A.& P. officials did not respond to requests for an interview. But at a March 1 investors' meeting sponsored by CIBC, Christian W. E. Haub, the executive chairman of the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, said the new Food Emporium concept was designed ""to really attract the kind of consumer who does not care about price, where it's all about quality and service.""One particularly challenging location for Food Emporium and other conventional supermarkets is Union Square, where the competition includes the city's premier Greenmarket, a Whole Foods store, a Garden of Eden market and the city's first Trader Joe's. Even before the arrival of Whole Foods, the D'Agostino market that occupies 6,000 square feet in a four-story commercial building at 64 University Place, three blocks from Union Square, was not successful, according to the landlord, Bernard Posner.Mr. Posner, an owner of Bernard-Charles Realty, said the supermarket's rent was $84.70 a square foot plus a percentage of earnings over $15 million. ""They never reached that amount,"" he said.Nicholas D'Agostino III, the chief executive of the third-generation family business, declined to comment.Now that D'Agostino is leaving, Mr. Posner said he had raised the asking rent to $135 a square foot. He said he hoped the next tenant would be another supermarket or an upscale restaurant.""We may end up with a chain drugstore,"" he said, ""but we'll try to avoid it if we can.""'"
"'06-03-22,'1','Prices at the wholesale level dropped unexpectedly in February, the Labor Department reported yesterday, but excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the cost of goods increased, highlighting the potential for higher inflation later in the year.Retreating food and energy prices drove down the Producer Price Index by 1.4 percent, the biggest monthly drop in almost three years, after increases of 0.3 percent in January and 0.6 percent in December. Energy prices fell 4.7 percent and food prices were down 2.7 percent.But excluding food and energy, the core index was up 0.3 percent, as the price of drugs, magazines, machinery and jewelry jumped. The increase comes on top of a 0.4 percent rise in January and a 0.1 percent increase in December.Compared with February 2005, the index was up 3.7 percent last month and the core rate was up 1.7 percent.Unlike the Consumer Price Index, which is more widely reported, producer prices do not include taxes, subsidies or distribution costs. Economists view increases in wholesale prices as early indicators of broader inflation.'"
"'06-03-22,'1','In his speech Tuesday, at a forum sponsored by George Washington University and the American Chemistry Council, a trade group, he said the regulations should be most stringent for plants that, because of the amount and danger of their chemical stockpiles or their proximity to urban areas, pose the greatest risks.But he said the nation should have uniform standards, strongly implying that states should not be allowed to adopt their own rules, as New Jersey did late last year, particularly if those rules were more stringent.He also said private-sector, ""third party"" inspectors could check on compliance, similar to the way accountants certify corporate financial compliance for the government.And while industrial plants that use dangerous chemicals should voluntarily consider switching to less dangerous alternatives, such moves should not be mandated, Mr. Chertoff said, in a nod to the burden on industry that those changes could entail.""We are committed in this department in moving forward on sensible legislation,"" Mr. Chertoff said.Senator Collins said that she welcomed the secretary's support and that she too was eager to pass legislation.""I am very pleased that this administration has recognized the importance of enacting chemical security legislation this year,"" she said in a statement.Tim Scott, chief security officer at Dow Chemical, speaking as one member of an industry panel after the event, said, ""What we're doing at Dow falls very much in line with what the secretary was talking about.""But Andy Igrejas, a program director at the National Environmental Trust, which is frequently critical of the administration's environmental policies, said of the speech: ""It was lame. It reflects pandering to the industry. And it means this could end up being more of a paperwork exercise instead of something that really protects people.""Dan Katz, chief counsel to Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, joined the criticism.""That is the Enron mentality: trust industry and put the public at risk,"" Mr. Katz said. ""But unlike Enron, the risk here is not that people will lose some of their stock savings. It is that we could have a catastrophic terrorist event.""Rick Hind of the Greenpeace Toxics Campaign said there were sewage treatment plants in 45 urban areas, as well as power plants and refineries in a number of states, that used extremely dangerous chemicals like chlorine gas and hydrofluoric acid and that could replace those chemicals with alternatives widely used elsewhere and without excessive cost.""With guards, fences, cameras, lights and gates, we are still gambling with people's lives,"" Mr. Hind said.Mr. Chertoff said he expected vigorous debate on any legislation. But the fact that this is an election year should not prevent Congress from acting, he said.""The terrorists aren't planning to take this year off,"" Mr. Chertoff said. ""I refuse to simply abdicate the field this year and say, 'Well, we're going to have to wait until after the election to get serious again.' ""'"

"'06-03-22,'1','A jury of four officers and three enlisted soldiers rejected Sergeant Smith's defense that he was simply following orders and using a barking dog to keep prisoners in line. The prosecution asserted that Sergeant Smith treated inmates at Abu Ghraib inhumanely in late 2003 and early 2004, a period during which photographs depicted prisoners naked and stacked in human pyramids, or leashed and crawling like dogs, with soldiers posing alongside them. One of the most notorious images was of Sergeant Smith holding his growling dog straining on its leash just inches from the face of a cowering orange-clad prisoner.The jury also found him guilty of indecent acts for ordering his dog, Marco, to lick peanut butter off the genitals of an American male soldier and the breasts of an American female soldier while a third soldier videotaped the episode.At issue in the dog-handler trial was a familiar refrain from similar courts-martial: was the misconduct unsanctioned abuse by a rogue soldier or part of a pattern of harsh interrogation techniques approved by military commanders in Baghdad and senior government officials in Washington?Sergeant Smith's weeklong trial at Fort Meade, Md., failed to resolve this debate. One of the witnesses, the former military intelligence chief at Abu Ghraib, Col. Thomas M. Pappas, had been considered a possible link between the abusive tactics used at the prison and his superiors in Baghdad and Washington.Colonel Pappas said during testimony last week that he had learned that military working dogs were an effective interrogation tool from a team of intelligence officials visiting Iraq in September 2003 from the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. He said he had discussed with Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, the team leader and commander at Guantánamo Bay, the ""Arab fear of dogs"" as a reason to ""set the conditions"" for interrogations.But Colonel Pappas, testifying for the defense under a grant of immunity, said the Army lacked clear rules for using dogs in interrogations at Abu Ghraib, and he took personal responsibility for failing to ensure that military police and intelligence officers were properly trained in using dogs.Colonel Pappas acknowledged that he had approved a one-time use of muzzled dogs inside interrogation booths but only later learned that he could not give such an order without the approval of Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, then the top commander in Iraq. Colonel Pappas also said he was unaware that military intelligence soldiers were using unmuzzled dogs outside the booths.""In hindsight, clearly we probably needed to establish some definitive rules and put out some clear guidance to everybody concerned,"" Colonel Pappas said in his first public statements about the scandal. He is currently assigned to a planning job at Fort Knox, Ky.Two months ago, General Miller took the unusual step of invoking his right not to give testimony that might incriminate him, and said he would not answer questions in the court-martial proceedings against Sergeant Smith and another dog handler, Sgt. Santos A. Cardona, who is to stand trial in May.A military lawyer for General Miller said he had already fully answered all questions put to him on the issue by Congressional committees, Army investigators and other court proceedings. General Miller has said he only advised using working dogs to keep order.General Miller had been expected to retire from the Army soon, but the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month told the Army to delay that until the dog handlers' cases were resolved.The panel's chairman, Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday from Baghdad that he would summon Colonel Pappas and General Miller to testify again after the court proceedings involving them were complete.Avi Cover, a lawyer with Human Rights First in Manhattan who monitored the trial, said, ""The testimony in these proceedings revealed an appalling level of confusion and implicated the chain of command, certainly Pappas, for blame in authorizing these techniques in some instances.""The Pentagon last fall approved a policy directive governing interrogations as part of an effort to tighten controls over questioning of terror suspects and other prisoners by American soldiers. It also reaffirmed that military working dogs could not be used in interrogations and that military police could assist interrogators by providing information about detainees' behavior but could not participate in the interrogations themselves.In addition to Corporal Graner in cases related to abuse at Abu Ghraib, Private Lynndie R. England was sentenced Sept. 27 to three years in prison and a dishonorable discharge at a second court-martial after an earlier one at which she entered a guilty plea ended in a mistrial. The highest-ranking officer to be punished was Brig. Gen. Janis L. Karpinski, who was demoted to colonel and lost command of her military police unit.'"

Three years of owner collusion against free agents and the 1994 labor negotiations that produced a lengthy strike interfered.But once a new labor agreement was forged in 1996, the two sides began working toward what we have seen the past three weeks.Unfortunately, some owners and general managers still do not like the idea, George Steinbrenner chiefly among them. Talk about Neanderthals.Although no one was keeping count, it appears that three major leaguers emerged from the Classic with injuries -- Johnny Damon of the Yankees with shoulder tendinitis, which he might have developed had he stayed in Tampa, Fla.; Derrek Lee of the Chicago Cubs, who bruised his shoulder making a diving catch of a foul bunt; and Luis Ayala of the Washington Nationals, who sustained a season-ending elbow injury while pitching (maybe he shouldn't have been because he had bone chips removed from the elbow last October).We can feel sorry for Ayala and the Nationals, but their experience is a small price to pay for the positive elements of the event. Next time, officials can exercise more caution about recovering pitchers.Those officials will discuss the timing of the next Classic, but it almost certainly will not be moved to July or November, maybe just pushed back in March a little. They could also discuss staging the first two rounds in March, then waiting until what is now the break for the All-Star Game for the semifinals and final.It is highly unlikely that players will be so quick in the future to decline invitations to play in the Classic.I wonder how Hideki Matsui really feels now that his countrymen, led by Ichiro Suzuki, have won the first Classic. By refusing to play, Matsui insulted his country and his country's baseball legend, the team's manager, Sadaharu Oh.On the Petco Park field after Japan's 10-6 victory, Suzuki, who had five hits in the last two games batting third instead of leading off, said in English, a language he rarely uses publicly: ""Unbelievable. Most impressed with my baseball.""Translation: It was his most enjoyable day in baseball. If the Yankees win the World Series, maybe Matsui can experience that feeling.""I didn't even think about the upcoming regular season,"" Suzuki said through an interpreter, reverting to Japanese. ""It's not an ideal thing for a player to think, but I didn't really care if I would get injured in this game. That's how much I really wanted to win this one.""The championship game was a little raggedy but compelling. Scrapping all the way to climb out of a 4-0 first-inning hole, the Cubans closed the gap to 6-5 before their relief corps collapsed in a four-run ninth.As disappointing as it was for them to get that close to being the best in the world, the players who call themselves amateurs because they do not make major league salaries demonstrated a considerable amount of class.As their conquerors celebrated wildly around the pitcher's mound, Fidel's vanquished forces emerged from their dugout, walked onto the field in a single orderly line, waited patiently until the celebrating Japanese players realized they were there and congratulated them. A few players from each team then posed for pictures together.A few minutes later, Cuba's manager, Higinio Velez, showed his class at a news conference when asked about the United States team.""We have high respect for major leaguers in the U.S., we admire them, we follow them, we see how they play,"" he said. ""We have great respect for them, and what they got and what they get and what they still have is something that they obtained through sacrifice, through their sweat.""Nothing they get is for free. More than 95 percent of the major leaguers in the U.S. come from the very low classes, from the humble classes, so what they do is with their effort, with their sweat, their sacrifice and with their love for baseball.""There might have been a touch of propaganda there -- the mention of the low and humble classes as well as the exaggerated figure of 95 percent -- but Velez was gracious in defeat.Cuba and South Korea were the most impressive teams in the tournament, Cuba because it showed that it could beat the best professional players as well as amateurs and South Korea because it had a terrific 6-0 run until it encountered Japan for the third time.The United States, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Puerto Rico were all stocked with major league stars but did not win, in this opinion, because those players are geared to begin playing serious baseball April 1.Cuba, in contrast, is in the middle of its 90-game November-to-April season.But the tournament did not suffer from the premature elimination of highly regarded teams. It was liberally sprinkled with outstanding games, South Korea's 2-1 victory over Japan in the second round perhaps being the best.My only regret is having to wait three more years.'"
"'06-03-22,'1','The Windows delay follows Microsoft's difficulties in meeting its production goals for its Xbox 360 video game console after its release last November. Yesterday, however, Microsoft said it was accelerating output of the devices, potentially helping it capitalize on the postponement of Sony's rival PlayStation 3. Microsoft attributed the further delay in Windows Vista as a matter of a few weeks to ensure quality and security testing.Over the last year, Microsoft executives have emphasized the importance of reducing the vulnerability of their products to computer viruses and other malicious code. If the security focus means product development takes longer, they have said, so be it.""We won't compromise on product quality, and we needed just a few more weeks,"" James Allchin, co-president of Microsoft's Windows division, said in a conference call with analysts and journalists.In an interview after the conference call, Mr. Allchin said that he made the decision to take a few more weeks yesterday mornning after a meeting with the leaders of the Windows development team. No single feature or problem prompted his move, he said.""But I wanted to push up the quality even higher,"" Mr. Allchin said. ""And the balance between usability and security is a tricky one.""The security testing process, for example, has included dozens of outside computer security consulting companies -- known as blue-hat hackers -- who are given access to the Windows Vista code and its documentation and asked to try to find any ways to break in. Mr. Allchin characterized that program alone as the ""largest penetration-testing effort ever conducted on a commercial software product.""The shipment delay, he conceded, was ""a bit painful, but we're trying to take a leadership role here and do the right thing.""The new version of Windows has encountered repeated delays. The last major release of Microsoft's operating system, Windows XP, was in 2001. The gap of more than five years is a long one for Microsoft, which has generally shipped a new version of Windows every three or four years.In August 2004, Microsoft said that it would release Vista sometime in 2006, and that it was scaling back its technical ambitions for the product by removing an intelligent data-storage system, called WinFS.Mr. Allchin stressed that the current delay had no effect on the set of features now planned for Vista -- features that Microsoft has shown off at customer conferences in the last week.Microsoft's shares fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement, easing to $26.82 a share, down from the close of $27.74 in regular trading.Analysts did not expect the Vista delay to hurt Microsoft's financial performance in the 2007 fiscal year, which will end in June 2007. Mostly, they said, revenue anticipated in one quarter will move into a later quarter.Some analysts were surprised that a few weeks' delay could be predicted so early in the year. And Charles Di Bona, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said sales of Microsoft's Xbox video game consoles might benefit during the holiday season from not having to compete with new Vista-based PC's for consumers' dollars.""You won't have new PC's crowding out the Xbox, and that could work to Microsoft's advantage in a holiday season when it looks as if there won't be competition from Sony PlayStation 3, because of Sony's shipment delays,"" Mr. Di Bona said.Sony disclosed last week that the PlayStation 3, originally due this spring in Japan, would not be available until November, giving Microsoft a full year's head start.Microsoft said yesterday that starting this week it was increasing by two or three times the number of Xbox 360 consoles sent to retailers each week, a figure it did not specify.""Today we have turned a major corner,"" Peter Moore, corporate vice president of Microsoft's interactive entertainment business, said in a statement yesterday, adding that by June the company expected 80 games to be ready for the machine.When it introduced the console last November, Microsoft said it expected to ship three million Xbox 360's in the first three months, and 4.5 million to 5.5 million by the end of June. But it encountered component shortages and was forced to lower its projection for the first three months to 2.5 million to 2.75 million. It has not said whether it met that target.But even with Microsoft's acceleration in production, analysts said, frustration over the Xbox 360 shortage may have led some game enthusiasts to decide to wait the extra months for the PlayStation 3.""The question is, How many of those who didn't buy a 360 in December will now wait for the Sony?"" said Michael Pachter, a game industry analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities. ""Some will.""For Microsoft, the Xbox 360 is a critical part of the strategy of converging home electronics and entertainment, eventually integrating computing, music and gaming through a home media system in consumers' living rooms.Some analysts say they believe that as part of that strategy, Microsoft is in the early stages of developing a hand-held device that will combine the features of a music player like the Apple iPod with a gaming machine that would compete with Sony's PlayStation Portable.The San Jose Mercury News reported Monday that Microsoft was designing such a product; Microsoft officials declined to comment.'"
"'06-03-22,'1','ALBANY, March 21 - Gov. George E. Pataki instituted a policy on Tuesday barring his appointees and commissioners from raising political donations and rebuked his hand-picked insurance superintendent, Howard D. Mills, for raising $15,000 last year.But while Mr. Mills said afterward that he would stop raising donations while he is the superintendent of insurance -- the state's $127,000-a-year chief insurance regulator -- he held open the possibility that he would continue to spend from his campaign account.The governor announced the policy after The New York Times reported last week that Mr. Mills -- a former Republican state assemblyman who left office in 2004 and said he did not expect to seek elected office until 2008 -- continued to accept campaign donations last year and continues to spend the money, even though he holds an appointed regulatory post.Mr. Mills reported that he spent his campaign funds on monthly payments of $588.55 for a Chrysler 300 that he said he used only as a means ""to keep his profile high,"" and on cellphone bills, meals, flowers, political donations and gifts for volunteers.Mr. Pataki -- who appointed Mr. Mills to the insurance post after Mr. Mills tried unsuccessfully to unseat Senator Charles E. Schumer in 2004 -- said at a news conference here on Tuesday that he thought the renewed fund-raising was inappropriate, ""and we've made that plain to him.""'"

"'06-03-22,'1','The changes are rewriting the rules of Japan's business culture, where for decades after World War II companies marched in lock step to advance the nation's economy. That collectivist system broke down when Japan's economy stalled and even contracted in the 1990's after the collapse of twin bubbles in the real estate and stock markets.""It's a new era for Japanese business,"" said John C. Beck, president of the business consulting company North Star Leadership and co-author of ""Japan's Business Renaissance."" ""Japan has become much more entrepreneurial and innovative. Companies are taking new risks, going into new areas, making new products.""At Sharp, Mr. Machida said he had learned to take risks because the company had no choice. Sharp had thrived during the postwar years with products like hand-held calculators. But when Mr. Machida took the helm in 1998, weak domestic sales and cheaper Asian competition had plunged the 94-year-old company into its worse crisis since an earthquake flattened its original factory in 1923.As profit plummeted, Mr. Machida decided to shrink or halt production of semiconductors, computer monitors and tube televisions, which were major product lines where Sharp could no longer compete on price. Mr. Machida said he decided the only way to beat cheaper manufacturers was to stay ahead technologically. He said he chose flat-panel televisions to take advantage of L.C.D. technology that Sharp had originally developed in the 1970's for calculator screens.""The old way of doing things was just spreading us too thin,"" Mr. Machida said in an interview at Sharp's headquarters in this industrial city in western Japan.While Sharp does not break out earnings by product, it said L.C.D. TV's will account for a hefty chunk of the record profit of 87 billion yen ($737 million) it expects in the current fiscal year, ending March 31. That is up from a profit of 4.6 billion yen ($39 million) in 1998, when Mr. Machida took over. Sharp's profit margin is also higher at 5.5 percent, up from 1.5 percent over the same time period.Demand is so strong for the TV's that the company is investing 350 billion yen ($2.97 billion) to expand annual production capacity to about 20 million in two years, up from about 5 million sets now. It is also stepping up hiring, with plans to add 615 new employees next year, double the number it hired in 2003.Economists say turnaround stories like Sharp's are fueling the current revival in Japan's $4.6 trillion economy, the second-largest after the United States. As companies hire more employees and build new factories, the recovery has found a firm footing in domestic consumption, unlike previous, short-lived upturns here that relied on exports. Many economists now predict that Japan will expand as much as 3.6 percent this year, rivaling and perhaps even surpassing growth in the United States.To be sure, some specialists say Japan has not changed enough. They point out that levels of productivity and earning power still tend to lag behind those in the United States. The problem, they say, is that fundamental change is limited to a small numbers of companies, while most remain too timid to leave the pack.""I don't see enough differentiating,"" said William Swinton, an assistant dean in the business school at the Tokyo campus of Temple University. ""Some companies are using more focused strategies, but many still have a long way to go.""Still, most agree that change has reached even the cobweb-filled corners of Japan's domestic economy. Aeon, Japan's largest supermarket operator, has shaken up the country's retailing industry by erecting sprawling, Wal-Mart-style supercenters even more aggressively than Wal-Mart's own local subsidiary, Seiyu. Customers are flocking to its low-cost stores, helping Aeon forecast record profit for this year.Orix, an auto and aircraft leasing company, has gotten even more creative, seeking to turn itself into a global investment bank with acquisitions like the $500 million purchase in October of Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, the Los Angeles-based mergers and acquisition advisory firm.But nowhere are the changes in corporate behavior more apparent than in Japan's electronics industry, where companies compete in what the Japanese business press has dubbed a new ""era of winners and losers."" The former include Canon, the camera maker; Matsushita Electric, maker of Panasonic; and Sharp, all thriving. Meanwhile, other well-known companies like Sanyo Electric, Pioneer and Sony have floundered.""Everything changes much faster now than 10 years ago,"" said Kesanobu Yamagishi, a spokesman at Pioneer.But this new era of competition also bears some distinctly Japanese flourishes. One is the relatively small number of layoffs, which companies still shun here for fear of ruining morale. Mr. Machida, for one, is proud of the fact Sharp did not release any of its 49,000 employees during its turnaround, instead cutting costs by dropping product lines.He spent his first year as president making almost daily trips to Sharp offices and factory floors around Japan, exhorting employees to work extra hard to make his plan a success.""If we don't do this, Sharp has no future,"" Mr. Machida repeatedly said, according to employees. Many listened sullenly, unwilling to contradict their boss in public.Mr. Machida faced a particularly tough sell at Sharp's computer panel division, whose products he was scrapping. In town-hall-style meetings with 50 to 100 employees at a time, he said South Korean and Taiwanese manufacturers could make the same panels, and he challenged his engineers to raise the quality of L.C.D. screens high enough to work for televisions. He set technical goals, such as tripling the contrast ratio, a way of measuring picture sharpness, within three years.Employees said they were skeptical at first that L.C.D.'s could work, particularly for large televisions. But support quickly grew as they reached targets ahead of schedule.Sharp gained an early lead in L.C.D. televisions that it still strives to maintain. In October, it will open the first factory in the world to use so-called eighth-generation L.C.D. production technology, which increases production by using glass panels as large as a king-size bed but only as thick as a postcard. Sharp now competes in the global L.C.D. market with companies more than 10 times its size, like Sony and Samsung Electronics.""We are constantly telling employees to push ahead,"" said Shigeaki Mizushima, head of Sharp's L.C.D. division. ""We can't stand still for a moment.""'"
"'06-03-22,'1','Any significant weakening of the law will represent a serious blow to the prime minister, who hopes to run for president next year. It will also signal another defeat in France's long struggle to break the stranglehold of its rigid social-welfare system, which economists say has kept growth sluggish and unemployment high for decades. While there is no guarantee that the new law will create jobs, as the government contends, bowing to student and union pressure on it will call into question the current administration's ability to restructure the system.France has a strong tradition of often violent demonstrations and paralyzing strikes that is largely tolerated by the broader population, which has a cultural mistrust of government even as it retains a deep sense of dependency on the state. The resulting tendency to rebel against any attempt to curtail entitlements has cowed many administrations into backing down from bold policies that might have helped remake the system in the past.But as one commentator wryly noted, the administrations often pay by losing subsequent elections anyway. Even Mr. Woerth seemed to sense the quandary. ""It won't be a glorious exit,"" he said.Many people in France are already predicting Mr. de Villepin's political demise as a result of the crisis. He has come under intense criticism from opponents and from within his own party for pushing the law forward without first campaigning for it among the unions and students most affected by it. His chief rival, Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, by contrast, ushered in an immigration law last year by lobbying potential critics before submitting it to Parliament.Angered at not being consulted this time and sensing the government's weakness, the students and unions are now taking a hard line.Tens of thousands of students marched in major French cities on Tuesday, with some violence breaking out in Paris, where a group of youths smashed the windows and rear-view mirrors of cars along a street behind the Sorbonne. Hotel workers on the street, Rue Gay-Lussac, said fights had broken out between groups of students.Meanwhile, a witness told Agence France-Presse that the national riot police beat a man unconscious during a melee at Place de la Nation on Saturday night. The victim, a 39-year-old postal worker and union member, Cyril Ferez, briefly regained consciousness but lapsed into a coma, the news agency reported. He remained in a coma on Tuesday.The possibility of the serious injury or death of a protester at the hands of France's notoriously tough riot police is what the government fears most. Such incidents have fueled protest movements and helped end political careers.Hoping to defuse the situation, Mr. de Villepin has opened the possibility of amending the new law. He had hoped the law would lead to more hiring, helping to trim the 22 percent unemployment rate in the age group affected by it.Now, he is discussing shortening the trial period to one year and requiring companies to explain to dismissed employees exactly why they were let go, though without giving them legal recourse.But is not clear that even those changes will satisfy opponents.""Even one year is still excessive,"" said Mr. Aschieri, the union leader. ""In most employment contracts, trial periods are from one to six months.""In any case, even legislators like Mr. Woerth say the changes would effectively gut the law, making the ""first employment contract"" it defines little different from other short-term employment contracts already in effect and removing any incentive for employers.""The problem is that it will kill the C.P.E.,"" said Mr. Woerth, using the French abbreviation for the first employment contract. ""The more we modify the law, the less attractive it is for companies.""'"

"'06-03-23,'0','Flu experts already knew that people who contract the current avian flu virus, a type known as A(H5N1) or H5 for short, are infected in the lower lung.Paul A. Offit, a virologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new reports helped explain why the H5 virus, though it can infect people, does not easily spread from one person to another.Virologists agree that a flu pandemic will happen sooner or later as one of the 16 types of flu virus in the animal world, probably one that infects birds, will manage to switch hosts, and grow and spread in humans. But they differ over whether H5 is the likeliest candidate to make such a switch. Previous pandemics have been caused only by H1- (the 1918 pandemic), H2- (the 1957 Asian flu) or H3-type viruses (the Hong Kong flu of 1968).The H5 strain of avian flu has so far failed to develop a pandemic form. Some virologists fear it may need only better transmissibility. The new findings suggest that the virus could acquire such a property by switching its preference from the cell receptor found in the lower lung, known as alpha 2-3, to the receptor found on cells in the upper airways, known as alpha 2-6.A team of scientists at the Scripps Research Institute reported in Science last week that only a couple of mutations might be needed to enable the H5 virus to make this switch to the alpha 2-6 receptor. This is the about same number of mutations made by the H1, H2 and H3 viruses when they adapted to infect people. Since viruses mutate fast, a two-mutation step is not such a big hurdle.Because the H5 virus has killed about half of the 187 people it has infected, ""a lot of its genes are already optimized for virulence,"" said James C. Paulson, a member of the Scripps team. For H5 to become pandemic, ""the key gene that needs to be mutated is the HA gene,"" he said, referring to the hemagglutinin gene that makes the protein probe used by the virus to latch onto a cell's receptor sites.Though H5 may seem only a couple of steps from transmissibility among people, many virologists believe mutations in several other genes would be necessary as well, even though those changes are not yet well understood.Viruses find it difficult to switch hosts, and though they may quite often cause outbreaks in just a few individuals, ""viruses that produce a self-sustaining chain of transmission in the new host appear rare,"" Dr. Kawaoka writes in the current Annual Review of Microbiology. ""Most of these transfers are dead ends,"" he said.The H5 virus has been present in the human population since the late 1950's, said Dr. Offit of Children's Hospital, but has never acquired the full set of mutations needed to set off a pandemic. Such epidemiological evidence ""should make us feel safe that there's a substantial barrier,"" he said, noting the small number of people who have been infected.Dr. Offit said it was a good thing to worry about the next flu pandemic, given that about three can be expected every century. ""What's not good is to try to sell the public on their fear of pandemic flu being this particular bird flu, since if it's not, crying wolf will lose you credibility,"" he said.Peter Palese, a virologist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, said he did not believe the H5 virus could infect people except when they were exposed to large doses, for example, by sleeping in the same room as chickens. ""I feel strongly that H5 has been around in humans for a long time and never caused a pandemic, suggesting that this is not the virus which is likely to be the next pandemic,"" he said.But like Dr. Offit, Dr. Palese said he fully supported plans for better preparations for the next flu pandemic, whatever its source. ""People have to understand we are not really prepared should it come,"" he said.'"
"'06-03-23,'0','The study included no comparison group. In most studies of depression, 10 percent to 30 percent of the subjects recover spontaneously when taking placebo pills.""The importance of this was that it focused on remission, not response, on treatments to help people get well, not just better,"" said Dr. Thomas R. Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, which financed the study. ""And these trials provide doctors and patients with extensive information to help find the best strategies.""Many of the more than 20 researchers involved in the study have consulted widely with manufacturers of antidepressants, but the authors said the companies played no role in interpreting the data or writing the papers.In one paper appearing today, the authors report that 21 percent of 727 people who switched from Celexa to another antidepressant, like Zoloft, Effexor or Wellbutrin, improved. In the other paper, the authors report that 30 percent of 565 people who supplemented their Celexa with Wellbutrin or BuSpar, an antianxiety drug, recovered.""One of the big questions in the past was whether you should give up or continue if the first antidepressant treatment fails,"" said Dr. Madhukar H. Trivedi, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and the lead author of one of the papers. ""The message from this is that if the first try doesn't lead to an optimal outcome, you go to the next step.""The researchers emphasized that the doctors treating the people in the study paid careful attention to dosages and side effects and that the patients stuck with their drug therapies for up to 14 weeks before giving up, more than twice as long as many patients do.One recent study of treatment in primary care found that fewer than 10 percent of chronically depressed people achieved full recoveries.Dr. Donald F. Klein, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, said that the study provided important data but that it would probably not change practice much.""Most doctors are already convinced that you don't stop after just one failed treatment,"" Dr. Klein said. ""One major question has been whether it's better to give adjunctive treatment or to switch drugs, and the hope was that this trial would answer that definitively. But unfortunately it didn't.""Other experts cautioned against extrapolating too much from any study without a comparison group of patients. Dr. David A. Freedman, a clinical trial expert at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an e-mail message that without a control group ""we can't tell if improvement is due to time, or due to treatment.""""Also,"" Dr. Freedman added, ""many patients dropped out along the way. We don't know what happened to them. How well do the drugs work? We still don't know.""Dr. Trivedi said further analysis should clarify some of the questions. The researchers are analyzing data from patients who dropped out and from those who continued on Celexa. The researchers are also tracking a group of people who have received psychotherapy after a failed trial with drugs.'"
"'06-03-23,'0','The mystery surrounding the murder of Jennifer Shafiq, a 4-year-old girl from Hollis, Queens, has lingered far longer than she was even alive. But resolution may be at hand, the authorities said, after the Suffolk County police arrested her parents on Monday night at police headquarters in Sacramento, Calif.Her mother, Khairual N. Abdul, 42, was charged with murder in the case, and her father, Parmjit P. Singh, 48, was charged with hindering prosecution, the police said. They were arrested without incident and were extradited to New York yesterday, according to the Sacramento police.Jennifer's remains were discovered in 1996 by a hiker who stumbled across a shallow grave in a wooded area of Manorville, N.Y., while looking for deer antlers, officials said. At the time, medical examiners estimated that the body had been in the woods for four to six years. But for nearly a decade, the police had few clues beyond a T-shirt and a sleeveless dress found on the body, and they were unable to identify the skeleton without other DNA samples for comparison or a missing child report, the authorities said.The case began to turn last May when Sacramento police officers were called in a domestic dispute between Ms. Abdul and Mr. Singh, whom Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick of the Suffolk County Police described as estranged spouses. ""She had him arrested a number of times in Sacramento, and he finally decided to tell the police"" about the killing, Lieutenant Fitzpatrick said.During his conversation with the Sacramento police, Mr. Singh said that Ms. Abdul had beaten and burned Jennifer periodically in the months leading up to her death, officials said. In 1990, Mr. Singh said, he saw Ms. Abdul shake Jennifer violently and throw her to the floor, where the child hit her head and died, according to Lieutenant Fitzpatrick, an account that matched the description of injuries on the body of the child found in Manorville.Though Mr. Singh did not give the location of Jennifer's body, the police in Suffolk County and Sacramento conducted DNA testing and further interviews to identify the remains as hers, officials said. It was not clear how Jennifer's body ended up in the Manorville woods.'"
"'06-03-23,'0','BRUSSELS, March 22 - Microsoft offered on Wednesday to give rival software companies unlimited technical support to help them develop programs that work smoothly with the Windows operating system, the company's latest effort to comply with a European Commission order and avoid daily fines of up to 2 million euros ($2.4 million).The company previously offered to give rivals 500 hours of free technical support. ""We are committed to doing everything in our power to address the commission's concerns,"" said Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft's general counsel.The commission was unimpressed. A spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said that while Microsoft's move was ""positive,"" rivals should not have to rely on help from Microsoft and that the technical documents it was ordered to draw up should be clear enough not to require technical support.The offer comes a week ahead of a hearing to determine whether Microsoft is complying with a March 2004 antitrust ruling that found it guilty of abusing the dominant position of Windows in the software market in Europe.According to the 2004 decision, Microsoft must disclose information about Windows to allow rivals to build server systems that work as well with Windows as Microsoft's own server software. Servers connect personal computers together to create computer networks.Over the last six months, Microsoft and the commission have disagreed over whether the company has complied with the ruling.'"
"'06-03-23,'0','SAN FRANCISCO, March 22 - Three executives of Samsung, the largest supplier of computer memory for consumer electronics, have agreed to plead guilty and serve prison sentences in the United States for their roles in a price-fixing conspiracy, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday.The plea agreements are the latest development in the Justice Department's three-and-a-half-year investigation of the volatile market for dynamic random access memory chips, the most common type of computer memory products, used in personal computers, printers and electronic devices like cellphones and digital cameras.Samsung of South Korea, along with its rivals -- Infineon Technologies of Germany, Elpida of Japan and Hynix Semiconductor of South Korea -- were accused of conspiring to fix DRAM prices from April 1999 to June 2002.The Samsung executives are the third group of individuals to agree to prison terms; their sentences are similar to those of four Hynix executives announced this month.Sun Woo Lee, Samsung's senior manager of DRAM Sales, agreed to serve eight months; Yeongho Kang, associate director, DRAM marketing in Samsung's United States subsidiary, will serve seven months; and Young Woo Lee, sales director for Samsung's subsidiary in Germany, agreed to serve seven months. Like the Hynix executives, each executive agreed to pay a $250,000 fine.'"
"'06-03-23,'0','""It's less 'little boy,' "" Mr. Bradley said. ""For a while men have looked too much like Boy Scouts going off to day camp.""On city streets, too, trends in scruff have reached new levels of unruliness, a backlash, some beard enthusiasts say, against the heightened grooming expectations that were unleashed with the rise of metrosexuality as a cultural trend. Men both straight and gay, it appears, want to feel rough and manly.Other designers who appeared in scruffy beards during Fashion Week included Brian Kirkby of Boudicca, Nathan Jenden and Matthew Williamson. Santino Rice gave the look national exposure on ""Project Runway"" this season, with weekly variations. Among the models that Ralph Lauren cast in his men's show was a wildly bearded young man with long tresses, like Brad Pitt circa 2002.And with their fully furry chins Ariel Foxman and Bruce Pask, the editor in chief and the style director, respectively, of Cargo magazine, the metrosexual manifesto, seem now to be endorsing a lumberjack ideal.""It's a nice masculine aesthetic,"" said Robert Tagliapietra, who with his similarly bearded partner, Jeffrey Costello, designs a collection of pretty silk jersey dresses under the Costello Tagliapietra label. ""We both like that aesthetic of New England cabins with antlers on the wall, plaid shirts and a beard.""Beyond the fashion world, any number of celebrities are exhibiting luxuriant facial hair, including George Clooney with a Hussein-like beard in ""Syriana""; Heath Ledger in GQ, looking like Snoopy's sad cousin, Spike (the beagle with a skinny mustache who is always depressed); and Mel Gibson on a good day. At the New York premiere of ""V for Vendetta"" last week, Hugo Weaving appeared (with his co-star Natalie Portman, an adopter of last summer's iteration of the Mohawk) in the beard of the moment, grown for the stage production of ""Hedda Gabler.""John Allan, the owner of several clublike grooming salons in New York, reports seeing newly bearded customers, but not enough to warrant concerns for the health of his shaving business.""It will be interesting to see over the next six to eight months what mainland America is going to do with it,"" Mr. Allan said. ""For the past several years we've been stripping guys of their body hair. Maybe now it's time for the pendulum to swing the other way.""Whenever a countercultural trend becomes a mainstream one, there is a natural tendency to look for deeper meaning. Do beards that call to mind Charles Manson suggest dissatisfaction with ""the system""? Are broody beards, like the dark and somber mood of the fall fashion collections, physical manifestations of a melancholia in the air? Are they a reflection of the stylistic impact on mainstream fashion of the subculture of gay men known as bears, who embrace natural body hair?But such theories seem to have less relevance -- and beards less shock value -- than they once did.""Style has separated itself from viewpoint,"" said Tim Harrington, the lead singer of the rock band Les Savy Fav, who is known for his full beard and balding head. ""This is not like when beards were worn by hippies. Now you pick a style for aesthetic reasons as opposed to a viewpoint. I wonder if beards can have the oomph they once had when it feels like someone will ask you: 'Where did you get that beard? Is that beard from Dolce & Gabbana?' ""No survey ever conducted about women's attitudes toward beards, even those not underwritten by the Gillette Company, has indicated that more than 2 or 3 percent of women would describe a full beard as sexy. (""I hang out with those girls who are in that 2 or 3 percent,"" Mr. Martin, of Vice, said.)Yet the return of the wild beard carries a certain erotic charge that has been missing from beards since the Furry Freak look of the 1970's, or at least those who grow them hope they do.Andrew Deutsch, a designer of interactive Web videos, swears that having a beard has changed his life, giving him an air of confidence. ""I met my current girlfriend a week after I started growing my beard in November,"" Mr. Deutsch said. Now he finds himself constantly touching and stroking the beard, as if it were a talisman. ""It's like a security blanket on my face,"" he said.That a full beard can suddenly look right -- or, more accurately, not so awful -- illustrates how quickly ideals of masculinity can change.""You know, it's funny,"" said Lola Phonpadith, a public relations manager for the fashion company BCBG. ""I've been talking about this with my friends for weeks. I'm kind of into guys with beards today, and I'm embarrassed to say that. But the pretty-boy look can only last for so long.""'"
"'06-03-23,'0','Union leaders have refused to begin a dialogue with the government until it has rescinded the law, insisting they will carry out nationwide protests and strikes next week. So in what will certainly be perceived as a direct criticism of Mr. de Villepin, Mr. Sarkozy added, ""You should never break the line of dialogue in a complex country like France.""He also said the jobs initiative should be tried as an ""experiment"" for six months. In another subtle barb, Mr. Sarkozy denied speculation that he might resign over the law, saying, ""One does not leave a government for opportunist reasons.""Mr. Sarkozy, who is responsible for maintaining law and order, was widely blamed for contributing to the tense environment that set off riots last fall by disadvantaged youth in suburbs of Paris and other major cities. He is unwilling to be blamed again should the current public protests, which have at times become violent, turn deadly. On Wednesday a 20-year-old student in Poitiers died of unknown causes at a sit-in.Certainly Mr. de Villepin is finding himself more and more isolated in his fight to preserve even part of his modest initiative. The front page of Le Figaro, the daily newspaper that most strongly defends the official government line, was dominated on Wednesday by four color photos that told the story.One showed Mr. de Villepin telling legislators of his determination to carry out the law. The second showed a hooded and masked protester running. The third showed the crumpled body of a 39-year-old postal worker and union member who sank into a coma after violence in last Saturday's protest in Paris. The fourth showed commuters waiting on a train platform during a previous transportation strike.The satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaîné, in a takeoff on Albrecht Dürer's iconic engraving of St. Sebastian the martyr, portrayed Mr. de Villepin in a loincloth, his nearly naked body pierced with arrows.There is broad agreement throughout France that something has to be done about chronic joblessness, particularly among the young. But there are only 13 months until the presidential election, and politicians of the right and the left alike are unwilling to support any initiative that is remotely unpopular.The new law has become a political battle focused less on reforming France's jobs and benefits policies than on scoring political points.As the head of government and largely responsible for domestic matters, Mr. de Villepin is the obvious target. Appointed by President Jacques Chirac, he has never held elective political office and has no ready-made constituency, but he is answerable to Parliament, unions, interest groups and the people.The National Assembly, the lower but more important house of Parliament, has taken him on with unusual brutality.""Filled with egotism, Mr. de Villepin imprisons France in his personal destiny,"" Jean-Marc Ayrault, the Socialist leader in the Assembly, said Tuesday in a speech. He added, ""The only thing of importance for him is to sculpt his inflexible presidential statue."" Indeed, Mr. de Villepin proposed the work initiative on his own, ignoring the advice of some of his ministers who had warned him that it would not work.It was never debated in the National Assembly, but two weeks ago Mr. de Villepin used his authority under the Constitution to tack it on as an amendment to a much broader law on equality in the workplace. At 2:30 in the morning it was passed by a vote of 51 to 23, and it was later passed by the Senate.In the last week, the prime minister has shifted his strategy. After first defending the initiative as a law passed fair and square and vowing that France will not be held hostage by the streets, he has now expressed a willingness to water it down.On Wednesday, Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. de Villepin gave no indication of tension between them as Mr. de Villepin and his ministers appeared before the National Assembly.If the criticism forces Mr. de Villepin from his job, Mr. Sarkozy may not be the winner. Although it is far-fetched, it is not out of the question that Mr. Chirac could turn around and name Mr. Sarkozy as Mr. de Villepin's replacement.That may sound good, but throughout the Fifth Republic the post of prime minister has been the Bermuda Triangle of French politics. In more than three decades, no prime minister has successfully used the perch to catapult into the presidency.'"
"'06-03-23,'0','Even as adopting a stray dog or cat -- rather than buying one from a store or breeder -- has become politically fashionable, a badge of pride for some because of the millions of animals that are euthanized each year, the hurdles that some humane societies and rescue groups make potential owners leap -- including multipage applications, references, background checks, interviews and home visits -- can make the process feel nearly as daunting as adopting a child.Animal adoption groups say they want to avoid giving pets to owners who will abuse them and, perhaps more important, to make sure an animal that has been given up once will find a permanent home. Yet would-be adopters who expect exacting standards from top breeders are surprised when shelters and rescue groups ask more from them than a pulse. Many families feel stung when they are denied and are left to ask: Is it better for the animal never to find a home than to live with us?While some 8 million to 12 million dogs and cats end up in shelters in the United States each year, and 4 to 6 million are euthanized, those who place pets say that the high standards they demand of owners rarely leave animals without homes. Eventually almost everyone who wants an animal will get one, somewhere. So why put would-be adopters through a process that makes them feel inadequate, their privacy invaded?""The home visit weirds out a lot of people,"" said Jill Blasdel-Cortus, the president of Dachshund Rescue of North America, a network of about 100 volunteers, who give temporary homes to daschshunds claimed from overcrowded shelters or families who surrender them because of a behavior problem or lifestyle change. The group places the dogs in permanent homes. ""We're not going to judge if you've dusted or if it's clean,"" Ms. Blasdel-Cortus said.Nonetheless she defends the practice of requiring would-be adopters to fill out three-page applications that ask if the home is owned or rented, as well as open-ended questions like, ""If your dog bit a child at a backyard barbecue, what would you do?""References are checked. The home is visited. Adopters must sign a contract specifying the care of the dog. In the last nine years the dachshund group has placed some 4,300 dogs, Ms. Blasdel-Cortus said, and she could recall only one family turned down after a home visit, because it lived in an upstairs apartment with rickety stairs and refused to carry the dog up and down.""I am a dog advocate,"" Ms. Blasdel-Cortus said. ""I'm not a people advocate. If you don't want to fill out the form, go to your local shelter. Some people may find that uncooperative, but a rescued dog is not for everyone.""Animal rescue groups, which seem demanding in approving new homes for their charges, are part of a ""very intense, very big and rapidly expanding movement,"" said Jon Katz, who has written about them in ""The New Work of Dogs"" (Villard, 2003).He estimates the number of people involved in rescue (the overwhelming majority of them women) in the tens of thousands. An animal rescuer can be an established urban nonprofit shelter or a woman in Idaho with a Web site. Sometimes a rescuer travels hundreds of miles to meet another, who has traveled hundreds of miles with a pet, in a sort of underground railroad handoff.Cocker Spaniel Rescue of New England will not place a dog with a family with children under 7, said Gerry Foss, its president. German Shepherd Rescue, in Burbank, Calif., receives six dogs a day from people who don't want them, said Grace Konosky, the founder, and she denies about 70 percent of the people who want to adopt them.Janie Regnier filled out an application to adopt a dachshund through Dachshund Rescue. ""It was a surprisingly long application, but as an animal lover, I thought it was a good application,"" she said.Ina Eaves, of the rescue group, visited Ms. Regnier's home in Fairfax, Va., this week. The prospect made Ms. Regnier nervous because she is a renter, not an owner. Ms. Eaves wanted a fence repaired, but by the time she left, Ms. Regnier felt they were friends, she said. She was approved.For those denied a pet, the experience can be bewildering. Tamara Burke, who lives near Stowe, Vt., where she owns a consulting company and writes a column for The Stowe Reporter, has owned animals all her life. But when she and her husband decided to get a second golden retriever as a companion for their older retriever, Mercedes, a rescue group still wanted to visit her home.""There is nothing about my house that says upper middle class,"" Mrs. Burke said of the century-old cottage that has been in her family for generations and where she raises sheep and chickens. ""It is a funky, cobbled-together little thing, but it has nothing to do with how much money I spend on my dogs or how much attention I give them.""The rescue-group representative said, Mrs. Burke remembered, that while she and her husband were nice people, theirs was not a suitable home for the dog because they did not have a fenced-in yard. ""I own 150 acres,"" Mrs. Burke said. ""I'm looking at her saying: 'What am I going to do, fence in all 150 acres so I can have a dog? This is absurd.' ""In response Mrs. Burke became involved with rescue organizations herself. And she found that lots of other people didn't ""qualify"" for a dog. In her experience home visits don't mean a lick.""I cannot make a determination based on how a person lives,"" she said. ""I have friends who have trust funds, and they live without running water. They also happen to have dogs, and the dogs don't seem to mind.""Mrs. Burke said that potential owners can feel bullied by the process, and the gatekeepers justify it because they are advocates for homeless animals. ""These are people who would bully in other aspects of their lives if they could, but this is a socially acceptable way to get away with it,"" she said. ""You're talking about individuals who develop this attitude because they know they have something that you desperately want. They are demanding an emotional response.""Most rescue volunteers strive to balance what is best for the animal with what is best for a would-be adopter. But everyone defines a successful home differently, and there are no uniform requirements for owning a pet. Some publicly owned shelters also require home visits.The Animal Care and Control Department in Palm Beach County, Fla., requires a home visit in the case of breeds that are top biters --like pit bulls, Rottweilers, German shepherds and Akitas -- to ensure the yard is fenced. Adoption can be denied if a family lives in an area where the department is regularly called to seize dogs, said Kelly Diegert, a department official.In the view of some adoption specialists, elaborate vetting of clients and home visits are overkill. They are trying to lower the hurdles, though they don't envision letting people drop in and simply take home a dog with no questions asked. That would make them pet shops. ""We are interested in making adopting an animal less like applying to college,"" said Gail Buchwald, the vice president of shelter and adoption programs at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Manhattan, which places more than 2,000 dogs and cats each year. ""Most people who have been asked to go through a process like that tend to feel intruded upon.""She said that her organization asks for an application form and makes contact with each member of the household to be sure they want to have a pet. They ask about landlords, but they do not make home visits. ""When pets are easy to come by,"" Ms. Buchwald said, ""it doesn't make sense to push adopters away to the point that they'll say: I don't need your college-application process. I'll go to the deli down the street and take that stray from the box.""When Chris Coates, 23, and his partner Zach Denison, 24, adopted Buddy, a Labrador-pit bull mix, at the A.S.P.C.A. this week, Mr. Coates said the process was thorough but not invasive. He first visited last Friday, then took Mr. Denison on Sunday. They went back on Monday and played with six dogs before selecting Buddy, who had been at the center for two years and received a full-staff sendoff.""As an animal rescuer, you want to have control,"" Ms. Buchwald said. ""You may have nursed the animal back from the streets or illness or injury. You want to know beyond any doubt what the home looks like. But this work involves trust and restraint. The best thing you can do is say, 'Go with my blessing,' and you clap when they find a home.""'"

"'06-03-23,'0','Writing for the majority, Justice David H. Souter said the search was unreasonable, given the vocal objection of the husband, Scott Randolph. True, Justice Souter said, the court had long permitted one party to give consent to a search of shared premises under what is known as the ""co-occupant consent rule."" But he said that rule should be limited to the context in which it was first applied, the absence of the person who later objected.The presence of the objecting person changed everything, Justice Souter said, noting that it defied ""widely shared social expectations"" for someone to come to the door of a dwelling and to cross the threshold at one occupant's invitation if another objected.""Without some very good reason, no sensible person would go inside under those conditions,"" he said.""We have, after all, lived our whole national history with an understanding of the ancient adage that a man's home is his castle,"" Justice Souter said. ""Disputed permission is thus no match for this central value of the Fourth Amendment.""Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M. Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the majority opinion, as did Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who explained himself in a concurring opinion notable for its ambivalent tone. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. did not vote, as he was not a member of the court when the case was argued.The dissenters, in addition to Chief Justice Roberts, were Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. In his opinion, the chief justice took aim at the majority's description of social custom, as well as its reliance on that description to reshape ""a great deal of established Fourth Amendment law.""Every lower federal court to have considered the issue, as well as most state courts, had concluded that one party's consent was sufficient. The Georgia Supreme Court, in its 2004 decision that the justices affirmed, was in the minority, ruling in this case that the evidence of Mr. Randolph's cocaine use was inadmissible.""The fact is that a wide variety of differing social situations can readily be imagined, giving rise to quite different social expectations,"" Chief Justice Roberts said. For example, he continued, ""a guest who came to celebrate an occupant's birthday, or one who had traveled some distance for a particular reason, might not readily turn away simply because of a roommate's objection.""Noting that ""the possible scenarios are limitless,"" he said, ""Such shifting expectations are not a promising foundation on which to ground a constitutional rule, particularly because the majority has no support for its basic assumption -- that an invited guest encountering two disagreeing co-occupants would flee -- beyond a hunch about how people would typically act in an atypical situation.""The majority missed the point, the chief justice said; the fact is that someone choosing to share space has also, already, chosen to share privacy.""Our common social expectations may well be that the other person will not, in turn, share what we have shared with them with another -- including the police,"" he said, ""but that is the risk we take in sharing.""That was the analysis, and then came the footnotes.Justice Souter, usually mild-mannered to a fault, said in Footnote 4 that ""in the dissent's view, the centuries of special protection for the privacy of the home are over."" By invoking a ""false equation"" between inviting the police into the home and reporting a secret, he said, the chief justice ""suggests a deliberate intent to devalue the importance of the privacy of a dwelling place.""Chief Justice Roberts responded in turn. The majority had mischaracterized his position on privacy and ""seems a bit overwrought,"" he said in a footnote.In a concluding paragraph of his dissent, he said: ""The majority reminds us, in high tones, that a man's home is his castle, but even under the majority's rule, it is not his castle if he happens to be absent, asleep in the keep or otherwise engaged when the constable arrives at the gate. Then it is his co-owner's castle.""Justice Souter also attacked as a ""red herring"" a warning by Chief Justice Roberts that the rule the court was adopting would hamper the ability of the police to protect victims of domestic violence.Justice Souter said the law was clear on the right of the police, despite any objection, to enter a home to protect a crime victim. But that issue ""has nothing to do with the question in this case,"" he said.The discussion by Chief Justice Roberts of the implications for domestic violence cases might have been an effort to win, or a failed effort to hold, the vote of Justice Breyer.When the case was argued on Nov. 8, Justice Breyer raised the issue of domestic abuse. Addressing Mr. Randolph's lawyer, Thomas C. Goldstein, he said, ""I haven't seen anything on your side that wouldn't prevent many cases of domestic spousal abuse from being investigated."" He added, ""Quite frankly, it bothers me a lot.""In his concurring opinion on Wednesday, Justice Breyer noted that in this case, the police were searching ""solely for evidence,"" and domestic abuse was not at issue. While he pronounced himself satisfied by ""the case-specific nature of the court's holding,"" he said the outcome might well be different in the context of domestic abuse, in which police entry even over one spouse's objection could be reasonable.This case was the oldest undecided case on the court's docket, and it is likely that Justice Breyer's vote was in play until the final stages. One indication was Chief Justice Roberts's reference in his opinion to Justice Breyer's having joined ""what becomes the majority opinion,"" an odd present-tense locution suggesting that the outcome had once been otherwise.The case also produced dueling opinions by Justice Stevens, concurring, andJustice Scalia, in dissent, over how a true believer in interpreting the Constitution in light of the framers' original understanding would have resolved the issue. There was a tone more of banter than anger to this exchange between the old adversaries, as if after some months of forced and unaccustomed unanimity, they were now free once again to acknowledge their differences.'"

"'06-03-24,'1','The companies said last night that they would have ""no further comment until an agreement is reached or the discussions are terminated.""The talks come nearly five years after the two companies called off what would have been a $22.8 billion merger. That aborted deal had been constructed as a merger of equals but fell apart after the companies could not agree on how much control Alcatel would have.For Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., a sale would be the last chapter in an extraordinary story of struggle. In 2002, the company was on the brink of collapse, but survived by eliminating thousands of jobs and cutting billions in debt.Yet as Lucent has returned to profitability, the telecommunications landscape in the United States has radically changed. Lucent has lost many of its largest customers as the regional Bell phone companies gobbled up rivals, steeply reduced investment in their older copper-line networks and spent more on fiber optic equipment that has fallen in price.Consolidation among the phone companies -- this month's $67 billion deal between AT&T and BellSouth being the most recent -- has raised expectations that at least some of the equipment makers that serve them will also merge.Lucent and, to a lesser degree, Nortel Networks in Canada, have been considered the most likely takeover targets because of their depressed stock prices and lukewarm business prospects.The outlook seemed worse in 2001, when Alcatel and Lucent discussed a merger. The two companies were then roughly equal in size, but were struggling as the collapse in spending on telecommunications equipment dragged down their earnings and stock prices. But Alcatel has emerged as the much stronger company, with a market value of nearly $20 billion.To Alcatel, Lucent's most valuable asset would be its C.D.M.A. wireless technology used by Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, two of the largest cellphone companies in the United States. Though only about a third of mobile phone subscribers worldwide rely on this technology, Verizon and Sprint have spent heavily to upgrade their networks to provide more next-generation data services.Lucent's wireless business would complement Alcatel's leadership in broadband equipment, fiber optic networks and Internet television, all of which are growing quickly. Lucent's leading position in the American market would also dovetail with Alcatel's strength in Europe.Though Alcatel would be eager to obtain Lucent's customers and leading position in the C.D.M.A. market, it could also risk inheriting some of the company's problems. Growth overseas has been uneven. For instance, Lucent sales in the last three months of 2005 fell more than 15 percent, in part because of weaker demand in China.Lucent's roots go back to the age of the telegraph. It was the equipment-making arm of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and included the research and development unit Bell Laboratories, an intellectual powerhouse. In 1996, AT&T spun off Lucent in a $3 billion initial public offering. The stock quickly became a Wall Street favorite, rising to more than $63 a share and surpassing AT&T in market value by 1998.In 2000, the company was caught wrong-footed by a sudden slowdown in demand for communications equipment and reported a series of disappointing quarterly results. Its chairman and chief executive was ousted, and the Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry into its accounting practices. The shares -- which made up the nest eggs of thousands of Lucent employees -- slid to a low of 58 cents in 2002.Patricia F. Russo was named chief executive that year, and pulled the company back from the brink of collapse. In 2004, Lucent settled the S.E.C. investigation, agreeing to pay $25 million.

"'06-03-24,'1','Suns Coach Mike D'Antoni said: ""He wasn't even the same person I saw yesterday. I think I'm still surprised. But ask me next week because he's got some dog days ahead of him.""Before the game, Portland Coach Nate McMillan had called it the Suns' second season opener. Stoudemire was ready.He infused the Suns with a new sense of purpose, one that was lacking when the Blazers (20-48) defeated the Suns, 111-101, on March 12 in Portland.""I wasn't surprised that he had the performance like he did tonight,"" Suns point guard Steve Nash said. ""Just because he is so talented, he's big and strong, with big strong hands, he finishes.""Even if he's not moving as much as he will,"" he said, ""he's still a physical presence.""With Stoudemire patrolling the paint, the Suns can return to a slightly larger and more physical lineup they had last season.But D'Antoni was not yet ready to proclaim his team championship ready. ""It gives us a better chance to win a title,"" he said.Stoudemire, 23, showed why Thursday night. In one memorable sequence, he head-faked and pump-faked the Blazers' Brian Skinner four times -- going east, west, north and south -- before draining a jumper. He scored 9 points in the first five minutes.""Him at 75, 80 percent is still pretty good and pretty difficult to stop,"" Nash said.As easy as the night seemed for Stoudemire, he had another goal.""The postseason is the real season, that's when it all counts,"" he said before the game. ""This is my opportunity to get into shape. I am going to use these games to work on my cardio.""Stoudemire was breathing hard in Monday's five-on-five scrimmage -- his third this week -- but it was a pain-free experience, which convinced him he was ready to return.He fit seamlessly into the Suns' flow, supplanting James Jones in the starting lineup. Marion had been averaging 21.5 points and 12.3 rebounds, keeping the Suns afloat along with Nash, the front-runner to repeat as the league's most valuable player.Even without Stoudemire, the Suns had steadily surged to a six-game lead in the Pacific Division, holding a 45-21 record.He had not been in uniform since last season's Western Conference finals, where he averaged 37 points and 9.8 rebounds in a 4-1 series loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Then, in October, Stoudemire had microfracture surgery on his left knee, a procedure that has damaged other N.B.A. players like Chris Webber, Penny Hardaway and Blazers forward Zach Randolph.Stoudemire played in 80 games last season, averaging 26 points and 8.9 rebounds and dominating as an undersized center. But his persistent knee pain early in training camp led to an operation that made him question whether he would play this season.""It was tough,"" Stoudemire said. ""I felt like there were some days where I wasn't going to come back this year and there were some days when I thought I was ready to come back tomorrow."" He was more than ready on this night.'"
"'06-03-24,'1','Baseball is a prime-time play because what interests suitors is the highly rated playoffs and even higher-rated World Series, which are shown mostly at night. With some key games scheduled on Sundays, it would be risky for ABC to shelve its ""Desperate Housewives""/""Grey's Anatomy"" juggernaut, which toyed with NBC's Winter Olympics last month.NBC, which is in deep prime-time trouble, might need the ratings uptick that would come from a successful World Series. But it has a Sunday night conflict: this September, it will start its six-year, $3.6 billion deal to carry Sunday night National Football League games.With so much work to do to revive its last-place prime-time schedule, NBC is not likely to interrupt its season for three weeks of baseball and pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege. NBC might have nostalgia for the decades it carried baseball, but the price and risk might be too steep.CBS would seem to be the longest shot. With so much prime-time strength, why let baseball intrude?Neal Pilson, a sports industry consultant and former president of CBS Sports, said he sees Fox eventually taking the broadcast package, partly because it wants more of the package than its rivals.""They're generally happy with the 'Game of the Week,' and it gives them continuity,"" he said. ""It's difficult to start your season with the World Series. But what's most attractive to any other network is the World Series.""What is likely is that M.L.B. will sell a broadcast package without the maximum seven league division series games that Fox has carried, and possibly, without two or three afternoon league championship series games.Fox would like to save money by not paying for the L.D.S. games. And it is wary of paying too much for baseball despite the nostalgia of carrying the scintillating 2003 Yankees-Red Sox league championship series and the 2004 Red Sox World Series victory. But in 2002, it foresaw big losses on its six-year contract and wrote down its value by $295 million.Baseball would ideally like to get the kind of whopping increase it got when ESPN renewed its cable contract for $2.4 billion over eight years -- the $296 million average annual rights fee starting this season is 117 percent higher than in the past deal, even before radio and digital highlights deals are factored in. But that stupendous a leap would be absurd; unlike Fox, ESPN has a dual stream of revenues flowing from subscribers and advertisers.Which brings us to the second cable package being dangled before ESPN, Comcast and Turner Sports for at least $150 million annually. It contains regular-season rights to the ""Game of the Week,"" plus those two or three L.C.S. games and maybe all 20 division games.Whether baseball is pricing itself too high is a big concern. Many of the measures of its business are growing, but it is seeking its television bounty after the networks have spent heavily on N.F.L. rights. ESPN, which seems to print money in Bristol, Conn., nearly doubled its fees to $1.1 billion a year so it could step up to ""Monday Night Football"" rights, and it paid another $270 million a year for Nascar rights.Also, is Comcast's appetite for big-ticket sports still as voracious as it was before it lost out on the Thursday-Saturday slate of games that will be carried on the NFL Network? And how much does Turner, with more than 70 Braves games on TBS and a successful franchise of drama series on TNT, really covet more baseball without a World Series payoff?'"
"'06-03-25,'0','Experts at the three-day International Symposium on Emerging Zoonoses said they had no way of predicting what human disease would emerge next from an animal source.Preventing further outbreaks, participants said, will require a variety of measures, including more education about zoonoses among veterinarians and physicians; more integration of animal diseases into health plans; the creation of more laboratories to detect animal diseases; and possibly changes in the foods people eat and the animals they keep as pets.Breaking down barriers among government agencies, academia and special interest groups will be needed as scientists seek new ways to collect reliable evidence to protect the health of animals and humans, participants said.But ""no single institution has the capacity to do all this,"" said Dr. Pierre Formenty, a veterinarian and epidemiologist at the World Health Organization in Geneva.The meeting was the first between the World Animal Health Organization, a cooperative of chief veterinary officers from 167 countries, based in Paris, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based in Atlanta, said Dr. Lonnie King, the dean of Michigan State University's veterinary school.Dr. King is soon joining the C.D.C., which is expected to become a laboratory and epidemiology reference center for the animal organization.""We are creating the conditions for the spread of these viruses"" that cause zoonoses and human illness through tourism, hunting and farming, said Dr. Bruno Chomel, a professor of zoonoses at the University of California, Davis.For example, Dr. Chomel said, the corn mouse that carries the virus that causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever has spread its range with changes in farming, leading to outbreaks of the bleeding disease.The liver infection caused by the hepatitis E virus, which has been detected mainly in poor countries, is being increasingly recognized in wealthy countries in small numbers. Two outbreaks of hepatitis E occurred recently in Japan after people ate raw liver from infected wild boar and deer, Dr. Chomel said.In 1999, scientists discovered the Nipah virus among pig workers in Malaysia and Singapore who developed inflammation of the brain and respiratory illness. Farming practices on pig farms where fruit trees were abundant created opportunities for transmission of the Nipah virus, said Dr. Peter W. Daniels of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong.Fruit bats carried the Nipah virus, and it was transmitted to pigs that lived in an open farm environment. In turn, the virus was transmitted to humans and their pets.Additional factors favoring Nipah virus transmission were disrespect for regulations and the frequent breaking of rules to increase profits. It was a lesson that self-regulation must be realistically audited, Dr. Daniels said.The demand for exotic pets can also spread zoonoses.Customs inspectors recently stopped the potential spread of A(H5N1) virus in Belgium by catching a man trying to smuggle infected Thai eagles that had been stuffed alive in a roller tube.Cats, leopards and tigers have died from A(H5N1) avian influenza in southeast Asia and Europe. Though the number of cases is small, they have raised concern that the virus could become a bigger problem among felines. The 10,000 tigers now being kept as pets in the United States outnumber the 6,000 in the wild worldwide, Dr. Chomel said.Another zoonosis, rabies, killed 50,000 people in 2005, mainly from dog bites in Africa and Asia despite availability of an effective vaccine, according to the World Health Organization.In poor countries, many dogs go unvaccinated because they are believed to be strays. But many strays turn out not to be strays, said Dr. Jakob Zinsstag of the Swiss Tropical Institute in Basel. In a pilot study in Chad, his team vaccinated and tagged stray dogs. When the Swiss team recaptured stray dogs, it found that 70 percent had been vaccinated, concluding that their owners had let them roam freely and that opportunities existed to conduct rabies vaccination programs.Many disease outbreaks like avian influenza often lead to mass cullings that create practical and emotional problems for animal health workers, said Dr. Larry Granger, a veterinarian at the United States Department of Agriculture in Riverdale, Md. When mass euthanasia of animals is carried out, all workers should be debriefed to help relieve their stress, Dr. Granger said.'"
"'06-03-25,'0','The identity of the other dismissed supervisor could not be determined.Mr. Keena, who has been affiliated with the Red Cross for 25 years, told volunteers in the disaster area that he was leaving because of a medical emergency.He could not be reached for comment yesterday.Several volunteers who had served in the area complained over the last four months that Mr. Keena had ignored Red Cross rules, overridden efforts to establish procedures to keep track of relief supplies and interfered with internal investigations into the diversion of supplies.Two volunteers assigned by Red Cross national headquarters last fall to look into those and other accusations of wrongdoing urged the removal of Mr. Keena and other senior managers in a report that they filed with senior organization officials on Dec. 5.A second supervisor, Jill Paul, who was in charge of the kitchens where meals were prepared for delivery to the needy, told volunteers yesterday that she had elected to leave the operation, several volunteers said. But it could not be determined whether Ms. Paul was the second worker ordered out of the area.She could not be reached for comment.Teala Brewer, a former Secret Service agent who is the Red Cross's director of ethics and compliance, was in New Orleans yesterday with volunteers who had pointed out problems.One of the accusations they are investigating is that supervisors in charge of the kitchens have been ordering more food than is needed, raising questions about where the extra food is going.In one case highlighted by the volunteers, Ms. Paul recommended sending 1,500 meals a day into the New Orleans neighborhood of Bywater because residents had only limited access to utilities, potable water and a small convenience store.Eight days after she filed her recommendation, volunteers assigned to go street by street in Bywater to estimate the number of meals needed said they came up with an assessment of only 500 meals needed on the route every day.""They found that not only did a great portion of the route have full utilities, they also had a major grocery store up and running and public transportation,"" said a volunteer who had seen their report but requested anonymity because she said she had been physically threatened by a supervisor. ""Much of the area was back to pre-Katrina, and the rest of it was so bad that no one was living in it.""Volunteers delivering meals said investigators from national headquarters had been trailing them over the last week and interviewing people living along their routes.The interim president of the Red Cross, John F. McGuire, acknowledged this week that the organization was investigating accusations that relief supplies had been improperly diverted and that procedures for tracking inventory had been ignored.Initially, according to those raising such concerns, their warnings were ignored.In fact, Jerome H. Nickerson Jr. and Michael A. Wolters, who wrote the report recommending that the supervisors in New Orleans be removed, said they were relieved of their responsibilities.Mr. Nickerson, a Maryland lawyer, said his name disappeared from the Red Cross database of trained disaster volunteers, and Mr. Wolters, a security guard, said his local chapter was told that he was forbidden from entering disaster areas on orders of the Red Cross's general counsel.""When I first came out of New Orleans, I couldn't sleep for about a month because I just couldn't figure out why people weren't moving on this,"" Mr. Nickerson said yesterday. ""But now people are paying attention, and the people who were doing this bad stuff are being called to account.""According to Red Cross publications, Mr. Keena has assisted with disaster response for the last 12 of his 25 years as a volunteer, working at 26 major disasters. The Colorado Springs Gazette reported last year that Mr. Keena, whose wife is in the Air Force, worked at the Double Eagle Casino in Cripple Creek, Colo.The Gazette said Mr. Keena volunteered at the local Pikes Peak Chapter of the Red Cross, but Paul Koch, the financial director there, said yesterday that he did not know Mr. Keena.Mr. Keena was on an elite team of paid Red Cross volunteers, known as temporary disaster reserves, who have extensive experience in disaster relief work. They are called out at the onset of an emergency and paid because they are needed for an extended period.'"
"'06-03-25,'0','NEW DELHI, March 24 - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called Friday for a far-reaching ""treaty of peace, security and friendship"" between India and Pakistan, in what appeared to be an effort to stanch criticism from across the border for inaction on the contested Kashmir region.Pakistan politely welcomed the offer but pointed, not surprisingly, to the need to take on the Kashmir issue.""We are not afraid of discussing Jammu and Kashmir or of finding pragmatic, practical solutions to resolve this issue as well,"" Mr. Singh said. He went on to say that territorial lines could not be redrawn -- the Indian government's longstanding position -- but that the two countries could work toward making them irrelevant, or as he also put it, ""just lines on a map.""The two countries, violently separated at birth in 1947 but unable ever since to agree over who controls the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, have been engaged in peace talks for more than two years. Those talks have yielded little more than modest agreements to open train and bus links across the border.For the last several months Pakistan has stepped up criticism of India for what it calls New Delhi's recalcitrance on resolving the Kashmir dispute. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, for his part, has dangled the idea of greater self-rule for Kashmiris on both sides of the de facto border.'"
"'06-03-25,'0','Employees with ailing parents, more than 20 million nationwide, cite other benefits that would allow them to focus more on their jobs, like geriatric case managers to guide them through the mysteries of Medicaid and Medicare, or backup care for emergencies like a last-minute business trip. Companies that offer this kind of hands-on assistance generally pay for at least part of the service.But they are rare. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, which represents more than 200,000 human resource and other corporate officials, 39 percent of its members said in 2003 that elder care benefits were ""too costly to be feasible."" Only 1 percent of their companies subsidized any elder care benefits last year. And only 3 percent offered the emergency backup care -- subsidized or otherwise -- that experts say saves money by keeping workers at work.""The perception among companies is that they can't afford elder care benefits,"" said Frank Scanlan, a spokesman for the society.It is the largest companies that are the most generous, but even those often subscribe to the mistaken notion that the Mommy Track and the Daughter Track are the same, said Chris Gatti, president of the Work Options Group in Superior, Colo. Work Options, whose clients employ 400,000 people nationwide, provides in-home care for children and the elderly.""These benefits fall under the same umbrella but are fundamentally different,"" Mr. Gatti said. ""Child care programs are relatively straight-forward and easy to administer compared to elder care, which is a maze with lots of sharp corners and dark secluded places.""An individual supervisor can ease an employee's burden but still leave them vulnerable to management changes. Just 6 percent of employers have written policies about elder care, according to surveys by the Society for Human Resource Management, while 76 percent say they help employees on a case-by-case basis.For Ms. Goodman, the one godsend since her father died and her mother moved into her Boston apartment has been permission to work at home. But that is likely to change with a new boss. ""I'm walking on eggs right now,"" Ms. Goodman said.The distinctions between child care and elder care have become apparent as the first of the 77 million baby boomers turn 60 and their parents live past 85, joining the fastest-growing segment of the population.The most obvious is that children's schedules are predictable -- a school holiday next Monday -- while elderly parents' needs -- a trip to the emergency room -- are crisis-driven. Also, children are raised at home; an elderly parent often lives far away.Guiding the decisions of an elderly parent also requires mastery of arcane legal, financial and medical matters.""It's a new and very confusing skill set,"" said Maureen Corcoran, a vice president at Prudential Financial. ""You don't just give people a list; you lead them there. Otherwise they spend hours upon hours figuring it out themselves.""For both employees and employers, the costs of elder care are enormous, according to studies by the MetLife Mature Market Institute, which is in the midst of updated analysis to reflect rapidly changing demographics.The price tag for employers in 1997 ranged from $11.5 billion to $29 billion a year. Most expensive were the replacement of lost workers (at least $4.9 billion a year), workday interruptions ($3.7 billion) and absenteeism ($885 million). The employees lose salary, Social Security and pension benefits as a result of refusing promotions, switching to part-time work or retiring early.Certain benefits mitigate these costs, and certain companies have learned there is a clear return on investment. At Prudential, for instance, subsidized emergency backup care prevents absenteeism and workday interruptions. Prudential's 21,000 employees, with one phone call to Work Options Group, can get help for parents by the next morning, for a co-payment of $4 an hour.A $20-an-hour aide, on an eight-hour shift, would otherwise cost a Prudential employee $160, rather than $32. Yet the company says it will save $650,000 during a three-year contract with Work Options, Ms. Corcoran said, because ""if our employees needs are taken care of, they can focus on work.""Diane Yankencheck, a Prudential employee in Newark, said the service kept her working during a crisis. Her father has a degenerative neurological disease and round-the-clock care. Her mother manages the household, or did until she broke her wrist. Now an aide from Work Options cooks, cleans and helps her bathe and dress.Kent Burtis, a Verizon technician in Bayville, N.J., uses similar backup care for his father, who is paralyzed and incontinent. For a while, Mr. Burtis spent hours before work feeding, diapering and dressing him. Now an aide does the morning shift. ""It's kept me from slitting my throat,"" Mr. Burtis said.Elder care benefits most often seem a luxury at small companies and nonprofits. So even at AARP, dedicated to the needs of older Americans, Deborah Russell, the director of work force issues, was daunted by coordinating long-distance care for her mother and then missing weeks of work to be at her bedside when death neared.Ms. Russell and her two sisters, grateful for AARP's excellent referral service, still spent ""an inordinate amount of time on the telephone"" during working hours, distracted and unproductive. As their mother's condition deteriorated, and the siblings rotated weeks in Florida, Ms. Russell used paid vacation time rather than the 12 weeks of unpaid leave guaranteed by the federal Family Medical Leave Act or AARP's more generous 16-week program, also unpaid.Another benefit assumed to be useful is the flexible spending account, governed by the Internal Revenue Service and widely offered by companies. It permits the use of pretax dollars for dependent care, as long as the dependent meets the I.R.S. definition. Virtually all children do, but most aged parents do not. That means tax breaks for baby sitters but not companions for the elderly.Experts disagree about whether women will push employers for help with their parents, as they did 30 years ago when child care was their pressing issue.Ellen Galinsky, 63, president of the Family and Work Institute, led the charge for a day care center at Bank Street College when she was a researcher there in 1969. After ""huge resistance,"" the center opened in 1974. Ms. Galinsky predicts a similar awakening to elder care issues because ""demographics are destiny.""""Everyone I know is dealing with this,"" said Ms. Galinsky, who recently stayed at the bedside of her 98-year-old mother for the last two months of her life. The institute allows unlimited sick leave for such family emergencies. But even with that leeway, Ms. Galinsky said: ""I was on another planet. It's like no other experience. I barely have words for how hard it is.""Todd Groves, founder of LTC Financial Partners in Seattle, who advises human resource managers on long term care, is not convinced that women like Ms. Galinsky will have the same galvanizing effect this time around, regardless of their numbers or their passion.""Back then you still had a paternal business culture,"" Mr. Groves said. ""Now people feel out on their own. They are fearful about their careers and don't feel they can ask for help.""'"

Russo, would be able to sell the remaining unvested shares of restricted stock that Lucent gave her in 2002 if there is a change in control of the company, even if she remains.Unlike many other executive contracts, her deal with Lucent does not automatically let her sell the millions of restricted shares and options that she has been awarded in the four years since then, but that have not yet vested, according to the company and a compensation consultant who studied the contract.Ms. Russo had 3.84 million shares of Lucent, worth about $11.8 million, after selling about 200,000 shares in January, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. It is unclear from the filing how many of those shares she is restricted from selling today.The combined company after a merger could simply assume and convert the remaining restricted-stock awards into the stock of the new company.

"'06-03-25,'0','Although I'm hardly an opera buff, I had a new appreciation of the experience in general and ""Roméo et Juliette"" in particular, thanks to some long overdue research. According to a brief history compiled by a Kennedy Center affiliate called ArtsEdge, opera was invented in the late 16th century by a group of rich people in the city-state of Florence who wanted to reproduce ancient Greek dramas. The Italians began reading the plays aloud and adding musical accompaniment, a practice called recitativo.As opera's popularity spread to Germany, France, England, Russia, Spain and Portugal, composers began to include chorus parts, dances and highly complex songs called arias that allowed singers to express their emotions and show off their voices. But renowned 18th-century masters like Handel and Mozart continued to write operas in Italian because opera was still considered an Italian art form.Then in the 19th century along came Richard Wagner, who wrote long and lavish operas in his native German. Wagner felt that the operas of his day relied too heavily on music and lacked quality drama. He introduced a concept called Gesamtkunstwerk, which roughly translated as ""total artwork"" and referred to the notion of combining music, theater and the visual arts in a seamless whole. In 1876, Wagner unveiled his masterpiece, ""Der Ring des Nibelungen,"" a four-opera cycle which ran no less than 16 hours in performance.Charles-François Gounod, the composer of ""Roméo et Juliette,"" was a contemporary of Wagner's who was regarded as one of the leading opera maestros of his era. Born in Paris in 1818, Gounod began composing music at the precocious age of 12, only to find himself torn between religious studies and secular operas. After he entered and then quickly abandoned a Carmelite monastery, skeptics dubbed him ""the philandering monk.""As a lapsed Catholic, I figured Gounod was my kind of opera composer. His big breakthrough came in 1859 when he completed work on ""Faust,"" an opera loosely based on Goethe's famous play but written in French. In Gounod's version, the title character sells his soul to Mephistopheles in exchange for help in wooing the beautiful but unattainable Marguerite. ""Faust"" eventually became the most frequently performed opera at the Grand Opera house in Paris and a staple of repertory companies worldwide.Gounod's ""Roméo et Juliette"" was first performed at the Théâtre Lyrique in Paris in 1867. Although it never enjoyed the popularity of ""Faust,"" the opera won high praise from critics all over Europe. Three years later, following the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Gounod fled to England to conduct the Royal Choral Society. Married to the daughter of a famous French pianist, Gounod created a tabloid-style scandal when he commenced a romance with the wife of a British military officer. He eventually reconciled with his wife and returned to France, where he died in 1893.By that time, the Metropolitan Opera was celebrating its 10th season in a theater on Broadway and 39th Street. It opened at Lincoln Center in 1966. According to the organization's official history, ""In the company's early years, the management changed course several times, first performing everything in Italian (even ""Carmen"" and ""Lohengrin,""), then everything in German (even ""Aida"" and ""Faust""), before finally settling into a policy of performing most works in their original language -- with some notable exceptions.""When Alison and I took our seats in the third level Grand Tier, we discovered that ""Roméo et Juliette"" was not one of those notable exceptions. The entire opera was to be performed in French with the Parisian-born Bertrand de Billy conducting and the Mexican tenor Fernando de la Mora and the American soprano Maureen O'Flynn starring in the title roles. But the language barrier was easily bridged thanks to Met Titles, a system of individual computer screens mounted on railings at the back of each row of seats that translated the libretto into English.I must confess that I've enjoyed some of the most restful sleeps of my life in opera houses and symphony halls. There is just something about classical and orchestral music that makes each note a kind of lullaby to my untrained ears. As far as I was concerned, the railings at the Met Opera had an even more attractive feature than the computer screens. Their front sides were covered in soft red velvet, which made them surprisingly comfortable headrests.Now I don't mean to imply that the Met Opera's production of ""Roméo et Juliette"" was either soporific or boring. To the contrary, my spine tingled when Ms. O'Flynn cut loose with an Act One aria celebrating the freedom of youth. And Mr. de la Mora commanded my rapt attention when he approached his theatrical love at first sight to ask if his hand might touch hers, and later, when he apostrophized her as the sun, the purest and brightest star in the heavens.But for me the highlight of the evening came near the end of Act Three when Alison leaned over and gently put her head on my shoulder. The tenderly candid words that poured from her yawning mouth were enough to make this subway-riding Romeo fall in love with his Juliet all over again.""Bigger,"" she said with a weary sigh, ""can you write a story about getting tickets to the Rolling Stones next time? Or maybe Sting? Sting wrote an opera.""Minutes later, we left Lincoln Center and boarded the last bus back to Long Island. There were still two more acts in ""Roméo et Juliette,"" but we knew their tragic outcome all too well. Our 8-year-old son was scheduled to dance in his school talent show early the next morning, and that was one performance neither of us would miss if our lives depended on it.

"'06-03-25,'0','The star of ""Stay Alive"" is a cutting-edge video game, but the film still has hackneyed horror at its heart. And worse, it's not even the stylishly, wittily executed hackneyed horror of the ""Scream"" movies.The film, which opened yesterday, starts from a decent enough premise: a young video-game addict named Hutch (Jon Foster) realizes that a friend of his who was murdered had been beta-testing a game called Stay Alive when he died. Once he and some pals play the game a bit and a few more people die, he realizes that the game itself is doing the killing: when a player's character is knifed or run over or whatever, the same thing happens to the player.Some interesting movies have been built on the notion of people being sucked into or disgorged from electronic devices (""Pleasantville,"" ""Shocker""), but this isn't one of them. The writers, Matthew Peterman and William Brent Bell (Mr. Bell also directed), apparently thought that premise alone would carry the film, so they surrounded Mr. Foster with a generic bunch of buddies. His love interest (Samaire Armstrong) is so lazily constructed that you don't even realize she's a love interest until they smooch. Frankie Muniz, surprisingly uncomfortable-looking as a geek named Swink, convincingly makes the case that he should stay in ""Malcolm in the Middle"" for the rest of his life.And it turns out that interactive video games kill off a group of young people the same way that B-grade horror movies always have: by having them separate for no apparent reason.""Stay Alive"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

"'06-03-25,'0','We don't generally approve of holding nominations hostage to other political objectives. But Senators Hillary Clinton and Patty Murray surely have good cause to block a vote on the nomination of Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach to become commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration until the agency makes a final decision on the morning-after pill. There is no excuse for the administration's endless obfuscation and delays on making the pill available without a prescription when the overwhelming bulk of expert opinion says it is safe to do so. The pill must be taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, preferably within 24 hours, leaving little time to visit a doctor to get a prescription.The two senators, both Democrats, have good reason to feel betrayed. When they threatened last year to hold up the confirmation of a previous commissioner until a decision on the pill was made, they ultimately relented because of a written assurance from Michael Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, who said the F.D.A. would act on the issue by Sept. 1. Sadly, Mr. Leavitt was misinformed by the agency, overruled by the White House or deliberately deceptive with the senators. The only action the agency took in September was to defer a decision indefinitely.The case for approving the use of the pill without a prescription has become even stronger in recent months. Evidence has emerged that high officials at the agency overruled their professional staff and ignored expert advisory committees when they rejected the application. Moreover, the agency's claim that it needed more time to consider ""novel"" issues raised by a proposal to require prescriptions for young teenagers was belied by internal documents revealing that the issues had been discussed for some time but not analyzed aggressively. The logical inference is that the result was dictated by politics -- by a desire to placate religious and social conservatives who consider the pill an invitation to promiscuity and an abortifacient.Should this nomination ultimately go forward, senators will still need to assess the qualifications of Dr. von Eschenbach, who has been acting commissioner since last September. He is a respected surgeon and was president-elect of the American Cancer Society. But his record as director of the National Cancer Institute, a post he holds even as he runs the F.D.A., gets mixed reviews.His goal to eliminate death and suffering from cancer by 2015 is deemed visionary by some, but wildly unrealistic by others. His desire to bring medicines to market more quickly and more cheaply wins plaudits from the drug industry and some patient advocates, but criticism from consumer advocates who worry that safety will be undermined.There is little likelihood that the Senate will reject Dr. von Eschenbach's nomination in a floor vote, although the senators could at least push him for guarantees that safety issues will not be submerged in the rush to approve new drugs and conquer cancer. But the vote should not take place until the F.D.A. has the spine to tackle the morning-after pill head-on.'"
"'06-03-26,'0','But the Red Sox didn't let the Renteria experience dissuade them from signing or trading for National League players on a wholesale basis. They traded for Mike Lowell to play third base, Mark Loretta to play second, Josh Beckett to be their No. 2 starter and Wily Mo Peña to play a share of right field. They signed J. T. Snow to play a share of first base, Alex Gonzalez to play shortstop and Julian Tavarez to help in the bullpen.The Red Sox are a statistically minded team, so they presumably did their homework on the success/failure ratio of players changing leagues. With the aid of the Elias Sports Bureau, we did ours.Using moves of players in the past five years, based on certain minimum playing criteria, Elias found 68 position players and 32 pitchers who changed leagues after having played at least the previous five seasons in the other league. Of the 68 players, only 25 hit for a higher batting average in their first year in the new league.Of those 25, and of particular interest to the Red Sox, was Bill Mueller. In 2003, he played third base for Boston and won the American League batting championship with a .326 average, a considerable improvement over his .262 average in the National League the year before.Of the 32 pitchers, 18 lowered their earned run averages in their first year in the new league. ""It's a small sample,"" Steve Hirdt, the executive vice president for Elias, said, ""but it suggests that what baseball people say is true, that the first time a batter sees a pitcher, it's to the pitcher's advantage.""The identity of the new pitchers didn't affect some hitters. In their transition years, Carlos Delgado batted .301 with 33 home runs and 115 runs batted in, Vladimir Guerrero went .337, 39 and 126, and Bret Boone .331, 37 and 141.Jim Thome's batting average fell to .266, from .304, but his R.B.I. total rose to 131, from 118. Carlos Lee's average dropped to .265, from .305, but his R.B.I. rose to 114, from 99. Mark Kotsay's average went up to .314, from .266. Randy Winn, who was traded to San Francisco from Seattle on July 30, batted .275 for the Mariners and .359 for the Giants.Other hitters, though, had trouble. Adrian Beltre went from a career year of .334, 48 and 121 with Los Angeles to .255, 19 and 87 with Seattle; Jason Kendall's average plummeted to .271, from .319; Steve Finley's to .222, from .271; Tony Womack's to .249, from .307; and Gary Sheffield's to .290, from .330, although he drove in 121 runs, a slip of only 11.One of the biggest drop-offs was Roberto Alomar's in 2002, when he batted .266 with 53 R.B.I. for the Mets a year after hitting .336 with 100 R.B.I. for Cleveland.Some examples of earned run averages: Jeff Weaver, 4.01 from 5.99; Roger Clemens, 2.98 from 3.91; Kevin Millwood, 2.86 from 4.85; Mark Mulder, 3.64 from 4.43; Javier Vazquez, 4.91 from 3.24; Matt Clement, 4.57 from 3.68; and Tim Hudson, 3.52 from 3.53.Some league switchers to watch this season, besides the Boston contingent: Adam Eaton and Vicente Padilla (Texas); Kris Benson (Baltimore); A. J. Burnett (Toronto); Luis Castillo; (Minnesota); Aaron Rowand and Tom Gordon (Philadelphia); Jacques Jones (Chicago Cubs); Alfonso Soriano (Washington); and Bronson Arroyo (Cincinnati).At some point during spring training, Mark Shapiro said, ""People stopped asking, 'Why did you trade Coco Crisp?' and started asking, 'Was Marte going to make the team?' ""Shapiro, the Cleveland Indians' general manager, welcomed the change, but he wasn't surprised that the focus of the fans had changed. Andy Marte, the Indians' future third baseman, can do that.Marte, a highly prized 22-year-old prospect, had a busy winter. Atlanta traded him to Boston for Edgar Renteria, the shortstop they needed to replace Rafael Furcal. The Red Sox then sent him to Cleveland for Crisp, whom they needed to replace Johnny Damon in center field.The Indians were committed to Aaron Boone at third base, but only for a year. Before being officially sent to the minor leagues Friday, Marte played in 15 exhibition games and compiled a .359 batting average (14 for 39), a .590 slugging percentage and a .381 on-base percentage. He drove in nine runs and had seven extra-base hits.""He's part of our core here, and he knows that what he has done this spring is an exclamation point on why we traded for him,"" Shapiro said. ""We found out more than statistics about him this spring. He fits with our team, he's a good teammate and he has a good professional approach for a young player.""On June 20 last season, Colorado first baseman Todd Helton, a .339 career hitter, was hitting .250. Then his aching back improved and the real Helton re-emerged. From that point, he hit .381 and finished at a still-respectable .320. He capped his comeback with a .444 (28 for 63) flourish in his last 18 games.Juan Pierre, a .312 career hitter, also struggled early, with a calf injury, but he wasn't able to surge as significantly as Helton did and finished at .276.""He told me he didn't play in spring training at all last year,"" said Dusty Baker, the manager of Pierre's new team, the Chicago Cubs. ""I played two years where I had no spring training. You're operating from behind from the very beginning. I asked Juan was it like it was for me, where everybody looked like they were throwing a thousand miles an hour. He said pretty close to that.""Baker said the season might have been a bad one for Pierre, but added: ""A lot of people would take the year he had. Every year is not a great year. No matter what, I'm sure he won't take it, but what he did last year is better than what we've had here in the leadoff spot since Kenny Lofton.""Baker referred to 2003, when the Cubs won the National League Central title, acquiring Lofton shortly after midseason. ""I'm very confident,"" Baker said of his expectations. ""I'm glad to have him, big time.""The Cubs obtained Pierre for three pitchers; only one of them, Sergio Mitre, has had major league experience, and not much. The view suggested here was that the Yankees, before signing Johnny Damon to play center field, should have pursued Pierre. It turns out that they did, but the Marlins insisted on Robinson Cano in return.Barry Bonds can sue anyone he wants, as his lawyers have indicated he has, over published accusations of steroid use, but there are no intentional walks in court. On the witness stand, Bonds's responses under oath would be severely scrutinized by the government, the public and the news media. His testimony would be better theater and sport than his pursuit of Babe Ruth and Henry Aaron.'"
"'06-03-26,'0','At the heart of Biovail's racketeering lawsuit, filed last month in New Jersey Superior Court in Newark, is an audacious claim: that some of the nation's biggest hedge funds colluded with independent research firms and analysts at big banks to produce purposely misleading research with the sole object of driving down a company's stock price. Hedge funds do so, the suit contends, to profit from their huge short positions on these companies, essentially bets that the stocks will drop.SAC, Bank of America and Gradient vehemently deny the accusations. Carr Bettis, a founder of Gradient, says the lawsuit reads like a ""fiction novel,"" and his business partner and co-founder, Donn W. Vickrey, says the conference call that Mr. Smith cites never took place. Mr. Vickrey further said that the practices alleged by Mr. Smith did not occur.Daniel J. Kramer, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison who represents SAC, says Biovail's allegations of manipulation are ""false and implausible."" He adds that the company's stock dropped in 2003 because of its publicly disclosed earnings disappointments and regulatory problems, not because of any supposed conspiracy.Biovail's lawsuit does have a familiar plot line: it aims at analysts who write negative research -- something that regulators have tried to encourage, because too-positive research has historically been a problem.The suit also takes aim at some familiar targets. Whenever companies are in trouble or there is panic in the market -- from the bursting of the South Sea bubble in London in 1720 to the plunge in markets after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks -- critics are often quick to vilify short-sellers as market manipulators. Recently, companies have even hired public-relations firms to spread the contentions.In a short sale, an investor borrows shares and then sells them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price before having to return them, and aiming to profit from the difference. If buying a stock -- going long -- represents faith in the future of a company, then going short signals skepticism about those prospects. Short-sellers recognized Enron's problems long before investigators issued any subpoenas.""Short-selling makes the market more efficient and more liquid,"" said Owen A. Lamont, a professor of finance at the Yale School of Management who has studied short-selling. ""It helps get the opinions of the pessimists into the market so that prices can be more accurate.""Biovail's chief executive, the Canadian billionaire Eugene N. Melnyk, says that the suit is not about short-selling. ""We are talking about misinformation put into the marketplace,"" he said. (Mr. Melnyk has sued a short-seller in the past.)The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating some of the allegations made by Biovail and Overstock.com, which has filed a similar lawsuit against short-sellers and analysts. At the same time, the S.E.C. is investigating Biovail for its own accounting practices, one further twist in a knot of a case.Surrounding these claims about short-selling and market manipulation is an anxiety about the growing power of hedge funds. These funds, private investment pools for institutions and the wealthy, have increased sharply in number, size and effect on the market: according to New York Stock Exchange officials, they constitute from one-quarter to one-half of all trading on that exchange every day.Hedge funds operate with a fair amount of secrecy, which naturally shrouds them in mystery and, often, suspicion. Combine that with the veiled practice of shorting and the devaluation of stock research since the market collapse, and it becomes a recipe for concern -- if not paranoia.Setting aside rhetoric about free speech and accusations of intimidation and retaliation, a simple question emerges: Are independent analysts and sell-side research firms determining the content of the research, or is that content being controlled by the hedge funds who make money from it?If the Biovail lawsuit can show that hedge funds are persuading analysts to come to predetermined conclusions and then asking that the reports be held so they can make low-risk bets that stocks will fall on the negative news, then the case will open another ugly chapter of corruption and greed on Wall Street. If not, Biovail is another company resorting to lawsuits to silence its critics.""Experience tells me that a lot of short-sellers, if not most, are totally legitimate,"" said Arthur Levitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""But occasionally there is manipulation going on, and any device which manipulates the market in favor of insiders is bad for the investing public.""BIOVAIL is an unusual pharmaceutical company, and Mr. Melnyk, its founder, is an unlikely pharmaceutical executive. For one thing, he is not a scientist, or even a college graduate. The son of Ukranian immigrants, Mr. Melnyk worked in specialty advertising before starting his own company, the Trimel Corporation, a publishing business focused on summarizing clinical research and making it digestible for doctors. In 1989, he sold the company to the Thomson Corporation for $8 million and used the proceeds to buy shares of Biovail. By 1992, he controlled the company.Based in Mississauga, Ontario, Biovail does not develop its own drugs. Instead, it produces generic versions or produces its own time-released versions of others' drugs, like an extended release version of Wellbutrin, which was developed by Merck. It is a lucrative niche. Biovail's revenue soared to $788 million in 2002 from $112 million in 1998; over that period, its profit more than sextupled, to $280 million from $45 million.With the company's success came personal success. Today Mr. Melnyk owns the Ottawa Senators professional ice hockey franchise, hundreds of thoroughbred horses and homes in New York, Toronto and Barbados, where he spends about a third of his time.In early 2003, Biovail was positioned for a transformational year: it planned to introduce two potential blockbuster drugs, Cardizem LA, a once-daily dosage to treat blood pressure, and Wellbutrin XL, an extended-release version of the antidepressant. Wall Street analysts rated the company a buy and gave aggressive price targets and optimistic projections based on the predicted success of the new drugs.During the summer, Biovail's stock, which had edged toward $50 in early June, started to fall. Mr. Melnyk said that at the time, he couldn't pinpoint what was driving it, but he received odd calls from major investors questioning the company's accounting. In mid-July, within days of each other, Barron's and The Wall Street Journal ran articles suggesting that doctors were being paid, potentially improperly, to prescribe Wellbutrin XL.While the news articles knocked down the stock price slightly, the shares really tumbled -- falling 10 percent in a day -- when the company announced a disappointing quarter a week later.EARLIER that summer, Mr. Smith says Gradient got a call from a powerful hedge fund in New York asking if it would consider expanding its research on Biovail. Gradient agreed, and on June 10 produced a ""client position analysis"" for SAC Capital, Mr. Smith said, identifying a number of accounting concerns. Ten days later, Gradient published another report, almost identical in content, giving Biovail an ""F.""Biovail's lawsuit contends that these reports, in conjunction with later research by David Maris, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, slowly eroded Biovail's reputation in the marketplace, weakening the stock's ability to recover from market disappointments.Even straightforward things related to Biovail result in virulent debate. A case in point was a truck accident that killed eight people and destroyed a shipment of Wellbutrin XL in October 2003. Biovail held a conference call two days after the crash to say it would miss its revenue and profit targets that quarter for three reasons, including the accident, which itself could shave up to $20 million of revenue. The stock fell 18 percent.A few days later, Mr. Maris initiated coverage of Biovail with a sell recommendation, echoing many of the concerns in the Gradient reports and appearing to accuse the company of lying about the volume of product lost in the accident. He said photographs of the crash appeared to show that there was nothing in at least one of the trucks. Mr. Maris's report sent Biovail's stock reeling an additional 14 percent.When Biovail confirmed that $7 million in revenue had been lost, both sides claimed victory, Mr. Maris for his questioning of the original estimate and Mr. Melnyk for making conservative estimates with the information he had. In the end, Biovail's third-quarter earnings were lower even than its lowered predictions.Mr. Maris declined to be interviewed for this article, but his employer was unequivocal in its support of him. ""Bank of America wholeheartedly supports David Maris and has the highest degree of confidence in the objectivity and integrity of his research,"" said Timothy Gilles, a bank spokesman.Today, Biovail remains under a cloud. The S.E.C. is investigating its accounting; the Ontario Securities Commission is investigating suspicious trading activity. Mr. Melnyk sold three million shares in 2003 -- when short-sellers were driving down his stock -- due to a margin call.Biovail's stock price has recovered to $25 from a low of $14, but it remains far below the $50 where it once traded; its market capitalization, at $4 billion, is half what it once was. Is that because it failed to execute on its promises or because SAC, in concert with Mr. Maris and Gradient, produced research with the input and knowledge of important trading clients to drive down the stock?The question will be answered in court, but an independent accountant, with no current ties to any of the parties involved, confirmed that 2003 was an unusually tough year for Biovail, both from operational and accounting standpoints.""Heading into 2003, repeated product losses indicate that many of the drugs the company had purchased were not finding their hoped-for market,"" said Charles W. Mulford, a professor of accounting at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ""Such problems were manifesting as slowing revenue growth, declining operating profit, negative free cash flow and rising debt levels. I think that there were definite reasons to be concerned.""IN filing its lawsuit, Biovail did not take on just any hedge fund: it challenged SAC Capital, an $8 billion behemoth run by Stephen A. Cohen and shrouded in more mystery and intrigue than almost any other big Wall Street firm.The hedge fund is considered one of the most powerful on the Street because it is wildly successful and because its aggressive focus on rapid, short-term trading means that it doles out hundreds of millions of dollars in commissions. Money means access on Wall Street, so Mr. Cohen is often first in line for the best information, which is the most valuable commodity in the trading world.In its suit, Biovail says that SAC was a leading force hammering its stock in 2003, aided by other hedge funds, Gradient and Mr. Maris.Mr. Bettis and Mr. Vickrey founded their research firm in 1996, attracting clients with their quantitative or mathematical models. In 2002, the company, then called Camelback Research Alliance, started to write research reports, called ""earnings quality analytics,"" which it offered to clients for a subscription fee.Camelback's own quantitative models determined about 95 percent of the companies it would cover, Mr. Vickrey said. In 2003, however, it also allowed clients to request coverage of stocks, a practice it has ended.While the firm's client list reads like a Who's Who of successful hedge funds, Mr. Bettis is emphatic that the firm, which changed its name to Gradient in 2004, does not move markets -- making the allegation of market manipulation impossible.From the time the firm issued its first report on Biovail in March 2003, when it rated the company a ""D,"" to its more substantive report in June that year, the stock rose 43 percent. Biovail's stock inched down 0.07 percent after Gradient issued the June report with an ""F,"" the firm's lowest rating, but then the stock rose for two consecutive weeks.Biovail's allegations of conspiracy rest on the recollections of Mr. Smith, Mr. Ballash and two other former Gradient employees. None of the four quit over their concerns about SAC's influence over the firm: three were fired and the fourth, Mark Rosenblum, left for another job that he secured with the help of a recommendation from Gradient. All but Mr. Rosenblum are cooperating in the Overstock.com suit, which also names Gradient as a defendant.Mr. Smith, a former account executive at the Principal Financial Group who joined Camelback in 2002, said he got a lead in June 2003 from Timothy McCarthy, an analyst at SAC HealthCo, the healthcare unit of SAC, who was interested in research on Biovail.A conference call to discuss the drug maker ""turned into a one-way download from Tim about funny accounting"" at Biovail, Mr. Smith said. Gradient's ""client position analysis"" of June 10, 2003, contained ""everything Tim was talking about on the call,"" he added.Mr. Vickrey denies that he and Mr. Smith were ever on a call together with Mr. McCarthy, and both Mr. Bettis and Mr. Vickrey deny that their firm's research was delayed for any client or concocted with any predetermined outcome. Susan Brune, a lawyer for Mr. McCarthy, said: ""The allegations as they relate to Mr. McCarthy are simply wrong.""Mr. Vickrey acknowledged that he and his analysts would engage in conversations with clients about issues in reports, and he conceded that ""there were times when they could have seen drafts of the reports."" But, he added, ""there has never been a case when a client has had influence on the direction of a report.""Mr. Rosenblum tells a different story, based on a personal meeting he says he had with Mr. McCarthy in New York. Mr. Rosenblum said that he and Scott Vorhauer, Gradient's head of products and operations, discussed with Mr. McCarthy stocks that SAC HealthCo would be interested in seeing Gradient cover.""In no unclear terms, McCarthy set the ground rules"" about how the research would be done, Mr. Rosenblum said, echoing claims in the lawsuit. "" 'We'll provide you information. We'll decide when we want you to release the report and who to release it to.' I am 110 percent convinced in my mind that the relationship with SAC HealthCo and Camelback was improper.""Mr. Vorhauer denies that Mr. McCarthy provided specific information about a company or told him when to release reports. ""If he had, I would never have agreed to it,"" he said.Mr. Rosenblum did not question the activities he saw at Gradient at the time. ""I wish I did,"" he said. He added that he left Gradient -- on amicable terms -- because he did not have success selling its research, and said that he had remained on friendly terms with the principals at Gradient since his departure.His decision to cooperate was not easy, he says; he did it because he was tired of watching his former colleagues getting ""dragged through the mud"" for speaking up, he said. ""Have I jeopardized my job? Maybe,"" Mr. Rosenblum said. ""Have I jeopardized my career in the securities industry? Maybe. Have I financially benefited from this? No.""It was the right thing to do,"" he added of his decision to testify against his former employers. ""I only hurt myself.""Correction: April 2, 2006, Sunday Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about a lawsuit contending that a hedge fund colluded with a research firm to spread false information to drive down the stock price of Biovail, a drug maker, misidentified the company that developed Wellbutrin, a depression treatment that Biovail produces in extended-release form. It was GlaxoSmithKline, not Merck. The article also misidentified the drug that was the subject of articles in Barron's and The Wall Street Journal suggesting that doctors were being paid, potentially improperly, to prescribe it. It was Cardizem LA, a blood-pressure medication, not Wellbutrin XL.'"

""We're like kids in candy stores,"" Mr. Snyder said. ""There's just an endless variety, and you could really take that and put it into every aspect of what we do.""For many, SoHo is a shopping nirvana. Bloomingdale's arrived last year, and it would be hard to find a major designer or upscale retail outlet that hasn't.Prince and Spring Streets, running east to west, and West Broadway, from north to south, the area's most established fashion streets, are to SoHo what Via Condotti is to Rome, or Madison Avenue to the Upper East Side.Yet while streets surrounding these upmarket standbys host some haute couture spillover, the comparative quiet of cast-iron-heavy byways like Greene and Wooster suggest there is more than one SoHo, especially in its southern reaches. And though it is a small neighborhood, wedged between Houston and Canal Streets to the north and south, SoHo offers a surprising variety of housing styles for people who are not as excited about loft spaces as the real estate world is.West of West Broadway, for example, the neighborhood still retains a few tenement buildings, offering smaller (and somewhat cheaper) spaces. In this section, among streets like Thompson and Macdougal, known to some as the Italian South Village, one can still find old Italian standbys like the Vesuvio Bakery, serving up sesame loaves and perfectly crisp breadsticks since 1920.""If you want SoHo, you have it right around the corner,"" said Deborah R.

""But you don't have that chaos if you don't want it.""Elsewhere, there is the rare town house -- one on Thompson Street is on the market for $5 million -- and for those who favor new construction, several new projects are completed or under way. Among them are One Kenmare Square, which opened last fall on Lafayette Street, and 40 Mercer Street, a block-wide glass-and-steel tower now rising as students in chef's outfits loiter across Broadway outside the French Culinary Institute.Some buildings in SoHo are governed by the city's artist-in-residence laws, which require occupants to be registered with the Department of Cultural Affairs as working creative artists.Yet several brokers acknowledged that many buildings do not enforce the regulations, choosing to make individual agreements with new tenants. One also gets the sense that the city is not paying much attention; on its application form for certification as an artist, the preprinted date is 199X.SoHo is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in New York City, though as there are few genuinely raw loft spaces left for developers to renovate -- and market at a premium -- prices may be evening out somewhat.""They're stabilizing,"" said Mary Rolland, a broker with Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy and a neighborhood resident since 1980. ""At one point one loft could be priced as another one, but they wouldn't be equal in value as far as condition. They could both sell. And that's not happening anymore.""Yet stable prices in SoHo still mean that apartments under $1 million are extremely rare; anything around that price seems to sell in seconds and is usually in need of renovation. Few fixer-uppers remain, and for space at around $1,000 a square foot, buyers are turning to smaller apartments on low floors in prime shopping areas or to the quieter streets west of West Broadway. A 457-square-foot one-bedroom co-op on Sullivan Street is currently on the market at $470,000.Ms. Wires of Stribling recently sold a 4,400-square-foot loft at 158 Mercer Street, a doorman building, for $6.25 million. At the recently constructed 7 Wooster Street, a 2,000-square-foot loft that went for $2 million in 2005 would probably now go for $2.5 million, Ms. Wires said.Martin Eiden, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman, currently lists a 3,287-square-foot apartment on the second floor of a building on West Broadway. The apartment, which is in need of renovation, is on the market for $2.995 million.And 40 Mercer Street, the new glass tower from the developer André Balazs, is nearly sold out, said Susan Singer, a vice president of the Corcoran Group, adding that only 25 percent of new residents are New Yorkers. Prices for remaining units start at $2.65 million for a two-bedroom and go up to $12.95 million for a four-bedroom duplex.Rental rates vary widely, though it is difficult to find anything under $2,000 a month, except perhaps for a studio on less glitzy streets; one- and two-bedrooms are more likely to approach $3,000 and beyond.What to DoIf you need a wardrobe for your visit to Milan or jeans costing somewhere in the high three digits, SoHo is certainly the place to be. But residents find the everyday things they need, too, with a few upscale food markets, dry cleaners, drugstores and the like. ""In fact, you can survive,"" said Ms. Singer of Corcoran, who used to live in the area.SoHo still retains more than a few art galleries, for browsing when one tires of shopping. Off Broadway shows are on offer at the SoHo Playhouse on Vandam Street. Restaurants abound, and the nearest cinema is the Angelika Film Center on West Houston Street. For the growing number of families in SoHo, there is the Children's Museum of the Arts on Lafayette Street.SoHo lacks public schools. Some local children are zoned for Public School 3 on Hudson Street, where in English Language Arts 75.8 percent of students met standards on city and state tests in 2004 versus 48.1 percent citywide. In math, 75.4 percent of students met standards, with 55 percent doing so citywide.SoHo middle schoolers are zoned for Simon Baruch Middle School on East 21st Street, where 56 percent of students met standards in English and 67.4 percent did so in math, versus 35.5 and 38.9 percent citywide, respectively.At the nearest high school, the Chelsea Career and Technical Education High School, the average SAT verbal score in 2003-2004, the latest score available, was 413, and the average math score was 450, compared with 497 and 510 statewide, respectively.Many local parents choose private schools, including the City & Country School on West 13th Street for children ages 2-13, and the Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School on Bleecker Street.SoHo is served by several subway lines, including the C and E trains at Spring Street and Avenue of the Americas, the 6 train at Spring and Lafayette Streets and the R and W trains at Prince Street and Broadway. All offer brief commutes both to the Financial District and Midtown Manhattan.SoHo was one of New York's first neighborhoods to be re-enlivened by artists, who began taking residence in the area's decrepit and defunct manufacturing and warehouse lofts in the 1960's. The culture the artists developed had begun morphing into today's fashionable mix by the 1980's, memorably depicted in the film ""9 1/2 Weeks."" Yet the prior life of SoHo was that of a pulsating manufacturing center through the end of the 19th century, with confident businessmen opting for glorious cast iron on their buildings. Before that era, SoHo was largely residential, with regal town houses occupied by the wealthy replacing the hilly fields that came before.What We LikeWith vocal and well-organized residents ever vigilant about SoHo's buildings, their overall grandeur is sure to stay intact, despite the onslaught of ground-floor retailing.As high-end commerce continues to amass in SoHo, so do the crowds and traffic, making it difficult for some residents on the livelier avenues to get to their front doors. Without common open areas, the afternoon SoHo crush can be difficult to navigate.'"
"'06-03-26,'0','Richard G. Frank, a health economist with a specialty in mental health issues who is a professor at Harvard, said: ""Clearly, the earnings of mental health professionals -- medical doctors, psychologists, social workers and counselors -- have either been flat or been declining for the past five to eight years.""""It's not so much the number of visits allowed by managed care to mental health professionals has changed,"" he said. ""It's that fees paid to the mental health professionals have not been rising.""Mr. Frank, who is the co-author of ""Better but Not Well"" (Johns Hopkins Press, 2006), which examines United States mental health policies, cites efforts by insurance companies to keep costs down as well as changing treatment patterns, including the increasing use of drugs, rather than psychological therapy, to treat mental ailments.Ms. Hinterman, too, observed that patients found prescription medicines a quicker fix than ""prolonged and thorough introspection.""""We just live in a culture that values speed and efficiency and wants to see complex problems resolved in half an hour,"" she said. Given those changes, she no longer wants to rely on the profession she trained for as her sole source of income.An experienced seamstress, in January 2004 she started Fiber Embellishments, a company that makes scarves, table linens, chefs' aprons and one-of-a-kind bags made of boiled wool; local retailers are already selling her goods.Ms. Hinterman's concerns about earning a livelihood as a mental health professional are not isolated.""A lot of people have taken a hit, there's no doubt about it,"" said Dava Weinstein, a licensed clinical social worker in private practice in Manhattan, who also teaches in the social work programs at Columbia University and Hunter College.She also volunteers on a committee that deals with reimbursement issues for clinical social workers at the New York City chapter of the National Association of Social Workers. ""Some members have told me, 'I don't know how I'm going to pay my mortgage' and that they're struggling to pay bills,"" she said.Among the top complaints from social workers about health insurers and the managed care industry are reduced fees, late payments and ""inappropriate assessment of the needs of patients.""Although the colleagues he has spoken with may not be leaving the profession yet, Paul C. Berman, a licensed psychologist in Baltimore who serves as professional affairs officer for Maryland's psychological association, said there were ""lots of gripes.""Many psychologists in private practice, he said, have said their fees have been reduced year after year, requiring them to work many more hours to maintain the same income.Mr. Berman said that when he went into private practice in 1990, participating in the provider networks of various health insurance companies, his maximum allowable hourly billing rate was $95, with about half of that paid by the insurance company and the rest by the patient. Today, he said, rates have plummeted to the point that the usual total reimbursement for psychologists is $65 to $75 an hour.This drop has forced many practitioners to nearly double their client load simply to maintain their income, he said. Not only are lower fees problematic, but there is also the issue of not being paid quickly by managed care companies, and often having to resubmit claims. The time required to complete paperwork is, of course, not billable.What Mr. Berman, who is no longer part of any insurance company's provider network, has done -- and what he encourages other psychologists and behavioral health care providers to consider -- is to diversify the practice.He now sees only a handful of therapy clients a week, at $95 for a 50-minute session, and earns his living predominantly ""outside the insurance reimbursement world,"" evaluating people on behalf of social service agencies, lawyers or the courts seeking expert opinions on mental fitness or in matters like custody hearings.Lynne Spevack, a licensed clinical social worker in full-time private practice in the Wall Street area and in Brooklyn, also advises her colleagues to be active in making changes.She consults with other social workers on how to expand their practices and leads monthly meetings for the New York City chapter of the social workers' association on topics like practice-building and marketing. Among her suggestions to colleagues is taking speaking engagements to raise one's profile.Ms. Spevack said that even if the practitioner lowered the fee for someone paying out of pocket, the negotiated fee could still be higher than a managed care company would allow, and the practitioner would be ""free of the invasion of managed care, paperwork and other administrative burdens,"" she said.""We can learn to ethically sell ourselves. It's a skill set. There are no reasons people need to be leaving the profession.""Mr. Berman says he also sees more of his colleagues revamping how they work, often displaying an array of feelings ""similar to any life change,"" he said.""First, many practitioners thought managed care would die. ""Then there was outrage. Then resignation. Then they felt overwhelmed. Where we are now is taking a proactive stance so we can meet the needs of the changing marketplace and survive financially and professionally.""'"
"'06-03-26,'0','A grand jury in Brooklyn has accused a retired F.B.I. agent of helping a Mafia killer and bureau informant murder or help murder at least three people, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the indictment confirmed yesterday.The murder indictment in Supreme Court names R. Lindley DeVecchio, a career investigator and onetime head of the bureau's Colombo and Bonanno families squads. He led a government surveillance team during a bloody mob civil war in the 1980's. That war left at least 10 men dead and 14 wounded.Mr. DeVecchio, 65, reached yesterday by telephone at his home in Sarasota, Fla., denied any wrongdoing and referred all further questions to his lawyer, Douglas Grover, who said the district attorney's case against his client was ""complete nonsense.""""I'm going to bang the table"" in court on Monday ""and get a copy of the indictment,"" he said. Mr. Grover, a former federal prosecutor with the Organized Crime Task Force, added: ""It's common for an indictment to be filed and sealed and kept secret until prosecutors make a decision as to how they want to deal with the arraignment. But it's uncommon to leak it to the press.""Starting in 1982, Mr. DeVecchio began grooming Gregory Scarpa Sr., a captain and an assassin for the Colombo crime family, as a mole for the F.B.I.'"
"'06-03-26,'0','For years, workers like Mr. Kumaran have done whatever they could to get here, often paying thousands of dollars to unscrupulous recruiters for the chance to work at one of the hundreds of construction sites in the emirates.Of the 1.5 million residents of Dubai, as many as a million are immigrants who have come here to work in some capacity, with the largest subgroup being construction workers, said Hadi Ghaemi, a researcher with Human Rights Watch who covers the United Arab Emirates, citing government statistics. The vast majority of the immigrants come from the Indian subcontinent and the Philippines.With the cost of living rising, many have abandoned dreams of returning with a fortune. The construction workers' camps, in particular, have been set up ever deeper in the desert. That adds an hour or two just to get to the job site every morning, in addition to the workers' 12-hour shifts.A growing number have resorted to suicide rather than return home with empty pockets: last year, 84 South Asians committed suicide in Dubai, according to the Indian Consulate here, up from 70 in 2004.Mr. Kumaran, who earns 550 dirhams every month, or about $150, as a laborer, sends home almost half his earnings and lives on the equivalent of roughly $60 a month. That is barely enough to pay for food and cigarettes and using his cellphone from time to time. But he is not sure how he will repay the loan he took to get here.""If I'd stayed in India and worked just as hard as I do now, I could have made the same money,"" he said. ""And I wouldn't have needed to get a loan to come here.""Since last September, when 800 workers staged a protest march down a main highway in the heart of the city and set off a national debate about the treatment of foreign workers, laborers have held at least eight major strikes to demand their rights and get their pay, which is sometimes withheld.But the mass action on Tuesday was the most significant of its kind. Hundreds of workers building the Burj Dubai skyscraper chased security guards and broke into offices, smashing computers, scattering files and wrecking cars and construction machines. When they returned to work the next day, demanding better pay and improved working conditions, thousands of laborers building an airport terminal across town also laid down their tools, demanding better conditions, too. The workers also halted work on Thursday, until a settlement was negotiated.""It was a watershed moment in coordination and organization,"" Mr. Ghaemi said. ""It started with increasing numbers of strikes, and has now evolved into very organized and coordinated activities. If these grievances are not addressed quickly by the government they are sure to begin hurting the economic growth of the country.""Those workers have few rights. Visa sponsors and employers typically confiscate their passports and residency permits when they sign on, restricting their freedom of movement and their ability to report abuse.Most pay money to recruiters to find work here, a practice that the U.A.E. government has sought to stop. When they get here, few can leave the country without the permission of their employers, who can block them from working elsewhere in the country if they resign or are fired.Unionizing is forbidden, too, and most workers have no recourse other than the Labor Ministry.Denial of wages is the most common abuse of workers, as contracting companies typically wait to pay their workers until they themselves get paid. In the worst cases, workers have been denied wages for more than 10 months, only to lose the entire salary when the contracting companies go bankrupt, leaving the men destitute and with few options.The U.A.E.'s Ministry of Labor has tried to tackle the problem in recent months, making changes meant to allow workers to change employers more easily and imposing strict penalties on employers that do not pay their workers.Workers can call a toll-free hot line to the ministry to lodge complaints, which are investigated. And ministry inspectors do travel to work camps to inspect them.""We always support the workers and want to protect their rights, but we must protect employers' rights as well,"" said Ali al-Kaabi, the labor minister in the U.A.E. ""As long as these three factors are in place, the workers have no reason to protest. If they have any problems or complaints they should speak with a supervisor, who should come to the ministry. Then if we don't act they have the right to protest.""But the sheer number of workers who have poured into the country over the past two years and inadequate staffing at the ministry have meant that many problems slip through, some officials and human rights workers say.Only 80 government inspectors oversee about 200,000 companies and other establishments that employ migrant workers, Mr. Ghaemi said, citing government figures. The inspectors also look at labor camps: of the 36 camps inspected from May through December last year, the ministry ranked 27 well below government standards.""There's such a boom and so many laborers required here that the government is bringing measures which are not entirely adequate,"" said B. S. Mubarak, labor and welfare consul at the Consulate General of India in Dubai. ""Neither we nor the ministry can cope with the growing number of laborers and growing number of complaints.""As he boards a bus to his construction site every morning but Friday, Mr. Kumaran says he looks up at Dubai's skyline of gleaming high rises with a degree of sadness.""I wish the rich people would realize who is building these towers,"" Mr. Kumaran said, flanked by his co-workers. ""I wish they could come and see how sad this life is.""Correction: April 7, 2006, Friday An article on March 26 about hardships faced by the large population of Asian migrant laborers in Dubai misidentified the construction site where striking migrants rioted on March 21. It was the Old Town commercial section of the Burj Dubai complex, not the nearby skyscraper known as the Burj Dubai Tower.'"

"'06-03-26,'0','George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at the University of California at Berkeley and author of ""Don't Think of an Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate,"" says the different language used in any public policy debate is ultimately a contest for the public mind. ""Metaphors repeated often enough eventually become part of your physical brain,"" he said. ""Use the word 'illegal' often enough, which suggests criminal, which suggests immoral, and you have framed the issue of immigration to a remarkable degree.""Every side, of course, claims that its choice of words is not only correct but a reflection of the literal truth. Those favoring more restrictive laws, for instance, assert that people who violate immigration laws are, de facto, illegal residents.""Immigration is such an emotional issue at this point that every word is being hotly contested,"" said Frank Sherry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a group based in Washington that advocates a liberalized policy. ""You know where people stand pretty much from the language they use,"" said Mr. Sherry, who uses the term ""undocumented immigrants.""A House bill that would stiffen penalties for unauthorized immigration adds yet another term to the list of synonyms for the illegal immigrant: felon. Under that bill, which led to protests in Washington, Chicago and San Francisco a couple of weeks ago, illegal immigrants would be charged with aggravated felony and face five years in prison.A Senate bill produced yet more terminology -- earned legalization -- which would apply to illegal immigrants who pay their back taxes and stiff fines, promise to learn English and wait in line. Earned legalization is not to be confused with amnesty, a word in the immigration debate that is a bugaboo to all sides, on the theory that rewarding illegal behavior would only lead to more of it.The language can be so arcane that even people who track immigration policy might have been hard pressed to follow the conversation on ABC's ""This Week"" between the host, George Stephanopoulos, and the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist. In one 10-second exchange, Mr. Frist said he was for enforcement, and Mr. Stephanopoulos asked if Mr. Frist was also for guest worker, to which Mr. Frist replied that he was for guest worker but against amnesty.Enforcement, in the debate, is code for border security. The enforcement-only bill passed by the House focuses exclusively on tightening border security. It authorizes the building of a 700-mile fence, or the deployment of electronic devices and drone aircraft to create a ""virtual fence."" It does not establish a guest worker program.The enforcement-plus bills under review in the Senate (there are three, with a fourth pending) tighten border security and create versions of a guest worker program. (In Washington, to be in favor of ""enforcement-only"" or ""enforcement-plus"" is to state one's immigration weltanschauung.)As for the meaning of ""guest worker"" in the enforcement-plus universe, it depends. It can signify a long-term foreign worker who might eventually become a citizen. It can also indicate someone who works for two years with no such expectation, and then goes home. It can be a seasonal worker who goes home after every harvest. And in the most restrictive version, it is perhaps a little like the homey status of the political prisoners in Frank O'Connor's short story ""Guests of the Nation."" The prisoners are treated like friends of the family until one is ordered executed in the national interest.Ultimately, there may be no neutral language possible in the immigration debate -- any more than there is in other emotionally charged human interaction, said Deborah Tannen, a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University and the author of the best-selling ""You're Wearing That? Understanding Mothers and Daughters in Conversation."" Ms. Tannen claims no special expertise about immigration, but she knows communication. ""People cling to words, and use them, as a way of showing whose side they're on, who their people are,"" she said.Guillermo Gómez-Peña, a performance artist and writer born in Mexico known for his observations about the cultural life of the border, has coined his own term for the movement of people, legally or illegally, temporarily or permanently, willingly or not, from south of the border to the north. In a recent performance, he mordantly referred to it all as ""original sin.""'"
"'06-03-26,'0','Procrastination technique: I just put it off. There are things that I've been meaning to do for six months. None of them are pressing.Next big purchase: We're looking right now. I think it will be an S.U.V., maybe a Cadillac Escalade. I used to drive Cadillac sedans; then I moved over to S.U.V.'s. I like big cars. I've got a big family: six children and eight grandchildren.Where he hangs out with his kids: At the pool table. My children like to play pool, particularly my son Alexander. He's in college now.Where he keeps grandchildren's toys: In the closet in the mudroom, or wherever they leave them lying around. Often that is in my office. They've tried to interest me in their portable video-game toys, but without success.Habitual outfit: I wear walking shoes by Merrell or some Merrell knock-off, a navy blue suit by Lands' End and a knit tie. I've had lots of people tell me they're glad I gave up the Sears suits I used to wear.Biggest self-indulgence: Well, it used to be hot fudge sundaes and fried chicken, but my wife has become a food-police enforcer, and she's cut back on that.Hobby: I've had a Ping-Pong table all my life. I grew up playing Ping-Pong with my father. I play with my children and often with my clients. Usually I'll play a couple times a month, and when I do play, I play for hours.Gadget he can't live without: I don't care for most gadgets, but we did get one of those flat-screen televisions. I have to say the flat screen does have a better picture; it also has high definition, which is great for sporting events.Usual haunt outside the house: I spend a lot of time on our grounds, which are parklike; you can wander around and feel removed from the world. I love sitting by the pool. It's a peaceful environment.Favorite justice: In the current court, I'd have to say Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Anthony Kennedy.Least favorite justice: That's hard; probably James Clark McReynolds. He was appointed by Woodrow Wilson. He had many deplorable qualities, among them that he was an out-and-out racist. He fought decisions that cut back on segregation.Shows he dislikes: Watching people cook isn't interesting to me.Prized possession: I have a charcoal grill. It's a Hasty-Bake.

Drink wine, talk and relax.Evening routine: I like to get home around 5:30 p.m., but often I don't get home until 8 p.m. We'll have dinner, turn on the television and sit around. Depending on what's happening, people may bring things over from the office for me to look at.Collection: My house has two wine cellars, both operational. I was supposed to use one for bottles and the other for cases. Over time, I've ended up with bottles and cases in both. I collect red wine, primarily French Bordeaux and Californian. I've got 6,000 to 8,000 bottles in the house.Favorite wines in collection: I have both an aesthetic and sentimental affinity for the top Bordeaux wines of the 1982 vintage. It was a great vintage and the year I was married.When he drinks: I drink wine probably four days a week. Not always at home.What's by his bed: Water, a notepad; sometimes cough drops.Pets: We have temporary custody of a French bulldog while my daughter, Mary Regency, is at school. The dog is named Lola, as in, ""Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.""

He rings it three times before Lamont's wary voice sounds on the other side.""Who is it?""""It's me. Win,"" he says. ""Open the door, Monique.""Locks unlock, the heavy wooden door opens, Lamont on the other side, looking like hell, looking as if she just got out of the shower.""What do you want? You had no right coming here,"" she says furiously, pushing damp hair out of her face. ""How did you get in?""He moves past her, stands beneath a Baccarat chandelier, looks around at ornate molding and wainscoting and rich, old wood.""Nice place you've got here. Worth what? A couple mil? Four or five, maybe six?"" he says.Sykes sits inside an office at a club she could never afford and wonders if Vivian Finlay thought she was better than everybody else and would have dismissed Sykes as a klutzy country girl who probably didn't know which fork to use for salad. The truth about crime victims is that a lot of them are unlikable.She sorts through paperwork, has gotten up to May. What she has learned so far is that Mrs. Finlay was very active, played tennis at the country club as often as three times a week, always had lunch afterward, and based on how much the bill was each time, she never ate alone and had a habit of picking up the check. It appears that she ate dinner there once or twice a week and liked Sunday brunch. Again, she didn't dine alone, based on the substantial size of the bills.Mrs. Finlay was conspicuously generous, and Sykes suspects that the reason for the rich old woman's largess wasn't so she could spread around her good fortune, since it is unlikely that her guests were on tight budgets, not at this club. More likely, she was one of those people who nod for the check every time because she likes to be the big shot, likes to be in charge, controlling people, proud people, the sort who have always made Sykes feel simple and small. She has dated plenty of men like that, thinks about how different Win is from any man she has ever known.Like the other night at the Tennessee Grill, the two of them watching the sun set over the river, a special evening of big cheeseburgers and beer, her aching with the hope that maybe he was as attracted to her as she was to him. Well, is. She can't deny it, keeps thinking it will go away. That night it was her turn to treat, and she did, because unlike most men, Win doesn't mind, not that he's cheap, because he sure isn't. He's generous and kind but believes things ought to be equal so both people feel empowered and experience the pleasure of giving, is the way he explains it. Win takes turns. On the firing range, driving places, paying tabs or just talking, he is as fair as he can be.Sykes begins looking through the statement for the month of July, starts getting excited when she notices that in addition to Mrs. Finlay's court times and lunches, a guest played tennis and golf at the club. Whoever this guest was, or perhaps it was a different guest on different occasions, Sykes considers, within a two-week period, almost $2,000 was spent on ""clothing"" in the pro shops and charged to Mrs. Finlay's account. Sykes starts on the month of August.On the eighth, the day Mrs. Finlay was murdered, a guest played tennis, apparently alone, because there is a rental fee for the ball machine, something it doesn't seem the sociable Mrs. Finlay ever used. That same day, a guest spent almost $1,000 in the tennis pro shop and charged it to Mrs. Finlay's account.There is nothing between Lamont and Win except an antique table and her red silk robe.It is almost 7 p.m., the sun fiery orange, a band of pink spreading across the horizon, the window open and warm air drifting in.""Why don't you get dressed?"" he says to her for the third time. ""Please. We're two professionals, two colleagues talking. Let's keep it like that.""""You're not here because we're colleagues. And it's my apartment and I'll wear what I want.""""Actually, it's not your apartment,"" he says. ""Sammy had a little chat with the supervisor. It seems your crime-lab director is doing quite well.""""Monique? Where does Huber get his money?""""Why don't you ask him.""""Why are you staying in his apartment? The two of you got something going?""""I'm rather homeless at the moment. Get this over with, won't you?""""All right. We'll get back to that."" Win leans forward, rests his elbows on the table. ""I can go first or give you a chance to tell me the truth.""""Yes, colleagues, as you put it."" Her eyes are on his. ""Will you Mirandize me next for some crime you seem to think I've committed?""""Truth."" He says it again. ""You're in trouble. I can't help you if you don't tell me the truth.""""I have no idea what you're talking about.""""The office over your garage,"" he goes on. ""Who uses it?""""Did you get a search warrant before you went charging in there?""""Your property is a crime scene. All of it, every inch of it. I don't need to explain that to you.""She picks up a pack of cigarettes, slides one out, her hands trembling. It's the first time he has ever seen her smoke.""When's the last time you were in the apartment over your garage?"" he asks.She lights the cigarette, takes a deep drag, is considerate enough to blow smoke out sideways instead of in his face.""What is it you intend to accuse me of?""""Come on, Monique. I'm not after you.""""Feels like it."" She slides an ashtray close.""Here, let me walk you through it."" Win tries a different approach. ""I enter your garage through the side door -- which, by the way, had been broken into, the lock pried open.""She blows out smoke, taps an ash, a glint of fear that turns to anger.""And I see some evidence of a car having been in there, tire tracks, dirty, possibly made when it rained last. Which would have been the night you were attacked.""""I see the pulldown stairs and climb up and find a guest apartment that appears unlived-in except for footprints on the carpet.""""And of course you ransacked the place,"" she says, leaning back in her chair as if inviting him to look at her in a way he shouldn't.""If I did, what did I find? Why don't you tell me?""""I have no idea,"" she says.THE FUNNY PAGES: III: SUNDAY SERIAL Previous chapters are online at www.nytimes.com/funnypages.'"

"'06-03-26,'0','BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 25 - Iraqi politicians say they are considering asking the main Shiite political bloc to allow a vote by the entire Parliament on a candidate for prime minister. In the proposed plan, the Parliament would choose among three candidates, including Ibrahim al-Jaafari, the current prime minister, the politicians say.The Shiite bloc, which has 130 of 275 seats in the Parliament, has already nominated Mr. Jaafari to be the next prime minister. Political negotiations to form a new government have been deadlocked over the past month on the issue -- the main Kurdish, Sunni Arab and secular blocs in Parliament are all opposing Mr. Jaafari, for various reasons.Under the Constitution that Iraqi voters approved last fall, the bloc with the most seats in Parliament gets first shot at nominating a prime minister. The document has no explicit passages allowing the entire Parliament to decide on a nominee.The idea of having Parliament vote for one of three Shiite candidates is being floated among the blocs opposing Mr. Jaafari's candidacy. Some leaders of those blocs would prefer that the Shiites nominate Adel Abdul Mahdi, another prominent Shiite politician. Early last month, the Shiites held a secret ballot among themselves to choose the nominee, and Mr. Mahdi lost to Mr. Jaafari by one vote.Politicians supporting a parliamentary vote to nominate the prime minister say the plan has yet to be formally presented to the Shiite bloc.'"
"'06-03-26,'0','""If you look at it as a resort, it has its limitations,"" Ms. Desiderio said. ""It's seasonal; it's not 12 months out of the year.""People who can afford $55 million summer homes, on the other hand, do not care if they can go there year round, she said. ""I think it just is screaming for someone to make it a private club or a private residence.""Some real estate agents familiar with East Hampton prices were initially shocked at the idea.""It's just irrational exuberance,"" said Peter Turino of Brown Harris Stevens of the Hamptons, who sold an 8.7-acre oceanfront parcel in Amagansett (along with about seven acres of adjacent land deeded to the Nature Conservancy) in December for $43 million.""It's some sort of intoxication that people have with"" the East End, he said. ""That's just a crazy price.""Ms. Desiderio said she had looked at what she called comparable properties that have sold or are for sale on the East End.Andy Warhol's former Montauk estate is on the market for $50 million, she said, and the 15-acre former Siena Spirituality Center in Water Mill sold for $35 million in August. Then there was the $43 million Amagansett sale, and the 25-acre Burnt Point estate in Wainscott that sold in 2004 for $45 million.""Maybe this is the year that the $50 million houses will sell,"" Ms. Desiderio said. ""They're headed that way.""She also looked at the value of each component of the five acres. ""The restaurant alone is in the neighborhood of $20 million to $25 million,"" she said, adding that a buyer could sell it and keep the rest.Htun Han, a partner in Hamptons Realty Group in East Hampton, by contrast, put the value of the restaurant at up to $6 million. Mr. Turino said maybe the whole resort could be sold as a commercial property for about $20 million.Perhaps. But East Hampton Point's restaurant and marina are features that could never be built anywhere on Three Mile Harbor today under East Hamptons strict zoning laws controlling development on the waterfront.""It is truly one of a kind,"" Mr. Han said. ""There's just nothing on Three Mile Harbor that offers this package of amenities that he's got.""""He"" is Ben Krupinski, one of the owners of the East Hampton Point property, and a longstanding builder in the town. Mr. Krupinski may be another factor in the pricing.""This is just one of his many, many holdings,"" Mr. Han said, conjecturing on how the price may have been set. ""They don't need the money, so they can reach out and think of a number.""But, to Mr. Turino, the idea of turning East Hampton Point into a private residence is far-fetched. ""There's no market for that at $55 million, unless somebody wants their own private marina,"" he said. ""But even so, why pay so much?""Mr. Han wondered if 13 cottages and 20 more rooms or suites aren't a bit extravagant, even for a family compound.""It's got a nice sound to it,"" but, Mr. Han said, it would have to be a very big family, perhaps ""an Asian family like I have, with 42 relatives who come to visit every summer.""And yet, the secluded year-round resort is appealing even in winter, when rates are discounted 40 percent.The cottages, varying in size from studios to duplexes, are outfitted with full kitchens, private outdoor decks and sitting rooms, Jacuzzi tubs, marble finishes and soothing décor in pastels and whites.Meandering bluestone walkways connect the cottages to one another and to other conveniences: the in-ground swimming pool, a small jungle-gym, and a general store, where yacht owners and visitors can pick up supplies or just a muffin and coffee to eat on the waterfront deck.Michael Capoferri, the general manager of East Hampton Point, said the cottages and suites are sold out for the season well before it begins.Nearly 20 percent of seasonal visitors live in other countries, Mr. Capoferri said, and many, he added, are returnees. ""Once we get them, we've sort of got them for life,"" he said.One Parisian woman spends 35 nights in a two-bedroom suite in the manor that costs $1,895 a night so that her son can attend a tennis camp, he said.Mr. Han said each of the cottages could be worth $2 million because they have access to the water. One-bedroom cottages in Springs, a neighboring hamlet, he said, are listed for up to $1.4 million. A buyer might also consider converting the cottages to condominiums or time shares.But the whole five-acre East Hampton Point resort for $55 million?""At first glance, my reaction is, that's a lot of money,"" Mr. Han said of the asking price. ""But when you take it apart, they're not that far off. The uniqueness is what makes it so interesting.""'"

"'06-03-26,'0','A STEADY line of cars, mainly yellow taxis and white limousines, crawled eastward through the night past the floodlit entrances to two of Manhattan's best-known nightspots, the strip club Scores and the nightclub Crobar. Each time a car stopped for more than a few seconds, a driver impatiently honked his horn. It was 2:30 a.m. on a Saturday in West Chelsea, and the party was in full swing.This is the heart of New York club land, a hodgepodge of former warehouses and factories that by day is busy with gallery hoppers and by night becomes an adult playground. In five years, nightlife capacity has increased to 10,000 people from 1,000, and the area bounded by 10th and 11th Avenues and 24th and 29th Streets is home to a score of clubs and bars.The nightlife, while helping reinvigorate an area once troubled by prostitution and crime, has brought its own problem: noise. Not from the well-soundproofed clubs, but from the irritable drivers and boisterous revelers, a noise that seems to peak around midnight and again between 2 and 4 a.m., according to Michelle Solomon, acting district manager of Community Board 4.Starting two years ago, Crobar on West 28th Street, the area's largest nightclub, with a capacity of 3,000, has tried to make friends in the community by opening its doors and bar to neighbors once a month. But its definition of ""neighbor"" is broad.Last Friday Crobar, a former metal factory, was doing a brisk trade at the unusually early hour of 11 p.m., with free entry and a ""sponsored"" -- a k a open -- bar between 10 p.m. and midnight for anyone who had replied to a ""Get to Know Your Neighbor"" party invitation. Although the front bar was crowded with people trying to make themselves heard above the music, West Chelsea neighbors proved elusive.'"

"'06-03-26,'0','""The minister of education has done nothing,"" said Jean-Pierre Obin, an inspector general of education in France, who wrote a report in 2004 that called anti-Semitism ""ubiquitous"" in the 61 schools surveyed. ""He prefers not to talk about it.""Mr. Obin wrote in the report of ""a stupefying and cruel reality: in France, Jewish children -- and they are alone in this case -- can no longer be educated in just any school.""Ianis Roder, 34, a history teacher in a middle school northeast of Paris, said he was stunned by what he witnessed after Sept. 11, 2001. The next day, someone spray-painted in a stairwell of the school the image of an airplane crashing into the World Trade Center beside the words ""Death to the U.S., Death to Jews.""When he told his class months later that Hitler had killed millions of million Jews, one boy blurted out, ""He would have made a good Muslim!"" Mr. Roder told of a Muslim teacher who dismissed her class after a shouting match over Nazi propaganda. The students said the offensive images accurately depicted Jews.Even today, he said, there is widespread belief that the Sept. 11 attacks were a Jewish plot and that Jews were notified beforehand.Barbara Lefèbvre, a history teacher who has taught in several of the working-class suburbs, said many people minimize the anti-Semitism among France's youth.""They say, 'That's the way the kids talk -- they don't mean it in the same way that you or I would,' "" she said. Ms. Lefèbvre, who is Jewish, said she had to argue with the principal of her school several years ago to get an investigation when a student wrote ""dirty Jew"" on a notebook used by her class. The student, a French-Arab boy, was ultimately given just two hours of detention.Some teachers simply gloss over subjects likely to elicit anti-Semitic responses. Ms. Lefèbvre said she knows teachers who even show fictional films, like Roberto Benigni's ""Life Is Beautiful,"" instead of treating the Holocaust directly.France was the first European country to offer Jews full citizenship and has done as much as any to exorcise the ghosts of Nazi collaboration.But the postwar climate for Jews has steadily soured as attention has focused on the Palestinian cause and Muslims have moved here in large numbers.With the outbreak of the second Palestinian Intifada against Israel in 2000, anti-Semitic attacks in France skyrocketed. While the number of reported incidents has fallen since peaking in 2004, anti-Semitism is now entrenched in many of the country's working-class housing projects.The Arab communities of North Africa had no postwar sense of Holocaust guilt. If anything, distress over the creation of Israel in 1948 reinforced anger at Jews to the point that successive waves of anti-Jewish riots drove most of North Africa's Jews to Israel and Europe -- primarily France -- in the 1950's and 1960's.Some people say that many of the North African Arabs who subsequently moved to France carried anti-Jewish prejudices with them and passed them to a second-generation, where they have been reinforced by support for the Palestinian cause. And French guilt over colonialism has made such prejudices harder to counter.""As long as anti-Semitism came from the extreme right there was a reaction,"" said Ms. Lefèbvre, who has written about anti-Semitism and sexism in the schools. ""But when it came from that part of the population that itself was a victim of racism, no one wanted to see it.""Sitting in a room hung with posters deploring racism at a youth center in La Courneuve, a suburb on the outskirts of Paris, Yannis, the 16-year-old son of a French father and Algerian mother, said racist talk was common. ""We've become used to it, hearing it day after day, so we've all started to speak like that,"" he said, adding that even 7-year-olds say, ""Don't eat like a Jew,"" if someone is being stingy with food.Fahima, 14, with long black hair and limpid eyes, doing her homework beside him, spoke of a confrontation she had with a Jewish teacher two years ago.""He said, 'You blacks and Arabs will never get apartments in Paris,' "" she said, explaining that he meant the students would never manage to move out of the poor suburbs. Fahima, who is French-Algerian, said she retorted, ""You Jews only have apartments there because you were picked on during the war.""""I was mean,"" she said, playing with a shiny cellphone. ""But I'm not anti-Semitic.""The girls with her complained about the teacher, saying he talked often about his family's suffering in the Holocaust. ""He cries whenever he mentions his grandmother,"" one girl said with exasperation.Some schools have tried to defuse the problem without addressing it directly. After a Jewish girl was harassed in Saint-Ouen two years ago, the administration of her school decided to show ""Night and Fog,"" a haunting 1955 documentary film that includes graphic footage of Nazi death camps.Initially, teachers feared that showing the movie risked inciting confusing comparisons between the Holocaust and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but then relented.At the film's end, one boy -- not a Muslim -- asked how Jews who had known such suffering could treat Palestinians ""the same way.""No one responded, though Carole Diamant, a philosophy teacher, said she spoke to him privately later about why he was wrong. ""I felt like we were on a wire,"" she said, describing the tension. Since then, the school has included the Holocaust in a broader program on genocide.Anti-Semitism is felt most acutely in communities like Sarcelles, where many North Africans settled in the 1950's and 1960's. Sarcelles is home to one of the most concentrated Jewish communities in France, surrounded by an unsightly sprawl of apartment blocks that house the North African and sub-Saharan immigrants who arrived later.France has a well-established Jewish community with European roots, many of whose members occupy the upper echelons of French society. Hundreds of thousands of poorer North African Jews have more recently swelled the Jewish community to about 600,000, making it the largest in Europe. Those North African Jews and their children bear the brunt of the anti-Semitism in the working-class neighborhoods.Each time anti-Semitic attacks make news, the Interior Ministry promises more security around Jewish institutions. But ""more police aren't the answer because it remains in the spirit of the people,"" said Dr. Marc Djebali, a spokesman for the Jewish community in Sarcelles.Laurent Berros, the synagogue's rabbi, said local imams had evaded his suggestion that Jewish and Muslim leaders go together into troubled neighborhoods. ""They say that bringing a rabbi into these neighborhoods isn't easy,"" he said. ""There is a fear that they'll be seen as collaborators.""The deteriorating climate has led thousands of French Jews to move to Israel in the past five years, including about 3,300 last year, a 35-year high.Murielle Brami, 42, whose parents immigrated to France to escape anti-Jewish riots in Tunisia, has the sinking feeling that history is repeating itself. ""All the Jews in France want one thing, to leave for Israel or the United States,"" she said. That is hyperbole, but it is a sign of the anxiety percolating through France's Jewish community. ""When our parents came, it was paradise here,"" said Ms. Brami, who remembers staying out late without worrying about her safety.Now she avoids certain neighborhoods even in the day and no longer allows her son to wear a yarmulke in the street after some youths put a knife to his throat last year.'"
"'06-03-26,'0','The current excitement over ethanol derives from research that has cut the cost of converting nonfood plant matter like grasses and wood chips into alcohol. Mr. Khosla says he believes that such ethanol, called cellulosic ethanol, will eventually be cheaper to produce than both gasoline and corn-derived ethanol.Can investors whose pockets are not as deep jump into the ethanol market? Yes, but they are taking a big risk. Picking long-term winners among the companies that make ethanol -- or, for that matter, develop other alternative energy technologies -- is a very uncertain business. The few public companies that focus on ethanol are typically unprofitable. Pacific Ethanol, for example, has not yet had a profitable quarter and will not until at least the fourth quarter, when its first plant is scheduled to begin production, Mr. Langley said.Few mutual funds focus on alternative energy companies. ""We are not going to start a dedicated alternative energy fund, period,"" said Wenhua Zhang, a technology analyst at T. Rowe Price. The company is avoiding the sector ""for the same reason we didn't start an Internet fund in 2000: a dedicated very narrow sector fund with a single focus typically has a much higher risk.""Some publicly traded companies with operations linked to ethanol include Novozymes and Danisco, both based in Denmark, and Diversa of San Diego; all three have said they have made major gains in reducing the cost of the enzymes needed to produce ethanol from cellulose. Bigger, more diversified companies like Archer Daniels Midland and Monsanto have ethanol operations, too, though ethanol is but one of many businesses for these giants.Two mutual funds that focus on alternative energy include some ethanol companies among their holdings. The New Alternatives fund holds shares of Abengoa and Acciona Energía, two Spanish companies investing in ethanol production. Another option is the PowerShares WilderHill Clean Energy Portfolio, an exchange-traded fund that tracks a basket of 40 alternative energy companies. Robert Wilder, who created the index on which the fund is based, said that it currently includes just two companies with significant ethanol interests: Pacific Ethanol and MGP Ingredients, an ethanol producer in Atchison, Kan.Mr. Wilder said he expects to add other companies involved with ethanol. ""It's very elegant,"" he said. ""We can take an agricultural waste product we currently pay to get rid of and convert it into fuel.""But many ethanol companies are privately held, making them inaccessible to most investors. And there is certainly room for skepticism about ethanol's future. After all, corn ethanol has been around for years, and even with a current spike in demand, the industry commands only a 3 percent share of the market. Mr. Khosla counters that soaring energy prices have made corn-based ethanol more competitive, while research advances in breaking down cellulose into simple sugars have cut the cost of making ethanol from other sources.""Ethanol is cheaper to produce, unsubsidized, than gasoline today,"" he said. ""As these technologies ramp up, they will be cheaper -- unsubsidized -- than gasoline even if petroleum drops to $35 a barrel.""Brazil has proved that ethanol can be made competitively from sugar, said Daniel M. Kammen, a professor in the energy and resources group at the University of California, Berkeley. He estimates the cost of producing ethanol from sugar -- including raw materials and processing -- at $6 to $7 per gigajoule (a unit of energy) versus $14 a gigajoule for gasoline. In Brazil, roughly 70 percent of new vehicles are equipped to handle ethanol, and the country has been able to curb its dependence on foreign oil and turn ethanol into a growing export industry.But cellulosic ethanol, the kind produced from nonfood plant matter, has some advantages over food-based ethanol. Because cellulosic ethanol is derived from plant waste, wood chips or wild grasses like miscanthus and switchgrass, it would not require costly cultivation; that would mean savings on labor, pesticides, fertilizers and irrigation.And it is superior to corn-derived ethanol in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Professor Kammen said. He expects cellulosic ethanol to catch on quickly. ""I think you can really see ethanol comprising 25 to 30 percent of gasoline consumption within 10 years,"" he said.FOR that to happen, automakers would need to build more flex-fuel cars. The cost of adding this capability to new cars has been estimated at roughly $100 a vehicle. And ethanol would need to be much more readily available at gas stations. Mr. Khosla has been lobbying in Washington for government help in both areas.Smaller investors may be advised to just sit back and study developing opportunities. ""This is an area where investors have to be patient and build up slowly,"" Mr. Khosla said.But he said the potential payoff justifies his own aggressive bets. And ethanol's success, he said, would mean that more energy spending would flow to rural America. ""You get a fuel that's cheaper and greener than gasoline,"" he said. ""It gives us energy security.""'"
"'06-03-26,'0','Read today, ""Open Marriage"" is a period piece, a window onto a distant age of experimentation and abandon. Its ideas can appear shockingly ordinary, even quaint. In the shadow of AIDS, its bolder suggestions seem not so much daring as painfully naïve.Much of the book's marital counsel was conventional even in its day. ""The time to tell your wife she's shooting the budget to pieces with the amount she spends on clothes is not when she comes rushing home full of pleasure with a new purchase,"" the authors wrote.Trained as anthropologists, the O'Neills devoted other passages to the ethnography of marriage. (""No self-respecting Nama Hottentot owns a jointly held his-and-hers cow."")In keeping with the growing feminist consciousness of the period, they stressed women's need for meaningful lives.Tying the text together are liberal doses of 70's-era popular psychology.Three of the book's 287 pages explore, ever so tentatively, the elastic properties of marital fidelity. Forever after, those pages were all anyone seemed to remember about ""Open Marriage.""Ms. O'Neill was born Elizabeth Dross in St. Lawrence, Pa., on Nov. 29, 1923, and was known in her younger days as Betty. An early marriage ended with the death of her husband during World War II.In 1945, she married George O'Neill, who called her Nena (pronounced ""NENN-uh""), a Spanish term of endearment. Ms. O'Neill earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology from Barnard in 1946 and later did graduate work at Columbia.When ""Open Marriage"" appeared, some readers interpreted its choicest lines (""Sexual fidelity is the false god of closed marriage"") as a license to cheat.But on the very next page, the O'Neills seemed to back away from that provocative stance: ""We are not recommending outside sex, but we are not saying that it should be avoided, either. The choice is entirely up to you.""George O'Neill, a professor of anthropology at City College in New York, died in 1980. Besides her son Michael, of Brooklyn, Ms. O'Neill is survived by another son, Brian, of Cascais, Portugal; two brothers, David Dross of Augusta, Ga., and Gerald Dross of Hampstead, N.C.; and four grandchildren.The O'Neills also wrote ""Shifting Gears"" (M. Evans, 1974), about career change. In 1977, Nena O'Neill published ""The Marriage Premise"" (M. Evans), which argued that fidelity was perhaps not such a bad thing after all.""The whole area of extramarital sex is touchy,"" Ms. O'Neill told The New York Times in 1977. ""I don't think we ever saw it as a concept for the majority, and certainly it has not proved to be.""'"

"'06-03-26,'0','Now, as everyone who has the misfortune to fly commercially knows, air travel today is mind-bogglingly uncomfortable. The seats are small. The flights are nearly always full to overflowing. The food is unspeakable. The air is fetid and filled with germs. Many a time I board an airliner hale and hearty, only to emerge with a raging pneumonia.But there is one saving grace. Unless you are seated behind or next to really rude people -- which happens surprisingly rarely -- air travel is fairly quiet. Yes, the flight attendants stand around and talk. Yes, before the plane takes off people scream into their cellphones, but along about three hours into the flight from, say, Kennedy to LAX, it's pretty peaceful.That's solely because passengers can't use cellphones aloft. That prohibition was one of the great decisions ever. Now, in a fit of idiocy, some airlines are suggesting that they be allowed to sell the use of cellphones in the air at nominal prices. This will mean yelling and screaming and boasting and complaining for almost all the time you're sealed in that sardine can. The government is apparently planning to allow this anarchy.Why? Well, for a long time, cellphone use was barred because safety experts worried they had the ""potential"" to interfere with navigation systems or cellphones on the ground -- concerns that now, apparently because of technological advances, they no longer have. (The real reason for the ban, as I am told by airline personnel in secret, is that cellphone screeching made many passengers so crazy that flight attendants feared incidents of air rage.)The ban worked well. Now, in the rush to mine every penny they can from passengers, airlines plan to jettison that old excuse and, when planes are above 10,000 feet, let people holler into their cellphones, or maybe it will be the airlines' cellphones.This is rank madness. It will make most of us hide by listening to deafening music. (I recommend the live concert version of ""Idiot Wind"" on the ""Hard Rain"" disc of the immortal Bob Dylan to drown out the idiot winds of the people around you.) It will make us retaliate by talking into our own cellphones. It will take what could have been a bearable experience and turn it into hell.Why would the government, already reeling from criticism about Iraq and Katrina and the deficits, now make a decision that has absolutely no merit? If the airlines are that needy, let's bring back the Civil Aeronautics Board and allow the government to set prices again. Let's allow a $10-a-passenger surcharge to pay the airlines for silence. But please, Mr. Bush, don't let me be seated next to a man who talks on the phone for an hour, telling his mother what he just bought that day at Costco. Please don't make me sit next to a woman fighting with her boyfriend or a salesman speed-dialing his entire prospect list for concrete blocks.It is bad enough to allow cellphone use in a confined space anywhere. But on an airplane flight? No. Some planes already allow use of built-in telephones, but those are so hard to use, so amazingly costly, that they might as well not be there.

"'06-03-26,'0','VW is already known for the lateness and lost opportunities that took root in the company while Ferdinand K. Piëch was chief executive, pursuing his dream of transforming the ""people's car"" company into a luxury manufacturer on par with Mercedes-Benz. Of late, as chairman of VW's supervisory board, Mr. Piëch has pointed fingers for the company's troubles at the current chief executive, Bernd Pischetsrieder, the protégé he recruited in 2002.While VW's travails are deep and wide -- including a German bribery and corruption scandal in which managers were accused of buying labor officials' support by arranging sexual favors from prostitutes -- its problems here are not so exotic, centering on products that have been late, mispriced or missing altogether.Almost a decade after the Toyota RAV4 unleashed a wave of interest in small car-based sport utility wagons, VW still has no entry in that booming segment. As rivals roll out their latest fuel-sipping small cars and hybrids, VW's response consists of old-school diesels, too dirty to be sold in California and the Northeast, the nation's biggest car markets.When ignition coils in VW's and Audis began failing en masse, and a shortage of replacement parts left some owners stranded, VW stonewalled until widespread bad publicity finally forced it to issue a recall.In the United States, VW has not even been able to steal customers from General Motors and Ford, unlike most of its Japanese and Korean rivals. While companies like Toyota have grown fat on Detroit's lost generations, VW's American market share has steadily fallen -- to about 1.3 percent last year from 2.1 percent in 2001. Americans bought barely 224,000 VW-brand cars last year, down 37 percent in four years.Across the Atlantic, a jump in earnings cannot mask serious problems. VW is shedding 20,000 workers (who rank among the industry's highest paid and least productive). But on a potentially brighter note, the company hired Wolfgang Bernhard, who won respect in Detroit as the No. 2 executive during Chrysler's turnaround, to run the VW brand.VW's slide may have begun with Mr. Piëch's envious gaze up the luxury mountain. His golden calf was the Phaeton sedan, priced at $70,000 to over $100,000, which has been mercifully euthanized in North America. Despite fire-sale discounts, just 820 Phaetons were sold last year.While VW is hardly the first automaker to embark on an ego-driven lark, its Neverland approach -- indulging design whims and pricing cars with seemingly no thought to the competition -- has trickled down the lineup.The Phaeton's bitter fruits include the latest Passat, a once-great family sedan that now cavorts in luxury drag. With V-6 models priced from $30,000 to more than $40,000, and tepid sales so far, the redesigned Passat is proving that buyers can spell the difference between VW and BMW.Once the mascot of American college students, the Jetta has gone Wall Street. Ads promoted the awkwardly restyled model and its target audience as ""all grown up."" But some of these college grads apparently studied math: sales of the pricey new Jetta are down nearly 30 percent from their peak in 2000-02.Still more luxury is afoot: the Eos convertible arrives late this year at an estimated $30,000 to $40,000, and a diesel Touareg S.U.V. will run about $67,000. (The Golf, at least, should start around $16,000). Even the fine new GTI, which recaptures the thrills of America's original hot hatchback, can top $29,000 -- some $6,000 more than a formidable rival, the Honda Civic Si.VW's upscale strategy has hurt Audi, the company's pedigreed luxury brand, and not just because the Phaeton competed against the Audi A8. It is no wonder that sales of Audis are flat, given that other mixed-up VW mutts are nipping at their heels.In other costly distractions, Mr. Piëch added Lamborghini, Bentley and Bugatti to his toy chest. These are cool cars, but they look better in hip-hop videos than on the balance sheet. The $1.3 million Bugatti Veyron 16.4 has 1,000 horsepower, exceeds 250 m.p.h. and is as relevant to VW's core business as a Mars rover.Most mystifying is that VW, whose original Beetle essentially invented the economy car, seems to have virtually ceded that market. To some extent, that is because high labor costs and the euro's strength against the dollar make it hard for a German company to sell low-price cars here.Another problem is a perception of inferior quality. VW consistently ranks near the bottom of the three-year dependability study by J. D. Power & Associates; in 2005, it ranked 34th out of 37 brands.With Americans seeking higher mileage, VW needs to show it's in the game. While consumers associate Toyota with hybrids, VW is positioned to win gold stars with diesels, but it needs to roll out cleaner versions that can meet strict new emissions rules and be sold in all states.While VW's song may sound like a requiem, other automakers have rebounded against greater odds. Nissan was nearly bankrupt before Carlos Ghosn took over; today, its profits are the envy of the industry.'"

"'06-03-27,'0','The virus lacks just one trait that could turn itinto a pandemic: transmissibility, the ability tospread easily from person to person. If the virusacquires that ability, a pandemic could erupt.Everything hangs on transmissibility. But itis impossible to predict whether A(H5N1) willbecome contagious among people. The virus hasbeen changing genetically, and researchers fearthat changes could make it more transmissible,or that A(H5N1) could mix with a human fluvirus in a person, swap genetic material andcome out contagious.But most bird flu viruses do not jump speciesto people. Some experts say that since A(H5N1)has been around for at least 10 years and theshift has not occurred, it is unlikely to happen.Others refuse to take that bet.The A(H5N1) strains circulating now are quitedifferent from the A(H5N1) strain detected inHong Kong in 1997, which killed 6 of 18 humanvictims. Over time, A(H5N1) seems to have developed the ability to infect more and more speciesof birds, and has found its way into mammals—specifically, cats that have eaten infectedbirds.The actual number of human cases may wellexceed the number that have been reported, andmay include mild cases from which victims recoveredwithout even seeing a doctor. If that istrue, the real death rate could be lower. But noone knows whether mild cases occur, or whethersome people are immune to the virus andnever get sick at all.In the absence of more information, healthofficials must act on what they see — an illnessthat apparently kills half its victims.Q. How will we know if the virus startsspreading from person to person andbecomes a pandemic?A. If there is a pandemic, it would be everywhere,not in just one city or one country. Todetect such an event as early as possible there isan international surveillance system, involvingmore than 150 countries, that searches for signsthat a new flu strain is taking hold in humans.One hallmark of a pandemic flu would be anunusual pattern of illnesses — lots of cases, possiblycases that are more severe than normaland, possibly, flu infections outside the normalflu season.Ordinary human flu viruses, for reasons thatare not entirely understood, circulate only inwinter. But pandemics can occur at any time. Apandemic would also involve a flu virus thatwas new to humans, meaning that no one wouldhave immunity from previous infections.Q. If bird flu reaches the United States,where is it likely to show up first?A. Although health officials expect bird flu toreach the United States, it is impossible topredict where it may show up first, in partbecause there are several routes it could take.If it is carried by migrating birds, then it mayappear first in Alaska or elsewhere along theWest Coast.But if the virus lurks in a bird being smuggledinto the United States as part of the illegal tradein exotic birds, it could land in any internationalairport. Bird smuggling is a genuine problem:in 2004, a man was caught at an airport in Belgiumillegally transporting eagles from Thailand,stuffed into tubes in his carry-on luggage.The birds turned out to be infected withA(H5N1), and they and several hundred otherbirds in a quarantine area at the airport had tobe destroyed.In theory, an infected human could also bringbird flu into the United States, and that personcould fly into just about any international airportand go unnoticed if the virus had yet to produceany symptoms.A. No one knows the full story. Scientistssay A(H5N1) is unusual because it can infectand kill a wide variety of birds, unlike a vastmajority of bird flus, which are usually found inwild birds, not domestic fowl, and which causefew symptoms.Some researchers suspect that wild ducks, orperhaps other wild birds, are impervious toA(H5N1), and may be the Typhoid Marys ofbird flu — getting the virus, spreading it to otherbirds but never becoming ill themselves. No onehas good evidence of this yet, but that may bebecause the way scientists discovered A(H5N1)infections was by finding birds that had gottenthe flu and died.As virologists like to point out, dead birdsdon't fly. So migratory birds cannot spread thevirus if they are dying shortly after being infected.That is why some researchers say that ifwild birds are spreading the A(H5N1) virus, itmust be a bird species that can be infected butdoes not become ill.Q. When people die from avian flucontracted from birds, what kills them?A. Like victims of severe pneumonia, manypatients die because their lungs give out. Thedisease usually starts with a fever, fatigue,headache and aches and pains, like a typicalcase of the flu. But within a few days it can turninto pneumonia, and the patients' lungs aredamaged and fill with fluid.In a few cases, children infected withA(H5N1) died of encephalitis, apparently becausethe virus attacked the brain. A number ofpeople have also had severe diarrhea — not usuallya flu symptom — meaning that this virusmay attack the intestines as well. Studies in catssuggest that in mammals the virus attacksother organs, too, including the heart, liver andadrenal glands.But more detailed information about deaths inpeople is not available because very few autopsieshave been done. In some countries, likeVietnam, where many of the deaths occurred,autopsies are frowned upon. Researchers saythey may glean useful information from autopsies,but fear that pressing for them would alienatethe public in some areas.Q. When experts refer to bird flu asA(H5N1), what does that mean?Click here to see the answer.Q. If I got bird flu, how would I know?A. There is no reason to suspect the diseaseunless you may have been exposed to it.Since the virus has not reached North America,doctors do not look for bird flu in people unlessthey have traveled to affected regions or havebeen exposed to sick or dead birds.The early stages of the illness in people arethe same as those of ordinary flu: fever, headache,fatigue, aches and pains. But within a fewdays, people with bird flu often start gettingworse instead of better; difficulty breathing iswhat takes many to the hospital.In any case, patients with flulike symptomsthat turn severe or involve breathing troubleare in urgent need of medical care.Q. Can I be tested for avian flu?A. There is no rapid test for bird flu. Thereis a rapid test for Type A influenza viruses, thegroup that A(H5N1) belongs to, but the test isonly moderately reliable, and it is not specificfor A(H5N1).State health departments and some researchlaboratories can perform genetic testing forA(H5N1) and give results within a few hours,but they do not have the capacity to performwidespread testing.Because of the limited availability of testingand the extremely low probability of A(H5N1)in people in the United States, the test is recommendedonly for patients strongly suspected ofhaving bird flu, like travelers with flulike symptomswho were exposed to infected birds.Q. Do any medicines treat or preventbird flu?A. Two prescription drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza,may reduce the severity of the disease ifthey are taken within a day or two after thesymptoms begin. But Relenza, a powder thatmust be inhaled, can irritate the lungs and is notrecommended for people with asthma or otherchronic lung diseases.Both drugs work by blocking an enzyme —neuraminidase, the ""N"" part of A(H5N1) — thatthe virus needs to escape from one cell to infectanother. But just how effective these medicinesare against A(H5N1) is not known, nor is it clearwhether the usual doses are enough. Also unknownis whether the drugs will help if takenlater in the course of the disease.Although government laboratories and otherresearch groups are trying to develop vaccinesto prevent A(H5N1) disease in people, none areavailable yet.Q. If there is an epidemic of flu inhumans, how can I protect myself?A. If there is a vaccine available, that would bethe best option. But if there is no vaccine it maybe hard to avoid being infected. Flu pandemicsspread quickly, even to isolated regions. The 1918 flu reached Alaskan villages where the onlyway visitors could arrive was by dog sled.The vaccines produced every year to preventseasonal flu are unlikely to be of any use inwarding off a pandemic strain. But a flu shotcould provide at least some peace of mind, bypreventing the false alarm that could come fromcatching a case of garden-variety flu.Similarly, people over 65 and others withchronic health problems should consult theirdoctors about whether they should be vaccinatedagainst pneumococcal pneumonia, a dangerousillness that can set in on top of the flu. Again,that vaccine will not stop bird flu, but it mayprevent complications.Some health officials have recommendedstockpiling two to three months’ worth of food,fuel and water in case a pandemic interfereswith food distribution or staffing levels at publicutilities, or people are advised to stay home.Many health experts have advised againststockpiling Tamiflu or Relenza, the prescription-only antiviral drugs that may work againstbird flu. Doctors say the drugs are in short supplyand hoarding may keep them out of reach ofpeople who genuinely need them.Also, they say, self-prescribing may lead towaste of the drugs or misuses that spur thegrowth of drug-resistant viruses. But peoplemay not trust the government to distributethese drugs, and may want their own supplies.Doctors say people can take precautions likeavoiding crowds, washing their hands frequentlyand staying away from those who are sick. Masks may help, but only if they are a typecalled N-95, which has to be carefully fitted. Sofar, masks and gloves have been recommendedonly for people taking care of sick patients.Avoiding the flu can be hard because it is notalways possible to spot carriers. Many peopleget and spread flu viruses and but never knowthey are infected.Q. Is the government prepared for abird flu pandemic?A. No. The nation does not have an approved fluvaccine for people or enough antiviral drugs orrespirators for all who would need them. Thebest protection in any flu pandemic will comefrom a vaccine, but scientists cannot tell aheadof time what strain the vaccine should protectagainst.Efforts are under way to make a vaccine forA(H5N1). But the virus could mutate in a waythat makes experimental vaccines ineffective,requiring more than one vaccine.Moreover, there is no assurance that the nextpandemic will even involve A(H5N1). It may involvea different strain of bird flu, and anA(H5N1) vaccine would not work for it. Recentefforts to develop a sort of universal flu vaccinethat would work across strains have failed.For now, the hope is to spot a pandemic earlyand quickly make a vaccine. Investigators aredeveloping new and better ways to make vaccines— a bird flu, for example, cannot be grownin fertilized eggs like other flu viruses becauseit kills the chicken embryos — but these newmethods must first be approved by the Foodand Drug Administration.Preparations also include government plansto stockpile drugs to protect people who wereexposed to the flu and to reduce the severity ofthe disease in those who are ill. But the one antiviraldrug that everyone wants to buy and stockpile,Oseltamivir, also sold by Roche as Tamiflu,is in short supply.In retrospect, scientists say, maybe the nationshould have started preparing sooner. Butuntil the current bird flu appeared, there waslittle interest in such expensive and extensivepreparations.Q. If bird flu reaches the United States,will it be safe to eat poultry or to bearound birds or other animals?A. Poultry is safe to eat when it is cooked thoroughly,meaning that the meat is no longer pinkand has reached a temperature of 180 degreesFahrenheit. The risk is not from cooked meat —cooking kills viruses. Instead, it is from infectedbirds that are still alive or have recently died.So the person who killed an infected chicken,butchered it or put it in the pot would be at greater risk than the one who ate it.It's not clear how long the virus lives on adead bird, but it is unlikely to survive more thana couple of days. And it seems unlikely that infectedchicken will find its way to supermarkets.If the bird flu strikes poultry farms, thefarmers will know there is a problem. Beforethey die, the birds develop major hemorrhages,with blood streaming from their cloacas andbeaks. When the flu gets to a poultry farm,farmers have to destroy their flocks, and poulgreater risk than the one who ate it.As for contact with healthy birds or animals,there is no need to panic. The A(H5N1) virus isa nasty one. If chickens or other animals becameinfected they would get sick and die, andyou would know the virus was present.But animals can carry many diseases besidesinfluenza, and whenever you are around animalsit is a good idea to wash your hands afterward.Because cats in Europe have caughtA(H5N1), apparently from eating infectedbirds, health officials there advise keeping petcats indoors, but no such recommendation hasbeen made in the United States.For now, officials at the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention say it is safe to havebird feeders, and they note that even if the virusdoes arrive here, the kinds of birds that perch atfeeders are far less likely to carry A(H5N1)than are aquatic birds like ducks and geese.Q. Is it safe to buy imported featherpillows, down coats or comforters andclothing or jewelry with feathers?A. Imported feathers may not be safe. There isa risk to handling products made with feathersfrom countries with outbreaks of bird flu, accordingto the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention.Feathers from those countries are banned inthe United States unless they have been processedto destroy viruses.'"

"'06-03-27,'0','Windows runs on 330 million personal computers worldwide. Three hundred PC manufacturers around the world install Windows on their machines; thousands of devices like printers, scanners and music players plug into Windows computers; and tens of thousands of third-party software applications run on Windows. And a crucial reason Microsoft holds more than 90 percent of the PC operating system market is that the company strains to make sure software and hardware that ran on previous versions of Windows will also work on the new one -- compatibility, in computing terms.As a result, each new version of Windows carries the baggage of its past. As Windows has grown, the technical challenge has become increasingly daunting. Several thousand engineers have labored to build and test Windows Vista, a sprawling, complex software construction project with 50 million lines of code, or more than 40 percent larger than Windows XP.""Windows is now so big and onerous because of the size of its code base, the size of its ecosystem and its insistence on compatibility with the legacy hardware and software, that it just slows everything down,"" observed David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ""That's why a company like Apple has such an easier time of innovation.""Microsoft certainly understands the problem, the need to change and the potential long-term threat to its business from rivals like Apple, the free Linux operating system, and from companies like Google that distribute software as a service over the Internet.In an internal memo last October, Ray Ozzie, chief technical officer, who joined Microsoft last year, wrote, ""Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges and it causes end-user and administrator frustration.""Last Monday afternoon, James Allchin, the longtime engineering executive who leads the Vista team, held a meeting with 75 Windows managers and senior engineers to discuss the status of Vista. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Allchin met with a handful of his lieutenants and told them of the decision to push back the consumer introduction, a move that was announced publicly later that day, after the close of the stock market.Brad Goldberg, a general manager of Windows program management, who attended the Tuesday morning meeting, said he was not surprised, because he had been involved in the decision. ""But it's a different place than Microsoft a few years ago would have wound up,"" he said.Like other Microsoft executives, Mr. Goldberg bristles at the notion that little innovative work has come out of the Windows group since XP. In the last five years, he said, Microsoft has released two versions of the Windows Tablet PC software intended for pen-based notebook computers, and four versions of Windows Media Center. To combat viruses plaguing Windows, much of the engineering team focused for 18 months on fixing security flaws for a downloadable ""service pack"" in 2004.""The perception that nothing new has come out of the Windows group since XP is just so far from the truth,"" Mr. Goldberg said.But last Thursday, Microsoft reorganized the management of its Windows division. Steven Sinofsky, 40, a senior vice president, was placed in charge of product planning and engineering for Windows and Windows Live, a new Web service that lets consumers manage their e-mail accounts, instant messaging, blogs, photos and podcasts in one site.Mr. Sinofsky, a former technical assistant to Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, was one of the early people in the company to recognize the importance of the Internet in the 1990's. He comes to the Windows job from heading Microsoft's big Office division, where he was known for bringing out new versions of the Office suite -- Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and other offerings -- on schedule every two or three years.The move is seen as an effort to bring greater discipline to the Windows group. ""But this doesn't seem to do anything to address the core Windows problem; Windows is too big and too complex,"" said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The Vista delay, Microsoft executives said, was only a matter of a few more weeks to improve quality further, not attributable to any single flaw and done to make sure all its industry partners were ready when the product was introduced. Vista will be ready for large corporate customers in November, while the consumer rollout is being pushed back to January 2007.Mr. Allchin conceded in an interview that the decision was ""a bit painful,"" but he insisted it was the ""right thing."" Mr. Allchin, 54, will continue to work on Vista until it ships and then retire, as he said he would last year.Microsoft will not say so, but antitrust considerations may have played a role in the decision that Mr. Allchin called the right thing to do. As part of its antitrust settlement, Microsoft vowed to treat PC makers even-handedly, after evidence in the trial that Microsoft had rewarded some PC makers with better pricing or more marketing help in exchange for giving Microsoft products an edge over competing software.In the last few weeks, Microsoft met with major PC makers and retailers to discuss Vista. Hewlett-Packard, the second-largest PC maker after Dell, is a leader in the consumer market. Yet unlike Dell, Hewlett-Packard sells extensively through retailers, whose orders must be taken and shelves stocked. That takes time.Hewlett-Packard, according to a person close to the company who asked not to be identified because he was told the information confidentially, informed Microsoft that unless Vista was locked down and ready by August, Hewlett-Packard would be at a disadvantage in the year-end sales season.Vista was also held up because the project was restarted in the summer of 2004. By then, it became clear to Mr. Allchin and others inside Microsoft that the way they were trying to build the new version of Windows, then called Longhorn, would not work. Two years' worth of work was scrapped, and some planned features were dropped, like an intelligent data storage system called WinFS.The new work, Microsoft decided, would take a new approach. Vista was built more in small modules that then fit together like Lego blocks, making development and testing easier to manage.""They did the right thing in deciding that the Longhorn code was a tangled, hopeless mess, and starting over,"" said Mr. Cusumano of M.I.T. ""But Vista is still an enormous, complex structure.""Skeptics like Mr. Cusumano say that fixing the Windows problem will take a more radical approach, a willingness to walk away from its legacy. One instructive example, they say, is what happened at Apple.Remember that Steven P. Jobs came back to Apple because the company's effort to develop an ambitious new operating system, codenamed Copland, had failed. Mr. Jobs convinced Apple to buy his company Next Inc. for $400 million in December 1996 for its operating system.It took Mr. Jobs and his team years to retool and tailor the Next operating system into what became Macintosh OS X. When it arrived in 2001, the new system essentially walked away from Apple's previous operating system, OS 9. Software applications written for OS 9 would run on an OS X machine, but only by firing up the old operating system separately.The approach was somewhat ungainly, but it allowed Apple to move to a new technology, a more stable, elegantly designed operating system. The one sacrifice was that OS X would not be compatible with old Macintosh programs, a step Microsoft has always refused to take with Windows.""Microsoft feels it can't get away with breaking compatibility,"" said Mendel Rosenblum, a Stanford University computer scientist. ""All of their applications must continue to run, and from an architectural point of view that's a very painful thing.""It is also costly in terms of time, money and manpower. Where Microsoft has thousands of engineers on its Windows team, Apple has a lean development group of roughly 350 programmers and fewer than 100 software testers, according to two Apple employees who spoke on the condition that they not be identified.And Apple had the advantage of building on software from university laboratories, an experimental version of the Unix operating system developed at Carnegie Mellon University and a free variant of Unix from the University of California, Berkeley. That helps explain why a small team at Apple has been able to build an operating system rich in features with nearly as many lines of code as Microsoft's Windows.And Apple, which makes operating systems that run only on its own computers, does not have to work with the massive business ecosystem of Microsoft, with its hundreds of PC makers and thousands of third-party software companies.That ballast is also Microsoft's great strength, and a reason industry partners and computer users stick with Windows, even if its size and strategy slow innovation. Unless Microsoft can pick up the pace, ""consumers may simply end up with a more and more inferior operating system over time, which is sad,"" said Mr. Yoffie of the Harvard Business School.'"

"'06-03-27,'0','Apple Computer will meet the Beatles' Apple Corps in court this week in London, where a judge will determine whether Apple Computer's iTunes online music service violates a 1991 agreement between the two companies that, the Beatles' Apple claims, blocked the computer maker from selling music.Apple Corps, which represents the Beatles' business interests and markets their post-1968 recordings on disc, wants the computer firm to stop using the Apple trademark to sell recordings online, along with unspecified damages. Apple, the maker of Macs and iPods, said the 1991 agreement permitted using the Apple name to sell online data transfers, which are what downloaded songs amount to.The judge hearing the case, Justice Edward Mann, is an iPod user, but neither side has asked him to recuse himself.This is the third time the two companies have sparred. Apple Corps first sued Apple Computer in 1980 over the use of its name; a modest settlement was accompanied by an agreement that stipulated that Apple Computer, then a Silicon Valley start-up, would stay out of the music business. In 1989, after newer hardware and software made it easier to use Macintosh computers to synthesize sound, the Beatles' company sued again, resulting in a $26.5 million settlement in 1991 that left Macs able to edit and play back sound files but not create music. After the iTunes music store and software were introduced in April 2003, the record company filed suit a third time.The Beatles set up Apple Corps in 1968, partly as a tax shelter. These days the firm, led by Neil Aspinall, a longtime Beatles confidant, functions as record label, merchandiser and general defender of the Beatles' business rights. Apple Records has reissued original Beatles recordings on CD, as well as the mid-1990's Beatles singles ""Free as a Bird"" and ""Real Love"" and a DVD of George Harrison's 1971 Concert for Bangladesh.While Apple Records has made no effort to sell or license music online and none of the Beatles' recordings are yet available for legal download anywhere, Apple Computer announced on Feb. 23 that it had sold a billion songs through iTunes.'"

"'06-03-28,'0','Then, on March 2, after an independent panel found that the mission was running 20 percent over its $373 million budget, NASA killed the mission. About $257 million had already been spent, and about half of the hardware, including the scientific instruments, had been built.An uproar followed among the project's scientists and managers, who said that problem areas like the fuel tank had been largely overcome and that the orbits of Ceres and Vista would not allow another two-for-one asteroid mission for years.Many also saw it as further evidence that NASA was cannibalizing its science missions to pay for the space shuttle and the space station and future plans to send astronauts back to the Moon.NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is building the Dawn spacecraft, appealed the decision, a new process put in place as part of an agency reorganization by the agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin. A group led by Rex D. Geveden, a NASA associate administrator, conducted a review, and in a telephone news conference yesterday, Mr. Geveden said the technical issues had now been resolved to his satisfaction.""There's work to do,"" Mr. Geveden said, ""but the way forward seems pretty clear.""NASA now estimates that Dawn will cost $446 million, an increase of $73 million.Colleen Hartman, deputy associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate, said NASA's 2007 budget already took into account a 20 percent increase in Dawn's budget, so the reinstatement would not lead to additional cuts in other missions.Because of favorable alignment of the orbits, the one-year delay in launching will not delay the spacecraft's arrival at the asteroids.Asteroids are remnants of the solar system's formation 4.6 billion years ago, pieces of a planet that failed to coalesce between Mars and Jupiter. Studying the largest miniplanets should provide valuable clues to the formation of the Sun and the planets.Dr. McFadden said recent observations from Earth showed that asteroids were more interesting than once thought. ""They're not just rocks in space,"" she said. ""They're planets.""Ceres, for example, is rounder than expected, she said, suggesting that it could have an interior structure with different layers of different materials, much like the larger planets. The roundness could be the result of an underground layer of ice that offsets the force of spinning.Photographs of Vesta taken by the Hubble Space Telescope show craters and ancient lava flows.'"
"'06-03-28,'0','""Why would a particular virus be transmitted easily human to human, and another not?"" asked Dr. Peter Palese, chairman of microbiology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. ""Even though I am 35 years in this field, we do not have molecular parameters or signatures which make that clear, although many groups, including my own, are working on this exact question.""The virus is a moving target, and two distinct subsets of it have developed, one from Vietnam and one from Indonesia, that differ enough to make scientists think separate vaccines will be needed. Scientists are trying to understand how a virus can be wildly contagious among birds but almost impossible to spread in mammals — and what type of mutation could change that. They are also comparing different strains of A(H5N1) to see if it is becoming more virulent, and they are examining the structure of the virus in hopes of figuring out what makes it so deadly.Ferrets are used for some studies because, unlike mice, they easily catch human flu viruses and get sick, and so are considered a better model for people. At the disease centers, Taronna Maines and Terrence Tumpey have infected ferrets with A(H5N1) and then monitored them to see if the severity of the disease varies by strain and by dose, and to see if the infected animals cough up the virus or sneeze it out and spread it to healthy ones.It turns out that ferrets do not transmit the disease easily, though some healthy animals develop antibodies to the virus, indicating that they have been exposed. If a strain comes along that is contagious in ferrets, it might be bad news for people.Research like this may help determine whether (A)H5N1 is heading down the path to becoming a pandemic strain, and may also help to guide the development of vaccines and drugs.Aside from the virus's recent horrible track record, several other things about it can help explain why some scientists worry that it has pandemic potential. The A means it belongs to a larger group known as Type A influenza viruses, which cause many of the human flu epidemics that occur every winter. But more ominously, Type A also includes the only viruses ever known to have caused human pandemics, in 1918, 1957 and 1968.Flu viruses mutate a lot, and pandemics occur when a Type A virus undergoes a big genetic change to produce a new type of virus to which people have little or no resistance. Sometimes the change occurs when a person or a pig acts as a ""mixing vessel"" for two flu viruses — maybe a human one and a bird one — which swap genes to produce a new virus. That kind of change is believed to have caused the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. But the 1918 pandemic, the worst by far, is thought to have occurred without a gene swap, when a bird flu somehow mutated enough to jump into humans.All Type A viruses are found in birds. They probably originated in wild birds and usually do them little or no harm. Only a few evolved into strains that could easily infect people. A(H5N1) is not adapted to people, and researchers suspect that human victims so far may have been infected because they were exposed to enormous amounts of the virus from birds.The letters H and N stand for two proteins on the outside of all Type A viruses. The H, hemagglutinin, helps the virus get into cells, which it must do to reproduce. The N, neuraminidase, helps it get back out to infect more cells. There are 16 kinds of H and 9 kinds of N; they mix and match, and so can produce 144 possible Type A strains. The worrisome thing about H5 is that H5 viruses are avian flus and have not been known to cause human epidemics, so many people may have little or no resistance to them.Not long ago, A(H5N1) may well have been what scientists call a perfect parasite, meaning one that does little harm to its host, Dr. Ruben Donis, a flu expert at the disease centers. said. Some wild ducks seem to carry it without getting sick at all, so scientists think that ducks were probably its original host and that the two evolved together into a peaceful coexistence: the virus did not hurt the duck, and the duck's immune system ignored the virus. Thriving in the bird's intestines, the virus multiplied rapidly and was spread far and wide by droppings. Other aquatic birds may have adapted in a similar way.Not so for chickens or other domestic fowl: A(H5N1) attacks their lungs and other organs, and it quickly kills them. But the chicken's immune system tries to fight back, and that battle may alter the virus. The bird may fight off some viruses, ones with certain mutations. Other viruses survive, multiply and become more common. And since they have beaten out the chicken's immune system, they may also be nastier.It is just a theory, but some scientists suspect that its forays into huge poultry flocks may have brought out more virulent forms of A(H5N1), which may explain why the virus now seems to be killing off more wild birds than in the past. At the same time, the virus has begun to invade more species, including mammals — infected cats, pigs and dogs have been reported. Researchers consider that a bad sign.""The more opportunities this virus has to mutate during replication in a mammalian host, the more likely it is to mutate,"" said Dr. Nancy Cox, director of the influenza branch at the disease centers.In the laboratory, Dr. Maines and Dr. Tumpey have found that the virus seems to have become more virulent over time. With some strains, an unbelievably small amount of virus will kill a mouse, Dr. Tumpey said. Last September, in the Journal of Virology, they reported that viruses from people infected in 2003 and 2004 were more deadly in mice and ferrets than were samples taken from 1997 victims. But there is not enough information about the human cases to tell whether the disease in people has gotten more severe.Recent studies by several research teams have focused on hemagglutinin. The virus can attach only to cells that have the right receptors — compatible molecules on their surfaces. Many scientists think hemagglutinin, and mutations that change its structure, may control where the virus can go and what it can do. For instance, hemagglutinin may determine which species the virus can infect and which tissues it can invade.The more organs and tissues a virus can attack, the more likely it is to cause severe disease. Scientists are especially interested in a part of the hemagglutinin that sets A(H5N1) apart from many other bird flu viruses by enabling it, in some species at least, to latch onto many types of cells and thus to cause systemic disease.Studies published recently in Science and Nature by two research groups suggested that one reason A(H5N1) is not transmissible among people is that the virus can latch on only to cells deep in the respiratory tract, too far down to be coughed up or sneezed out to infect other people. They discovered that only the deeper cells had the right type of receptors.But if the virus were to mutate so that it could connect with cells higher in the respiratory tract, then it might become transmissible. Several mutations would be needed, and virologists disagree about whether they are likely to occur.Another major unanswered question concerns how severe bird flu really is in people. Based on cases in hospitals, it looks like a horrific disease with a 50 percent death rate.But what if some people get infected and recover without seeing a doctor, or never get sick at all, and so are not counted? Then, the death rate would be lower.A study published in January in The Archives of Internal Medicine suggests that there may be mild, unreported bird flu cases. Over a three-month period in 2004, researchers studied 45,478 residents in a rural district in Vietnam that had A(H5N1) outbreaks to find out how many had contact with sick birds and how many had flulike illnesses.They found that statistically, those exposed to sick birds were most likely to have gotten sick, and of 8,149 who had a flulike illness, 650 to 750 probably caught it from birds. The study was not conclusive because the researchers did not test their subjects to find out for sure whether they had A(H5N1).But if human cases are more common than previously thought, it could be both good news and bad news: good if not everyone becomes deathly ill, but not good if more people are infected and might act as the dreaded ""mixing vessels"" that could let A(H5N1) trade genes with an ordinary human flu virus and produce a new, highly contagious strain that could turn into a pandemic.""The viruses are changing, and in ways of concern to me and other scientists,"" Dr. Cox said.She said scientists had a unique window of opportunity now, in which they could see the disease in both birds and people and try to stop it or at least slow it down.""Could we quench an incipient pandemic?"" Dr. Cox asked. ""I don't know, but we could try.""'"
"'06-03-28,'0','""For years, they have been telling us it's going to happen — and it hasn't,"" said Dr. Farrar, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit at the hospital in Vietnam. ""Billions of chickens in Asia have been infected and millions of people lived with them — we in Asia are intimate with our poultry — and less than 200 people have gotten infected.""That tells you that the constraints on the virus are considerable,"" he continued. ""It must be hard for this virus to jump.""Still, a part of Dr. Farrar is terrified of A(H5N1) — ""a very nasty virus,"" he calls it — which he has watched kill healthy young people, devouring their lungs.In the last year, the virus has extended its range in birds from Eastern China to Western Africa. Over time, it has expanded the variety of species it can infect, including ferrets and cats.""That is alarming,"" he acknowledges in the understated British way.Like all responsible scientists, Dr. Farrar believes the world should prepare. But schooled in places where people die of real and present diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, he finds the ""doomsday"" predictions sketched out by some international officials unhelpful, more fantasy than fact.And even if these officials' dire forecasts were to come true, he says, many of their elaborate pandemic preparedness plans are unworkable in developing countries, which do not have the resources or medical facilities to comply.""I think you have to say we really don't know the odds of pandemic, and people are not comfortable with that,"" Dr. Farrar said. ""It could fizzle out and kill 98 people — one more than the number dead today. Or it could be something like 200 million,"" closer to an estimate once made by Dr. David Nabarro, chief avian flu coordinator for the United Nations.""It's terrifying if it happens, but it is very, very unlikely, I think — and it is difficult to balance those facts.""At the Tropical Disease Hospital in Vietnam, doctors have been doing just that, bracing for a pandemic that may never come, since long before it became fashionable in the West.Before Vietnam began vaccinating poultry in mid-2005, the disease was rampant among birds there. Of the world's 186 confirmed human cases, 93 are from Vietnam. There have been no new cases this year.But in the Tropical Diseases Hospital, doctors and nurses still don full bio-protective gear when they evaluate suspected cases, because ""you don't know if the next one will mark the start of human to human transmission,"" Dr. Farrar said.With each new patient, they assiduously try to follow international scientific recommendations. But their on-the-ground experience reveals holes in the neat strategies coming from United Nations experts in Geneva and Rome.The World Health Organization suggests that it might be possible to contain a pandemic by quickly diagnosing index cases, identifying contacts, prescribing all antiviral drugs, and quarantining, for example.In response, Dr. Farrar shows a picture of the home of a patient: a hut on stilts by the Mekong River. When that patient fell ill, he took a boat to the local health station, and was transferred to the district hospital, Dr. Farrar says. Later, an ambulance took him to Ho Chi Minh City, where genetic analysis showed that he had avian influenza, instead of typical pneumonia. If bird flu ever gained the ability to spread easily among humans, that patient would have infected thousands before diagnosis.""You've got to act quickly, but the process now takes many days,"" Dr. Farrar said, suggesting that more money for clinics, labs and experts should be flowing to developing nations.""Then you're supposed to go back to the village and saturate it with oseltamivir?"" he asks, using the generic name for the antiviral drug Tamiflu. ""What do the villagers do when they hear the man has bird flu? They don't sit still; they get on buses and flee and stay with relatives in other villages,"" potentially spreading it there.For doctors in Vietnam, human cases of avian influenza have been a frightening reality for more than three years, and Dr. Farrar vividly remembers the initial terror of the devoted hospital staff, unsure if they could catch bird flu from patients.""Look at this lung — there's nothing there,"" he said pulling up the X-ray of a patient who is back at the university, but whose left chest shows a vast empty cavern. Studies from the hospital have taught the world much about A(H5N1): humans took longer to clear this virus than normal influenza, for example, and Tamiflu can quickly breed resistant strains.But, to Dr. Farrar's chagrin, the treatment options have not really improved.Flu vaccines are still manufactured by an ""ancient strategy"" that involves injecting eggs with virus, he complained, even as other vaccines rely on more sophisticated methods. As a result, flu vaccines — including experimental versions aimed at A(H5N1) — are cumbersome to produce, and target just one strain.""What we need is a vaccine that is effective across strains because the virus can be different each year,"" he said. ""My mom in the U.K. can get a shot every year, but that is not realistic in rural Asia.""More remarkable still, he said, Tamiflu is still the only drug useful against avian influenza, ""and we all know that one drug is not adequate to treat any viral disease,"" he said, noting that multiple drugs are used in AIDS.Patients at Dr. Farrar's Hospital are given Tamiflu, and it appears to help some. ""It's all that we have,"" he said. ""So if I was sick, I'd certainly want to get it.""But, he rues the lack of international research and coordination to tackle a disease that has been in Asia for nearly 10 years. For example, he said, although Vietnam has greatly reduced the number of bird flu outbreaks by vaccinating poultry, no one knows if the vaccine puts pressure on A(H5N1) to mutate to develop resistance to the shot, which could cause a rebound of disease in the coming years.Personally, Dr. Farrar remains optimistic, believing a pandemic will not come. If A(H5N1) changed so that it readily infected people, it would probably become less deadly, he said.But if disaster happens, he says: ""People will look back and say: 'This was a nasty virus that you knew could sometimes infect other species. Why didn't you do something? All you had was a single effective drug and no vaccine?' ""'"
"'06-03-28,'0','But the effort was suspended shortly after it began because a paralyzing ailment, Guillain-Barré syndrome, occurred among a small number of the 42 million vaccine recipients.A few cases of the syndrome had been linked to influenza vaccine, but government officials failed to mention the risk in the consent form or to discuss it publicly.The feared killer disease never came. But by the time the effort ended, 535 cases of Guillain-Barré had been diagnosed, including 23 deaths, outnumbering the mostly mild 230 cases of swine flu at Fort Dix. The virus did not spread. The immunization plan was a fiasco. Health officials were dismissed, some say unfairly.The episode has become a textbook case in training a new generation of health officials about the dangers of sounding warnings too early without having a well-thought-out plan.The opposite problem — failing to warn about preparations for an outbreak — occurred in 2001.Shortly after Sept. 11, Tommy G. Thompson, then the secretary of health and human services, went on national television to assure Americans that the government was fully prepared to respond to any bioterrorism attack.Within days, the deliberate release of anthrax spores through the postal system proved him wrong. The outbreak was small — 22 cases, including 5 deaths. But it showed how poorly the government communicated in a timely way to doctors and the public. It left many government officials wanting never to be perceived as underreacting to a health threat.The two episodes led many people to lose trust in government health warnings, or in the lack of them.Warnings about A(H5N1) avian influenza began in 1997, when scientists in Hong Kong discovered that that strain of virus had jumped directly to cause disease in humans without first mixing in pigs, which had been the pattern until then. With the spread of the virus among birds, officials have warned that it could mutate, combine with a human influenza virus and create a new one to cause a human pandemic.That has not happened, although 105 of the 186 people in the world who have developed A(H5N1) avian influenza have died.Should health officials risk issuing stern warnings that may frighten people? Or should officials play it safe, going about their business and informing the public only when a pandemic becomes real?If officials do issue early warnings, and nothing happens, they stand to lose credibility among people who say that scientists promoted the worst possibilities to grab more grants and waste taxpayer dollars.If officials do not issue early or timely warnings, and a pandemic occurs, critics will say the public was not informed and protected in time.The situation also leaves health officials vulnerable to charges of ""I told you so,"" even though there is often no way to prove that the Monday morning quarterbacks actually made their criticisms known at the time key decisions had to be made.Two types of dilemmas are often involved in deciding when and what warning to give, said Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, who wrote a book with Richard E. Neustadt in 1978 analyzing the government's and industry's responses to the swine flu immunization program.One is like a Category 5 hurricane with long odds on its occurring, but with devastating consequences if it does.""In such cases, the naysayer is most often going to be right,"" said Dr. Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, said in an interview, referring to those who contend preparation is unnecessary.The second dilemma involves a tension that can arise when scientists believe that political leaders and the public do not understand risk as well as scientists do. Problems can arise if an expert believes action is needed because the risk of an outbreak is, say, 10 percent, but perceives that government officials will consider 10 percent to be too low for action to be taken.So the scientist may choose a way to present the facts and estimates to persuade government officials to do what the scientist believes is correct.In deciding whether to warn and act, the tendency is often ""reluctance to do something that may cause harm as opposed to allowing nature to create its own harm,"" Dr. Fineberg said.Last year, the Bush administration released a comprehensive plan to counter an influenza pandemic. Even with it, the dilemma of when to warn will remain.'"

"'06-03-28,'0','Here's what I think that all portends.One, domestic fares will rise more than some industry analysts have been predicting. Given high oil prices, airlines still cannot make money at current fare levels.Two, projections for steadily growing demand for domestic air travel may be overly optimistic. That is because a certain percentage of demand, mostly leisure travel, has been driven in recent years by rock-bottom fares. That bottom-rung leisure niche -- its size is unknown because so many business travelers jump into it when it is convenient -- is extremely price-sensitive. If air fares increase significantly, and they have been edging up week by week, leisure demand may start eroding.Three, if and when that happens, major airlines are going to be looking for more support from their most loyal and lucrative customers, frequent business fliers, who have to continue flying. But, as noted here last week, airlines have lost the loyalty of a good number of those customers, especially the ones who maintain elite status levels.That is because elite status benefits like upgrades and first chance at choice coach cabin assignments like exit rows and aisle seats have been sharply reduced. Last year, airlines cut first-class fares to the point where flying in first class now often costs little more than flying full-fare coach -- meaning fewer first-class seats were available as free upgrades. And airplanes are now flying full, and choice seats are booked well in advance on many flights, without regard to status.There was a lot of reaction to last week's column about what many business travelers, myself included, see as the deterioration of elite status programs. A good number of readers said that they, like me, were so unhappy with the decline in benefits for maintaining loyalty that they had simply given up on working to hit the annual mileage mark for elite status.A small number of mileage geeks, devout believers in the sanctity of frequent-flier programs, were hostile toward my suggestion that the elite status game was not worth the effort.But a significant number of other readers also pointed out something that anyone who understands simple industry economics readily concedes. ""You have been flying on unbelievably cheap fares long enough,"" one fellow wrote. ""The airlines and their employees have subsidized you and all travelers. It is time for you to start paying a fair price for your safe air travel and stop the whining.""I believe he is correct about fares. But elite status members who feel alienated despite their loyalty certainly are not whining when they say they are now looking at air travel as a commodity. They are simply making rational buying decisions without regard to brand loyalty anymore.Mr. Bisignani acknowledged that the days of fares sold below costs were waning. Fares ""have been quite low for some time,"" he said, adding, ""They will increase.""'"
"'06-03-28,'0','To some, Google is a novice arriving late to the table. To others, the company's embedding on K Street, which serves as home to many of Washington's top lobbyists, represents a new and not necessarily welcome sign of sophistication.""It's sad,"" said Esther Dyson, editor of the technology newsletter Release 1.0 and former chairwoman of Icann, a nonprofit group that plays a role in Internet administration. ""The kids are growing up. They've lost youth and innocence. Now they have to start being grown-ups and playing at least to some extent by grown-up rules.""In doing so, Google provides another example of how Internet companies, no matter how unconventional their roots or nonconformist their corporate cultures, increasingly find themselves wrestling with the same forces in Washington that more traditional industries have long faced. Google's executives consider the moves necessary as they achieve a prominence that allows them to elbow their own interests onto the political stage.""We've staked out an agenda that really is about promoting the open Internet as a revolutionary platform for communication,"" said Alan Davidson, brought on board less than a year ago as the company's policy counsel to set up offices in the Penn Quarter area of Washington. ""It's been the growth of Google as a company and as a presence in the industry that has prompted our engagement in Washington.""Even as they emphasize policy over politics to raise their profile, Google executives and advisers are also fully aware that they are embracing the lobbying world at a time when it has been rocked by the Jack Abramoff scandal of influence peddling. Some advisers say the company may wait until after Congress decides whether or how to overhaul lobbying laws before it wades more deeply into fund-raising and politics.With its stock price closing on Monday near $370 a share and its vaulting onto the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index this week, the company also cannot afford to be caught flat-footed by regulatory agencies or its competitors.""They are brilliant engineers,"" said Lauren Maddox, a principal in the bipartisan lobbying firm Podesta Mattoon that was hired by Google last year. ""They are not politicians.""In signing on Podesta Mattoon and other consultants, Google is spreading its lobbying dollars on both sides of the political aisle, increasing its spending on outside firms this year to well beyond $500,000, officials said, although that does not include its own new office complex or payments to some of the consulting groups being added on. (By comparison, the giant Microsoft spent almost $9 million last year in lobbying, and Yahoo spent more than $1 million for just part of last year, according to partial-year filings compiled by PoliticalMoneyLine, an independent campaign finance Internet site.)Podesta Mattoon is led by Anthony Podesta, a Democrat, and Daniel Mattoon, a Republican and longtime friend of Speaker Hastert, an Illinois Republican. The speaker's son Joshua also works at the firm, along with Ms. Maddox, a former top aide to Newt Gingrich.Adding to its arsenal is the DCI Group, a firm with top-flight corporate clients and strong ties to Mr. Mehlman and Karl Rove, President Bush's senior political adviser. DCI, Google officials say, will help it establish links to Republicans, as well as promote its book search project, an effort to make the full text of books searchable online, among publishers and authors.At the helm of that operation is Stuart Roy, senior vice president of DCI and a former aide to Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas. Mr. Roy also counts as a client Progress for America, the conservative group that successfully rallied grass-roots support for Mr. Bush's Supreme Court nominees.Ms. Maddox said Google's emerging army of advisers would help it fight fires along several policy lines, including copyright law, access to the Internet and privacy issues like its successful court fight this month to narrow a Justice Department subpoena over disclosure of its users' searches.""We have a team of Republicans and Democrats who are helping them sort out these issues,"" Ms. Maddox said, an effort that recognizes that the ""policy process is an extension of the market battlefield.""The big Internet companies, including Google, are bracing for an uphill struggle with lawmakers and the titans of the telephone and cable industries over whether fees should be charged for heavy data traffic, like video streaming over broadband width.""Our belief is that this is going to be an issue of great concern for consumers,"" Mr. Davidson said. ""The telephone companies have been lobbying these committees for generations. Our industry is very young.""Google's political awakening was nowhere more evident than on Capitol Hill last month, when it, Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Yahoo were slammed by Republicans and Democrats alike over business dealings in China. Elliot Schrage, vice president for global communications and public affairs at Google, was lashed repeatedly with the company's motto, ""Don't Be Evil,"" as House members accused the corporations of abetting China's government in censoring Internet communications and imperiling the safety of Chinese Internet surfers.It is an issue that Google and others know will not go away soon. Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, and other legislators are demanding that Internet companies be more sensitive when dealing with foreign countries.""I think they are just going to lobby to spread this yarn that by being there, they're going to spread democracy,"" said Mr. Smith, who presided at the hearing. ""This dictatorship can go on for generations if it's not unchecked.""Mr. Davidson said companies were trying to address the prickly subject. ""I think we all said in our testimony that we were serious about trying to work out standards for engaging in countries where these kinds of censorship issues come up,"" he said.By some accounts, China may be so radioactive that even a longstanding relationship with Congress would not have tempered that hostile reception. But ""the lack of a presence is what they recognized needed to get remediedfast,"" said Harry W. Clark, managing partner of the Stanwich Group, who has just been hired as a management consultant for Google. A veteran adviser to Internet corporations, Mr. Clark is a tightly connected Republican who worked in the Bush administration and who is now doing volunteer work for Senator McCain, an Arizona Republican.Google's recruitment of heavy hitters in the nation's capital has not stopped. While it had already retained the firms of Public Policy Partners and Capital Tax Solutions, the headhunter Russell Reynolds Associates is in the midst of a search to fill a senior position alongside Mr. Davidson. Mr. Clark also predicted that Google would name a political director, probably a Republican.Because some Republicans still view the company as Democratic-leaning, citing the 2004 election analyses that showed nearly all its employees' contributions went to Democrats, the company will be careful, Mr. Clark said, to spread its wealth around.""The folks I've talked to,"" he added, ""everybody recognizes that the employee contributions were weighted heavily toward Democrats, and they're waiting to see a course correction.""And despite the climate of indictments and investigations that pervades K Street right now, industry experts say Google has no choice but to get into the arena.Rhett Dawson, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, admonished that lobbying was not ""a dirty word."" Google, Mr. Dawson noted, ""is quickly going through a maturation phase that a lot of companies have gone through that shows it pays to pay attention to Washington or it can hurt you in ways that don't reflect well on you.""He added, ""It doesn't have to be a system that makes you embarrassed to talk to your mother about.""'"
"'06-03-28,'0','The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, overseen by the Treasury Department, reviews deals that give foreigners control over operations involving classified matters, export-controlled information, American infrastructure regarded as vital or a sole-source supplier to the Defense Department.The committee starts with a 30-day formal review, which can be expanded into a 45-day investigation, and if the matter is still unresolved, the deal could be forwarded to the White House for a presidential decision.Bell Labs was created by American Telephone and Telegraph in 1925 as a wide-ranging research and development center for new technologies in conjunction with its equipment subsidiary, Western Electric, which evolved into Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J.The unit, whose researchers helped develop groundbreaking technologies like the transistor and the Unix computer system, was called upon by successive administrations to aid the military during World War II and the cold war.""It was the equivalent of the national laboratories,"" said Narain Gehani, a 23-year Bell Labs veteran who wrote ""Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel"" (2003, Silicon Press).After the 1984 breakup of A.T.&T., Bell Labs' involvement in military work started tapering off and fell off more sharply when it became part of an independent Lucent in 1996. A year later, Lucent sold one of its last military businesses, a unit that made submarine surveillance systems based in Greensboro, N.C., to General Dynamics for $284 million.In recent years, however, Lucent has given new emphasis to government business, largely as a source of lucrative and stable military and intelligence communications contracts, after many of its commercial customers went bankrupt or severely scaled back spending on equipment.At a November meeting with Wall Street analysts, for instance, Lucent executives said its business running communications networks for governments had grown 50 percent in 2005 and 100 percent in 2004. It highlighted a $100 million contract to rebuild and modernize Iraq's communications system and a $242 million contract to modernize a United States Army network.But when asked to quantify the company's business with the government, a spokesman said yesterday that Lucent did not break that information out.Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Va., said, ""Compared with the cold war, Lucent's activity today has much less of a military cast.""But he also noted that the Bush administration's drive to modernize the military into a more agile and responsive force was greatly benefiting Lucent and other communications vendors. ""The technologies which Lucent is engaged in are at the cutting edge of military innovation,"" Mr. Thompson said.Some of the work has a decidedly futuristic focus, like an $11.5 million grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to develop high-speed wireless networks that can be quickly assembled to allow troops to communicate with one another on battlefields.Several former Lucent and Bell Labs officials said that over the years a small Bell Labs team based in Whippany, N.J., had been dedicated to classified projects and that even senior executives were not fully aware of the group's work because they lacked the requisite security clearances.Former Bell Labs researchers say the government is financing an increasing share of the basic research done at the labs, because scarce corporate dollars are reserved for commercial product development.""Unlike the rest of the company, in research, the major funding comes from the government,"" said Robert W. Lucky, who worked at Bell Labs for three decades before leaving in 1992. He sits on the Defense Science Board, which advises the Pentagon.Mr. Lucky and other experts said that they expected that Bell Labs' close ties to the government would mean extra scrutiny especially from an increasingly protectionist Congress, but that the merger would ultimately be approved.So far, the Alcatel-Lucent talks have not given rise to the kind of concerns voiced after the Bush administration approved a deal for a company owned by the government of Dubai to manage some terminal operations at six American ports.A spokesman for Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said yesterday that the two deals were not comparable, because Alcatel was not a government-owned entity. (The French government owns 4.8 percent of Alcatel's shares.)Charles Walston, the spokesman, said Mr. Lautenberg was looking to see whether the deal was truly a merger of equals, ""and whether Lucent has a lot of control and if it is structured such that Bell Labs would be autonomous.""Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who took a leading role in opposing the ports deal, issued a brief statement that said, ""The Bell Labs are some of the premier research institutions in the country, and we should watch this proposed merger carefully.""Harry L. Clark, a lawyer at Dewey Ballantine who specializes in getting federal approval for foreign transactions, said the ""political dimension"" could play a role. ""For a century, Bell Labs has been a crown jewel of American research,"" he said.'"

Mr. Mantegna is identified with much the same market-friendly policies as his predecessor, and no changes are expected in an approach that has won the approval of Wall Street and the International Monetary Fund.""Brazil's economy has nothing but clear skies ahead, even though the finance minister is going through hell,"" Mr. Palocci, a Trotskyite turned fiscal conservative, said in a speech last week in São Paulo.His resignation came as the financial markets in Brazil were closing, but investors and brokerage houses had already taken the prospect that he might resign into account, and little turmoil in exchange rates or country risk ratings was expected in the next few days.The scandal that has crippled Brazil's first popularly elected left-wing government began last May, when a postal-service official was filmed accepting a small bribe while discussing government contracts. Since then, hearings in Congress and press investigations have led to accusations of tens of millions of dollars in under-the-table payments to members of Congress, as well as the illegal financing of Mr. da Silva's own presidential campaign four years ago.'"

"'06-03-29,'1','The heart of Mr. Uchitelle's book is his detailed, wide-ranging reporting. He is present, taking notes, while airline mechanics are being counseled into job training that will take them into lower-wage work. If they were not so painful, these moments would have a certain droll comedy. One mechanic ends up running a water taxi for tourists. Another goes into maintenance. Others find jobs ""throwing boxes"" at Federal Express. As one of the ex-mechanics tells Mr. Uchitelle years later: ""It is hard to look in your son's eyes and explain to him that you are making $12 an hour and know his high school friends are making that much on the side.""In one of his shrewder moves, Mr. Uchitelle goes right into the enemy camp, as it were, and looks in on a reunion of Harvard graduates, the class of '68. But even Harvard grads are among the wounded now -- some have received pink slips. Mr. Uchitelle makes a strong case that the whole middle class is at risk. During the Clinton era, the claim was that the United States was expanding high-wage, high-skilled jobs, and that the laid off could simply jump into jobs as good or better. But Mr. Uchitelle takes apart this argument. After all, he writes, as of 2004, more than 45 percent of American workers were earning $13.25 an hour or less. The jobs that the country has been ""growing"" the fastest include those like janitor, hospital orderly and cashier.It nettles Mr. Uchitelle that even the center-left politicians have said so little about this trend -- or have done so little to stop layoffs. In fact, layoffs rose faster in the first half of the 1990's than they did in the first half of the 80's. Mr. Uchitelle particularly blames Mr. Clinton. One of his chapters is titled ""A Green Light From Clinton."" Mr. Uchitelle writes: ""As much as anyone, he disconnected the Democratic party from its past, specifically its New Deal concern for job security and full employment."" Indeed, it is Mr. Uchitelle's point that it took government action to bring about the reign of layoffs.He is also clear that this began long before the Clinton presidency. Mr. Uchitelle puts special emphasis on the deregulation of many industries, the dilution of the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act of 1978 and what he regards as other political wrong turns. Still, in a brief concluding chapter, it is unclear whether Mr. Uchitelle sees any good solutions now -- including a solution that he attributes to this reviewer.In this retelling of American history, Mr. Uchitelle is baffled by the collapse of any serious resistance to these mass layoffs. Even the protestors who began to sound off in the 90's generally believed that companies did have to downsize or die. It bothers Mr. Uchitelle that the mechanics and others he covers in this book and gets to know personally often blame themselves. ""Whenever I insisted that layoffs were a phenomenon in America beyond their control, they agreed perfunctorily and then went right back to describing why it was somehow their fault or their particular bad luck.""Many readers know Mr. Uchitelle as a business journalist with an acute analytic bent. That is in this book, but there is a surprising passion as well. He urges -- demands -- that Americans speak up: not to give empty speeches about how more of us should go to college, or ""skill up,"" but to stop the layoffs from ravaging us all.BOOKS OF THE TIMES Thomas Geoghegan is a labor lawyer and author.'"
"'06-03-29,'1','They have pledged not to change their treatment of American companies and are forging ahead with ambitious expansion plans, which include direct flights from the Middle East to California, then to other United States cities that could include Houston and Chicago.To appreciate the commercial scope of the Dubai royal family's business ambitions, there may be no better gauge than the Emirates Group. In 21 years, it has grown from a fleet of two planes that flew only to Karachi, Pakistan, and Bombay, to 90 aircraft that cover routes from New York to Australia.Thanks to attentive customer service at competitive fares and in-flight perks like wide seats and hundreds of movies, Emirates may bypass the airline it most resembles, Singapore Airlines, by the end of the decade, analysts say. By 2012, Emirates may even be the most popular long-distance airline in the world, they say, surpassing American Airlines and British Airways.Dubai is ""perfectly located to be the global hub of this century,"" said Mr. Flanagan. ""Look at a map of the world, with the Americas down one side and China and Japan down the other,"" he said. ""If you balance that all on a point, that point is Dubai.""Like most government-backed Dubai companies, the chairman of Emirates is a member of the royal family -- in this case Sheik Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum -- and run by an international mix of executives. Mr. Flanagan, who was a member of the Royal Air Force of Britain and a British Airways executive, has been with Emirates since it started in 1985.Emirates is part of a group of booming businesses founded by the Maktoum family that includes real estate, a new financial center, several investment funds and DP World.Mr. Flanagan, 77, claims cheerfully that he the ""oldest and deafest"" among his airline executive peers, thanks to his stint in the Air Force at a time when wearing earmuffs was ""sissy."" He is just as cheerfully confident about Emirates' success.In the next two years, Emirates plans to add 30 planes. To give those planes a place to land and take off, Dubai's airport is expected to triple its capacity to at least 75 million passengers a year.By 2010, Emirates will have more long-distance seats than British Airways and Lufthansa, according to a Goldman Sachs report. ""All the European carriers are set to suffer as a result,"" the report said.Emirates has posted a profit for 17 years in a row, and returns more than $100 million a year to shareholders in dividends.""Not only did the airline have to be profitable, it had to be top class,"" said Peter Hill, a former Emirates executive who now runs SriLankan Airlines. ""In the culture of Dubai, there wasn't any second-best.""But its rivals have long complained that the airline receives hidden government subsidies, a claim Emirates executives have always vehemently denied.""When we started in 1985, the rules were quite clear,"" Mr. Flanagan said. ""The sheik said, 'Here's $10 million, don't come back for more.' We get nothing special.""Emirates, for example, buys its fuel from the big oil companies like other airlines; Mr. Flanagan said its fuel costs had doubled in line with market prices.Since Emirates started releasing full financial data, analysts have found little evidence to support the complaints. ""An overview of the audited financial accounts contains no material surprises once one gets used to seeing consistent profits at an airline,"" UBS said in a report.Emirates' success rest on several factors. The airline does not have the legacy costs of its American and European rivals, which include costly pension plans and benefits. It can rely on cheaper labor, generally from Asia and India. Dubai has no income taxes, and its airport imposes relatively low operating costs.Using its less expensive airport as a hub, Emirates moves passengers long distances -- the most profitable part of the business -- from New York to Singapore, or Russia to Africa, always with a stop in Dubai. Often, passengers take advantage of the break to stay a day or more in one of Dubai's luxury hotels, or do some tax-free shopping.The Emirates Group's growth has gone hand-in-glove with the construction of extravagant hotels and huge amusement parks in Dubai. The plans keep getting grander, potentially drawing more visitors and Emirates passengers. Under construction, for example, is the Dubailand theme park, expected to be twice the size of Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., with an indoor rain forest and a covered snow park.""The government has done a great job stimulating travel to the region,"" said Jonathan Wober, an analyst with HSBC in London.Emirates' growth plan has its skeptics, though.One possible negative was highlighted by the controversy over DP World: the company is relying for some of its future growth on attracting a lot more American customers. Because of its politically sensitive connection to the Middle East, that may not be easy.Emirates has developed such a strong brand in Britain and Australia that the company is seen as ""practically separate"" from the Middle East, said Damien Horth, an airline analyst with UBS in Hong Kong. ""That will be very difficult in the United States, if not impossible,"" Mr. Horth said.But Emirates' target audience of international business executives is not as wary of the Arab connection as American consumers or Washington politicians are.Emirates now runs two flights a day directly between Dubai and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. It plans to start direct flights from either Los Angeles or San Francisco in the near future.Mr. Flanagan dismissed the notion that Emirates was more vulnerable to terrorism than other airlines. ""We're accepted by all the United States authorities, who give us high marks because of security,"" he said.Long-term trends in aviation may be more of a problem, particularly as new ultralong-distance aircraft roll out from Boeing and Airbus. ""If you can fly nonstop with a competitor,"" noted Mr. Wober of HSBC, ""why connect with Dubai?""But Emirates Group is counting on getting its fair share of the growing long-distance business. It is the single largest buyer of Boeing's 777 aircraft and has encouraged Boeing to build a larger model of its new 787 jet as well. Over all, it has 37Boeing planes now flying, and 63 on order.Emirates is also by far the biggest supporter of Airbus's new superjumbo A380 aircraft, with 45 planes on order. The next closest airline has ordered a third as many planes, prompting executives from some rival airlines to refer to Emirates as ""Bank of Airbus."" Airbus declined to comment for this article.Indeed, as Mr. Flanagan noted in regard to the Boeing planes and their G.E. engines, ""All those aircraft that we've ordered and engines have viable European alternatives.""But he quickly dismissed any notion of retaliation for the DP World debacle. ""We love Boeing, we love the aircraft, we love the people that we deal with,"" Mr. Flanagan said.The only thing that could cause Emirates to order less from Boeing is ""political considerations quite beyond our control,"" he said. Asked to elaborate, Mr. Flanagan explained that the United States would have to ""force Boeing to stop selling to us.""As for the political reaction to the ports deal in the United States, ""I just can't understand it,"" Mr. Flanagan said. ""It can't be simply to embarrass the president, can it?""INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Correction: March 30, 2006, Thursday A picture caption in Business Day yesterday with an article about the Emirates Group, the Dubai airline, referred imprecisely to the airplane shown. It was made by Airbus, which has an order from the company for 45 superjumbo A380 aircraft. (Boeing has an order from the line for 63 planes, but its craft were not shown.)'"
"'06-03-29,'1','MOSCOW, March 28 - A Moscow court appointed a bankruptcy administrator on Tuesday for Yukos, once Russia's largest private oil company, pushing it closer to insolvency and the probable nationalization of its remaining assets.The action was taken on the first day of a bankruptcy hearing by the Moscow Arbitration Court, which also set a June 27 hearing to decide whether Yukos should be declared bankrupt.A bankruptcy declaration was sought by a consortium of 14 Western banks after Yukos defaulted on nearly half of $1 billion in debt.The court approved the transfer of $482 million in Yukos debt from the consortium of banks to Rosneft, the state-controlled oil company, and an organization that analysts say has positioned itself to take over Yukos's remaining two production units and its refinery network.The deal between the banks and Rosneft was arranged in advance and disclosed by Yukos this month.""Our reaction is there is nothing unexpected here,"" Andrew Smith, a Yukos spokesman, said in a telephone interview from London.

"'06-03-29,'1','American officials in Baghdad did not dispute the Shiite politicians' account of the conversation, though they would not discuss the details of the meeting. A spokeswoman for the American Embassy confirmed that Mr. Khalilzad met with Mr. Hakim on Saturday. But she declined to comment on what was said.""The decisions about the choice of the prime minister are entirely up to the Iraqis,"" said the spokeswoman, Elizabeth Colton. ""This will be an Iraqi decision.""In Washington, the State Department said it would not comment on diplomatic conversations, but Adam Ereli, the deputy spokesman, reiterated American support for ""a government of national unity with strong leadership that can unify all Iraqis.""The Americans have harshly criticized the Jaafari government in recent months for supporting Shiite militias that have been fomenting sectarian violence and pushing Iraq closer to full-scale civil war.Mr. Khalilzad has sharpened his criticism in the last week, saying the militias are now killing more people than the Sunni Arab-led insurgency. American officials have expressed growing concern that Mr. Jaafari is incapable of reining in the private armies, especially since Moktada al-Sadr, the anti-American cleric who leads the most volatile militia, is Mr. Jaafari's most powerful backer.Haider al-Ubady, a spokesman for Mr. Jaafari, said the prime minister had received the ambassador's message and accused the Americans of trying to subvert Iraqi sovereignty.Tensions between Shiite leaders and the American government, which had been rising for months, boiled over after an assault on Sunday night by American and Iraqi forces on a Shiite mosque compound in northern Baghdad.Shiite leaders say at least 17 civilians were killed in the battle, most of them members of a Shiite political party. American commanders say the soldiers fought insurgents.The reported American pressure over Mr. Jaafari's nomination is another sign of White House impatience over the deadlocked talks to form a new government. American officials say the impasse has created a power vacuum that has encouraged lawlessness and civil conflict.The nomination has become one of the most contentious issues in those talks, with the main Kurdish, Sunni Arab and secular blocs calling for the Shiites to replace Mr. Jaafari. On Monday, Shiite leaders suspended their participation in the negotiations, saying they were enraged by the assault on the mosque complex.In Baghdad on Tuesday, at least 21 people were abducted in four separate incidents in the biggest wave of kidnappings in a month, an Interior Ministry official said. In one incident, 15 men in Iraqi Army uniforms dragged at least six people from a money exchange shop and stole nearly $60,000. In two other cases, people wearing Interior Ministry commando uniforms snatched victims from two electronics shops.The police in western Baghdad discovered 14 bodies on Tuesday, all killed execution-style with gunshots to the head, apparently the latest victims of sectarian bloodletting. On Monday, Iraqi forces found 18 bodies near Baquba with similar wounds. Earlier reports of 30 beheaded bodies found in that area were wrong, the Interior Ministry official said.An American soldier was killed Tuesday by small-arms fire in Baghdad, and another was killed and three were wounded by a roadside bomb outside Habbaniya, the American military said.The Iraqi security minister, Abdul Karim al-Enizi, said on the state-run Iraqiya network on Tuesday night that the Iraqi forces who had raided the mosque compound in Baghdad were not part of the Interior or Defense Ministry. A survivor said the soldiers did not speak Arabic well, implying they may have been Kurdish militiamen working with Americans, Mr. Enizi said.At the Pentagon, senior officials defended the raid, releasing photographs they said proved that weapons and bomb-making materials had been seized inside the compound, which they described as a school complex that had been turned into a base for a ""hostage ring.""When the soldiers entered the compound, ""they found that there was a building there that had a small minaret and a prayer room inside it,"" said Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Some people are calling that a mosque.""The surge in violence has shaken confidence in Mr. Jaafari, who has been widely criticized by Iraqis for failing to smash the Sunni-led insurgency, letting Shiite death squads run rampant and doing little on reconstruction.Mr. Jaafari won the Shiite bloc's nomination for prime minister by one vote in a secret ballot of its members of Parliament, beating out the deputy of Mr. Hakim, the bloc's leader. As the largest bloc, with 130 of the 275 seats, the Shiites have the right to nominate the prime minister.But a two-thirds vote of Parliament is required for approval of the new government. As long as the other major blocs oppose Mr. Jaafari, the process is at a standstill.'"
"'06-03-29,'1','The law requires federal agencies, and museums that have received federal funds, to survey their collections, identify Indian remains, funerary objects, sacred objects and other objects endowed with ""cultural patrimony,"" consult with Indian tribes and ""repatriate"" them if requested; newly discovered remains could be claimed by tribes showing a ""cultural affinity"" with them. The law was meant to provide a form of cultural and material restitution. But beyond any imagining, it also transferred intellectual authority over these objects to the tribes, increased the reluctance of curators to act as autonomous interpreters and diminished the stature of independent scholarship and scientific inquiry.In the Kennewick case, scientists sued the government and ultimately won the right to examine the bones, something that is now taking place. (DNA testing has not demonstrated any genetic connection between the skeleton and contemporary peoples.) But museums have taken a different course: they are transforming themselves under the law's pressures.According to federal statistics, by 2005, remains of more than 30,000 individuals had been ""deacquisitioned,"" along with more than 500,000 funerary and sacred objects. The effects have been profound, not because of the loss of the objects from museums, but because the law enforced a way of thinking about them. In the protection act's version of ""cultural patrimony,"" it is not just ownership of an individual object that can be called into question, but the possession of all objects from an Indian culture. The ""repatriation"" has also led to consultations in which tribal leaders become involved even in the treatment of objects that are not repatriated, able to help mold their interpretation, to guide research about their pasts and to influence how they are displayed.To some extent, this sea change in museum life is part of an international movement advocating for ""aboriginal"" or ""native"" cultures and formerly colonized nations. This month, for example, Peru announced it would sue Yale University over its claims to ownership of objects related to the exploration of Machu Picchu by a Yale explorer, Hiram Bingham, in 1912.The change also involves more than objects. In Australia, as the anthropologist Michael F. Brown reports in his book ""Who Owns Native Culture?,"" Aboriginal militants have claimed that images of the emu and kangaroo were the property of the Aboriginal people. Some Australian curators have accommodated Aboriginal demands that female curators can't handle their objects.Mr. Brown points out that the Hopis in New Mexico have been trying to restrict and control important historical photographs documenting their secret religious ceremonies; they were made by the Mennonite missionary Heinrich R. Voth at the turn of the 20th century, after he had been given access by Hopi priests. (Later priests have consulted these detailed photographs to try to restore frayed traditions.)Sound recordings have also been challenged. In 1907, the ethnomusicologist Frances Densmore set off on a series of expeditions for the Smithsonian's Bureau of American Ethnology, ultimately recording 3,000 wax cylinders of songs from 30 Indian tribes. But in a play, ""SongCatcher,"" by a White Earth Anishinabe playwright, Marcie Rendon, Densmore's recordings lead to death and despair. ""My songs, my wife, my religion,"" the main character accuses her. ""You took them all.""As Mr. Brown points out, in such instances even immaterial things -- images or songs -- are claimed as property; their documentary and historical value is dismissed in theory if not in practice.Often, all outsider knowledge is treated as a kind of trespass. The implications of this are troubling. Outsiders' written accounts may have been distorted or false, but they can be examined and put in context, and archaeological and scientific data can lead in new directions. But most aboriginal cultures did not even possess sophisticated written languages, while their oral traditions have been disrupted by trauma, massacre and disease. Insistence on the absolute truth of those traditions, regardless of evidence, turns into a variety of fundamentalism.One Umatilla tribal leader, for example, scoffed at suggestions that Kennewick Man was unrelated to contemporary tribes, arguing that the Indians had been the region's only inhabitants and that, in proof, the tribe's oral history goes back 10,000 years: ""We know how time began and how Indian people were created."" The protection act has helped institutionalize deference to this kind of assertion.One reason for all these problems, is the brutish past. In his book ""Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology and the Battle for Native American Identity,"" David Hurst Thomas, curator of anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, argues that ""the American academic community -- led by grave-digging archaeologists -- has robbed the Native American people of their history and their dignity.""He points out that after the horrific 1864 massacre of hundreds of Cheyenne at Sand Creek, Colo., corpses had their skin removed and were ""carefully crated for shipment eastward to the new Army Medical Museum in the nation's capital."" The bones were exhibited at the Smithsonian and elsewhere.Indeed, it may be that one reason why the protection act has been so widely accepted is that its title emphasizes ""Native American graves."" Human remains are the least ambiguous artifacts of the past: their possession is typically the result of murder or theft. Hundreds of thousands of Indian remains are said to be in American museums.The law's extension to other objects, though, raises more questions. Though there is a procedure to determine each object's fate, the law is not primarily designed to trace ownership. The presumption is that a museum's possession is a violation. The main issue is whether there is enough ""cultural affiliation"" so an Indian claim can be established. Communal ownership and communal grievances become central.A sense of grievance is surely justified, but there is also an impulse to try to restore some primal past, one free of looting and abuse, that presumably existed before museums and colonization disrupted the social and cosmic order. One result has been to revivify the old romantic myth of the Indian as a pastoral figure with no active role in the globe's pockmarked history of plunder and enslavement. The Indian is only a passive recipient of its worst injuries. Tribal conflicts, slavery and wars, evidence of pre-colonial migrations -- all the complications of historical actors are stripped away. The myth reigns.Even exhibitions must now provide a form of repatriation: if, in the past, museums had erred with a limited understanding of tribal perspectives, now they are heading in just the opposite direction, pressured by tribal consultations, the threat of repatriations, and a desire to transcend past guilt. A tone of self-promotion can come into play.This is the dominant tone, for example, of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian. Tribes tell their own stories, not because they are most knowledgeable but because finally, they have control. One tribe, asked to name the 10 most important events in its history, included ""birds teach people to call for rain,"" and a recent ""desert walk for health."" ""Honesty, love, courage, truth, wisdom, humility and respect,"" are the values promoted by one tribe. ""Respect and sharing of your self is very important,"" says another. Any specific sense of tribal history or meaningful description of particular beliefs is difficult to find in the haze.Serious scholarly exhibitions also fall prey to these sentiments. An exhibition of early American Indian art last winter at the Art Institute of Chicago, for example, began with the words of a tribal leader expressing how these objects will help his people realize they were descended from ""a wonderful and great culture"" -- an assessment echoed in other exhibition texts. And if some objects suggested the importance of weaponry, enslavement and ""trophy scalps,"" to these ancient cultures, their implications were studiously ignored.One reason for the Kennewick Man controversy is that it threatens to upset this model. If the skeleton is not directly connected with contemporary tribes, the very premises of the aboriginal world view, with its nativist claims, and its assertions of unique historical trauma, must be modified. It would imply that Indian tribes had a past that was neither as primordial nor as pastoral as oral histories assert, that other groups had come and gone, and other struggles had taken place.Hence, the Indian anxieties over a skeleton. Already, hundreds of less-renowned prehistoric skeletons have been turned over by museums for Indian burial. The lawsuit over Kennewick Man gave hope that perhaps the standard of proof for repatriation would be raised. But there has also been an attempt to establish through fiat what has not been established by fact: last year, Senator John McCain of Arizona, on behalf of several tribes, proposed an amendment to the protection act; it would ensure that ancient remains would automatically qualify as Indian remains, without requiring ancestral proof.But that idea, like the premature burial of the site itself, is a sign of how readily contemporary exhibitions and investigations of the Indian past are now characterized by the desire not to fully explore but to fully appease.Connections, a critic's perspective on arts and ideas, appears every other Monday in the Arts section.CONNECTIONS Correction: April 25, 2006, Tuesday The Connections column in the special Museums section on March 29, about the effects of laws protecting American Indian artifacts, misidentified the state where the Hopi tribe is based. It is Arizona, not New Mexico.'"
"'06-03-29,'1','The latest financial restatement was disclosed as G.M. filed its annual report Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing had been delayed by almost two weeks after the company discovered a number of accounting errors.G.M. increased its 2005 loss by $2 billion, to $10.6 billion, its largest loss since 1992. On Tuesday, as it previously disclosed, it also restated its corporate results for 2002 through 2004.In November, G.M. said it would restate its results for 2001, reflecting improper accounting for payments from suppliers. It warned that further restatements were likely for 2000 through 2005 as a result of an S.E.C. investigation into its accounting practices.After a review of accounting mistakes, G.M. said Tuesday that it would restate results at G.M.A.C. for 2003, 2004 and through the third quarter of 2005, but it did not indicate what G.M.A.C.'s results would be.G.M. said the restatement, which affected the way it accounted for cash, was necessary because of the way it tracked transactions at its residential mortgage operation, the Residential Capital Corporation.""In concluding the review, G.M. determined that the cash flows related to certain mortgage activities were not appropriately classified as either operating cash flows or investing cash flows,"" it said.G.M.A.C. has consistently been one of the company's most lucrative operations, providing income even when automotive operations lagged.G.M. put part of the unit up for sale last fall in an effort to separate G.M.A.C.'s credit rating from that of the parent company, which has been junk status since May. G.M., which expects to keep 49 percent of G.M.A.C., wants to restore its credit rating to investment grade.In its regulatory filing, G.M. said it was ""working to finalize a transaction as rapidly as we can.""But it added, ""Structuring a G.M.A.C. transaction is a complex endeavor and we cannot predict whether any transaction with respect to G.M.A.C. will occur,"" nor would it predict ""the terms of any transaction, the identity of any purchaser, or whether and over what period a transaction could achieve the principal strategic goals.""G.M.'s regulatory filing showed that the company was concerned about the effect of the restatements on its ability to draw from its $5.6 billion standby line of credit, which it could tap if it ran short of cash for operations.While the automaker said it believed that it would be able to make a ""good-faith borrowing request"" to use the credit line, ""in view of G.M.'s recent restatement of its prior financial statements, there is substantial uncertainty as to whether the bank syndicate would be required to honor such a request.""Therefore, the company said, ""There is a high risk that G.M. would not be able to borrow under this facility.""G.M. added that it did not plan to draw from the credit line and was considering amending its terms or replacing it with a new credit line that would be less restrictive. But it also said it had no assurance it would be able to do so.G.M. warned that it faced significant risks, including the possibility of a prolonged strike at Delphi. U.A.W. leaders say they expect Delphi to ask a bankruptcy court on Friday for permission to set aside its contracts and impose less generous wages and benefits.Other risks are a continued deterioration in G.M.A.C.'s credit rating and G.M.'s inability to win concessions from the union in 2007 contract negotiations, the company said.""The occurrence of any one or a combination of these events could severely threaten our liquidity position and threaten the successful implementation of our turnaround plan,"" it added.'"
"'06-03-29,'1','KHARTOUM, Sudan, March 28 - Concerns over growing Iranian influence in Iraq, and the lack of Arab involvement there, dominated the opening of the annual Arab League summit here on Tuesday.""Any solution for the Iraqi problem cannot be reached without Arabs and Arab participation,"" Amr Moussa, secretary general of the Arab League, said in his opening speech. ""Any consultations conducted without Arab participation will be considered unsatisfactory and will yield no solutions.""Arab countries have been fuming over an Iranian-American agreement this month to hold direct talks about sectarian violence in Iraq.""They fear Iraq is drifting from the Arabs, being divorced from the Arab world, and the increased influence of another neighboring country,"" said Hoshyar Zebari, the Iraqi foreign minister. ""This time, we are seeing some positive moves by the Arab League toward more realization of the situation on Iraq.""In a draft resolution likely to be approved tomorrow, the group's 22 Arab nations have pledged to reopen diplomatic missions in Iraq. In November, the Arab League also started an effort to reconcile differences among Iraq's religious sects in hopes of ending the sectarian fighting there, as well as increasing the Arab presence. Still, many Arab governments said they felt powerless in the face of Iran's growing influence.""Arabs have no cards to play with, while Iran has many,"" said Abdel Wahab Badrakhan, editor of Al Hayat, a newspaper based in London. ""Iran can influence the situation in Iraq, Lebanon, world oil prices, and now can play the nuclear card.""'"
"'06-03-29,'1','""You have to respect that there is a law,"" Mr. Kagermann said.The success of the campaign demonstrates the enduring power of organized labor in Germany, even at a time when membership in unions is declining and when unions have lost much of their muscle in extracting wage increases from old-line industrial companies like Volkswagen.SAP was named Germany's best employer last year, in the category of companies with 5,000 or more employees, by Capital, an economics magazine here. It is the world's largest maker of business software, with a 62 percent market share, compared with 16 percent for Oracle, its nearest competitor.But these are not reasons to oppose a works council, according to IG Metall, the union that has backed the campaign and represents workers in the computer industry.""People say, 'Why do we need a works council? Things are going well. Leave us in peace,' "" said Bernd Knauber, a union secretary at IG Metall in Heidelberg, north of SAP's headquarters in Walldorf. ""But when the problems erupt, then it's too late to start a works council.""The German operations of I.B.M. and other American technology companies have works councils, he noted. Members of IG Metall marched in front of I.B.M.'s offices in Stuttgart last year to protest job cuts.A works council does not have to have union involvement. In practice, however, unions often come to play an influential role because they have experience and expertise in promoting workers' interests.""Works councils have had an enormous impact in unionizing the shop floor,"" said Michael Fichter, an expert in labor relations at the Free University of Berlin. ""This is a very sensitive issue for a company like SAP, where you don't have production line employees.""Mr. Fichter, however, said he doubted IG Metall would make inroads with SAP employees. They would probably not earn higher wages if the union negotiated for them, he said. And SAP solicits the employees' views in other ways.Like all major German companies, SAP follows the principle of co-determination, which stipulates that workers and shareholders have an equal voice in the oversight of the company. Employees hold 8 of the 16 seats on SAP's supervisory board.SAP is studying whether to change its legal standing from a German company to a European company -- a move some German newspapers have suggested is connected to the labor issue, since it could open the way for SAP to move outside the country. Mr. Kagermann denied any link, and said leaving Germany would make little sense for SAP.Now that a works council is inevitable, Mr. Kagermann expressed little concern about its effect on relations between management and employees. He predicted that the union would have trouble making headway in the council.""It's always possible that one or two of the members will come from the union,"" he said. ""The question is, Will it be a majority or a minority? I don't see, in SAP's case, that it will be a majority.""The three SAP employees have not spoken publicly about their campaign, and Mr. Kagermann said he had forgotten their names. ""What is very encouraging,"" he said, ""is that 91 percent of people, in principle, said they don't need this.""'"
"'06-03-29,'1','Most of the proposals are not new. Many echo arguments put forward by Democrats and by their 2004 presidential nominee, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, including a demand for more military equipment and body armor for troops and improved veterans' benefits.In the diplomatic field, the proposals say Democrats will ""redouble efforts to stop nuclear weapons development in Iran and North Korea,"" but they offer few details that differ from the Bush administration's effort to get cooperation from allies in Asia, the Middle East and Europe to pressure those countries to abandon their nuclear programs.""In these times of unprecedented challenge and change, real leadership demands preparing for the threats that exist today and those that will emerge tomorrow,"" said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, who will be appearing with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader.""It demands tough and smart policies that recognize that a stronger America begins at home,"" Ms. Pelosi added.In a statement to be released on Wednesday, Mr. Reid is to say: ""Over the last century, Democrats have led America through two world wars, have stared down threats to our security at home and have defeated the ideals of Communism and Fascism. Today, Democrats are here to build on that record.""But Republicans, anticipating the Democratic attack, were already circulating their own counteroffensive on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, said he had just obtained a copy of the Democrats' plan and added, ""It's taken them all this time to figure out what we've been doing for a long time.""Mr. Bond said that while Democrats sought to showcase their support of national security, they had tried to block renewal of the antiterrorism law known as the USA Patriot Act and the administration's program of wiretapping without warrants.Democrats say that while their policies lack detail in some respects, they were able at least to put together a package of proposals to which all members of the party could subscribe, calling for more money to be spent on a broad array of items, including port security and foreign aid.Meanwhile, the manifesto skirted divisive issues like whether the United States should set a timetable on the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, as advocated by Representative John P. Murtha, Democrat of Pennsylvania, but opposed or not endorsed by other members of his party.Instead, it calls for making sure that 2006 ""is a year of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with the Iraqis assuming primary responsibility for securing and governing their country and with the responsible redeployment of U.S. forces.""Beyond ""redeployment,"" no mention is made of whether American troops should be taken out of Iraq.The Democrats' paper also calls for the United States to achieve ""energy independence"" by 2020 by increasing production of alternative fuels.'"

Kupriyanov, suggested in televised remarks that the company is acting prudently by seeking the terms of the adjustment now, long before the contract expires in December.A similar contract with Ukraine, which expired late last year, ended in a mid-winter standoff with the Ukrainian government. Eventually, Gazprom briefly cut off the flow for Ukraine — thus also reducing supply to Europe that came through Ukraine — during a cold spell and drawing sharp criticism from Western governments.""So that the issue of the gas prices for Belarus would not become the topic of the New Year's eve TV programs, we proposed now, in advance, to agree on how we will work in the next year,"" Mr. Kupriyanov said in an appearance on the ORT television station. ""The position of Gazprom is that the supplies of Russian gas should be carried out at prices corresponding to the European level.""The price demand underscored the shifting circumstances faced by Mr. Lukashenko, whose recent re-election was denounced as a fraud by the West. There has been some speculation that Russia might be distancing itself from him, now that the new open opposition in Belarus has suggested that Mr. Lukashenko's hold on power is weakening.Since the end of the election campaign, he has faced the most energetic protests in his 12 years of authoritarian rule. Belarussian authorities have been engaged in a broad crackdown, arresting hundreds of peaceful protestors and one former candidate, who remains in jail.There has also been widespread curiosity about the whereabouts and condition of the president, who is typically robust and omnipresent on state-controlled news. He has appeared only once since March 20. Russian and European newspapers, as well as blogs and Web sites, have suggested that something is awry.Mr. Lukashenko's spokesman, Pavel N.

"'06-03-30,'0','The general pattern of maturation, they report in Nature today, is that the cortex grows thicker as the child ages and then thins out. The cause of the changes is unknown, because the imaging process cannot see down to the level of individual neurons.But basically the brain seems to be rewiring itself as it matures, with the thinning of the cortex reflecting a pruning of redundant connections.The analysis was started to check out a finding by Dr. Thompson: that parts of the frontal lobe of the cortex are larger in people with high I.Q.'s. Looking at highly intelligent 7-year-olds, the researchers said they were surprised to find that the cortex was thinner than in a comparison group of children of average intelligence.It was only in following the scans as the children grew older that the dynamism of the developing brain became evident. The researchers found that average children (I.Q. scores 83 to 108) reached a peak of cortical thickness at age 7 or 8. Highly intelligent children (121 to 149 in I.Q.) reached a peak thickness much later, at 13, followed by a more dynamic pruning process.One interpretation, Dr. Rapoport said, is that the brains of highly intelligent children are more plastic or changeable, swinging through a higher trajectory of cortical thickening and thinning than occurs in average children. The scans show the ""sculpturing or fine tuning of parts of the cortex which support higher level thought, and maybe this is happening more efficiently in the most intelligent children,"" Dr. Shaw said.The I.Q. was tested when the children entered the program. Further tests were not needed because I.Q.'s are so stable, Dr. Rapoport said.Dr. Thompson said the new study opened huge possibilities because researchers should be able to identify the factors that influence the brain by looking at the scan patterns identified by the researchers.The Bethesda children have had genetic samples taken from their cells, so genes that have even the mildest influence on the brain should be detectable, Dr. Thompson said. The pattern of development may also be affected by factors like diet, hours spent in school or the number of siblings, and these may come to light by asking parents how they raised their children.""There are many enigmas of intelligence that they can now solve,"" he said.I.Q. scores and measuring intelligence have long been controversial. Brain-imaging studies by Dr. Thompson and the study group have advanced the field by identifying physical features of the brain that correlate with I.Q.In 2001, Dr. Thompson reported that based on imaging twins' brains the volume of gray matter in the frontal lobes and other areas correlated with I.Q. and was heavily influenced by genetics. Despite the great importance of genes in brain function, Dr. Thompson said experience could also change the brain.""Unless you have strong natural potential, you won't become a world-class marathon runner,"" he said. ""But that disillusionment is rapidly replaced by the notion that you can improve your own performance.""The institute's team has many genetic studies in progress. The analysis reported today was not intended to look at the relationship between genes and intelligence.""A lot of research in intelligence has not been that great,"" Dr. Shaw said. ""I would hope by this modest descriptive study to put things on an empirical footing.""One goal of the study was to establish normal development patterns, to diagnose what goes awry in children with schizophrenia or attention deficits. Dr. Shaw said his team did not have the full answers as to how the brain differed in those cases.'"
"'06-03-30,'0','Dr. Fauci and Dr. John Treanor of the University of Rochester, the lead investigator of the study, discussed the results on Tuesday in a telephone news conference.The vaccine, developed by government and other researchers, is being made by Sanofi Pasteur under a government contract. It is designed to prevent the disease caused by the A(H5N1) virus, which has been spreading rapidly through Asia, Europe and Africa. The disease has not reached the Americas.The virus attacks mainly birds, but some humans have been infected, almost all of them through contact with birds, and half have died. Some health officials are concerned that the virus could mutate in a way that would make it more contagious in people and start a lethal pandemic.Vaccines work by activating a patient's immune system. Standard flu shots, even with their smaller doses, are more effective than the new bird-flu vaccine: they protect 75 percent to 90 percent of people under 65, and 50 percent to 60 percent of those who are older, Dr. Fauci said.The standard shots probably work better because the viruses they protect against have been around for a long time, and most adults have some immunity to them. The vaccine acts like a booster shot to enhance an immunity that is already there.Researchers say the bird flu vaccine may be less effective because hardly anyone in the United States has been exposed to the A(H5N1) virus. People have no resistance to it, and so it takes a lot of vaccine to jump-start the immune system.The study used blood tests, which measured immunity to the virus, and researchers set the bar fairly high. Dr. Treanor said he thought that the vaccine might actually work better than it appeared from the study.A next step in the research is to try adding a substance called an adjuvant to the vaccine, to try to make it work better and at lower doses. Adjuvants stir up the immune system. Alum is a common one.The government has stored a ""modest"" amount of the Sanofi vaccine, Dr. Fauci said, about seven million to eight million doses. He said that such a small amount would not be of much help to the public, but he described it as stopgap.If the disease emerged, he said, the main purpose of the supply would be to inoculate health care workers and people involved in the rush to make a vaccine specific for the virus strain causing the outbreak.Currently, the United States does not have the production capacity to make bird flu vaccine and the usual vaccines for seasonal flu.The bird flu vaccine can be made only between runs of the seasonal vaccines, which have to take priority because those types of flu occur every year, and bird flu is a theoretical threat.Dr. Fauci said the government was spending several hundred million dollars to increase the nation's ability to make flu vaccine.Another company, Chiron, also has a government contract to make millions of doses of bird flu vaccine. But Chiron, which has a history of manufacturing problems, has produced only 70 percent of the amount it promised the government it would provide by now, and it will not begin making the rest until this fall.'"
"'06-03-30,'0','""There was a stand from both the American government and President Bush to promote a democratic policy and protect its interests,"" he said, sipping from a cup of boiled water mixed with saffron. ""But now there's concern among the Iraqi people that the democratic process is being threatened.""""The source of this is that some American figures have made statements that interfere with the results of the democratic process,"" he added. ""These reservations began when the biggest bloc in Parliament chose its candidate for prime minister.""Mr. Jaafari is at the center of the deadlock in the talks over forming a new government, with the main Kurdish, Sunni Arab and secular blocs in the 275-member Parliament staunchly opposing the Shiite bloc's nomination of Mr. Jaafari for prime minister.Senior Shiite politicians said Tuesday that the American ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, had weighed in over the weekend, telling the leader of the Shiite bloc that President Bush did not want Mr. Jaafari as prime minister. That was the first time the Americans had openly expressed a preference for the post, the politicians said, and it showed the Bush administration's acute impatience with the political logjam.Relations between Shiite leaders and the Americans have been fraying for months and reached a crisis point after a bloody assault on a Shiite mosque compound Sunday night by American and Iraqi forces.Mr. Jaafari said in the interview that Ambassador Khalilzad had visited him on Wednesday morning but did not indicate that he should abandon his job.American reactions to the political process can be seen as either supporting or interfering in Iraqi decisions, said Mr. Jaafari, the leader of the Islamic Dawa Party and a former exile. ""When it takes the form of interference, it makes the Iraqi people worried,"" he said. ""For that reason, the Iraqi people want to ensure that these reactions stay in a positive frame and do not cross over into interference that damages the results of the democratic process.""According to the Constitution, the largest bloc in Parliament, in this case the religious Shiites, has the right to nominate a prime minister. Mr. Jaafari won that nomination in a secret ballot last month among the blocs' 130 Shiite members of Parliament. But his victory was a narrow one: he won by only one vote after getting the support of Mr. Sadr, who controls 32 seats.That alliance has raised concern among the Americans that Mr. Jaafari will do little to rein in Mr. Sadr, who led two fierce rebellions against the American military in 2004. Mr. Sadr's militia, the Mahdi Army, rampaged in Baghdad after the Feb. 22 bombing of a revered Shiite shrine in Samarra and after a series of car bomb explosions on March 12 in Baghdad's Sadr City neighborhood. The violence left hundreds dead and Sunni mosques burnt to the ground.After the secret ballot last month, Sadr politicians said Mr. Jaafari had agreed to meet all their demands in exchange for their votes. Mr. Sadr has been pushing for control of service ministries like health, transportation and electricity.Mr. Jaafari did not say in the interview what deals he had made, but he insisted that engagement with the cleric's movement was needed for the stability of Iraq. He said he had disagreed with L. Paul Bremer III, the former American proconsul, when Mr. Bremer barred Mr. Sadr and some Sunni Arab groups from the Iraqi Governing Council in 2003.""The delay in getting them to join led to the situation of them becoming violent elements,"" he said.""I look at them as part of Iraq's de facto reality, whether some of the individual people are negative or positive,"" he said.Mr. Jaafari used similar language when laying out his policy toward militias: that inclusion rather than isolation was the proper strategy.The Iraqi government will try ""to meld them, take them, take their names and make them join the army and police forces.""""And they will respect the army or police rather than the militias.""Recruiting militia members into the Iraqi security forces has not been a problem under the Jaafari government. The issue has been getting those fighters to act as impartial defenders of the state rather than as political partisans. The police forces are stocked with members of the Mahdi Army and the Badr Organization, an Iranian-trained militia, who still exhibit obvious loyalties to their political party leaders.Police officers have performed poorly when ordered to contain militia violence, and they even cruise around in some cities with images of Mr. Sadr or other religious politicians on their squad cars.There is growing evidence of uniformed death squads operating out of the Shiite-run Interior Ministry, and Ambassador Khalilzad has been lobbying the Iraqis to place more neutral figures in charge of the Interior and Defense Ministries in the next government. That has caused friction with Shiite leaders, and some have even accused the ambassador of implicitly backing the Sunni Arab-led insurgency.But Mr. Jaafari said he supported the Americans' goal.""We insist that the ministers in the next cabinet, especially the ministers of defense and the interior, shouldn't be connected to any militias, and they should be nonsectarian,"" he said. ""They should be experienced in security work. They should keep the institutions as security institutions, not as political institutions. They should work for the central government.""In the first two years of the war, Mr. Jaafari emerged as one of the most popular politicians in Iraq, especially compared with other exiles like Ahmad Chalabi, the former Pentagon favorite. A doctor by training and well-versed in the Koran, Mr. Jaafari comes from a prominent family in Karbala, the Shiite holy city. But since taking power last spring, Mr. Jaafari has come under widespread criticism for failing to stamp out the insurgency and promoting hard-line pro-Shiite policies.'"

"'06-03-30,'0','The three government officials argued that the treaty governs relationships between nations, and that the remedy for a violation of consular notification was limited to a diplomatic protest or formal apology. The United States in fact issued a formal apology to Honduras in the case of Mr. Bustillo, who is serving a 30-year sentence for the 1997 killing.The lawyers for the defendants argued that so limited a view ran counter to the undisputed principle that a treaty, once ratified, becomes part of a country's domestic law. Consequently, they argued, foreign defendants should have access to the same remedies that the legal system offers for government violations of rights protected by American law.Accordingly, Mr. Sanchez-Llamas is arguing that incriminating statements he made to the police be suppressed because he had not received his consular notification at the time he made them. His lawyer's argument that such an exclusion should apply -- similar to the rule that bars the introduction of illegally seized evidence -- was rejected by the Oregon Supreme Court and did not make much headway with the justices on Wednesday.After the lawyer, Peter Gartlan, acknowledged that the Vienna Convention says nothing about suppressing evidence, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked, ""So if the treaty doesn't say 'suppress,' what authority does a federal court have to tell a state court to suppress?""The other defendant, Mr. Bustillo, is arguing that he is entitled to reversal of his conviction on the ground that Honduran officials, had they been notified of his arrest, would have helped identify another Honduran man who returned to Honduras after the murder and who, Mr. Bustillo asserts, was the real killer.His lawyer, Mark T. Stancil, argued that because Virginia was not forced to reopen the case to permit the new evidence, the state was able to benefit from its violation of the Vienna Convention.Here, too, the justices were skeptical. Several suggested that the fact that Mr. Bustillo had been provided with a lawyer was enough to insulate any Vienna Convention violation. The state, they said, had a right to expect that lawyers would inform their clients of their Vienna Convention rights.""The lawyer should be taxed with knowing it because it's the law of the land,"" Justice David H. Souter said, referring to the treaty.The International Court of Justice, often referred to as the World Court, takes the view that the convention confers individual rights. It ruled in 2004, in a case brought by Mexico, that the United States could not permit the execution of 51 Mexicans, on death row in various states, who had not received their consular notification.After that ruling, and while a Supreme Court appeal brought by one of the Mexicans, José Ernesto Medellín, was pending, the Bush administration withdrew the United States from the provision of the treaty that gives the World Court jurisdiction over disputes of this kind. At the same time, the administration told state courts to abide by the decision. The Supreme Court dismissed the Medellín case last May without ruling on the enforceability of the Vienna Convention.Deputy Solicitor General Gregory G. Garre was asked about the World Court's position by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who referred to that court by its initials, I. C J.Mr. Garre replied, ""To be blunt, the I. C. J. decision is wrong."" He said that while the World Court was entitled to ""respectful consideration,"" its decision was ""certainly not"" binding on the United States.Mr. Garre said that the State Department was making ""extensive efforts"" to make sure state and local governments were aware of the need to inform foreign defendants of the right to consular notification. The department has distributed 600,000 cards to police departments, he said, adding, ""These efforts are working.""But it appeared that Vienna Convention issues would probably not disappear. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy asked Mary H. Williams, the Oregon solicitor general, why the police, who already give Miranda warnings, could not simply be told to ascertain the citizenship of people they take into custody so that the required notice could be given.That was ""not so easy,"" said Ms. Williams.""I don't see why it's so complicated,"" Justice Kennedy said. He was joined by Justice Souter, who asked Ms. Williams, ""You ask his name, why not his citizenship?""Ms. Williams replied, ""We're moving toward that goal.""Justice Souter was less than satisfied. ""Why does it have to be a distant goal?"" he asked.The cases are Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, No. 04-10566, and Bustillo v. Johnson, No. 05-51.'"
"'06-03-30,'0','The Federal Election Commission finally did the right thing in ruling that the Internet must not be used as a conduit for unregulated salvos of big-money political advertising. Scolded by a federal judge, the commission reversed its earlier rule that threatened to turn the Web into a giant trough for the six- and seven-figure donations from corporations, unions and fat-cat influence shoppers that Congress banned in the campaign reforms of 2002.The F.E.C. ruling against such ""soft money"" corruption is welcome as well for its ringing endorsement of the free-speech rights of political bloggers, who had been concerned that they would be unfairly hobbled by any campaign controls on the Web. To the contrary, bloggers have now been assured of the same wide latitude to opine free of government control as newspapers enjoy, so long as they are not paid by a political campaign.The commission's action is timely for effectively skewering a brazen attempt in the House this week to make the Internet a soft money cornucopia beyond the reach of campaign law. The measure was peddled in the name of protecting bloggers' free speech, but that veil has been shredded by the F.E.C.'s rule. House Republican leaders wisely pulled the measure from the agenda rather than laying bare the political greed of trying to make the Web a supermarket for influence peddling.'"
"'06-03-30,'0','In the London trial, which is likely to run into next week or perhaps even longer, Apple Computer is expected to argue that it merely serves as a conduit for the transmission of music in digital form. A lawyer for Apple Computer, Anthony Grabiner, declined to comment outside the courtroom, citing legal restrictions.In his opening argument, Geoffrey Vos, a lawyer representing Apple Corps, dismissed the conduit argument, contending that the lack of ""interoperability"" with other companies' music stores undermined Apple Computer's stance.He noted that iTunes offers exclusive songs not available in CD form, as well as repackaged collections, products that he said demonstrated that Apple Computer was a music seller, not simply a transmitter of other companies' music. The holder of the copyright on the music is not immediately obvious on iTunes, he added.""The agreement was intended to say, We do music, you do computer software delivery systems,"" Mr. Vos said of the 1991 deal. ""The moment you cross the line is when you say you're in the record business.""The opening day of the trial was filled with light moments, as when Mr. Vos demonstrated the workings of iTunes for Justice Edward Mann, who took notes on a Dell laptop. Mr. Vos downloaded a copy of ""Le Freak,"" a 1970's hit from Chic, and proceeded to play it for the court.A ruling from Justice Mann is not expected for some time.Mr. Vos also showed a television commercial for iTunes, featuring the British band Coldplay performing ""Speed of Sound."" The ad features the Apple Computer logo alongside a reference to ""iTunes.com,"" and promotes a Coldplay album.""We know what they're selling with that,"" Mr. Vos said.One band that Mr. Vos was unable to highlight on iTunes was the Beatles themselves. Apple Corps -- which is owned by Ringo Starr; Paul McCartney; John Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono; and the estate of George Harrison -- has so far refused to license the Beatles' music catalog for digital sales. That makes it one of only a handful of bands still unavailable via legitimate online music sites.Mr. Vos said Neil Aspinall, managing director of Apple Corps, had rejected an offer from Mr. Jobs in 2003 proposing to buy the rights to the Apple Records name for $1 million. The iTunes Music Store appears with the Apple Computer logo, but not the company's name.In the suit, Apple Corps is seeking an injunction requiring Apple Computer to remove the bitten-apple logo from iTunes. If it succeeds, said Nick Valner, a lawyer representing Apple Corps, the company would seek undisclosed monetary damages.Without the logo, Mr. Vos said, ""iTunes is a jolly good name.""Correction: April 4, 2006, Tuesday An article in Business Day on Thursday about a British trademark suit against Apple Computer referred imprecisely to the ability of the Apple iPod to play tunes from online music stores other than Apple's, an issue in a French political debate. (The error also occurred on March 17 in an article about the French debate.) While Apple's music store makes tunes available in a proprietary format, iPods can play music purchased at certain other stores, usually in MP3 format.'"
"'06-03-30,'0','A retired F.B.I agent who has been plagued by allegations of close ties to organized crime for more than a decade turned himself in at the Brooklyn district attorney's office last night.The former agent, R. Lindley DeVecchio, who is scheduled to be arraigned today on charges that he helped a gangster kill at least three people, arrived at the office with two lawyers., Mark Bederow and Douglas E. Grover.An indictment to be unsealed today in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn charges Mr. DeVecchio, 65, with providing the gangster, Gregory Scarpa Sr., with information that led to the killings, according to a law enforcement source.Starting in 1982, Mr. DeVecchio spent years cultivating a relationship with Mr. Scarpa, a capo in the Colombo crime family who eventually became an informant for the bureau. But according to the indictment, Mr. DeVecchio began providing information to Mr. Scarpa, who in 1984 killed Mary Bari, an informant who had dated a mobster.Mr. DeVecchio is also accused of providing Mr. Scarpa with information that helped him in the 1987 killing of Joseph DeDomenico, a mobster also known as Joe Brewster, and the 1992 killing of Larry Lampesi, a mob associate.In 1996, a two-year inquiry by the Justice Department and the F.B.I. into Mr. DeVecchio's work included allegations that he helped Mr. Scarpa keep track of rivals but found no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing. While some of his colleagues told superiors they felt his relationship with Mr. Scarpa had become too intimate, Mr. DeVecchio said in an affidavit that the only things he ever received from Mr. Scarpa were a Cabbage Patch doll, a bottle of wine and a pan of lasagna.'"
"'06-03-30,'0','In a lunch meeting of Senate Republicans this week, Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, the only Hispanic Republican in the Senate, gave his colleagues a stern warning. ""This is the first issue that, in my mind, has absolutely galvanized the Latino community in America like no other,"" Mr. Martinez said he told them.The anger among Hispanics has continued even as the Senate Judiciary Committee proposed a bill this week that would allow illegal immigrants a way to become citizens. The backlash was aggravated, Mr. Martinez said in an interview, by a Republican plan to crack down on illegal immigrants that the House approved last year.The outcome remains to be seen. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said on Wednesday that he recognized the need for a guest-worker program, opening the door to a possible compromise on fiercely debated immigration legislation. [Page A22.]Democrats see an opportunity to ""show Hispanics who their real friends are,"" as Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, put it.But the issue is a delicate matter for Democrats as well. Polls show large majorities of the public both support tighter borders as a matter of national security, and oppose amnesty for illegal immigrants. Many working-class Democrats resent what they see as a continuing influx of cheap labor.The stakes are enormous because Hispanics now account for one of every eight United States residents, and for about half the recent growth in the country's population. Although Hispanics cast just 6 percent of the votes in the 2004 elections, birth rates promise an imminent explosion in the number of eligible voters.""There is a big demographic wave of Hispanic kids who are native born who will be turning 18 in even greater numbers over the next three, four and five election cycles,"" Roberto Suro, director of the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center, said.Nowhere is the immigration debate more heated than Arizona, where about 28 percent of the population is Hispanic and where Senator Jon Kyl, a Republican sponsor of an immigration bill, faces what could be a difficult race for re-election. Both Mr. Kyl and his Democratic challenger, Jim Pederson, have hired Hispanics or Hispanic-dominated firms to manage their campaigns.A mostly Hispanic crowd of about 20,000 gathered outside Mr. Kyl's office last weekend to protest criminal penalties against illegal immigrants that were in the House Republican bill, even though Mr. Kyl's proposal does not include the measure.Mario E. Diaz, the campaign manager for Mr. Pederson, faulted Mr. Kyl's proposal, which would require illegal immigrants or future temporary workers to return to their countries before becoming eligible for legal status in the United States.""Speaking the language that Kyl does, which is round them up and deport them, is offensive and disgusting to the Latino community,"" Mr. Diaz said.Mr. Kyl, for his part, accused Democrats of race-baiting by painting all Republicans as anti-Hispanic, a practice he said most Hispanics resent. But the senator also acknowledged some fears that the immigration debate could repel Hispanic voters. He added, ""I would hope that some of our colleagues who don't have much of a Hispanic population in their states would at least defer to those of us who do.""Pollsters from each party say Hispanics, like other groups, typically rank immigration lower in importance than other issues, especially education. But they respond strongly when they believe the rhetoric surrounding the debate demonizes immigrants or Hispanics, as they did when Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, backed a 1994 initiative to exclude illegal immigrants from public schools and services.Many analysts say the backlash from Hispanics wrecked the California Republican party for a decade.As governor of Texas, Mr. Bush opposed such measures, and pushed Republicans to woo Hispanics.Last week, Sergio Bendixen, a pollster for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, released a rare multilingual poll in which 76 percent of legal Latin American immigrants said they believed anti-immigrant sentiment was on the rise. A majority of immigrants said they believed the immigration debate was unfair and misinformed.But Ken Mehlman, chairman of the Republican National Committee, dismissed such concerns. Mr. Mehlman said the party's image was defined by President Bush, who supports a temporary-worker program and has repeatedly urged Republicans to avoid inflammatory rhetoric.""In an emotional debate like this,"" Mr. Mehlman said, ""people need to lower their energy and remember that ultimately the goal is something that is consistent with being a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.""Danny Diaz, a spokesman for the Republican Party, said it had pushed ahead on recruitment of Hispanic candidates and voters. He noted that Mr. Mehlman had appeared frequently at events with Hispanic groups, hitting classic Republican themes about lower taxes and traditional values. A particular focus has been Hispanic churchgoers and pastors like Mr. Cortes, who receives money from Mr. Bush's religion-based social services initiative.Democrats say that Mr. Bush's success with Hispanics has not gone unnoticed. Democratic leaders in Congress have expanded their Spanish-language communications, and after 2004 the Democratic Party vowed to stop relying on payments to Hispanic groups and organizations to help turn out Hispanic voters.""How can you spend your money on get-out-the-vote when you are beginning to lose your market share?"" Mr. Bendixen said. ""But Democrats had no experience in campaigning for the hearts and minds of Hispanic voters. They treated them like black voters who they just needed to get out to the polls.""Still, both sides say it is the tenor and ultimate outcome of the immigration debate that may give the Democrats their best opportunity to attract Hispanic voters.Senator Martinez, a Cuban immigrant who delivered part of a Senate speech in Spanish a few months ago, alluded to the nervousness among Hispanics when he was asked whether he would do the same again in the debate on immigration. ""I am about to be sent back as it is,"" he said, joking. ""I better be careful.""'"
"'06-03-30,'0','The crowd thought the goal would be awarded to Jagr, whose shot from the slot had glanced off Straka before crossing the goal line.""Marty never goes to the net,"" Jagr said with a laugh. ""Now, finally, he goes to the net, the little guy.""Jagr had another great chance to score, on a power-play breakaway at 10:30 of the third period. Islanders goalie Rick DiPietro turned aside the shot from the slot, or another Ranger record would have fallen.""It could have been a lot more,"" said Jagr. ""I had a lot of chances.""Jagr, who leads the league in goals, is tied with Adam Graves for the most in a season (52) by a Ranger. Jagr also leads the league in points.The Rangers (41-20-12) have nine games left in the regular season, and Wednesday's victory -- their second in a row -- enabled them to pull 4 points ahead of the Philadelphia Flyers in the battle for first place in the Atlantic Division.Jagr leads San Jose's Joe Thornton for the scoring title, 113-107. He has won the scoring title five times, the last in the 2000-1 season.Jagr has hurt the Islanders. In six games, Jagr has 16 points on 6 goals and 10 assists.After a 5-4 victory over Buffalo at Madison Square Garden on Monday night (in which Jagr engineered a goal and an assist in the third period as the Rangers rallied from a 4-2 deficit), Jagr said that his father had told him he would not reach his peak until he was 37 years old.""I want to play on a high level and I want to play in New York,"" Jagr said after the game. ""I don't think I can play somewhere else.""It all depends on how healthy I'm going to be and how good I'm going to be. I don't want to play on a third line or a fourth line. I don't think I can do it. It wouldn't be good for the team.""Luckily for the Rangers and their fans, Jagr does not have to make that decision for two more years.The three goals Martin Straka scored gave him his fifth career hat trick and first since Jan. 8, 2001. The Islanders (33-34-5) had won a season-best six consecutive home games. The veteran defenseman Darius Kasparaitis, who had missed the last four games with a sore groin, returned to the Rangers lineup. The rookie defenseman Fedor Tyutin was a healthy scratch. Henrik Lundqvist made 18 saves to improve to 30-10-9. ""It feels really good,"" said Lundqvist, who eclipsed the victories set by Johnny Bower (1953-54) and Jim Henry (1941-1942).'"
"'06-03-30,'0','Vista, which is expected to go on sale at the beginning of next year, will probably include a tool called Windows Defender designed to seek out spyware -- files that enter PC's through e-mail or from Web sites and secretly monitor them when they are connected to the Internet.Forcing the company to sell Vista without Windows Defender ""is a bit like forcing BMW to sell cars without air bags,"" Mr. Gutiérrez said. ""We have a responsibility to make our products better and more secure for our customers.""The commission's concerns about Vista echo the findings in its 2004 antitrust ruling against Microsoft. That investigation found that the company bundled its Media Player software into the Windows operating system to the detriment of rival music and video playing software programs.It also ruled that Microsoft had stunted competition by withholding vital information about Windows from rival makers of server software, preventing them from building products that operate smoothly with the ubiquitous Windows.Ms. Kroes outlined the same concerns with Vista. ""There is also the possibility that we won't have all the technical information needed for competitors to make their software inter-operable with Vista,"" her spokesman, Mr. Todd, said.With Vista there are at least four different bundling issues, as opposed to just one in the 2004 case. ""The commission is concerned that computer manufacturers and consumers won't have a proper choice of software,"" he said.Microsoft said in a statement that it was ""building Windows Vista to provide the most secure personal computing environment and to provide unprecedented opportunities for other companies throughout the industry.""No formal investigation has been opened yet, but, Mr. Todd said, ""If our concerns are confirmed and we conclude that Vista violated European competition rules then we would open a new case.""Ms. Kroes, in an article about the letter published in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, said: ""We expect that Microsoft will design Vista in a way which is in line with the European competition laws. It would be rather stupid to design something that is not.""The warning about Vista comes a day before Microsoft's top lawyers gather with regulators and rivals at a Brussels hearing about the company's compliance with the 2004 ruling.In December the commission issued a new lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing it of failing to provide the technical documentation needed by rival server software makers; it was ordered to provide that data in the 2004 ruling.According to the 2004 ruling, Microsoft must license out the documentation to other software producers. In the two-day hearing, which begins Thursday, Microsoft will explain that in spite of its best efforts to comply, the commission has set the company an impossible task.""It will take a real-life application to judge whether the documentation is adequate,"" Mr. Gutiérrez said, adding: ""It will take real licensees using the documentation to know. That's the way the industry works.""""Trying to create a test looking at the documentation in abstract is not consistent with the way the industry works,"" he said.If Microsoft fails to change the commission's mind it faces fines of up to 2 million euros a day, backdated to mid-December, until it is deemed to be in compliance with the 2004 ruling.""But it's more than money that's at stake during this hearing,"" said Thomas Vinje, a partner at the law firm of Clifford Chance and a founder of the European committee for interoperable systems, a trade group supporting the commission in its fight with Microsoft.""The meaningfulness of the 2004 ruling is at stake here,"" Mr. Vinje said. ""So far, no one has bought a license to see Microsoft's technical documentation. There is a danger that this side of the case could be rendered meaningless if Microsoft isn't forced to comply.""SAN FRANCISCO, March 29 -- A federal district judge in San Jose, Calif., Patricia Trumbull, quashed on Wednesday an attempt by Microsoft to force Sun Microsystems and the Oracle Corporation to provide documents in its battle with the European Commission.But judges in New York and Boston are still considering similar requests against I.B.M. and Novell, as Microsoft fights against possible fines of up to 2 million euros a day for failing to carry out sanctions imposed by the commission, lawyers for one of those companies said.'"

"'06-03-30,'0','That Mrs. Schlafly has so passionately endorsed domestic life as the greatest achievement to which a woman might aspire while aspiring to so much more herself, has, of course, infuriated her feminist adversaries for decades.""In the scale of liberal sins, hypocrisy is the greatest, and they have always considered me a hypocrite,"" Mrs. Schlafly said. She has never told women, she said, that they shouldn't or couldn't work. ""I simply didn't believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women's rights,"" she said. ""I knew of only one law that was discriminatory toward women, a law in North Dakota stipulating that a wife had to have her husband's permission to make wine.""By the time she married Fred Schlafly, a prominent St. Louis lawyer, in 1949, she had put herself through Washington University working full time as an ammunition tester, firing rifles and machine guns for the war effort. She had also completed a master's in political science at Harvard. Her mother, a librarian, had supported the family during the Depression, when her father was unable to find work. ""I grew up believing that I should support myself,"" Mrs. Schlafly said.Mrs. Schlafly first gained national attention in the early 1960's as the force responsible for galvanizing support around Barry Goldwater's presidential bid with her first book, ""A Choice Not an Echo."" A self-published populist treatise arguing that presidential elections had fallen into the hands of a cabal of Eastern establishment bankers and influence peddlers, the book sold three million copies.At the time, though, she did not consider her political work a career, but rather ""a hobby,"" as she put it. She cared for her children without the assistance of a nanny, but employed a housekeeper 40 hours a week. She breast-fed each child for six months, and home-schooled her four sons and two daughters through age 7.""I was never gone overnight,"" she said. ""I'd drive out to give a speech, and sometimes I'd bring a nursing baby with me. There was always someone outside willing to take care of a baby rather than listen to a long lecture.""And yet she remained quite a force. ""Nineteen-sixty-four was the most productive year of my life,"" Mrs. Schlafly said. ""I was running the Illinois Federation of Republican Women; I wrote 'A Choice Not an Echo'; I self-published it; I went to the Republican Convention, wrote a second book, 'The Gravediggers' -- now we're in September -- I was giving speeches for Barry Goldwater and in November I had a baby.""That child, Anne, is now 41. She owns a store in St. Louis, the Kitchen Conservatory, and recently married for the first time. When Mrs. Schlafly's other daughter, Liza, a Princeton graduate, left a partnership at a St. Louis law firm not long ago, her three children already grown, Mrs. Schlafly regarded the decision with bemusement. ""She stuck it out through all the difficult years when the children were young, and then she decided to leave,"" she said, adding, ""I've never told my children what to do.""Her husband maintained a less laissez-faire attitude. He encouraged all the children to go to law school, Mrs. Schlafly said. When one son, Bruce, expressed ambivalence, Mrs. Schlafly offered to take the law boards with him. (He became an orthopedic surgeon, but two other sons followed their father's advice.)When she announced at dinner one evening that she had applied to Washington University's law school and gained admission, her husband balked, saying that she was too busy with her work fighting the equal rights amendment.""I really didn't understand it because, of course, I could do whatever I wanted to do,"" Mrs. Schlafly said, laughing, ""so I went to one of my sons afterward and said, 'Why do you think he doesn't want me to go?' "" He suggested that his mother had everything and that his father might want to hold onto the profession he dominated. She withdrew the application, but within two weeks her husband changed his mind, arguing that a legal education would be a boon to her work on the amendment. She went to law school, graduated and took the Illinois bar exam in Chicago, wearing a wig and disguise to avoid detection by the press.Mrs. Schlafly's efforts to defeat the amendment succeeded once and for all in 1982, when it fell 3 states short of the 38 needed for ratification. She held a burial party at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington. Until 1971, when a friend invited her to speak about the amendment at a book club in Darien, Conn., she had given little consideration to gender-specific issues. ""This friend asked me to talk about the E.R.A. and I said, 'What's that?' "" ""The Feminine Mystique"" had come out eight years earlier, and Mrs. Schlafly maintains that she didn't know about it. History will always link her, though, to its author, Betty Friedan. During the 1970's Mrs. Schlafly, Ms. Friedan and the women's rights leaders Eleanor Smeal and Karen DeCrow were something of a traveling roadshow, arguing and lecturing about the amendment around the country.""I debated Friedan several times,"" Mrs. Schlafly remarked. ""She was always very ugly to deal with and debate, and made it clear that she hated me. I rejected all press calls to comment on her death; I'm not inclined to say critical things when somebody dies. Of course, I reject all her ideology, most of it based on the absurd notion that the home is a comfortable concentration camp and that the suburban housewife is oppressed by her husband and by society.""If women's lives have vastly improved in the last third of a century, she would credit neither Ms. Friedan's efforts nor her own, but instead the work of consumer product engineers who have created labor-saving devices. ""When I got married, all I wanted was a dryer so I didn't have to hang my diapers on a clothesline,"" she wrote in an e-mail message. ""Now, mothers have paper diapers. Et cetera, et cetera.""'"

He had already urged Washington to act quickly, because it was not clear ""how far advanced Moussaoui's plan is or how many unidentified co-conspirators exist.""But to high-level officials, the oddball Moroccan-born Frenchman in Minneapolis was only one of scores of possible terrorists who might be worth checking out. An F.B.I. official in Washington edited crucial details out of Mr. Samit's memorandums seeking a search warrant for Mr. Moussaoui's possessions, and said that pressing for it could hurt an agent's career, Mr. Samit testified.The picture of a large and lumbering bureaucracy trying to defend against a small and flexible enemy is striking, said Timothy J. Roemer, a member of the national Sept. 11 commission.""It's like the elephant fighting the snake,"" said Mr. Roemer, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana. ""One of the impressions of Al Qaeda and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is their ability to change course and put new people into their plan and dynamically respond to the challenges day to day.""The United States government, he said, ""is almost the opposite.""""We're slow to change,"" he said, ""slow to adjust, and we're building a huge bureaucracy.""The court testimony, Mr. Roemer said, has reinforced his belief that ""Moussaoui was an Al Qaeda mistake and a missed opportunity for the F.B.I.""The jury at Mr. Moussaoui's sentencing trial in federal court in Alexandria, Va., began deliberating on Wednesday about whether he qualifies for the death penalty for not telling American officials of the approaching terrorist attacks. If jurors decide he does qualify, they will then have to make a second decision as to whether he should be executed.The outlines of the events on both sides in the weeks leading to the Sept. 11 attacks are well known. But the voluminous evidence presented at the trial have added details and color to the public history of the plotters and how American counterterrorism officers failed to stop them.There are snippets of highly classified National Security Agency cables and glimpses of the C.I.A. inspector general's report on the agency's performance before the attacks, which remains secret. There are numerous new F.B.I. e-mail messages and memorandums that fill in the details of agents' suspicions and why they were not heeded.But the 58-page ""Substitution for the Testimony of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,"" a detailed account of what Mr. Mohammed has told investigators since his capture in Pakistan in 2003, and an attached two-page statement written by him, give the most direct view to date of the man who conceived and organized the attacks.""I know that the materialistic Western mind cannot grasp the idea, and it is difficult for them to believe that the high officials in Al Qaeda do not know about operations carried out by its operatives, but this is how it works,"" Mr. Mohammed wrote in his statement to his interrogators. ""We do not submit written reports to our higher ups. I conducted the September 11 operation by submitting only oral reports.""Mr. Mohammed comes across as a hands-on, midlevel manager who sometimes handled details, like perusing a San Diego telephone book he bought at a market in Karachi, Pakistan, for English-language schools and flight schools.But he delegated what he could to others. He had Abu Turab al Jordani, a Qaeda veteran from Jordan, train the less sophisticated ""muscle"" hijackers, teaching them to use their knives on animals and how to storm a jetliner cabin. He allowed Mohammed Atta, appointed ""emir"" of the hijackers, to make final decisions on targets and on the date of the attack.Mr. bin Laden repeatedly pressed Mr. Mohammed to move ahead with the hijacking plot, the document says. He pushed, for example, to strike on May 12, precisely seven months after the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole. Ever the pragmatist, Mr. Mohammed put him off. In fact, Mr. Mohammed ""noted that he disobeyed bin Laden on several occasions by taking operatives assigned to him by bin Laden and using them how he best saw fit.""One restriction on the plot was the small number of Qaeda devotees who had, or could get, visas to enter the United States. Mr. Mohammed used Mr. Midhar and Mr. Hazmi because they had visas — despite his doubts about their minimal English and lack of sophistication.But he also considered Mr. Moussaoui less reliable because of time he had spent in the West. Mr. Mohammed ""stated that Westerners have a different point of view because of their freedom,"" the summary says.The sentencing trial made clear the frustration of the Minneapolis F.B.I. office in its repeated efforts to interest bureau headquarters in Mr. Moussaoui.Gripping testimony came from Mr. Samit, who arrested Mr. Moussaoui on Aug. 16 and quickly became convinced that he was a terrorist who knew about an imminent hijacking plot. Mr. Samit said that he had sent about 70 warning messages about Mr. Moussaoui, but that they had produced no results.The agent said he had been puzzled at the reluctance of Michael Maltbie, a supervisor with the Radical Fundamentalist Unit at bureau headquarters, to seek a search warrant for Mr. Moussaoui's belongings from a special intelligence court.Mr. Samit seemed unable to satisfy Mr. Maltbie's demand that he provide a tangible link between Mr. Moussaoui and a foreign power, a requirement for a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. He thought he had sufficient evidence from two French intelligence reports showing Mr. Moussaoui had recruited someone to fight in Chechnya for an Islamist group allied with Mr. bin Laden.But on Aug. 24, 2001, a frustrated Mr. Samit sent an e-mail message to Charles Frahm, a friend and, at the time, an F.B.I. liaison to the C.I.A., asking for information to help make his case. ""We're trying to close the wiggle room for F.B.I. headquarters to claim there is no connection to a foreign power,"" he wrote.Mr. Moussaoui's lawyers asserted that Mr. Maltbie had undermined the effort to obtain a search warrant by deleting some details from Mr. Samit's requests. Mr. Samit said Mr. Maltbie had told him he was reluctant to press for a warrant because doing so would be risky for his career and ""he was not about to let that happen to him.""At the time, the bureau had become wary of applying to the intelligence court because a well-regarded supervisor had angered the court's chief judge in a previous case.Days later, with the attacks in New York and Washington, the scale of the destruction astonished even Mr. Mohammed. According to the summary, he said he ""had no idea that the damage of the first attack would be as catastrophic as it was.""'"
"'06-03-31,'0','Some of the Web sites are nonprofit operations that strive to create free online communities of friends. Others provide application help or admissions advice for a fee, while still others are operated by companies with sports and music programming aimed at teenagers, with the blogs and forums as an added attraction.But the amount of misinformation about the applications process, like any other topic online, is staggering, and there is no way to verify the identify of bloggers and writers. At the same time, guidance counselors and admissions officers — some of whom monitor the sites to check out what is being said about their colleges — suspect that the online chatter may do more to reinforce anxiety than curb it.""It's really accelerated in the past year to the point where there is a ton of bad information out there,"" said Robert Massa, the vice president of enrollment at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa. ""People need to realize that anybody can say anything on the Internet.""In the ""if you can't beat them, join them"" spirit, the Web site for Dickinson, like that of many other colleges, hosts its own admissions blogs, Mr. Massa said, intended to give prospective students an authentic window into the Dickinson experience.Sally Rubenstone, the editor of collegeconfidential.com, which offers admissions advice and counseling, wrote in an e-mail response to a reporter's question that she wondered whether online discussions were helpful ""or are we, instead, merely fanning the flames of fear in an already overly stressed process.""""Sometimes high school seniors should head to a movie or out for a jog and away from the keyboard and admissions angst,"" she added.Ms. Rubenstone acknowledged that sometimes the information provided was ""downright wrong"" but said she believed that ""over all, it's on target.""Bari Meltzer Norman, who runs www.mycollegecounselor.com, which offers admissions advice, said chat rooms were mostly ""amplified neighborhood chatter, much of which is pure speculation.""""Almost all of it feeds anxiety,"" Ms. Norman added. ""I see people on those boards asking questions that should be directed at a knowledgeable college adviser.""Jane F. Ross, an education consultant in Manhattan, said some parents were upset after reading postings about students who had been admitted to select colleges, yet had lower test scores or weaker grades than their children.""It had not even occurred to these parents (well-educated and generally sophisticated from all appearances) that perhaps the postings to the site were not entirely reliable,"" Ms. Ross wrote in an e-mail message.""Perhaps it is simply a sign of the times,"" she added, ""that the college admissions process itself seems increasingly mystical, so families and students are seeking soothsayers in the forms of blogs and chat rooms.""Certainly, there is inherent drama in the story of admissions. The narrative arc can stretch for months like a good soap opera in some cases, from the time in early fall when students decide where to apply, through SAT's, Medical School Admissions Test, transcripts lost and found, class rank ascending and descending — to the nail-biting, double tick-tock countdowns of application deadlines and the notification period, which is in the spring. And the public can listen in on the kind of conversations that used to be shared only between friends, with college counselors — or with the colleges themselves.Some writers make entirely unveiled cries for help, like this message posted on Tuesday on collegeconfidential: ""I totally feel like I am a failure and I have failed my parents as a son ... o be honest, I feel like committing suicide.""He wrote that he had applied to 13 colleges and, as of early this week, had been rejected by 4 of them.""What crime did I do to deserve this?"" he wrote.The first response to his message offered a colon and open parenthesis in the form of a frowning face. The second response advised applying to ""an easier but good school.""William Slocum, a counselor at Lenape High School in Medford, N.J., said the sharing of emotions on Web sites was cathartic.""Any forum that allows an individual to process and validate his/her emotions can be therapeutic,"" Mr. Slocum said.Still, even in the age of sharing, the best advice may be this: Say nothing.""I almost always advise my students not to share with anyone where they are applying (verbally or in chat rooms),"" Steven Roy Goodman, an education consultant in Washington, wrote in an e-mail message.Mr. Goodman explained that this way, ""my students can avoid having friends, acquaintances, and neighbors constantly ask if they have heard from College X or University Y.""But some news is good to share. On livejournal.com last week, came this: ""Yay! I made USC. =)""The message ended with this: ""Tiiiired. Off to sleep. Whoo hoo. College stress gone.""'"
"'06-03-31,'0','MOSCOW, March 30 — Russia's state-controlled gas monopoly announced Thursday that it would require Belarus, an ally whose economy is subsidized by Russia, to begin paying market prices for natural gas.The announcement, in a period of political turmoil in Belarus after a tainted presidential election on March 19, was seen by political analysts as a move by the monopoly, Gazprom, to gain control of Belarus's gas transportation system, which carries a large share of the gas that Russia exports to Europe.It reflected the broader trend of Gazprom's consolidation of Russia's gas markets and its efforts to increase revenues. But by driving up its neighbor's fuel cost, it may put new pressures on President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, often called Europe's last dictator.Gazprom has been raising rates for former Soviet states that it long subsidized, including Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, where the step was seen, at least in part, as revenge for turning away from Russia politically. Until Thursday, Belarus did not face such pressure; it has been allowed to buy Russian gas at $47 per thousand cubic meters, a sharp contrast to European prices of more than $230.In a statement, Gazprom said that the European prices would be effective for Belarus next year and that Belarus should submit any proposal for an adjustment by April 30.'"
"'06-03-31,'0','I fell in love with ""Well"" when I saw it in 2004, but I worried about its chances on Broadway, a place where you have to shout to be heard. My anxiety was not without foundation. Starting with Tony Walton's new set for the show, much of ""Well"" has been scaled up in ways that create a sense of strain, of an electrified perkiness. This is intermittently true of the four ensemble members (Daniel Breaker, Saidah Arrika Ekulona, John Hoffman and Christina Kirk) who portray different figures from Ms. Kron's past, sometimes breaking out of character in Pirandellian rebellion against the author.Using enhanced grimaces and double takes as she pontificates on the nature of meta-theater, Ms. Kron seems too much the professorial buffoon, set up expressly to have the avant-garde stuffing knocked out of her. Self-caricature is not necessary to achieve the friction between Ms. Kron's perspective and her mother's.Once again, though, Mom comes to the rescue. Ms. Houdyshell's performance as Ann Kron retains an anchoring authenticity that guarantees that ""Well"" opens doors of insight and emotion that no other play in New York is unlocking right now. From the moment she first wakens from a leaden slumber — squinting with slight alarm into the audience and murmuring, ""Oh, hello"" — Ms. Houdyshell's Ann is the perfect focal point of filial ambivalence. Slovenly in her time-bleached housedress as she struggles up a staircase, she inspires immense affection and embarrassment at the same time.She pulls you, as well as Ms. Kron, into an inescapable emotional gravity field. It's the effect that Ms. Kron describes so eloquently when she speaks of what happens when grown children, who feel they have gained perspective on their past, return to the family homestead: ""You realize that your parents live in an alternative universe where your therapy has no power.""Just as important to the purposes of ""Well"" is the paradoxical mix of energy and exhaustion that seems to seep from Ms. Houdyshell's very pores. Despite her galvanizing purposefulness as a neighborhood organizer, Ann Kron has always been afflicted by a paralyzing lethargy she attributes to unidentifiable allergies. Lisa Kron grew up assuming that ""the mysterious family illness"" was her legacy. And at 19, she left college to be treated in an allergy clinic in Chicago.Much of Ms. Kron's running narrative is devoted to the pains she takes to distance herself from the other patients she met at that clinic and, by extension, from her mother. As played by Ms. Ekulona and Ms. Kirk, those patients initially register as funny gargoyles, the stuff of anecdote. But Ms. Kron also allows the actresses moments in which real, inexplicable pain and bewilderment pierce their cartoon masks. These scenes anticipate the glorious moment when an exasperated Ms. Kron surrenders the stage to her mother. A tidal wave of sorrow then washes over the audience — a poignant, wondering sense of the ultimate aloneness of everyone.Now that Spalding Gray is gone, Ms. Kron may well be the best stand-up memoirist of the American theater. She has an inspired gift for spinning the depths of personal mortification into high-flying comedy, a trait in evidence a decade ago in her ""101 Humiliating Stories"" and still alive and kicking in ""Well."" (Her accounts of dressing up in costume as a child are agonizingly funny.)But more than any other monologist I can think of, including Mr. Gray, she uses autobiography to point out the limitations of the artificial forms we naturally impose upon memory. Even better, as she acknowledges those limitations, she tries to break out of the circularity of public introspection. Her ""2.5 Minute Ride"" (1999), a portrait of her father, whose parents died at Auschwitz, beautifully acknowledged the impossibility of fully entering another mind.In introducing other, insubordinately active characters into her work with ""Well,"" Ms. Kron gives physical life to this exasperation. Of course Ms. Houdyshell isn't really Ann Kron (who is still very much alive). But her rich, complex presence summons the tantalizing otherness of a complete personality. Lisa Kron may understand, painfully and regretfully, that we can never really know someone else. But the loving vigor with which she tries to do so here turns the natural selfishness of the memoir into a glowing act of generosity.By Lisa Kron; directed by Leigh Silverman; sets by Tony Walton; costumes by Miranda Hoffman; lighting by Christopher Akerlind; music and sound by John Gromada; hair and wigs by Tom Watson; production stage manager, Susie Cordon; associate general manger, Elizabeth M.

"'06-03-31,'0','BRUSSELS, March 30 - The United States government has intervened in Microsoft's antitrust dispute with the European Commission, urging it and the 25 national governments in the European Union to be fair to the company, American diplomats and European officials said on Thursday.Microsoft has complained frequently in recent months that it has been denied the right to a fair defense in the continuing antitrust case with the European Commission. It has also accused the commission of collaborating with its rivals in the software industry and denying it access to what it contends are vital documents it needs to prepare its defense.A memo written by unidentified government officials in Washington stated that Microsoft's complaints raise ""substantial concerns"" about the way Microsoft is being treated, according to a person close to the commission who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the memo. The memo was distributed this week through embassies in Europe and through the United States mission to the European Union in Brussels.United States diplomats visited the offices of three European commissioners earlier this week. Jonathan Todd, the spokesman for the competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, confirmed that her close aides met American diplomats this week and received the memo. He declined to comment on its content.The diplomats also visited the offices of the internal market commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, and Gunter Verheugen, vice president of the commission, according to the person close to the commission.'"
"'06-03-31,'0','The London Exchange had no comment on the Nasdaq withdrawal, though people involved in the discussions said the retreat was the natural consequence of London's initial reaction to the offer. When Nasdaq made its bid three weeks ago, the London Exchange rebuffed it immediately. Nasdaq officials have not met face to face with their counterparts in London since then, and had difficulty even getting Ms. Furse on the phone, people involved in the discussions said.Shares of the London Stock Exchange tumbled as much as 10 percent on Thursday before closing down 6.8 percent at £10.43. Still, the stock, which had climbed as high as £11.90 after the Nasdaq offer was disclosed, is still above that withdrawn offer's price of £9.50 a share. In New York, shares of Nasdaq fell $1.74, or 4.2 percent, to $40.11. Shares of its archrival, the NYSE Group, parent of the New York Stock Exchange, fell 1.9 percent, or $1.50, to $78.50.The New York Stock Exchange is seen as a more likely suitor for the London Exchange, but there was no sign on Thursday that any approach would be coming.""Although there are still other potential bidders in the form of N.Y.S.E. and Euronext, we believe that neither is imminent,"" Michael Long, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote Thursday in a note to clients. ""A bid for the L.S.E. could incur the wrath of shareholders, with no clear indication that L.S.E. would be receptive to such a move.""Richard H. Repetto, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill & Partners, said the chess game was in its early stages and Mr. Greifeld of Nasdaq could probably not make a serious offer without cooperation from the London Exchange's management. ""They walked because they couldn't rationalize a higher bid because they couldn't do due diligence,"" he said.London was never open to the idea of a Nasdaq takeover. ""Their timing was wrong and their proposal was wrong,"" said an executive from the London Exchange who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.The London Stock Exchange has been planning to return more than £500 million in cash to shareholders this spring, he noted. ""It's not that we have a closed mind, but this was inadvisable,"" the executive said.Nasdaq's offer is just the latest that Ms. Furse has spurned. That defensive position is feeding a growing sentiment in London that the exchange could be trying to buy its smaller counterparts in Europe, like the Nordic stock exchange operator OMX, or the Wiener Börse in Vienna.""What the London Exchange ought to do is consolidate its position in Europe,"" said Lynton Jones, founder of Bourse Consult, a London consulting group.The London Exchange may now be in a stronger position to make a takeover than ever before, analysts and investors say. It has been attracting many new listings from companies eager to avoid stricter regulatory standards in the United States, and smaller businesses, which are flocking to its small-capitalization Alternative Investment Market.The exchange's market value has more than doubled in the last 12 months, on the back of successively higher bids from Deutsche Börse, Macquarie Bank of Australia and Nasdaq. And its cash on hand amounts to several hundred million pounds, and it has no debt.Some users and investors in London expressed relief that Nasdaq had gone away, in part because many had feared that a takeover would bring American oversight to London companies.""I am delighted it isn't going ahead,"" said Richard Grossman, director of Redmayne Bentley Stockbrokers, which is a user and shareholder of the exchange. Mr. Grossman said attempts to combine the London exchange and Nasdaq would have created a ""minefield"" of regulation and integration problems. ""We should go out and expand,"" Mr. Grossman added.One issue that perplexed some American analysts was Ms. Furse's outright dismissal of the offer.""By U.S. shareholder standards, the shareholders of the L.S.E. have a reason to be very dissatisfied,"" Mr. Repetto of Sandler O'Neill said. ""At least in the U.S., it's a fiduciary duty of boards and management to entertain reasonable offers.""'"
"'06-03-31,'0','But Mr. Pataki's solution was coming under increasing fire in public from Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Corzine. They said it would have enriched the developer at public expense, while putting the project itself in jeopardy.Mr. Pataki had hoped to present his proposal yesterday to the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site. His framework would have relieved Mr. Silverstein of financial responsibility for building the $2 billion Freedom Tower, the tallest, most symbolic and most troubled of the five towers planned for the 16-acre site. But the developer would have retained the right to build three towers on the most valuable parcels on Church Street.At the end of a 90-minute meeting yesterday morning at the authority's Park Avenue office, it was clear to the Pataki administration that neither Mayor Bloomberg nor Governor Corzine, who shares control of the authority with Mr. Pataki, were willing to go along.So, the New York governor's office was forced to notify authority commissioners that ground zero was off the agenda.""Governor Pataki is insisting on moving forward,"" said Charles A. Gargano, the state's chief economic development official and vice chairman of the Port Authority. ""Our goal is to come to a framework agreement, to work out the structure to address many of these issues.""In public, officials from New York, New Jersey and City Hall were careful to avoid criticizing one another yesterday. Indeed, Mayor Bloomberg even said that Mr. Pataki had done a good job under difficult circumstances.But state officials who were granted anonymity so that they could speak with fewer political constraints defended the deal they had nearly signed with Mr. Silverstein. They said that it would have ensured the completion of all the buildings at ground zero at a quicker pace, while imposing strict deadlines on the developer.Further, they said, they had forced Mr. Silverstein to make concessions on his rent, the allocation of insurance proceeds and his share of infrastructure costs.Among the public officials, tension was clearly just below the surface yesterday. Mr. Gargano said that the framework the state had erected for a deal was still on the table. Yet city officials and Anthony R. Coscia, the authority's chairman and a New Jersey appointee, suggested that it was time to start over on an arrangement that all sides could embrace.If the turn of events was a blow to Mr. Pataki, it also hurt Mr. Silverstein, who leased the World Trade Center six weeks before it was destroyed. The developer has repeatedly vowed to start work on the Freedom Tower next month. But he may not want to start spending tens of millions of dollars without fully knowing what his role will be in the future when it comes to rebuilding the entire complex.Yesterday, Mr. Silverstein said that he had negotiated in good faith with Governor Pataki, making significant progress on all the critical issues, including rent and the allocation of $2.9 billion in insurance proceeds. Mr. Silverstein, who has been alternately applauded and vilified for his role, rejected any suggestion that he was at fault and blamed government ineptitude.""We now find that the process has apparently gotten bogged down inside the Port Authority, which is as frustrating to me as I'm sure it is to New Yorkers,"" Mr. Silverstein said in a statement. ""We hope that the different leaders and branches of government will quickly come together so we can move past the uncertainty and get on with what is our paramount obligation -- rebuilding the World Trade Center.""But Mr. Coscia put the onus on Mr. Silverstein and brushed aside talk of a rift with Governor Pataki. He said the city and both states would now work together on a unified proposal to offer Mr. Silverstein.""The issues we find with the Silverstein proposal are equally of concern to New York, New Jersey, Governor Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg,"" Mr. Coscia said. ""My expectation is that there is a growing unanimity of opinion among two governors and the mayor, and that is likely to enhance the chance of having an agreement.""The collapse of the talks is not the only trouble at ground zero. Work has begun on the Sept. 11 memorial, but that project is already over budget and fund-raising has been sluggish. There was a nasty public battle over a planned cultural center and continuing doubts about the economic viability of the Freedom Tower, which is widely considered to be too big, in the wrong place and nearly impossible to lease to corporate tenants, who view it as an obvious terrorist target.Some downtown executives and community leaders are also worried that the continuing uncertainty at ground zero will undermine the fragile recovery in Lower Manhattan. Although the office vacancy rate downtown is relatively high, they are hoping that rising rents and a tight Midtown market will once again make Lower Manhattan an attractive alternative.""The business community is eager for a resolution at ground zero so Lower Manhattan can continue it's momentum toward a full recovery,"" said Eric Deutsch, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York.The latest crisis was prompted, in part, by the scheduled April groundbreaking for the Freedom Tower. Although Mr. Silverstein continues to insist that he has the money and the desire to do the job, state and city officials and authority executives have grown increasingly concerned that he could run out of money, default on his lease and walk away with tens of millions in profit after completing only two towers.To be fair, Governor Pataki championed the skyscraper as a symbol of New York's resilience and insisted that it be built first, over Mr. Silverstein's objections. The developer and government officials subsequently reached agreements in 2003 and 2004 on what would be built and when.Last December, Mr. Coscia of the Port Authority suggested that Mr. Silverstein surrender a major part of the World Trade Center site as a way of addressing the financial problems.Mayor Bloomberg, who had been largely focused on the redevelopment of the Far West Side in 2004 and 2005, became increasingly focused on Lower Manhattan, backing Mr. Coscia.The developer refused, not wanting to relinquish what he said were the most valuable parcels.The Pataki administration then began weeks of negotiations with Mr. Silverstein that left Mr. Coscia and Mayor Bloomberg without seats atthe bargaining table. Even after the impasse on March 14, Silverstein executives complained that they were making concessions to Mr. Pataki's negotiators, while reading in the newspapers about new demands by City Hall or New Jersey.Mr. Coscia said yesterday that two fundamentally different interests were in play.""Silverstein Properties is pursuing their business interests to further the profitability of this effort,"" he said, ""and we have a responsibility to protect the public's interest.""'"

"'06-03-31,'0','Opens today in New York and Los Angeles Directed by Randall Miller 103 minutesEver since George Bernard Shaw described dancing as ""a perpendicular expression of a horizontal desire,"" his words have been the subliminal tag line of every movie in which couples hoof their way to romantic bliss. ""Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School"" struggles bravely to maintain that tradition, but it's tough to convey the erotic charge of a merengue when all your characters are drowning in misery.Most miserable of all is Frank (Robert Carlyle), a baker locked in mourning for a wife whose ashes greet him every morning from the dresser. A chance encounter with a dying crash victim named Steve (an operatic John Goodman) sends Frank to the titular dance school to keep an appointment with Steve's childhood sweetheart. Instead he meets Meredith (Marisa Tomei), a tranquil beauty bravely Lindy-Hopping on her one good leg. Though Meredith's burdens also include an abusive dance partner and stepbrother (a hip-swiveling Donnie Wahlberg), Frank is undeterred. A new life awaits.Elaborating on his own 1990 short film, the director, Randall Miller, toggles back and forth between Steve's past and Frank's present. Despite a gloriously baroque performance from Mr. Wahlberg -- attempting moves certified only for Antonio Banderas -- ""Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School"" remains irredeemably soggy. The only horizontal desire emanating from most of these characters is the one that puts you six feet under.""Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for mature situations and language.'"
"'06-03-31,'0','The N.B.A. and the W.N.B.A. are among the last leagues to use the jump ball to settle disputes after a held ball or other situation when two players lay equal claim to the basketball. The International Basketball Federation, which oversees Olympic basketball, and the National Federation of State High School Associations have adopted N.C.A.A.-style forms of alternating possessions.Most leagues do not use a jump ball except at the beginning of the game, and sometimes to start overtime. In the N.C.A.A., if there is not a held ball in the first half, the team that lost the opening tip gets the ball to start the second half.Even in the N.B.A., jump balls are rare. The loser of the opening tap is handed the ball to start the second and third quarters; the winner gets it to start the fourth.In college basketball, the jump-versus-arrow debate crops up on occasion, but the ferocity has generally decreased over time. The N.C.A.A. sends a survey each February to coaches, conference commissioners and others to gauge which rules should be discussed. A few years ago, the possession arrow was removed from the questionnaire.""If someone comes and champions it, then maybe it will come back up,"" Larry Keating, the senior associate athletic director at Kansas and the chairman of the N.C.A.A. men's basketball rules committee, said of the jump ball. ""But I don't see that happening.""It would take a controversial held-ball play in a big game, such as during this weekend's Final Four. But the rule has survived many of those. The first might have been in December 1981, when Rutgers upset U.C.L.A. at the Meadowlands. Rutgers led by a point in the final seconds when U.C.L.A.'s Michael Sanders rebounded a teammate's miss and was tied up under the basket. The arrow favored Rutgers, which clinched the victory.The latest controversy was averted last Sunday. George Mason led Connecticut by four points in overtime of the Washington Regional final in the N.C.A.A. tournament. With 46 seconds left, George Mason defenders clamped onto the ball held by UConn guard Marcus Williams. Instead of a jump ball, the arrow pointed toward UConn, giving it the ball right back. The play was forgotten when George Mason hung on to win.""I'd rather do the jump ball,"" UConn forward Josh Boone during an off day before the game. ""Then a team earns it.""In 1998, the N.C.A.A. experimented with a twist, aimed at rewarding tight defense: a held ball led to a jump ball. A year later, that amendment was removed with little argument. The general belief is that it all evens out in the end.""For every other one of those where the offense gets to keep the ball, the defense gets the ball even without a jump,"" Keating said. ""People forget about that.""Naismith invented basketball as an indoor wintertime diversion while teaching physical education at the Y.M.C.A. Training College -- later renamed Springfield College -- in Springfield, Mass. He made no mention of jump balls in his 13 original rules. But Rule 9 discussed a ball going out of bounds. ""In case of dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field,"" Naismith wrote.Basketball evolved quickly. The first game had nine players on each side. It did not have foul shots or dribbling.But it was 1936 before rules allowed for a basket to be followed by an inbounds play for the nonscoring team, not a jump ball. Naismith died three years later. In his autobiography, published in 1941, he wrote: ""Personally, I feel that the center jump is to basketball what the kickoff is to football. To award the ball to a team after a goal is scored takes away much of the thrill that is present in an opening play.""It was more akin to a face-off in hockey. But eliminating it between baskets added speed and flow to the game.""Some people would say that the elimination of the jump ball saved basketball,"" said Matt Zeysing, the historian for the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield. ""I would probably agree with that. The game had grown stale.""Before the change, which came before the advent of the N.B.A., teams such as the New York Celtics and the Harlem Rens dominated by dominating jump balls. Basketball, to some degree, was a game of keep-away.Even after jump balls were eliminated between baskets, teams were adept at running set plays off the tips, and jump balls were practiced at least as much as inbounds plays.Some teams used their tallest players for the jump balls; others used their quickest or highest jumpers. Jumpers were instructed to tip the ball to certain players, whose positions around the circle or on the court were dictated by the play being run.Some teams would attempt a quick scoring play before the opposing team could get set. Others, especially if the tip took place on their end of the court, devised defensive setups to prevent an easy basket.""They used to be opportunities to score,"" said the Kentucky associate head coach David Hobbs, the former head coach at Alabama. ""Now, you're not upset if you don't get it because you're just going to get it back.""Several players from teams in the N.C.A.A. tournament said that they have rarely, if ever, practiced a jump ball.""Not at all, to be honest with you,"" Boone said of his UConn team.The reason that the N.C.A.A. eliminated the jump ball from everything but the beginning of the game and the start of overtime was mostly because of officiating. Coaches bemoaned poor tosses and unevenly governed rules about the movement of players around the circle.""If you've seen a lot of basketball, you know -- there's probably 10 guys in the country who can throw it up well,"" said Rosborough, the Arizona associate head coach.Officials were weary of policing the microbursts of mayhem. Trouble sometimes began before the tip, when players would try to get the tallest player into the circle.""The rules committee got rid of the jump ball because of the chaos,"" said Hank Nichols, who worked several Final Fours as an official and now serves as the N.C.A.A.'s coordinator of men's basketball officials.""The jump ball was chaos, especially at one end of the floor or the other,"" he said. ""Then, when you did have a bad toss, the whole thing just looked like a circus.""Now, the games begin just as they did when Naismith first tossed the ball in the air. After that, everything changes.'"

"'06-03-31,'0','WASHINGTON, March 30 - The House voted largely along party lines on Thursday to approve the main measure governing colleges and universities, adding provisions to expand student grants based on need and pressing colleges to control tuition. But the House rejected a Democratic proposal to halve the interest rate on student loans.The $70 billion proposal, which would renew the law until 2012, sets the terms for loans and grants along with the limits for maximum aid. It was last renewed in 1998.The floor debate showcased partisan differences over how to approach an era when increases in tuition routinely outpace inflation and the ability of many Americans to pay for college. Republicans, who are particularly striving to control a soaring budget deficit by avoiding new spending, said the bill would make college more affordable.Democrats wanted to cut interest rates on student loans and enlarge Pell Grants, which had been frozen for several years.The average undergraduate now leaves college carrying nearly $18,000 in debt.In its final form, approved 221 to 199, the measure would simplify the financial aid application and make Pell Grants, the major grant that helps low- and middle-income students, available for summer study. The bill would also raise the spending cap on Pell Grants to $6,000, up from $5,800. The increase would be largely symbolic, however, as the maximum grant Congress appropriates has been frozen for four years at $4,050.The bill would require colleges and universities that raise tuition at more than twice the rate of inflation for three years in a row to explain the increases. But lawmakers abandoned a provision that would have set off audits by the Education Department in the event of increases.The bill would set the interest rate for subsidized loans at 6.8 percent, regardless of whether commercial rates rise or fall. Republicans defeated an amendment introduced by Representative George Miller of California, the ranking Democrat on the Education and Workforce Committee, to halve the interest rate on student loans over the next year.'"

"'06-03-31,'0','Being unregistered was not carte blanche to pillage clients' money. Unregistered hedge funds were and are subject to antifraud provisions of securities laws -- you can't tell your client you are investing in stocks and then buy yourself a Porsche with the money. If the hedge funds trade through broker dealers, those broker dealers are subject to regulatory scrutiny and they cannot lie, cheat or steal for their clients. They must observe ""blue sky laws,"" under which most states police securities and mutual fund sales within their borders, and they are subject to insider trading rules and securities law requirements related to owning more than 5 percent of a stock. Unregistered is not a code word for ""take the money and run.""Nonetheless, the S.E.C. determined that there were a lot of hedge funds with a lot of money and a lot of potential for fraud, so it passed a rule requiring that advisers register if they had more than $25 million under management and money that was not locked up for more than two years.Registration, while hardly boot camp, is no insignificant matter: it subjects advisers to random audits, strict requirements about books and records, the designation of a chief compliance officer and a form that asks questions like: Where do you live? How much money do you manage? And are you a criminal?Hedge fund advisers are now subject to the same rules as mutual fund advisers, except that they do not face the limitations that mutual fund advisers face on performance fees. Nothing lightly regulated about that. But compared with mutual funds or broker dealers, hedge funds still have it easy.According to one S.E.C. lawyer, here's a short list of things mutual funds have to do that hedge funds do not: file quarterly reports to the S.E.C. listing all the securities they own, file semiannual reports to shareholders about their operations, disclose how they vote all proxies, have a capital structure that allows only one class of stock to be issued and restricts the fund adviser's ability to leverage the fund, and a board with an independent chairman and a majority of independent directors.Unlike mutual funds, which must meet diversification requirements, hedge funds can bet the house on a trade they believe in, they can ratchet that bet up with leverage (borrowing money to double or triple the bet), and they can do business with just about anyone they want.When I joked to the lawyer that my Uncle George faced less scrutiny trading clam bellies, the lawyer responded -- in complete seriousness -- that if he were trading clam bellies, he would be a commodity pool operator regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Hedge funds, because they are not registered as public securities, face limitations on how they can advertise themselves. And as one leading hedge fund manager pointed out to me: ""You are regulated by the fact that if you make a mistake, you can be put out of business.""Hedge funds are lightly regulated next to mutual funds, broker dealers, commercial banks and all sorts of entities. But hedge fund managers are currently more regulated than their colleagues at private equity funds.For hedge fund managers, the world has grown more complicated since February. For instance, they can still bet $25 million on clam bellies, as long as there is a compliance officer to approve it, a record of it and copies of all the letters from investors wondering why there was a sign on the door saying ""Gone Fishin.'

"'06-03-31,'0','In most of the cases, including the slaying of another mobster's former girlfriend, Mary Bari, the prosecutor said, it was because the victims had begun talking to the authorities and posed a threat to Mr. Scarpa or his relatives. Mr. Scarpa, who contracted AIDS from a transfusion and died in prison in 1994, was a captain in the Colombo crime family.But it was Mr. Vecchione's argument that former F.B.I. agents had sought to intimidate witnesses on Mr. DeVecchio's behalf, and his contention that a network of former agents who had once worked overseas made him a flight risk, that transformed the hard-fought argument into a pitched battle with the defense.The contention that the former agents would help Mr. DeVecchio flee prompted groans, angry grumbling and some laughter from retired agents in the gallery.And Mr. DeVecchio's lawyer, Douglas E. Grover, belittled Mr. Vecchione, contending that his office was unaccustomed to making organized crime cases, a charge Mr. Vecchione sharply disputed.Mr. DeVecchio is charged with four counts of second-degree murder for acting in concert in the killings and could face a sentence of up to 25 years to life.Wearing a gray checked button-down shirt with the collar open and dark slacks, Mr. DeVecchio did not speak during the hourlong hearing and sat impassively. Mr. Grover called him an honest lawman who had played a key role in the bureau's battle against organized crime.Ultimately, Justice Reichbach released Mr. DeVecchio on $1 million bail, co-signed by 5 of the 45 former agents who Mr. Grover said were willing to step forward. The judge ordered that Mr. DeVecchio surrender his passport and that his movements in and out of his home in Sarasota, Fla., be monitored with an electronic bracelet.One of two other defendants, John Sinagra, 38, an accused mob figure charged in one of the killings, pleaded not guilty and was held without bail pending a hearing on Monday. Another defendant, Craig Sobel, 39, was being held in Florida pending extradition.After the bitter argument over Mr. DeVecchio's bail, the spectacular charges against him still resonated in the courtroom, though some of the accusations first surfaced more than a decade ago, when fellow agents told their superiors of their suspicions that he was funneling secret information to Mr. Scarpa.Internal investigations into those allegations by the F.B.I.'s Office of Professional Responsibility and prosecutors with the Department of Justice -- inquiries that several former federal officials have criticized as deficient -- failed to uncover enough evidence to charge Mr. DeVecchio with a crime or even to discipline him.Mr. Hynes said his investigation began in February 2005 after a member of the House Judiciary Committee, William Delahunt, Democrat of Massachusetts, brought allegations involving Mr. DeVecchio to his attention. Mr. Delahunt was investigating allegations against F.B.I. agents involved in organized crime cases.In the new case, one law enforcement official said the key witness was Linda Schiro, Mr. Scarpa's companion of many years. She knew details about the relationship between the gangster and the lawman because Mr. Scarpa had confided in her, and she was present for telephone calls and meetings between the men in which they discussed their crimes, the official said.Mr. Grover cited her at the arraignment and dismissed her testimony, saying that during the earlier inquiries she had said she knew nothing about the murders. He quoted her as saying then, ""I stay out of the kitchen,"" a reference to the room in Mr. Scarpa's Brooklyn home where Mr. DeVecchio and his informant had their weekly meetings.But another law enforcement official said that Ms. Schiro has reported that during the earlier investigation she felt intimidated by other F.B.I. agents who were associated with Mr. DeVecchio. Both law enforcement officials were given anonymity because the investigation is continuing. Mr. Grover also said at the arraignment that transcripts of testimony by several Colombo family turncoats in trials during the 1990's contradicted the theories about Mr. DeVecchio's role in the murders.The killings detailed by Mr. Vecchione began in 1984, with the slaying of Ms. Bari, 31, the former girlfriend of a fugitive mob figure. She was shot to death by Mr. Scarpa and others in his Brooklyn social club after Mr. DeVecchio warned him that she was talking to the authorities and might reveal the whereabouts of her former boyfriend, Mr. Vecchione said.In 1987, prosecutors said, Mr. DeVecchio provided information that led to the killing of a Colombo soldier, Joseph DeDomenico. The agent told Mr. Scarpa that Mr. DeDomenico was using drugs, committing crimes without sharing the proceeds with Mr. Scarpa and flirting with born-again Christianity, all of them lapses that Mr. DeVecchio said made him a threat, the prosecutor said.Two years later, a group of teenagers -- including Mr. Scarpa's son Joseph -- were joyriding on Halloween when one of them shot and killed 17-year-old Dominick Masseria after a fight that started over thrown eggs, according to the indictment.Mr. Masseria had no ties to organized crime, and prosecutors concede that Mr. DeVecchio had no role in his death. But when Patrick Porco, 18, one of the youngsters in the car, was interviewed by the police about the killing in 1990, Mr. DeVecchio warned Mr. Scarpa that Mr. Porco posed a threat to Joseph, the prosecutor said. So Mr. Porco, too, was killed. Mr. Sinagra was charged yesterday with that crime.The last killing, on May 22, 1992, was part of the bloody Colombo war of that era. Mr. Vecchione said Mr. DeVecchio, using information he gleaned from his agents' surveillance of a Scarpa rival, Lorenzo Lampasi, told Mr. Scarpa that Mr. Lampasi would get out of his car before dawn each morning to lock a gate when he left his home, leaving him vulnerable to attack.Before the hearing yesterday, Chris Mattiace, 58, who worked with Mr. DeVecchio for 25 years and was one of the retired agents who later crowded into the courtroom, said: ""We don't believe it. We believe in him. We believe that the charges are frivolous.""But members of Mr. Masseria's family, who attended the district attorney's news conference, took a different view. Even though Mr. DeVecchio was not charged in the young man's killing, they suggested that suspicions that the retired supervisor had a role in the Porco killing had kept the truth from coming to light. ""If we can't trust the F.B.I., who can we trust,"" said Dorothy Garuccio, a sister of Mr. Masseria.'"
"'06-03-31,'0','""What's next? Are we going to pay for municipal office buildings with state debt?"" he said. ""What about that monument in the park? Is that suddenly going to be a state debt problem?""Mr. Pataki echoed those concerns, saying that although he supported giving the city that amount of school construction aid, ""We just have to look at the technical structure of it to make sure it's appropriate, that is doesn't jeopardize the state's credit or in any way violate or run afoul of our historic debt-reform legislation we passed a few years back.""Legislative leaders and their top aides, who have been particularly critical of Mr. Cape, said the state had devised similar state bond deals recently. They did acknowledge, however, the unusual nature of the larger component of the school construction aid deal, which would use state school aid sent to New York City as a guarantee to pay off $9.4 billion in bonds issued by the city's Transitional Finance Authority.Assembly Democrats argued that a court order for a multibillion-dollar infusion of funds for city schools required an aggressive response, far beyond what Mr. Pataki has been proposing.""The C.F.E. case is unprecedented,"" Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said in an interview, referring to the court orders for school financing resulting from suits brought by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity. ""That's a liability of the state. They refuse to recognize that.""Mr. Cape also said the governor's staff believed that changes made to Mr. Pataki's original, more modest property tax relief plan were not constitutional. In a 2004 decision, the State Court of Appeals said the state Constitution forbade the Legislature from rewriting the governor's budget language.""They just went into the governor's appropriation, they took out the cap, and substituted their own language for how the money would get spent,"" Mr. Cape said. ""You can't do that. You've got to have a separately stated add that is subject to the governor's line-item veto.""The governor and the Legislature have until the week of April 10 to negotiate their differences. They continue to skirmish over even the size of the Legislature's budget, with Mr. Cape saying it was as high as $115 billion, not $112.4 billion to $113.4 billion the Legislature claimed.Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno continued to fire away at Mr. Cape's accounting skills, suggesting on Thursday that Mr. Cape would have trouble even adding two plus two and was acting more like a lawyer than a budget director.""Contrary to Senator Bruno's assertion, I'm not a lawyer,"" Mr. Cape said, adding, ""Two plus two equals four.""'"
