"'08-12-01,'0','Citigroup’s troubles should come as no surprise. In 1998, when people like Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin were busy persuading Congress to eliminate New Deal firewalls between financial services sectors, many advocates warned that this would create unaccountable and potentially unstable financial institutions that were too big to fail.News of taxpayers’ huge bailout of Citigroup (“U.S. Approves Plan to Help Citigroup Weather Losses,” front page, Nov. 24) prompted us to dust off a series of comment letters we submitted to federal regulators starting a decade ago.In a detailed comment opposing Citigroup’s merger with Traveler’s Group, filed in July 1998, the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project and others warned the Federal Reserve that “the size and complexity of the proposed Citigroup would strain the banking industry and the economy,” and that failure of one affiliate “could lead to a bailout using either deposit insurance or funds appropriated by Congress.”Hundreds of billions of dollars in bailout funds later, we would hope that President-elect Barack Obama’s economic advisers — many of whom are Rubin protégés — take the lessons of recent history to heart. What’s needed is a strong new regulatory system that serves the public interest, not one that serves corporate greed.The writers are co-directors of the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project.'"

"'08-12-01,'0','GENEVA (AP) — The world’s most comprehensive legalized heroin program became permanent on Sunday with overwhelming approval from Swiss voters, who separately rejected the legalization of marijuana.The heroin program, started in 1994, is offered in 23 centers across Switzerland. It has helped eliminate scenes of large groups of drug users shooting up openly in parks and is credited with reducing crime and improving the health and daily lives of addicts.The nearly 1,300 addicts selected for the program visit one of the centers twice a day to receive a carefully measured dose of heroin produced by a government-approved laboratory.They keep their paraphernalia in cups labeled with their names, and use the equipment and clean needles to inject themselves under the supervision of nurses. They also get counseling from psychiatrists and social workers.The United States and the United Nations narcotics board have criticized the program as potentially fueling drug abuse. But it has attracted attention from governments as far away as Australia and Canada, which have started or are considering their own programs modeled on the system.The Netherlands began a smaller program in 2006, and it serves nearly 600 patients. Britain has allowed individual doctors to prescribe heroin since the 1920s, but it has been running trials similar to the Swiss approach in recent years. Belgium, Germany, Spain and Canada have also been running trial programs.'"
"'08-12-01,'0','The stream, which is outside Victor, south of Missoula, is known for its abundance of large trout and is expected to attract fishermen from all over.The landowners are preparing to have far less privacy.“I’m crushed personally,” said Kenneth F. Siebel, managing director of Private Wealth Partners, a money management firm, who is the owner of the Bitterroot Springs Ranch, along Mitchell Slough. “We were totally surprised. A populist Supreme Court came to the conclusion they wanted and worked backward.”Mr. Siebel, who has lived here for 29 years, said he had spent millions rebuilding, narrowing and deepening the slough. “I’ve put time and energy and love into the property,” he said, “and it’s all gone. And it’s a shame.”A home belonging to Anthony Marnell II, the head of a casino construction company, is built over a tributary to Mitchell Slough. Robert N. Lane, the chief legal counsel for the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department, said he thought the public would soon be able to gain access to fish the tributary.“I guess they’ll have to portage around his living room,” Mr. Lane said of Mr. Marnell.Mr. Lane hailed the ruling as “great — a significant decision” that would continue public access to other streams.“It’s not the only place in the state,” he said, “where people could say, ‘It’s altered enough, it’s no longer public.’ ”Despite having supported the landowners, Edith L. Wark, a rancher from just outside Victor, said she did not expect many problems. “I don’t think a lot of people will stampede through the place,” Ms. Wark said.Mr. Lane said his department would watch for any conflicts. He added that the stream would not officially open until the completion of paperwork, expected in a couple of weeks.At least one fisherman was not willing to wait. “I took a picture of a guy fishing there this morning,” said Michael Howell, publisher of The Bitterroot Star and a member of the Bitterroot River Protective Association, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit that led to the court ruling. “The same guy who was arrested there in 1991, Randy Rose.”Mr. Rose was arrested on trespassing charges for fishing on a section of stream that runs through Mr. Lewis’s property, but he was found not guilty by a justice of the peace. His arrest eventually helped to spark the association’s lawsuit, which challenged a 2003 decision by the Bitterroot Conservation District that the slough was not a natural stream for permit purposes.As for Mr. Siebel, he said he and other landowners would be watching. “Anyone who trespasses,” he said, “will be arrested.”'"
"'08-12-01,'0','Calculated Risk, which gets about 75,000 visitors a day, was started in early 2005 by a retired technology executive named Bill McBride. The housing market was soaring, but Mr. McBride sensed that the industry was about to peak, and he posted articles and data that made his case.The blog quickly drew a lively and informed group of commentators, few livelier and none more informed than someone who called herself Tanta. She began by correcting some of Mr. McBride’s posts. “She would tell me either I was wrong or the article I was quoting was wrong,” he said Sunday. “It was clear she really knew her stuff. And she was funny about it.”Tanta soon graduated from merely commenting to being a full-scale partner. Her first post, in December 2006, took issue with an optimistic Citigroup report that maintained that the mortgage industry would “rationalize” in 2007, to the benefit of larger players like, well, Citigroup.“Bear with me while I ask some stupid questions,” Tanta wrote, and proceeded to assert that the industry was less likely to “rationalize” than fall apart, which it did. Citigroup was bailed out by the government last month.She loved the intricacies of mortgage financing and would joke about being not just a nerd on the subject but a nerd’s nerd. She eventually wrote, for the Calculated Risk site, “The Compleat ÜberNerd,” 13 lengthy articles on mortgage origination channels, mortgage-backed securities and foreclosures that constituted a definitive word on the subject.The rest of the time, Tanta liked to chew on the follies of regulators, the idiocies of lenders and — a particular favorite — clueless reporters, which according to her was just about all of them. She did not approve, she once wrote, of “parading one’s ignorance about mortgages in an article full of high-minded tut-tutting over ignorance about mortgages.”In March 2006, Ms. Dungey was diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer.Ms. Dungey was raised in Bloomington-Normal, Ill., had a graduate degree in English, and worked as a writer and trainer for a variety of lenders, including Champion Federal and AmerUs Mortgage.One of Tanta’s last posts was written as the $700 billion bailout was first being debated in mid-September, and it seemed that the Treasury Department might buy bad assets directly from troubled banks.Tanta argued that for every asset that banks unloaded on the government, the chief executives should be required to explain “why they acquired or originated this asset to begin with, what’s really wrong with it in detail, what they have learned from this experience, and what steps they are taking to make sure it never happens again.”'"
"'08-12-01,'0','That setup allowed U.S. Helicopter’s customers, who paid as much as $159 for an eight-minute ride, to clear security in Manhattan and fly directly to secure areas of the airports.Until Nov. 1, the company was running flights from two heliports — one near Wall Street and another at the east end of 34th Street — to Kennedy and Newark. For the past few weeks, travelers who live or work in Lower Manhattan have had to travel more than three miles uptown to the East 34th Street Heliport to board a U.S. Helicopter flight.U.S. Helicopter had ambitious plans to expand the service to La Guardia and a third heliport on the West Side of Manhattan, then to other cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles. But demand for the service has been weak, and the company has had trouble financing its growth.As its losses have piled up, the company has been borrowing to stay in business at interest rates as high as 15 percent, according to its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Earlier this year, the company’s auditors expressed doubt about its ability to continue operating.It was unclear how much U.S. Helicopter had suffered from being barred from using its downtown heliport or how long the company could survive without it. Donal McSullivan, the company’s chief marketing officer, did not respond to messages left on his cellphone and at the company’s offices.U.S. Helicopter’s troubles were compounded when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey stopped managing the downtown heliport on Oct. 31. City officials had expected FirstFlight, which won the contract to operate the heliport over several other bidders, to take over without disruption, said David Lombino, a spokesman for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which oversaw the bidding.But the company did not draw up a security plan of its own and seek the Transportation Security Administration’s approval until the Port Authority’s managers were leaving the heliport and taking their security plan with them, aviation officials said.Paul Dudley, owner of Linden Airport Management Corporation in New Jersey, an unsuccessful bidder, sued the Economic Development Corporation in state and federal courts and appealed to city officials, arguing, among other things, that FirstFlight was unqualified to operate the heliport. The failure to obtain the required federal approval was proof that he was right, Mr. Dudley said in an interview.“The city should have canceled them immediately because they failed to meet a principal and fundamental requirement of the contract,” Mr. Dudley said.Ronald J. Ricciardi, vice chairman of FirstFlight, did not respond to a request for comment.“Any new entity that would be a new operator would hopefully understand the importance of security in the New York City area and should expect to comply with Congressional mandates for upholding the highest levels of security,” Ms. Uselding said.She added that the security administration was working with FirstFlight officials and hoped to have an acceptable security plan drawn up “in the coming weeks.”In the meantime, the downtown heliport has remained open for the sightseeing and charter flights by other companies that account for most of the traffic there, Mr. Lombino said. “The transition to FirstFlight has been otherwise seamless, and the heliport has been operating in a safe and efficient manner.”'"
"'08-12-01,'0','The amount the city must pay back is likely to surge again in the next two months, analysts who follow the city budget said, as companies stymied by tight credit markets scramble for additional money to pay for operating expenses and other needs.“When you’re trying to harness every shekel you’ve got, you start paying attention to everything,” said Carol O’Cleireacain, a former finance commissioner and budget director under Mayor David N. Dinkins who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “And this is one of the liabilities they can quantify. So they say to themselves, ‘The lines of credit are frozen, I need money for operating expenses, so why don’t I go and get some of the tax refund back early?’ ”Through the first 10 months of this year, the city paid out $804 million in refunds to companies, many of them in the financial sector, versus an average of $246 million over the same period the previous three years.The same dismal development is playing out in Albany, though the increase is less acute. New York State paid out $1 billion in corporate refunds during the first 10 months of 2008, in contrast to the $581 million it paid out during the same period in 2007.In all, corporate taxes make up $5.4 billion of total taxes paid to the city, or 14 percent, and $6 billion of total taxes paid to the state, or 15.6 percent.“The impact will be greater here than in the rest of the nation, given the size and concentration of the financial industry in New York City and New York State,” said Kenneth B. Bleiwas, deputy state comptroller for New York City.And the metropolitan area does not have a monopoly on the refund trend. Scott D. Pattison, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, a professional organization, says the topic has been coming up more often in conversations with budget officials from around the country. It is something he has seen before, he said, but not on this scale.“That’s usually the pattern,” Mr. Pattison said, “especially at the beginning of really bad times.”Since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg unveiled the city’s latest budget projections on Nov. 5, much of the attention from the City Council and advocacy groups has focused on preserving the money that the city sends out the door: tax rebate checks for property owners, financing for schools and programs for the elderly.But economists and city officials are deeply concerned about the money coming in. And they say that the tremendous surge in tax refunds is emblematic of the tight squeeze that the city finds itself in, both short-term and long-term.“I don’t remember this being a big issue before,” said Charles M. Brecher, research director for the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed watchdog group, referring to corporate refunds. “It seems like a sign of people being in pretty serious trouble.”The surge in refunds is already contributing to a new $285 million shortfall in the current year’s budget, thus making it imperative, city officials say, to cut programs and raise taxes even earlier than anticipated.The rise in refund requests also gives the city less wiggle room to do everything that Mr. Bloomberg and the City Council agreed to in June in the city’s annual budget. This helps to explain, city officials say, why the mayor has been so stubborn about delaying the $400 property tax rebate checks that homeowners have been expecting since October. The rebate program is worth $256 million.The requests also underscore the sobering reality that many of the city’s corporations will not be paying much, if anything, in taxes for years to come. Most companies trying to absorb billions of dollars in losses this year are entitled to spread out those losses over several years, and therefore will not be liable for taxes. That translates, city officials estimate, into a loss of roughly $2 billion in tax revenue over the next few years.“This will be a continuing issue — figuring out what happens to all those losses from now-defunct or nearly defunct firms, and how those losses will work their way through the system during the course of bankruptcies and bailouts and into the tax system,” said Donald J. Boyd, a former state budget official who is now a senior fellow at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, part of the State University of New York system.Mr. Bloomberg has called the corporate refunds an “enormous liability.”City officials say that they cannot legally disclose which companies are receiving refunds, because of state laws concerning confidentiality, privacy and competition. (The New York Times asked more than a dozen major companies that have reported fiscal difficulties this year whether they were among those requesting refunds, but the companies either did not respond or declined to comment.)Owen Stone, a spokesman for the city’s Department of Finance, said that the requests had “come from a wide variety of business sectors, including financial services and information services.” A handful of companies account for a significant portion of the $804 million, however. Mr. Stone said the city had received two refund requests for more than $50 million and four between $10 million and $25 million.Just since September, Mr. Stone added, the city has issued 7,757 refunds to companies totaling $261 million. That represents an increase of 18 percent in the number of refunds, and 72 percent in the amount being refunded over the same period last year.“This is an environment in which liquidity is a huge issue for big and small firms,” said Marcia J. Van Wagner, a deputy in the New York City comptroller’s office who specializes in budget issues. “Everyone needs cash, and cash is king.”'"
"'08-12-01,'0','Since its introduction, the iPhone, which is available only through AT&T in the United States, has helped AT&T steal customers from other carriers. Wireless service operators are now concentrating on retaining current subscribers as much as they are trying to reel in new ones, said Charles Golvin, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. Part of that strategy, Mr. Golvin said, is offering perks like exclusive “presales” of hot new models to subscribers.Phone shoppers say carriers and contracts have a big influence on their decisions about phones. “I’m pretty sure my next phone will be a touch screen,” said Vernon McIntosh, 40, a personal trainer from New York who is an AT&T customer.Mr. McIntosh was in a Verizon store last week and said he was choosing between an iPhone and the BlackBerry Storm. “But I’m not eligible for an upgrade at AT&T,” he said. “It might be cheaper to switch contracts.”To help drum up excitement for the release of the Storm, Verizon Wireless rolled out a teaser campaign in early October that zeroed in on the phone’s distinctive feature: a palpable clicking sensation when the screen is pressed.The Storm, which costs $200 after rebate with a new two-year contract, also has built-in appeal for the existing base of BlackBerry fanatics, and it appears to be a hit. When the Storm went on sale Nov. 21, people lined up outside Verizon stores to get their hands on it, and many stores quickly sold out.An employee at a Verizon Wireless store in Midtown Manhattan said Friday that none of the company’s stores in Manhattan had the Storm in stock, but that people were still streaming in to place orders. The earliest those customers can expect their phones to ship is Dec. 15, the employee said.Nancy Stark, a spokeswoman for Verizon, said she could not provide figures on sales or inventory for the Storm, although she did say it had been the company’s “fastest-selling phone to date.” Verizon’s next touch-screen models are the $350 HTC Touch Pro, available now, and the $249 Samsung Omnia, which is for sale online and will be in stores next week.Touch-screen phones do have their critics. Mr. Snyder says the bigger screens are a drain on battery life, and the phones require users to look at the screen instead of getting to know the phone’s buttons by feel.“You’re getting all these extras so you can look at the phone and stand still, when you bought the phone so you could move,” he said. “Only a niche of users are going to be willing to spend money to have the extra capability.”“The hype surrounding the touch-screen technology far exceeds its impact,” Mr. Snyder said.Dave Perry, a business developer who was shopping in a Verizon store in Manhattan last week, said he liked the user-friendliness and big screens of touch-screen phones. “But there are drawbacks: the accuracy of typing and reliability of the screen,” he said.“I don’t necessarily think the technology is where it needs to be,” Mr. Perry said, adding that the occasional problems and slow responses from the devices were “not something I’m willing to wait for.”Touch-screen phones remain a fraction of the overall mobile phone market, but sales have been soaring. In the 12 months through September, sales of the phones in North America grew 130 percent, in contrast to 4 percent growth in the overall phone market, according to comScore M:Metrics, a market research firm.As of September, M:Metrics data shows, more than 2.6 million people in North America had some model of the iPhone. The second-most-popular touch-screen model was the LG Voyager, which was available through Verizon Wireless and had 851,000 users.Mr. Golvin said it was unlikely that touch-screen phones would take over the industry.“There’s no question that it’s a very fast-growing segment of the market,” Mr. Golvin said. “It’s become one of the form factors that some consumers want.”But Mr. Golvin said there had been similar frenzies for flip phones and candy-bar-style phones when they were introduced. “And yet today, there are still plenty of people who prefer a flip phone.”Touch-screen technology first appeared in devices like the Treo that were aimed at professional users, and the screens were best activated with thin plastic styluses. Since the advent of the iPhone, more touch screens are activated with the fingers, and the phones themselves are aimed at mainstream users.The phones also tend to cost several hundred dollars, which could hurt sales in an economic downturn. For its part, Sprint is fighting the barrage of high-end phones from its competitors with a new marketing campaign that emphasizes the money-saving value of its phones and plans.Ev Gonzalez, director of device marketing for Verizon Wireless, said the company recognized that touch-screen technology was not for everyone. In fact, he said, touch screens are likely to show up on a limited number of the company’s devices.“There are consumers who are looking for straight phone services,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “Where the touch screen is not needed, we won’t provide it.”'"
"'08-12-01,'0','OPEC members need prices of $60 to $90 a barrel to balance their budgets, and the prospect of lower prices and revenue is daunting to many. Even Saudi Arabia, the biggest exporter, indicated that it considered $75 a barrel to be a “fair price,” a far higher figure than most analysts had expected from the kingdom.But as the Cairo meeting illustrated, there are unmistakable signs that the group was struggling to maintain unity.“It is at times when the organization is under pressure that its cohesion is tested,” said Raad Alkadiri, an energy specialist at PFC Energy, a consulting firm, who was in Cairo. “Right now, there is a sense it’s not in the driving seat.”The oil market has gone full circle at an astonishing speed. The factors that pushed up prices since 2003 — surging demand, sluggish production and investors flocking to commodity markets — have mostly disappeared.Dimming the prospects for oil, the global economy entered into a broad-based recession in the third quarter, according to JPMorgan Chase analysts, and will not have positive growth before the second quarter of next year, at the earliest.In the United States, oil demand plunged by 2.6 million barrels a day in September, or nearly 13 percent, according to monthly figures from the Energy Department. Demand was 17.7 million barrels a day, the lowest monthly level since October 1995.Overall global consumption could drop for the first time in 25 years this year and might not recover before 2011, analysts said. Some say OPEC must cut output by at least three million barrels a day to make up for declining demand in industrialized nations.Behind the facade, the cartel is facing its toughest test in years. The meeting failed to resolve deep-seated issues like what each country is currently pumping and how much more the members should reduce production. Instead, producers tried to stay on message. “OPEC is united,” Shokri Ghanem, the oil minister from Libya, said Saturday.Signs of tensions remain. The Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, are unwilling to approve further trims before other members follow through on previous commitments to reduce output, particularly Iran and Venezuela.Analysts said the Saudis wanted to show just how serious it was about all cartel members sharing the burden. Even as the Saudis appear ready to play hardball, OPEC is laying the groundwork for a more coordinated approach.OPEC’s secretary general, Abdalla Salem el-Badri, has asked producers outside the cartel — Russia, Mexico and Norway — to restrain supplies, as some did in the late 1990s when prices slumped below $10 a barrel. These countries will attend the group’s meeting in Algeria.“Our concern is about overproduction,” Abdullah al-Attiyah, Qatar’s energy minister, said. “If you’re producing oil and no one is buying it, this is the concern.”'"

"'08-12-02,'1','Plasma televisions offer even better deals. While prices do vary almost daily, a Panasonic 50-inch plasma display with 720p resolution was $975 on Amazon.com recently; a Samsung of the same size was $900 at Sixth Avenue Electronics; and a 42-inch 1080p resolution Samsung model was $807 at Sixth Avenue Electronics. Three years ago, the Panasonic’s predecessor cost $3,000.“It is nothing short of amazing that a customer can get a 50-inch set for under $1,000,” said Bob Perry, Panasonic’s senior vice president for marketing. “If you said that one year ago, people would think about locking you in a room with rubber walls.”Thanks to increasing worldwide sales and economies of scale, a wide range of large-screen HDTVs are now available for three-figure prices. At Wal-Mart, for example, 42- to 50-inch plasma and LCD sets can be found for $600 to $925. Some lesser-known brands in a 32-inch screen size are around $400.At Costco, a Sharp 19-inch LCD costs $269, a Samsung 24-inch is priced at $450 and a Sharp 32-inch is $650.To attract the price-conscious, Sony introduced its “M” line of televisions, designed for big box stores that “want to buy Sony without all the bells and whistles,” Mr. Waynick said.To cut costs, the company uses 720p resolution, rather than 1080p, and less sophisticated color processing, offering a lower contrast ratio than in its more expensive sets. “Our contrast ratio is on a par with the rest of the marketplace,” Mr. Waynick said. If price is your main consideration, here are several tips on how to keep costs down and still get the best television for your money.720P VS. 1080P If you are considering a television that is 40 inches or smaller, a less-expensive 720p resolution set is likely to produce a picture that looks as good as one from a 1080p set.A television that can display a higher resolution is more important in bigger screen sizes, where the difference can be seen at normal viewing distances. (Only Blu-ray players can actually deliver a 1080p signal. The set will “upconvert” other program sources, like television broadcasts, to near-1080p quality.)“Below 40 inches, 1080p is a complete waste,” said Gary Merson, editor in chief of HDGuru.com, an HDTV Web site.VIEWING ANGLE LCD televisions tend to have smaller viewing angles than plasma sets. So if your friends are over to watch the game, those sitting on the left and right of the screen will see an image with blacks that look gray; whites that are darker; reduced contrast; and colors that have shifted.“It’s like, ‘who changed the tint control?’ ” Mr. Merson said.To counter that effect, Mr. Merson said, consumers should look for LCD televisions that use I.P.S., or in-plane switching technology. I.P.S. is available on Hitachi and Panasonic sets; Samsung and Sony have a similar technology called S-PVA.INPUTS HDMI is the gold standard for connecting components to the television. It cuts down clutter by combining audio and video into one cable.

As always, these combo units remain a bad idea.If the player breaks, you will need to buy another DVD unit, or you will need to send the unit out for repair, depriving you of a television while one component is being fixed.LESSER KNOWN BRANDS When all televisions were analog, each company made its own components to its own specifications. With the rise of digital technology, many companies simply buy hardware from the same manufacturers. Differences in picture quality come from the techniques used by each company to process the signal.“You would be surprised at the names of the top-tier brands being built by the same factories that build our TVs,” said Rey Roque, vice president for marketing at Westinghouse, a lower-priced brand.If budget is your prime consideration, consider buying a less-well-known brand. But before you do, check its reliability on sites like Consumer Reports (consumerreports.org). Also, find out if the company will stand behind the television once the warranty expires; and find out if you need to ship the set back to the company if it stops working.

"'08-12-02,'1','“I was so relieved to see Plax healthy,” said Rosenhaus, ignoring the possibility that Burress’s actions could have had broader ramifications. He expressed no relief that other Latin Quarter customers were not shot.Instead, Rosenhaus was in self-absorbed-agent mode, caring only about himself and his client, and praising the Giants’ owners and General Manager Jerry Reese for caring, so far, only about Burress’s health.“I’m very touched by the way the Giants have handled this,” Rosenhaus said.Of course he is. The Giants have full leverage on Burress, who has rarely seemed content with the five-year, $35 million contract he signed in September. Only $11 million of the total is guaranteed, so it is Rosenhaus’s fiduciary obligation to his client to be as nice as possible to Giants management, especially if Burress’s lawyer helps him avoid jail time.Rosenhaus kissed up to the Giants but would not answer Kornheiser’s question about Burress, really the central question about Burress’s behavior: “What was he doing with a gun, in a nightclub, two nights before a game he wasn’t going to be playing in because of an injury?”“You know, Tony,” Rosenhaus said, “that’s not something I can talk about because we’re in the middle of a legal proceeding.”While that was a prudent answer, he then told Kornheiser that he would answer the question privately. Public figures like Rosenhaus rarely declare their public intention to divulge information privately.

"'08-12-02,'1','WASHINGTON — President Bush issued an executive order on Monday that denies collective bargaining rights to about 8,600 federal employees who work in law enforcement, intelligence and other agencies responsible for national security.Mr. Bush said it would be inconsistent with “national security requirements” to allow those employees to engage in collective bargaining with respect to the conditions of their employment.Among those affected are 5,000 employees of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is now part of the Justice Department.Scott M. Stanzel, a White House spokesman, said that 4,000 of those employees had not chosen to participate in collective bargaining. But he said that 900 were represented by collective bargaining units.Colleen M. Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said that employees at the alcohol, tobacco and firearms agency had just “had their collective bargaining rights stripped away for no justifiable reason.”'"
"'08-12-02,'1','“We’ve had quite a few people call who are losing their houses and have to cancel birthday parties,” he said.In addition, Mr. Baker said, a few years ago he refinanced the theater’s mortgage to help pay for rising operating costs, and the mortgage payments have shot up. A business deal he made to improve his space went bad. He said he was negotiating with his lenders, and added ruefully, “I am more of an artist than a businessman.”In a city where children’s movies are often screened in a Hollywood theater with white-glove popcorn service and the organic certifications of birthday cakes are debated at length on Web sites aimed at parents, Mr. Baker’s theater is a charming throwback.As they have for generations, children gather in a circle on the floor of the 200-person capacity auditorium as Mr. Baker’s elaborately appointed marionettes scamper about to the sounds of old phonograph records, scratches and all. The theater is one of the few places in Los Angeles that routinely attracts racially and economically diverse groups of children.A typical show requires about 15 workers, including 8 puppeteers, a lighting designer, a costume maker and ticket takers. There are usually two productions a year, one with a Christmas theme. The second show might be “Something to Crow About,” a barnyard spectacular; the Latin-flavored “Fiesta”; or a revue like “Bob Baker’s Musical World,” which might evolve over the season and employ a rotation of 100 or more puppets. Mr. Baker also performs puppet shows around Southern California for birthday parties and other events. The annual budget, Mr. Baker said, is about $360,000.Victoria Hurley, 42, grew up in Los Angeles going to the shows, and now takes her children, who are 5 and 3. “They still serve the exact kind of ice cream with the exact same wooden spoon I got 30 years ago,” Mrs. Hurley said. “The quality of the entertainment has certainly held up fantastically, but I think the building could use some sprucing. It is almost like they haven’t even repainted. I personally think it is charming, but if I came from New York and brought my children I might feel otherwise.”At a recent performance of “The Nutcracker,” an eclectic mix of Mr. Baker’s handmade puppets appeared, ranging from a Mouse King, resplendent in velvet, to what is perhaps best described as selections from the “Soul Train” collection, white leisure suits and gold trim included.The marionettes are handled by Mr. Baker’s students, who spend a good year under his tutelage before they are allowed to don black clothing and work before an audience. As they moved through the room they occasionally dropped a puppet into the lap of a delighted toddler. As usual, the whole affair ended with a cup of vanilla ice cream handed to each child.The shows are not exactly linear. The “Soul Train” marionettes, for example, are wedged into “The Nutcracker,” and the story seems oddly lacking in the middle section. But the focus is really on the puppets, in their glorious velvet and gossamer.“There is a magic thing about a live puppet show,” Mr. Baker said recently. “I was watching the children just today and they were hugging the puppets, and then they always come up after me and ask me how they work. A lot of children who come here have never been to a live show and may never go to a live show again.”The number of people whose careers as puppeteers Mr. Baker started is “amazing, at least a dozen professionally,” said Greg Williams, 51, a professional puppeteer who helps Mr. Baker with his road shows. “I started with him when I was 15, and was cleaning the party room. I went from there to doing the sets to the lights. One day a puppeteer wasn’t available, and I got shoved on the floor,” Mr. Williams said.Mr. Baker “gets a lot of the neighborhood kids, and some of these kids who look like they would have no future are here entertaining and enjoying it,” Mr. Williams said. Mr. Baker still does many private birthday parties personally. “You get those Beverly Hills parents and you need to keep those people happy,” he added.Mr. Baker, whose puppet passion began at an early age, has had an authentic Hollywood career — something not immediately evident given his modest site downtown.He grew up in what is now Koreatown, in a house often full of actors and others from the “theatrical world,” Mr. Baker said, and graduated from Hollywood High School. When he was a little boy, his father took him to a holiday show at an area department store, which featured, as many store entertainments did in the early 20th century, puppets.When he turned 7 he bought two puppets and soon started working the birthday party circuit. He said his first party was for Mervyn LeRoy, a producer and director for both Warner Brothers and MGM, which set off a word-of-mouth campaign. Years later he would perform at Liza Minnelli’s fourth birthday party. (And, keeping it in the family, a few years after that, he appeared in the 1954 Judy Garland film, “A Star Is Born,” conducting a marionette show.)In the 1940s Mr. Baker worked as a puppet maker for George Pal, creator of the Puppetoons, whose movies and television credits include cult films like Edgar G. Ulmer’s “Bluebeard” (1944), the original “Star Trek” series and “Bewitched.”Mr. Baker started his production company in 1949 with his business partner, Alton Wood (who died in 2001). It has remained one of the more well-known training grounds for puppet makers who have gone on to work in fantasy films.But it is the theater, opened in 1960 in a warehouselike building, for which Mr. Baker is best known around town. The elaborate facade meant to suggest “Alice in Wonderland” is long gone, as are the evening performances, which Mr. Baker said faded after the 1965 Watts riots made people afraid to venture downtown at night. Weekends and shows for school groups — along with sales of puppets and movie work — have sustained him, and he hopes the doors of his theater will stay open.“My mother used to say, ‘We can fall into a mud puddle and come up smelling like roses,’ ” Mr. Baker said. “We have gone through some pretty hard times, and I just have to see the light of day. We’re just going to make it.”'"
"'08-12-02,'1','Creating a beloved New York City institution from a standing start takes imagination, talent, tenacity and good luck.In the case of the Big Apple Circus, the intimate, single-ring extravaganza that is currently in its 31st season in Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, the ingredients for success have also included a distinctive blue tent, a big dollop of whimsy and an urban sensibility. That, and a family-friendly mix of clever clowning, acrobatics, aerial and animal acts and no shortage of old-fashioned showmanship.Small wonder that countless New York City parents, including this one, rank visits to the Big Apple Circus with their children among their fondest family memories. Some years, we’ve caught the circus during its summer stop by the Rhode Island shore — an experience, I confess, that’s always been enhanced by a smug sense that we were sharing our circus with the locals.The present production, “Play On!,” features a cast of 28 people from 12 countries, 4 horses and 8 dogs rescued from animal shelters — the dogs are part of the circus’s less-known tradition of community service. A Big Apple program teaches circus arts to inner-city schoolchildren, and each year the circus gives special performances for vision-impaired and hearing-impaired youngsters. Its Clown Care unit sends trained clowns to entertain children in city hospitals.This is a moment of transition. At the end of the year, Paul Binder, the founder, artistic director and ringmaster of the Big Apple Circus, has said that he would be stepping down to assume a smaller, behind-the-scenes role. The institution he invented and nurtured along with his co-founder and former juggling partner, Michael Christensen, will be getting a new circus boss in Guillaume Dufresnoy, the outfit’s present general manager.That will ensure the continuity the circus needs, especially in a tough economy.

"'08-12-02,'1','The man who went to court rather than reveal details of the Senate’s pork-barrel spending now speaks proudly of his company’s role in designing a program for the state comptroller that allows reporters or the public to examine any contract between a state agency and a vendor.And Mr. Bruno, who once did most of his deal-making in secret as one of Albany’s “three men in a room” — along with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and a succession of governors — now spends much of his time hobnobbing at meetings and conferences in Texas, Arizona and other places. He hopes to double CMA’s business over the next two years, in part by promoting the company’s products to cash-strapped state officials nationwide.“I feel like technology is a place that governments at all levels are going to have to look at for relief, to create efficiencies that they want and need, to create the service that people demand these days, to be responsive and to do it in a cost-effective way,” Mr. Bruno, 79, said in an hourlong interview recently at a publicist’s office in Manhattan.“You people can have some fun with that,” Mr. Bruno added gamely, referring to the press. “But I’ve always really been kind of on the leading edge of being open.”As Mr. Bruno pursues his new career, however, the vestiges of his old one still loom. In recent weeks, a grand jury heard additional testimony in a two-year-old federal investigation into outside business dealings Mr. Bruno had while serving as senator, according to two lawyers involved in the case.Since late October, Mr. Bruno has spent at least $24,999 from his campaign account to pay legal bills, according to the State Board of Elections. Federal prosecutors began the inquiry by looking into earmarks and economic development grants arranged by Mr. Bruno. Over the summer, it expanded to examine investments made by some unions with business before the Legislature in a private fund that employed Mr. Bruno. The lawyers involved in the case predict a conclusion by the end of the year, though no one seems sure what that would mean for Mr. Bruno — least of all Mr. Bruno himself.“I personally haven’t heard from them,” Mr. Bruno said, referring to federal investigators. “My take is that they’re looking to see if they think anything was done wrong. I’ve never been charged, never even been told that I was a target, by anybody. So I am doing my thing, making what contribution I can to the health and welfare of myself and the business community here.”The office of the United States attorney for the Northern District of New York, which is conducting the investigation, declined comment. Since resigning his Senate seat in July, Mr. Bruno has largely withdrawn from daily politics. He has begun to empty out his campaign account with checks to old Senate colleagues and local Republican organizations and has turned down most requests to appear at political events. Former colleagues said he calls occasionally to catch up, but has resisted the role of Republican elder statesman. For some time after leaving the Senate, Mr. Bruno said, he did not even speak with his successor as majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, Republican from Long Island.“I made up my mind, once I was out, that I wasn’t going to try to be looking over anyone’s shoulders, I wasn’t going to be Monday morning quarterbacking,” Mr. Bruno said.His passions now, Mr. Bruno says, are his business, his family and his horses, which he tends to every day on his farm in Brunswick, N.Y. Mr. Bruno has largely escaped the grind of political life, friends say — not to mention blame for his party’s loss of the Senate in November and the dismal possibilities of life in the minority there.“You can almost feel in his voice a load off his shoulders,” said Jasper Nolan, the longtime Republican chairman in Saratoga County.But leaving the Capitol has not meant leaving the public sector behind. On the contrary: Although Mr. Bruno says he hopes most of the firm’s expansion will be in the private sector, the vast majority of CMA’s revenue comes from government contracts. Indeed, the firm expects that Mr. Bruno’s vast experience in government will be a selling point to potential new clients.“It’s helping me a great deal, having been there, on the inside, and now being on the outside,” Mr. Bruno said.With 410 employees and $42 million in annual revenues, CMA was a thriving and respected business even before Mr. Bruno was recruited. (The outgoing president, Kay McCabe Stafford, is the widow of Ronald Stafford, a former Republican senator who was a friend and colleague of Mr. Bruno’s.) In Texas, for example, the firm designed a system for the state’s child welfare agency that tracks case workers with global-positioning devices and allows them to file reports using handheld equipment. In Arizona and a dozen other states, CMA runs food-stamp programs, using automated software to track what mix of foods are being purchased by people receiving aid.But close to half of the company’s public-sector business is in New York, and includes state and city agencies. The firm has three dozen contracts with state agencies totaling about $30 million, according to state records. Five of those contracts, worth about $1.4 million, were awarded in October, though Mr. Bruno said those were largely negotiated before he joined the firm.Mr. Bruno has already registered as a lobbyist in New York. And though state law prohibits him from lobbying his former Senate colleagues for the next two years, he is free to lobby members of the executive branch. He remains close friends with Gov. David A. Paterson, a relationship that, combined with his stature as a former majority leader, could potentially pay enormous dividends for CMA.The governor attended a barbecue at Mr. Bruno’s home over the Fourth of July holiday and speaks roughly every other week with the former senator, according to both men.“David Paterson has been absolutely terrific to me,” Mr. Bruno said.Well after leaving office, Mr. Bruno remained active in negotiations to provide Advanced Micro Devices, a computer-chip manufacturer, with more than $1 billion in state aid to build a factory in Saratoga County, a project Mr. Bruno regards as part of his legacy.“Most of his ideas are about bringing business to New York and bringing jobs to New York,” Mr. Paterson said. “He’s arranged for me to meet some people who he thinks can be helpful.”Mr. Paterson said that the former senator had not asked him for any favors. But the two ignored suggestions from ethics groups last summer that they seek special guidance from the state’s public integrity commission on how to manage Mr. Bruno’s interactions with executive branch officials, given the governor’s closeness to Mr. Bruno.“Bruno wasn’t some rank-and-file legislator,” said Blair Horner, the legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group. “The bottom-line corporate reason is, they’re hoping that he will fatten the bottom line, that his personal relationships will help them to keep and expand the amount of government contract work.”Indeed, some do not buy Mr. Bruno’s new enthusiasm for transparent government or his claims that it is consistent with policies he advocated as senator.Mr. Bruno, for example, was the first Senate leader to require the release of every internal expenditure made by the Senate.But those reports are published only every six months, in a book format that makes it extremely difficult to examine the spending in any systematic way. (Asked about it, Mr. Bruno joked, “You noticed that, huh?”)Similarly, as majority leader, Mr. Bruno signed off on state budgets laden with what fiscal watchdogs call gimmicks, including the extensive use of private contractors that created the appearance of a shrinking state work force without the reality of shrinking spending.Mr. Bruno acknowledged that some skepticism about his reinvention was probably inevitable, but added: “I hope when we get together in a year, I will be able to say I was responsible for a lot of good things.”'"
"'08-12-02,'1','Reid Weingarten, a lawyer for Mr. Holder, said that Mr. Holder had done nothing improper in his handling of the Rich matter and that conversations about it were routine and largely insignificant, in part because he assumed that Mr. Rich’s lawyer, Jack Quinn, was going through normal pardon channels.“Mr. Holder assumed that this was all being handled in the normal course,” Mr. Weingarten said, adding, “There’s no question that Quinn played him and it was astute by Quinn because he did catch Eric unawares.”By all accounts, Mr. Holder’s role in the affair represents the biggest misstep of his career, and Mr. Obama’s aides focused on the issue before Mr. Holder was selected. Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee were consulted to gauge whether the pardon would prove an insurmountable hurdle.Some Republicans in Congress are eager to revisit the Rich pardon, which was investigated at length in 2001 both by Congress and by a grand jury amid a public clamor that was fueled by hefty donations that Mr. Rich’s former wife had made to Mr. Clinton’s presidential library and to Democratic causes. Critics of the pardon also seized on reports from American intelligence officials that Mr. Rich’s oil-and-commodities company had done business with Iran, Iraq and other so-called rogue states.“Marc Rich was a fugitive for nearly two decades, wanted by the federal government for fraud and tax evasion,” Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said Monday after the nomination was announced. Referring to Mr. Holder’s actions, Mr. Smith added, “If a Republican official had engaged in this kind of activity, he would never receive Senate confirmation.”Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview on Monday that Mr. Holder’s role in the Rich pardon would be “a big question” at his Senate confirmation hearing.A longtime prosecutor and a former judge, Mr. Holder remains a popular figure at the Justice Department eight years after he left, and his supporters insist he was made the “fall guy” for a controversy mainly of Mr. Clinton’s making.Both Republican and Democratic admirers say Mr. Holder’s handling of the Rich affair, which he has acknowledged was flawed, should be balanced against the bulk of his law enforcement career.“There’s no way you can have a high-profile job in Washington like the deputy attorney general without attracting some kind of controversy,” Larry Thompson, who succeeded Mr. Holder in that post in the Bush administration, said before Monday’s announcement. “That matter has been fully investigated, and it should be put behind him.”Janet Reno, the former attorney general who was Mr. Holder’s boss, attributes the episode in part to the fast pace of pardon requests at the end of the Clinton administration. “There wasn’t much time to vet anybody,” Ms. Reno said in an interview.But for Mr. Holder, his role in the Rich issue actually began more than two years before the end of the Clinton administration, almost by happenstance. At a corporate dinner in November 1998, Mr. Holder was seated at a table with a public-relations executive named Gershon Kekst, who had been trying to help Mr. Rich resolve his legal troubles.When Mr. Kekst learned that his dinner companion was the deputy attorney general, he proceeded to bring up the case of an unnamed acquaintance who had been “improperly indicted by an overzealous prosecutor,” according to the Congressional inquiry.A person in that situation, Mr. Holder advised, should “hire a lawyer who knows the process, he comes to me, we work it out.” Mr. Kekst wanted to know if Mr. Holder could suggest a lawyer. Mr. Holder pointed to a former White House counsel sitting nearby. “There’s Jack Quinn,” he said. “He’s a perfect example.”Months later, Mr. Rich’s advisers settled on Mr. Quinn to lead the legal efforts, which stemmed from Mr. Rich’s indictment in 1983 on charges that he evaded taxes on tens of millions of dollars in revenue. At the time, it was the biggest tax fraud case in American history. He fled to Switzerland while the investigation against him was pending.Mr. Quinn and his legal team sought to make the case that Mr. Rich and his partner, Pincus Green, had been wrongly prosecuted by the office of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was the United States attorney in Manhattan at the time of the indictment, and that the charges against them should best have been treated as a civil matter, not a criminal one.One of the first people Mr. Quinn contacted was Mr. Holder, his former colleague. Mr. Quinn wanted his help in interceding with prosecutors in Manhattan, and the two men had several conversations about the topic beginning in October 1999.Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York were unwilling to negotiate with Mr. Rich’s lawyers while he remained a fugitive. Mr. Holder told Mr. Quinn in one phone call in November 1999 that he believed the prosecutors’ refusal to meet with the Rich lawyer was “ridiculous,” according to notes by Mr. Quinn obtained by House government reform committee investigators as part of a three-volume report on Mr. Clinton’s pardons.In February 2000, Mr. Quinn sent Mr. Holder a memorandum entitled “Why D.O.J. Should Review the Marc Rich Indictment.” About a month later, Mr. Holder spoke with Mr. Quinn again and told him that “we’re all sympathetic” and that the legal “equities” in the issue were “on your side.” Pressed to explain the remark when he appeared before Congress a year later, Mr. Holder said that he meant only that he thought it was “unreasonable” for prosecutors in Manhattan not to meet with Mr. Rich’s lawyers and that he was not intending to assess the merits of the case.By the fall of 2000, efforts to re-open the criminal case were dead, and Mr. Rich’s lawyers had moved on to the idea of a pardon.Again, Mr. Quinn turned to Mr. Holder. On Nov. 21, 2000, at the close of a meeting on a separate topic, Mr. Quinn took Mr. Holder aside, told him he was planning on filing a lengthy pardon petition with the White House and asked whether the White House should contact Mr. Holder for his opinion, according to Mr. Quinn’s account. (Mr. Holder said he did not remember the conversation but did not dispute the account.)In a separate e-mail message that Mr. Quinn sent three days before that to other members of the Rich team, under the topic “Eric,” he wrote: “Spoke to him last evening. Says to go straight to W.H. Also says timing is good.”For the next months, Mr. Rich’s team pressed ahead with the pardon, soliciting foreign leaders from Spain, Israel and elsewhere to speak to the White House about Mr. Rich’s philanthropic work.Still, many White House officials remained opposed to the idea because of the precedent it would set to pardon a fugitive. Prosecutors in New York would “howl,” Mr. Holder told Mr. Quinn.On Jan. 19, 2001, Mr. Quinn called Mr. Holder and let him know that the White House would be contacting him for his recommendation on the pardon, which he said was receiving “serious consideration.” Mr. Holder told him that he did not have a personal problem with the pardon, and Mr. Quinn quickly passed on the gist of the conversation to the White House.Minutes later, Mr. Holder received a call from Beth Nolan, the White House counsel, who had opposed the pardon idea and was surprised to hear that Mr. Holder apparently felt differently.Mr. Holder, according to Ms. Nolan’s testimony, told her that if the Israelis were in fact pushing for the pardon, he would find that “persuasive” and would be “neutral leaning toward” favorable.Mr. Holder told Congressional investigators that he assumed the pardon was going to be rejected and that his comments were not intended to push it through. “I was ‘neutral’ because I didn’t have a basis to make a determination,” he testified.But investigators for the House government reform committee, in a final report in 2002, concluded that Mr. Holder’s input on Jan. 19, 2001, had a “significant impact” in giving the Justice Department’s imprimatur, even though no formal review was conducted by the department’s pardon office. The next day, Mr. Clinton signed the pardon, setting off the final controversy of his terms. The office normally reviews all clemency applications.After Mr. Clinton left office, a federal grand jury investigation was eventually closed with a finding that no criminal wrongdoing had occurred.'"
"'08-12-02,'1','But the Big Three now sell fewer than half of all new vehicles in this country, with a market share of about 47 percent this year, compared to 62 percent just five years ago.Supporting all those models and brands with separate marketing budgets, design teams, dealers and management divisions represents an enormous expense, particularly for G.M.The proliferation of models is one big reason the American companies are losing so much money as vehicle sales slump to their lowest point in 15 years.As part of their plans to get $25 billion in federal aid, the Detroit companies will be making many promises, including symbolic ones.For example, Ford’s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, will offer to take a pay cut from his last year’s compensation of $21 million, according to people with knowledge of the company’s plans. Mr. Mulally is also traveling to Washington in a Ford Escape Hybrid (two weeks ago, the American automakers’ chief executives traveled by corporate jet, inviting barbs from lawmakers.)G.M. and Chrysler declined to disclose the travel plans of their leaders this time.But the Big Three also need substantive changes to drastically cut costs, industry analysts said, including trimming their glut of products and sprawling distribution networks to go with their shrinking market shares.“Downsizing brands and models is the minimum they have to do,” said John Casesa, a principal in the auto consulting firm the Casesa Shapiro Group. “This can’t just be about resizing the companies, but also restructuring them.”Ford took a step on Monday toward reducing its brand lineup by announcing it was considering the sale of Volvo, its Swedish luxury brand. Volvo sales have fallen 28 percent so far this year.“Given the unprecedented external challenges facing Ford and the entire industry, it is prudent for Ford to evaluate options for Volvo,” Mr. Mulally said.G.M. is already trying to sell its Hummer brand. In its report to Congress on Tuesday, the company may settle widespread speculation that it is considering selling or eliminating the Saab, Saturn and Pontiac brands as well.People familiar with G.M.’s deliberations said that the company had considered earlier this fall a plan to put the Saab and Saturn brands up for sale. But those plans were dropped because of the lack of potential buyers. With a market share so far this year of about 22 percent in the United States, G.M. is struggling with the costs of filling showrooms with eight separate brand lineups.“Cutting Saab and Hummer are no-brainers because each of them has 0.2 percent of market share, so they’re irrelevant,” said Jerome P. York, who was a member of G.M.’s board during 2006. “Beyond that, Pontiac looks very suspect to me.” But shutting down a brand is a complicated and costly effort that requires buying out dealers protected by state franchise laws, as well as scaling back production of vehicles. In 2000, G.M. decided to eliminate its Oldsmobile brand after its sales fell from 1.1 million vehicles a year in 1985 to about 265,000 a year. But the process took nearly four years and cost G.M. more than $1 billion. Rick Wagoner, the automaker’s chairman, has repeatedly cited the problems of closing Oldsmobile as a prime reason to avoid eliminating more brands.G.M., however, is spending down its cash hoard by $2 billion a month, and the company has acknowledged that it is teetering dangerously close to bankruptcy. In asking for up to $12 billion in federal loans, Mr. Wagoner told lawmakers last month that the company could run out of cash by the end of the year without government assistance.Shrinking dealer networks may be another important component of the business plans that G.M., Ford and Chrysler will present Tuesday in an effort to convince Congress that they have viable, long-term strategies.G.M., for example, has about 6,700 dealers in the United States, compared to 1,200 for Toyota (the disparity is even greater when franchises are counted — G.M. dealers operate 14,000 franchises for its many brands, compared to 1,600 franchises for Toyota).Separately, union leaders will meet on Wednesday in an emergency session in Detroit to possibly discuss renegotiating terms of the latest contract, Bloomberg News reported.The automakers are also bracing for news on Tuesday of yet another dismal month in the marketplace. Sales of new vehicles are expected to fall 27 percent for November from the same period last year, according to the auto research Web site Edmunds.com.The forecasts by Edmunds.com suggest that Chrysler’s sales were down 41 percent in November, Ford’s 33 percent, and G.M.’s 28 percent.Analysts said that dealers were still being hurt by a lack of available credit for consumers shopping for new vehicles.“Until credit actually loosens up, we’re going to see a suppressed situation that is not sustainable in the long term,” said Tom Libby, senior director of industry analysis for J. D. Power & Associates.'"
"'08-12-02,'1','Treasury Department officials have never described their actions as the sole remedy. A spokesman noted that Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recently testified that stabilizing the financial system was a necessary first step in any plan to address the financial and economic crisis.“Our objectives in asking Congress for a financial rescue package were to first stabilize a financial system on the verge of collapse, and then to get lending going again to support the American people and businesses,” Mr. Paulson said at one recent hearing. “If the financial system were to collapse, it would significantly worsen and prolong the economic downturn.”A Harvard law school professor and a consumer bankruptcy expert, Ms. Warren was named by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to the new five-member panel, created as part of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, enacted in October. She was elected chairwoman at the group’s first meeting last Wednesday.In that role, she will have a strong voice in shaping the mission of the panel and the content of the regular reports it will deliver to Congress as long as the TARP exists.The panel’s power, as sketched out in the law, extends a bit beyond the “bully pulpit” but falls far short of a veto over specific proposals or programs. Its main source of influence is that it will have the ear of lawmakers who can tighten the bailout purse-strings or rewrite its charter.“Good ideas produce their own power,” Ms. Warren said. “If we have good ideas, it will be a powerful series of reports. If we don’t, it won’t.”Like much of the public, lawmakers “have just been stunned by these economic and financial developments,” she said. “There wasn’t time even to develop a coherent list of questions to ask Treasury about what it’s doing and what it plans to do — and whether either of those are likely to address what’s going wrong.”She added: “Our role is to make sure that the right questions are asked as early as possible.”In that spirit, she promised that Congress would get the panel’s first report on Dec. 10, “laying out the central questions that Treasury should be addressing as it spends the taxpayers’ money.”Meetings with Treasury officials so far have made her question whether they understand that “household financial health is profoundly tied to the economic health of the nation,” she said. “You cannot repair this economy if you can’t repair those families, and I’m not sure the people directing the bailout see that as their job.”In her view, the government should be trying to create more reliable customers for those banks by shoring up the fragile finances of the millions of American families that could not save, borrow or spend even if their banks were flush with capital.“Any effective policy has to start with the households,” she said. “Years of flat wages, low savings and high debt have left America’s households extremely vulnerable.”Ms. Warren, on the law faculty at Harvard since 1995, has written extensively and testified frequently before Congress on consumer credit laws and personal bankruptcy reform. She has been a member of several government advisory panels addressing consumer finance issues, and is the co-author of “The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers & Fathers Are Going Broke” (Basic Books, 2003).Ms. Warren will also be responsible for getting the panel up and running quickly and steering it around the two other monitors put in place by the legislation, the Government Accountability Office, whose first report on the bailout is due Tuesday, and a special inspector general who is not yet on the job. (Neil M. Barofsky, a veteran federal prosecutor in Manhattan, has been nominated by the White House but is still awaiting Senate confirmation.)The specific bailout investments, transactions and employment decisions need to be monitored closely to make sure they are appropriate and ethical, she said. “But we need to draw a distinction between policy oversight and procedural oversight,” she added. “I see our role as lying more in the policy realm, so I don’t think we duplicate those efforts.”The panel is also required by law to provide Congress with recommendations for reforms to the financial regulatory structure, a report that she said it would deliver by Jan. 20.Despite Ms. Warren’s ambitious timetable, the new Congressional panel is having a bumpy start.Created with the law’s passage on Oct. 3, it existed only in theory until Nov. 14, when its first three members were appointed by the Democratic leadership in Congress. Besides Ms. Warren, they are Damon Silvers, an associate general counsel of the AFL-CIO and the panel’s new deputy chairman, and Richard H. Neiman, the state superintendent of banks for New York.On Nov. 19, the Republican leaders in the House and Senate selected Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire to fill out the panel.But on Monday, Senator Gregg, who is also the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, announced that he “will need to step aside from this effort.” He cited the legislative burden facing the Senate, specifically “an extremely large stimulus package” and “the ongoing issues of developing fiscal policy relative to the budget.”Aides to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said his office expected to announce a successor soon.Ms. Warren said she regretted his absence but still expected the panel to meet its deadlines.'"
"'08-12-02,'1','WASHINGTON — As governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano, President-elect Barack Obama’s choice for homeland security secretary, pledged that her state would not cooperate with a major domestic security initiative, the Real ID drivers’ license program.The program, which she would direct if confirmed as secretary, imposes stringent requirements on states for confirming the identity and legal residency of people who want drivers’ licenses. Ms. Napolitano said the law would impose huge costs on the states without reimbursement from Washington.In June, she signed into law a bill that forbids Arizona from cooperating with the federal requirements. The state law had no immediate effect, because Arizona already had a federal waiver allowing it to delay enactment until 2009.Last year, as the chairwoman of the National Governors Association, Ms. Napolitano testified before a Senate committee that the program would cost the states $11 billion. Since then, Congress has appropriated $100 million to meet some of the costs.Real ID follows the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission; it was passed without hearings or debate, attached to a mostly unrelated bill.Janice L. Kephart, a staff member for the 9/11 Commission, said, “I’m hoping she will see this program from the federal government side and see it with new eyes.”'"
"'08-12-02,'1','“It’s one of the intimidation techniques of the political class,” said Franco Abruzzo, a journalism professor and a former editor of the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore.And something of a bipartisan sport as well. In 1999, Massimo d’Alema, a former Communist who was then a center-left prime minister, sued a political cartoonist for a drawing that showed him whiting out names in the Mitrokhin Report on Western cooperation with the Soviets during the cold war.Yet, when the plaintiff is Mr. Berlusconi, the situation inevitably takes on other dimensions.“What makes it different is that he’s the most powerful politician and richest man,” said Mr. Lane, the Rome correspondent of The Economist and a target of Mr. Berlusconi’s lawsuits. “He controls the media. He’s working from a position of maximum strength.”Indeed, some see such lawsuits as part of a more troubling pattern in which Mr. Berlusconi tries to intimidate the press — even as he claims that the same news media organizations he largely controls are out to get him.In 2002, Mr. Berlusconi criticized three left-wing critics — the comedian Daniele Luttazzi, the talk-show host Michele Santoro and the journalist Enzo Biagi — from RAI, which soon canceled their programs. (Mr. Luttazzi and Mr. Santoro eventually returned to television, and Mr. Biagi died last year.)Today, Italy’s answer to Tina Fey, Sabina Guzzanti, famous for imitating members of the government, and Beppe Grillo, a Michael Moore-style provocateur, are given little airtime on television, albeit for complicated reasons, in spite of their large populist followings. Yet a leading send-up show, “Striscia la Notizia,” routinely mocks those in power and is shown on Mr. Berlusconi’s Mediaset network. In the case to be heard Tuesday in Milan, Fedele Confalonieri, the chairman of Mediaset, is suing over several passages in Mr. Stille’s 2006 book on the rise of Mr. Berlusconi, “The Sack of Rome.”Mr. Confalonieri objected to Mr. Stille’s having reported that he was investigated in 1993 for illegal financing of the Socialist Party, without also noting that he was later cleared of those charges.He found fault with Mr. Stille’s assertion that Mr. Berlusconi “has fused his business and private life almost totally,” as evidenced by his appointing Mr. Confalonieri, “his oldest childhood friend,” to run Mediaset.And he objected to Mr. Stille’s quoting someone who said that many of Mr. Berlusconi’s close associates based their friendships “on blackmail” because they were the ones who knew where “all the skeletons in the closet are hidden.”Although the assertions were not new and had been reported in the Italian press, Mr. Confalonieri maintained in his suit that they “directly damage the honorability and the reputation” of the parties in question. Mr. Confalonieri and Mediaset are seeking undisclosed damages.A lawyer for Mr. Confalonieri, Vittorio Virga, said other journalists had avoided lawsuits by publishing retractions saying they now considered Mr. Confalonieri “a gentleman.”“We shook hands and ‘arrivederci,’ ” Mr. Virga said. But Mr. Stille, he added, “didn’t show any initiative toward making peace.”For his part, Mr. Stille, a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and the author of several well-regarded books on Italy, said that being sued for printing facts was “a Kafkaesque experience.”“If they had been sincerely interested in setting the record straight and establishing the truth, they had many simpler ways,” Mr. Stille said.Mr. Berlusconi’s lawyer, Nicolò Ghedini, said Italian newspapers rarely punished erring journalists so public figures had to defend their names in court. He added, “How come a journalist should have the right to defame?”Under Italian law, even printing that someone has been investigated can be tantamount to defamation. Yet defamation suits are difficult to win, and public officials are usually on the short end.But Mr. Stille and others contend that the point is not to win a judgment as much as to intimidate journalists and news outlets with the prospect of a lengthy and expensive court proceeding if they write something unfavorable. “For each of these suits, you may affect the behavior of another 100 journalists,” Mr. Stille added.Such litigation seems to have an effect.Mr. Lane, of The Economist, said he was considering cutting all references to Mr. Berlusconi in the Italian — but not the British — edition of his forthcoming book on the Mafia. “I’m too tired of spending my own money,” he said. “There are no medals to be won by being sued by Berlusconi.”'"
"'08-12-02,'1','Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, records most of its profit from its core business, the microprocessors that serve as the brains of most computers. But the company’s side venture in flash memory — which is used to store songs on digital music players and photos on digital cameras — has been another story.Although Intel does not disclose financial details of the business, flash-based storage is an intensely competitive industry, with specialty companies like SanDisk and giant electronics makers like Samsung and Toshiba battling for market share amid eroding prices of the underlying high-speed memory. Some shareholders have been pushing Intel to exit that low-margin business, which it operates through a joint venture with Micron.But Intel is taking a different approach. On Tuesday, it will announce a deal with Hitachi to become the sole supplier of flash memory for Hitachi’s forthcoming line of high-end solid-state computer drives intended for computer servers and storage systems. Intel and Hitachi also plan to share research and development costs.Although solid state drives are expensive, they are faster, tougher and more energy-efficient than traditional drives with spinning disks. Intel and the other players are hoping the drives will become popular for data-center computers used by corporate customers — potentially a more profitable market than the consumer laptops where the solid state drives are mostly used now.“We believe this combination spreads out the risk and gives the venture the highest probability for success,” said Troy Winslow, a director of marketing at Intel.Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, formed in 2003 after Hitachi acquired I.B.M.’s storage business, is the third-largest seller of hard disk drives, trailing Seagate Technology and Western Digital. As such, it has deep ties to the server and storage makers, whose corporate customers have often been more willing to pay a premium for higher-performance technologies, like flash drives.'"
"'08-12-02,'1','Robert Barnett accuses the British government of rewriting Tibet’s history (“Did Britain Just Sell Tibet?,” Op-Ed, Nov. 25). We believe the accusation to be unfair.Many in the United States, in Britain and elsewhere agree with us that the human rights situation in Tibet is unacceptable. Prime Minister Gordon Brown will continue to make this plain to China’s leaders.Finding a sustainable solution for Tibet is about the future, not the past. The Dalai Lama says he wants autonomy for Tibet within China, not independence. We updated our position because we consider this the right way forward. That means we consider Tibet to be part of China. It does not mean we suspend our support for autonomy and human rights: quite plainly we do not.Our statement was clear on the need for progress at the recent Tibet talks in Beijing, which is why we issued it just before they began. Talks must now recommence urgently, based around the proposals already made by the Dalai Lama’s envoys. China should look at these proposals with an open mind.'"
"'08-12-02,'1','Meanwhile, the Brewers made sure they would receive draft-pick compensation if Sabathia signed elsewhere by offering him arbitration. The Brewers did the same with their other top free agent, pitcher Ben Sheets.The Blue Jays offered arbitration to starter A. J. Burnett, as the Rockies did to closer Brian Fuentes. Other teams that offered arbitration to top free-agents included, the Dodgers to Manny Ramírez and Derek Lowe; and the Angels to Mark Teixeira and Francisco Rodríguez.Teams had until midnight to make the offers to free agents. If a team offers arbitration to a player, he must decide by Sunday if he wants to accept it. But once it is offered, a player is guaranteed to sign for at least one year with the team. Teams can still negotiate with players if they do not offer arbitration.The Mets, not surprisingly, offered arbitration only to Oliver Pérez among their 11 free agents.They remain interested in re-signing Pérez, although not at the expected cost or length of the contract that his agent, Scott Boras, plans to pursue. If Pérez, who went 10-7 with a 4.22 earned run average last season, accepts arbitration, he stands to receive a significant raise from his $6.5 million salary last year.Pedro Martínez, Luis Ayala, Damion Easley and Moises Alou were among the players the Mets did not offer arbitration.The Yankees would like to re-sign Pettitte, who faded in the second half and went 14-14 with a 4.54 E.R.A. But the Yankees think Pettitte should take a pay cut; he does not agree. Pettitte has spoken with Joe Torre, the Dodgers’ manager and his former manager with the Yankees. But Pettitte has also mentioned how meaningful it would be for him to pitch at the new Yankee Stadium.It was surprising that the Yankees did not offer arbitration to Abreu, who batted .296 with 20 home runs, 100 runs batted in and 100 runs scored. Although the Yankees do not want to sign Abreu, 34, to a multiyear deal, he would not seem to be much of a gamble on a one-year deal.Because the Yankees did not offer arbitration to any of their eligible players, they will not receive draft-pick compensation if those players sign elsewhere. Depending on whether a player is classified as a Type A or Type B free agent, a team receives one or two draft picks.Although Mussina retired after winning 20 games last season, the Yankees could have offered him arbitration to protect themselves in case he decided to return with another team.Nick Evans became the Mets’ second young outfielder to be shut down for the rest of the winter ball season. The team announced he had strained his right quadriceps while playing in Puerto Rico. Evans, who batted .257 in 109 at-bats last year, will return to home to Phoenix for therapy. The Mets expect him to be ready for spring training. Evans last played on Nov. 19. Daniel Murphy strained his right hamstring while playing in the Arizona Fall League three weeks ago.'"

The work was to have been completed this year, but the date was later pushed back to 2009. On Monday Natalya Uvarova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Culture Ministry, told Agence France-Presse that the latest delays could be “explained mainly by the ground quality, which made it necessary to reinforce the foundations further.” The culture minister, Aleksandr Avdeyev, told the newspaper Izvestia that the delays resulted from poor management.'"

"'08-12-02,'1','Unfortunately, the esophagus, unlike more accessible body parts like the breast and skin, is not very easy to monitor. In the traditional exam, called gastrointestinal endoscopy, the patient is heavily sedated, usually in a hospital, and a scope is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus.For patients with GERD who have already developed Barrett’s esophagus, annual endoscopy is recommended to check on the health of esophageal cells. If a biopsy indicates an impending or existing cancer, the usual treatment is a rather challenging operation in which all or part of the esophagus and the upper part of the stomach are removed and the remaining parts of the digestive tract are reattached.Another technique uses light therapy to destroy the inner lining of the esophagus, which can result in scarring and strictures that impede swallowing.After this treatment, patients must stay out of sunlight and direct artificial light for about six weeks to avoid a severe sunburn on exposed skin.But now there are simpler and safer alternatives for both detecting and treating an esophageal problem even before it becomes a serious precancer.A colleague who suffers from chronic reflux recently underwent the new detection method, called TransNasal Esophagoscopy, or T.N.E. It can be done safely and effectively in a doctor’s office, and it does not require sedation or involve loss of a day’s work. Nor does it leave the patient with a sore throat.“Surprisingly easy,” was how my colleague described it. “I had an exam that involved sending a tube, slim as a wire, with a camera, down through a nostril.”His doctor, Dr. Jonathan E. Aviv, medical director of the Voice and Swallowing Center at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, said he and other ear, nose and throat doctors around the country started using the technique in the mid-1990s.“Patients are examined awake, sitting upright in a chair,” Dr. Aviv said in an e-mail message. “An ultrathin flexible scope, the size of a shoelace, is placed via the patient’s numbed nose past the throat and then into the esophagus, thereby avoiding the powerful gag reflex which sits in the mouth.”Dr. Aviv described the technique as a triple bonus: one that avoids the risk of anesthesia and loss of work time for patients, increases the efficiency of medical practice for doctors and reduces the costs to insurers.Even newer than T.N.E. is a technique that can both diagnose and, using radiofrequency energy, treat abnormal cells.Joseph Broderick of Hudson, Fla., had suffered for years with periodic attacks of reflux, especially after eating spicy foods.“I had a bottle of Maalox at the ready to quiet it down,” Mr. Broderick, 77, said in an interview.At his doctor’s suggestion, he underwent a traditional endoscopy and esophageal biopsy, which revealed the presence of Barrett’s esophagus. He was prescribed medical, dietary and behavioral treatment to control reflux and told to return a year later for another test.But before the second test, he began having pain in his chest. This time, the endoscopy and biopsy found advanced dysplasia, a cellular abnormality that can progress to cancer without warning. A repeat exam three months later found no improvement, and an operation was recommended.First Mr. Broderick sought a second opinion from Dr. John E. Carroll, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. Given the treatment options, Mr. Broderick said the choice was a no-brainer: burn out the precancerous cells with radiofrequency energy before they become invasive cancer.The therapy uses a device, produced by BARRX Medical of Sunnyvale, Calif., that fits on the tip of a gastroscope, with a balloon that expands to fill the esophagus. The device, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is coupled to a generator that emits radiofrequency energy deep enough to burn off the inner lining of the esophagus. Normal esophageal cells then form to replace the destroyed cells.In a report published this year in the journal Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, cellular abnormalities were eliminated in 98 percent of 70 patients with Barrett’s esophagus who were treated at eight medical centers around the country. The improvement lasted the duration of the study, up to two and a half years.In a second study by the same multicenter group, 142 patients with advanced dysplasia were treated. The precancerous condition was eliminated in 90 percent, and the Barrett’s cells were destroyed in 54 percent of the patients at one year.The question now is whom to treat with this technique, since most people with Barrett’s esophagus never get the cancer.“The trouble is, there’s no predicting which patients will progress to cancer, and when they do, it’s a major cancer that spreads quickly,” Dr. Carroll said. “So I believe this will become a treatment option for most patients with Barrett’s.”'"
"'08-12-02,'1','There has been some evidence that vitamin B and folic acid can lower the risk for cancer, but a large randomized trial of the supplements suggests that they do not have that effect in women.The seven-year study, published Nov. 5 in The Journal of the American Medical Association, assigned 2,721 women older than 40 to receive a daily combination of folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, and compared them with a matched group of 2,721 who took a placebo. The vitamin doses were more than six times the recommended daily allowances.In the placebo group, 192 women developed invasive cancer, compared with 187 in the vitamin group, a statistically insignificant difference. There were no differences in rates of breast or colorectal cancer, and no difference in rates of death from cancer or any other cause. It is well known that vitamin B requirements increase with age, and the researchers did find a possible benefit among women over 65.“This doesn’t preclude an important benefit from diets that are high in B vitamins and folates,” said Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, the senior author, “and folate intake throughout pregnancy is very important.”Dr. Manson, who is chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said that the study found no evidence of increased risk from the supplements, and that taking an ordinary multivitamin is safe.'"
"'08-12-02,'1','The Bank of New York — America’s first financial firm — was founded in a rich man’s house on Pearl Street in 1784. While it is no surprise that the august institution has a long history of business in the country, it is less well known that it has also made a business of the country’s history — writing, for example, the first loan to the federal government (for $20,000) that helped retire debts from the Revolutionary War.The original copy of that note hangs today in a small alcove just outside the office of Robert P. Kelly, the chairman and chief executive of the bank, who, much like those before him, is elaborately entangled in the nation’s financial fate. Just six weeks ago, in fact, the Treasury Department named his bank — now called the Bank of New York Mellon — the master custodian of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (known in the vernacular as the Massive Wall Street Bailout). Given Mr. Kelly’s centrality to the economy, one wonders what is — literally — on his desk.Beyond a clock, a cloisonné pen jar and a surprisingly empty outbox, there are hastily scribbled notes on a monogrammed pad from a meeting with a certain “Tim G.” (Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Barack Obama’s pick to run the Treasury?). The notes make reference to “ad com updates” and “FVA’s,” and contain the jotted notion that the current situation may not be a “pushback issue” after all.“I can’t tell you how many people have come to me recently and said, ‘I hope you’re keeping notes,’ ” Mr. Kelly, a self-described history buff, confessed. “But it’s not like this is stuff that you forget. I always have a sense of gravitas and of history in the making.”History, like a powerful smell, is everywhere in Mr. Kelly’s office: in its address (1 Wall Street); in its artwork (antique paintings); in its century-old grandfather clock, which stands there like a footman at the wall. But the office’s most historic piece is the view from out the window: It is of Alexander Hamilton’s grave — resting place of the bank’s founder — 10 stories down in the Trinity Church cemetery directly across the street.'"
"'08-12-02,'1','Facing a combination of high feed prices, a glut of product on the market and a swelling debt load, one of the nation’s largest poultry producers filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday.The company, Pilgrim’s Pride, which started as a feedstore partnership in 1946, said that it had sought Chapter 11 protection in the Federal District Court in North Texas as it tries to negotiate with its creditors.The filing was not unexpected. Pilgrim’s Pride had already sought to extend deadlines from its lenders, including CoBank and the Bank of Montreal.“After careful consideration of all available alternatives, the company’s board of directors determined that a Chapter 11 filing was a necessary and prudent step and the best way to obtain the financing necessary to maintain regular operations and allow for a successful restructuring,” the chief executive, Clint Rivers, said in a statement.With the filing, Pilgrim’s Pride joined a growing list of companies that have been buffeted by the storm of economic conditions. The chicken producer said, however, that its setbacks were temporary and that its outlook and that of its industry would improve in 2009.'"
"'08-12-02,'1','Part of the drop may have reflected profit-taking after last week’s surge in stock prices, but it also came in response to new data showing that manufacturing activity dropped to its lowest point in 26 years.Both the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, and the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., vowed to use all the tools at their disposal to restore a measure of normalcy to the economy.Mr. Bernanke, speaking to business leaders in Austin, Tex., said it was “certainly feasible” to reduce the Fed’s benchmark overnight lending rate below its current target of 1 percent, signaling that the central bank would lower the rate at its next policy meeting in two weeks.And in an unusually explicit follow-up, Mr. Bernanke said the central bank was also prepared to use the “second arrow in our quiver” if policy makers have already reduced that rate, called the federal funds rate, to nearly zero.Among the options, he said, the Fed can start aggressively buying up longer-term Treasury securities. That would have the effect of driving down longer-term interest rates. The Fed is already doing something of that sort, by buying up commercial debt from private companies as well as mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Investors reacted to Mr. Bernanke’s remarks by pouring money into longer-term Treasury bonds, which briefly pushed already-low yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasuries to new record lows. Investors appeared to be reacting mainly to the clear signal from Mr. Bernanke that the Fed was preparing to pump money into the economy by buying up longer-term bonds.The yield on 30-year Treasuries declined 0.23 percentage points, to 3.21 percent, and briefly touched a record low of 3.18 percent. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell 0.19 percentage points, to 2.73 percent.In normal times, those kinds of yields would automatically mean lower interest rates on mortgages, automobile loans and other forms of consumer debt. But the credit markets have been stalled by continued fears among financial institutions about who can be trusted for even short-term transactions, so the effects on home loans and other purposes could remain modest.Mr. Paulson, in a speech in Washington on Monday, vowed to look at new ways to use the $700 billion bailout fund that Congress approved in October.In Congress, Democratic leaders are drawing up a huge new fiscal stimulus plan that could total more than $500 billion. Democrats said they planned to have the measure ready as soon as Congress convened with a strengthened Democratic majority in January. Meanwhile, Democrats could take up legislation next week that would provide financial assistance to the automobile industry.President Bush, increasingly the odd man out in the last weeks of his term, said his administration would do whatever was necessary to safeguard the system.“I’m sorry it’s happening, of course,” Mr. Bush said in an interview with ABC’s “World News” on Monday. “Obviously, I don’t like the idea of Americans losing their jobs or being worried about their 401(k)s. On the other hand, the American people got to know that we will safeguard the system.”But many analysts said they saw no signs yet that the economy was nearing a bottom. American consumers, who for decades have been the country’s tireless source of growth when all else failed, have cut back on their spending more sharply than at any time since the early 1980s.Consumer spending plunged in the third quarter of this year, and the evidence so far suggests they may pull back even more in the fourth quarter. Consumers account for about 71 percent of American economic activity, and their most recent retreat is occurring even though gasoline prices have dropped by almost half in the last month and left people with more money in their pockets.In officially declaring that the current recession began in December 2007, the National Bureau of Economic Research paid little heed to the fact that the nation’s gross domestic product actually expanded slightly in the first and second quarters of 2008.In explaining its decision, the bureau noted that a wide variety of other indicators, including payroll employment and personal income, peaked in December 2007. Payroll employment has dropped every month since then. Personal income declined and then zigzagged until June, and has declined steadily since then.The gross domestic product often fluctuates widely from quarter to quarter, but it also received a somewhat artificial boost from the tax rebate checks that the government mailed out last spring and early summer as a temporary stimulus.Ed McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said the bureau’s starting point of last December for the recession was close to Goldman’s own estimates.The announcement means that the downturn is already one year old. That is longer than the average length of 10.5 months for recessions since World War II. The current record for the longest recession over the last half-century is 16 months, which was reached in both the downturns of 1973-74 and 1980-81.Mr. Sinai of Decision Economics said it was hard to imagine that this downturn would have hit bottom within the next four months, which would make it all but certain to set a new record.Mr. Paulson, who teamed up with the Fed last week to begin a new $200 billion program to buy up consumer debt and small-business loans, said he had committed all but about $20 billion of the first $350 billion Congress authorized for the bailout fund.“We are actively engaged in developing additional programs to strengthen our financial system so that lending flows to our economy,” Mr. Paulson said in his speech. “We are continuing to examine potential foreclosure mitigation ideas that may be an appropriate” use of the funds.Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticized Mr. Paulson for refusing to use any of the money yet for reducing foreclosures. Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, warned last month that as many as 4.5 million people were likely to lose their homes through foreclosure. Ms. Bair proposed a plan that she said could prevent about one-third of those foreclosures.'"
"'08-12-02,'1','The pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson agreed on Monday to acquire the Mentor Corporation, the medical products supplier, for $1.07 billion in cash.The price was to $31 a share, according to a statement from both companies. Mentor shares closed Friday at $16.15; the tender price represents a 92 percent premium.According to the statement, Mentor, which is based in Santa Barbara, Calif., will operate as a stand-alone unit through the Ethicon division. It will help Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., strengthen its presence in aesthetic and reconstructive medicine.The boards of both companies have approved the transaction.“This transaction allows Mentor to expand our product portfolio and significantly grow our global reach,” the chief executive of Mentor, Josh Levine, said.The deal is expected to close in the first quarter and is expected to reduce Johnson & Johnson’s earnings by 3 to 5 cents a share.'"
"'08-12-02,'1','Anxiety is mounting that a quick recovery for the economy no longer seems probable. The nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research, charged with officially dating recessions, has declared that the economy had been languishing in one since December 2007.“To find out that we are 11 months into the recession with no end in sight, I think that concerns people,” Mr. Peta said. “It makes them say, gee, we’re right back into the territory of the 1980, 1981 twin recessions” — and past the more modest dips of the early 2000s and 1990s.The Institute for Supply Management recorded the worst reading on the health of the manufacturing industry since 1982. “However you look at the numbers, the message is the same: manufacturing is in free fall, with output collapsing,” Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics wrote in a note to clients. “We see no prospect for near-term improvement.”That view may be underscored on Friday, when the government is expected to report that employers shed more than 300,000 jobs in November, a fresh sign of the problems facing American workers and businesses.Worries about the economy were most pronounced in the debt market, where yields on 10- and 30-year Treasury securities fell near their record lows.Investors rushed to buy government notes, considered the most reliable investment, pushing the price on the 10-year note up 1 22/32, to 108 26/32, causing the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, to fall to 2.73 percent, from 2.92 percent late Friday. Earlier, the yield fell as low as 2.65 percent, the lowest level since the Federal Reserve’s records began in 1962.The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 3.24 percent after briefly hitting a record low of 3.18 percent.Some hedge fund and mutual fund managers, anticipating big redemption requests from clients, may also have seen last week’s rally as a good signal to sell assets at a decent price. With the new year looming, many funds and banks are looking to shore up their balance sheets so they can put their best fiscal face forward to investors awaiting year-end reports, leading some analysts to fret that markets may become more volatile as December wears on.“There are stories of hedge funds putting up gates and putting halts on redemptions,” said Todd Salamone, an analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “Fund managers are looking at last week’s rally as a good opportunity to raise cash to meet future redemptions.”The major indexes fell by hundreds of points just after the opening bell, led by huge declines in shares of financial firms. Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley shares all dropped more than 20 percent. Most other major Wall Street banks were also in double-digit percentage declines.Shares of retail companies also slumped on concern that retailers might see only modest gains as consumers remained prudent this holiday season. The daily decline of financial stocks in the S.& P. 500 was 17 percent — the worst decline for any sector in at least two decades.“Financials led the rally on the way up, and they’re leading on the way down,” said Anthony Conroy, head equity trader at BNY ConvergEx Group.Despite the sharp sell-off, it was also remarkable that on one of the worst single-day sessions in decades, there was little panic to be seen on Wall Street.“Investors have slowly become accustomed to it, after seeing it day after day for month after month,” Mr. Salamone said. “A year ago, a 9 percent move would have raised a lot more eyebrows than it does today.”Concern over a slowing economy, which may cut demand, pulled oil prices down $5.15 to settle at $49.28 barrel in New York trading.The declines on Wall Street came after stocks fell in Europe and most of Asia, regions that are also being stung by the economic downturn. Benchmark indexes in Paris and Frankfurt were down more than 5 percent, and London’s FTSE-100 dipped 5.2 percent. The Nikkei 225 index fell 4.6 percent on Tuesday morning.Following are the results of Monday’s Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:'"

"'08-12-03,'1','One of those songs was sung during the pivotal civil-rights March on Washington on Aug. 28, 1963. In a videotaped interview with The in 2007 for its online feature Odetta recalled the sentiments of another song she performed that day, “Oh Freedom,” which is rooted in slavery: “Oh freedom, Oh freedom, Oh freedom over me/ And before I’d be a slave, I’d be buried in my grave/ And go home to my Lord and be free.”Odetta Holmes was born in , Ala., on Dec. 31, 1930, in the depths of the . The music of that time and place — particularly prison songs and work songs recorded in the fields of the Deep South — shaped her life.“They were liberation songs,” she said in the interview with The Times. She added: “You’re walking down life’s road, society’s foot is on your throat, every which way you turn you can’t get from under that foot. And you reach a fork in the road and you can either lie down and die or insist upon your life.”Her father, Reuben Holmes, died when she was young, and in 1937 she and her mother, Flora Sanders, moved to . Three years later Odetta discovered that she could sing.“A teacher told my mother that I had a voice, that maybe I should study,” she recalled. “But I myself didn’t have anything to measure it by.”She found her own voice by listening to blues, jazz and folk music from the African-American and Anglo-American traditions. She earned a music degree from Los Angeles City College. Her training in classical music and musical theater was “a nice exercise, but it had nothing to do with my life,” she said.“The folk songs were — the anger,” she emphasized.In a interview in 2005 she said: “School taught me how to count and taught me how to put a sentence together. But as far as the human spirit goes, I learned through folk music.”In 1950 Odetta began singing professionally in a West Coast production of the musical but she found a stronger calling in the bohemian coffeehouses of . “We would finish our play, we’d go to the joint, and people would sit around playing guitars and singing songs and it felt like home,” she said.She moved to New York in 1953 and began singing in nightclubs like the storied Blue Angel, cutting a striking figure with her guitar and her close-cropped hair, her voice plunging deep and soaring high. Her songs blended the personal and the political, the theatrical and the spiritual. Her first solo album, “Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues,” released in 1956, resonated with an audience eager to hear old songs made new.Mr. Dylan, referring to that recording, said in a 1978 interview with , “The first thing that turned me on to folk singing was Odetta.” He said he heard something “vital and personal,” and added, “I learned all the songs on that record.” The songs included “Muleskinner Blues,” “Jack o’ Diamonds” and “ ’Buked and Scorned.”“What distinguished her from the start,” Time magazine wrote in 1960, “was the meticulous care with which she tried to recreate the feeling of her folk songs; to understand the emotions of a convict in a convict ditty, she once tried breaking up rocks with a sledgehammer.”That year she gave a celebrated solo concert at Carnegie Hall and released a live album of it. Eight years later she was on stage there again, now with Mr. Dylan, , , Ramblin’ Jack Elliott and other folk stars in a tribute to , which was also recorded for an album.Odetta’s blues and spirituals led directly to her work for the civil rights movement. They were two rivers running together, she said in her interview with The Times. The words and music captured “the fury and frustration that I had growing up.”Her fame hit a peak in 1963, when she marched with the Rev. Dr. and performed for President . But with King’s assassination in 1968, much of the wind went out of the sails of the civil rights movement, and the songs of protest and resistance that had been the movement’s soundtrack began to fade. Odetta’s fame flagged for years thereafter.In 1999 President awarded her the ’ National Medal of Arts. In 2003 she received a Living Legend tribute from the and a National Visionary Leadership award.Odetta married three times: to Don Gordon, to Gary Shead, and, in 1977, to the blues musician Iverson Minter, known professionally as Red. The first two marriages ended in divorce; Mr. Minter moved to in 1983. There are no immediate survivors, Mr. Yeager, Odetta’s manager, said.Odetta was singing and performing well into the 21st century — 60 concerts in the last two years, Mr. Yeager said — and her influence stayed strong.In April 2007, a half-century after Mr. Dylan first heard her, she returned to Carnegie Hall to perform in a tribute to . She turned one of his songs, “57 Channels,” into a chanted poem, and Mr. Springsteen came out from the wings to call it “the greatest version” of the song he had ever heard.Reviewing a December 2006 performance, James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote: “Odetta’s voice is still a force of nature — something commented upon endlessly as folks exited the auditorium — and her phrasing and sensibility for a song have grown more complex and shaded.”Mr. Reed called her “a majestic figure in American music, a direct gateway to bygone generations that feel so foreign today.”In her 2007 interview with The Times, Odetta spoke of the long-dead singers who first gave voice to the old blues and ballads and slavery songs she sang. “Those people who made up the songs were the ones who insisted upon life and living, who reaffirmed themselves,” she said. “They didn’t just fall down into the cracks or the holes. And that was an incredible example for me.”'"

The runs are named for the time of day the sun hits them.INSIDER’S TIP There’s nothing like race training to hone your ski technique; the Billy Kidd Performance Center , run by Mr. Kidd, the Olympic silver medalist, who lives in Steamboat, offers three-day clinics ($675) with small groups, intensive coaching and take-home video analysis. Book through the ski school. Mr. Kidd personally takes a run on most days of the ski season with anyone who shows up at the Billy Kidd Meeting Place at the top of the gondola at 1 p.m. He offers ski tips and anecdotes, and it’s free. Check the signs by the gondola to see if he’s skiing that day.FAMILY INFORMATION Ski lessons start at age 2½ with the Buckaroos program, a full day of child care that incorporates a one-hour private ski lesson ($265, includes ski equipment and lunch). Snowboard lessons are offered for children in first grade and up ($119). A child age 6 to 12 can ski free when a parent or a grandparent buys a lift ticket for five days or more; the same deal applies to a child’s equipment rental. Children younger than 6 ski free every day. Information: (800) 299-5017.Breakfast Winona’s (617 Lincoln Avenue,; 970-879-2483) is worth the trip into Steamboat Springs for hearty breakfasts like sourdough French toast with warm apples and lemon butter cream sauce ($8.95) and country fried steak with a homemade biscuit and gravy ($8.95). If the wait’s too long, get one of the huge, gooey cinnamon rolls to go ($3.50) — even then, you may not have room for lunch.On-Mountain Dining Snowy slopes and the warm Scandinavian vibe of Ragnar’s (970-871-5150), at Rendezvous Saddle on the ski area’s southern side, are a natural pairing. The Norwegian-influenced fare includes appetizers like smoked salmon lefse ($10.50), a quesadilla with layers of smoked salmon, Jarlsberg and scallions, or entrees like venison morsels sautéed with onions and wild mushrooms in a dark beer sauce and served with parsley mashed potatoes ($27). Reservations are recommended.Low-End, In-Town Dining At Cantina (818 Lincoln Avenue; 970-879-0826) the margaritas are made from fresh-squeezed lime juice, and the entrees range from standard fare like burritos (from $15.95) and tacos (from $12.95) to more eclectic dishes like the chimichanga Cozumel, a shrimp- and cheese-stuffed fried tortilla served with jalapeño pesto cream sauce ($15.95) or fajitas (starting at $12.95) flavored with a shot of tequila poured tableside ($3.75 to $4.50 extra).High-End, In-Town Dining At bistro c.v. (345 Lincoln Avenue; 970-879-4197; www.bistrocv.com), one of Steamboat’s newest and most innovative restaurants, the menu emphasizes fresh, local ingredients and changes regularly; favorites include the chicken-chorizo pot pie appetizer ($9) and a foie-gras-topped wagyu beef burger ($19). The carefully edited wine list concentrates on small-production wineries.Après-Ski As the name implies, joining Steamboat’s most popular après scene at the Slopeside Grill (1855 Ski Time Square; 970-879-2916; www.slopesidegrill.com) requires nothing more than clicking out of your ski bindings. Toast your day with a pint of Fat Tire ($4) or other Colorado draft brews. If you linger through dinner, there’s a huge menu to choose from, including 19 different kinds of pizza and calzones baked in the restaurant’s Italian brick oven ($9.95 to $12.95).Après Après-Ski At the ski resort, the venerable and often rowdy Tugboat Grill and Pub (1860 Ski Time Square, 970-879-7070) has been the ski bum’s watering hole of choice since 1972; this is the spot to trade stories of big winters past and listen to live music. It has escaped the wrecking ball — for now — that leveled the surrounding commercial plaza, which is being redeveloped. Go while you can. In town, the Mahogany Ridge Brewery and Grill (435 Lincoln Avenue, 970-879-3773) draws a lively crowd, especially weekend nights when local bands play. If you can’t narrow down the selection of house brews on tap, try the sampler of all eight ($8).Frugal The family-run Rabbit Ears Motel (201 Lincoln Avenue, Steamboat Springs,; 800-828-7702; www.rabbitearsmotel.com) in downtown Steamboat Springs has basic but bright rooms with refrigerators and microwaves; look for the vintage pink neon bunny sign, a local landmark.

"'08-12-03,'1','In the East Village, local cuisine is quickly whittling down to a single food: pig. With new pork-bun outlets and ramen shops, porchetta and hot dog specialists, plus bacon peanut brittle as a local bar snack (at The Redhead), the area is all bellied up. But the braised pork belly at Hea, a new Asian restaurant, moves the medium forward again. The chef, Meng Kong, braids together food threads from China, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand and his native Malaysia. Spice-and salt-cured one night, then simmered the next in soy, sugar and Japanese and Chinese cooking wines, the whole belly is finally sliced and seared in a wok with whole dried chilies and whole garlic cloves ($8).That dish alone is worth climbing up to this spacious, quiet dining room with a great urban view. But many others are head-scratchers. Why the lumps of stiffened chicken breast in the overtouted Hea broth, a listless chicken-coconut brew? Why is the table being piled with entrees and appetizers all at the same time? Why the ghastly “vegetable sushi” parade of pickled fungi and roots? What is so Malaysian about a bland slice of beefsteak, sprinkled with salt and pepper served with sauteéd bok choy? According to the manager, Ben Wu, the pan-Asian menu (and patrons) reflect a kind of Hong Kong-style mix: young, urban and hungry for the New.The menu promises much — this grilled in banana leaf, that glazed with tamarind and honey — yet is not quite tied to the reality that arrives on the table. Too many dishes use random American vegetables — broccoli, julienned red pepper — as feeble substitutes for the proper Asian ingredients.Not all surprises are unpleasant. The Berkshire ham hock for two (there is that pig again) was missing its garnish of crispy Fuji apple, but then again, the sweet perfume of the steamed buns for wrapping the meat was garnish enough ($50). Spicy pickled pineapple, a typical Malaysian salad-chutney, is hard to find in New York City; Mr. Kong makes it beautifully. Try it with kalasan (beggar’s) chicken, a traditional dry-roast method that reduces a whole Cornish hen to a burnished, twisted mass of salt and crisp ($16). Even the tempeh, an Indonesian soy cake with sweet chili sauce, has a nice crust and chewy texture ($5). And the one homemade dessert, a soy-almond pudding ($7), is actually the perfect soother for a confused, occasionally delighted palate.'"
"'08-12-03,'1','Government auditors urged the Treasury Department on Tuesday to act more quickly to develop the internal controls and hire the professional staff necessary to ensure that its $700 billion financial rescue package is operating effectively and ethically.The audit team from the Government Accountability Office also called on the department to communicate better in the future to Congress and the public about how the bailout program is changing and why those changes are necessary — “to avoid information gaps and surprises,” the auditors said in a report.The report is the first full review of the bailout program since Oct. 3, when it was authorized with the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Over that period, the Treasury has used more than $150 billion to make investments in dozens of financial institutions.Neel Kashkari, the assistant Treasury secretary serving as the interim chief of the bailout operation, did not dispute most of the report’s recommendations. In a letter attached to the audit, Mr. Kashkari noted that the report “makes helpful recommendation about the work that remains to be done.”But Mr. Kashkari said he and the department had “a different perspective” from what the auditors had about how to monitor the use banks are making of money received under the financial rescue program. He called for further discussions with the auditors over how best to do that.'"
"'08-12-03,'1','“With no foundation, no endowment, where would the sustaining money come from?” Michael Mondavi asked.Copia seemed to run into problems immediately, setting off speculation that it would not survive intact.“It was exquisite but stunning, the way they spent money,” said Karen MacNeil, director of wine education at the Culinary Institute of America’s large Greystone campus in nearby St. Helena. “You can’t charge $40 for a cabernet tasting and spend that much just on the class materials. Everything was so beautifully done, in the best possible taste. It didn’t seem sustainable.”As its mission has shifted under different leaders, Copia has contemplated merging with the American Institute of Wine and Food, starting a program of national food awards to compete with the James Beard awards (an idea later scrapped), and opening a satellite campus in San Francisco.The center never attracted anywhere near the number of visitors it expected for programs like salt and mustard tastings, interactive wine-knowledge tests, and chamber music concerts.One of the first art exhibitions, illustrating themes of gluttony and scarcity, included figurines of nuns and the pope squatting to defecate.Such programming fueled the local perception of Copia as too highbrow, “a place for food and wine snobs,” as Debbie Wheeler, a shopper at the nearby Oxbow Public Market, put it on Friday.In the Napa Valley, a magnet for food and wine lovers, competition is fierce for tourist and fund-raising dollars. The Napa Valley Opera House, the Napa Valley Museum, the Lincoln Theater and the community hospital fight for potential donations from wealthy residents. And Copia’s downtown location, off the tourist paths of Route 29 and the Silverado Trail, is a disadvantage.The fundamental question of what Copia is — a museum, a cooking school, a wine-industry promotion space — has remained unanswered.“Copia was supposed to be a food and wine center,” said Darrell Corti, owner of Corti Brothers Grocers in Sacramento. “Please define that for me. It can’t be a place where you go around giving parties for each other and expect to be successful.”Margrit Biever Mondavi, the widow of Robert Mondavi, who died in May, and stepmother to his three children, “is perceived in the valley as the one who pushed the arts piece of Copia,” said Julia Flynn Siler, author of “The House of Mondavi” (Gotham, 2007). “But really, the whole thing was Robert’s folly.”Ms. Mondavi said in an interview yesterday, “Maybe the legacy of Copia is in the idea of food, wine and the arts, not in the bricks and mortar.”Neither board members nor staff members would speak to the media, but in a statement on Monday evening, the group’s chief executive, Garry McGuire Jr., said, “We recently have taken intensive measures to overcome our deteriorating liquidity position.”Recently, Copia has tried to act more like a community center, showing classic movies, offering gingerbread-house-making workshops, and planning a hot-chocolate party at the end of the Napa Holiday Parade last Saturday. Santa Claus was supposed to appear at Copia, but the place remained shuttered.'"
"'08-12-03,'1','An added benefit of the road trip is that it will help draw attention to the fact that Detroit is making more fuel-efficient vehicles, Mr. Wilkinson said. “It’s as much to showcase product as it is to get to D.C.,” he added.Robert L. Nardelli, the chairman of Chrysler, is driving a hybrid to Washington, too, though the company declined to name the model.And Alan R. Mulally of Ford is sharing the wheel of a Ford Escape hybrid, said Mark Truby, a spokesman.Ford is stepping up its efforts, too, to combat what the business world often refers to as “optics” — or, as most people call it, things that look bad. Ford said in a news release that it would “sell its corporate aircraft as part of its overall cash improvement plan,” and that Mr. Mulally would work for a salary of $1 a year “as a sign of his confidence in the company’s transformation plan and future.”The company has also canceled all 2009 bonuses for management employees worldwide and bonuses for all employees in North America. Mr. Nardelli of Chrysler has also said he would reduce his compensation to a dollar a year, as would Mr. Wagoner.The prospect of the executives motoring along more than 500 miles of highway to Washington — a trip of about nine hours, not counting a possible stop in Pittsburgh for a sandwich at Primanti Brothers — introduces an element of ritualistic public relations gamesmanship.The long drive shows how “desperate” the executives are to address the image problem, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management and president of the school’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute. “On the other hand, it’s a shame it wasn’t of their own volition” two weeks earlier, when they might have avoided an ugly situation.Eric Dezenhall, president of a crisis management company, Dezenhall Resources, in Washington, said that public relations crises tend to build upon themselves, so the executives probably cannot win, no matter how they travel to Washington.“You don’t defuse outrage with cute little stunts,” he said.The Big Three executives seem reluctant to point out to Congress that private jets can make sense, given how valuable their time is (before they cut their annual pay to $1, of course).Mr. Dezenhall is not so shy on that point. “Most of my clients have corporate jets,” he said — as do, presumably, the other big companies receiving government bailouts and guarantees. And there is a reason for that. “If the C.E.O. of one of the world’s largest companies is dealing with a product recall in Europe and he’s futzing around at Dulles, waiting for his shoes to be scanned, it’s ridiculous,” Mr. Dezenhall said.Mr. Wilkinson of G.M. said that when an executive had to be in “three Asian countries in three days,” commercial air travel did not offer much efficiency or flexibility. In the future, such trips will be handled with chartered aircraft, he said, and the company will conduct more meetings through videoconferences and Internet-based information-sharing.Business experts raised the question of whether the long drive constituted the best use of the executives’ time, particularly as they crawl along Washington’s Capital Beltway at the end of a stultifying road trip.Mr. Wagoner’s $14.4 million in compensation in 2007 comes out, approximately, to an hourly wage of $7,000. Before Mr. Mulally’s voluntary pay cut, the $21 million he made for 2007 corresponds to an hourly wage of about $10,000. (Mr. Nardelli’s compensation is not disclosed, as Chrysler is now a private company).“I would have flown commercial, maybe coach,” Mr. Sonnenfeld said. If the point is to travel cheaply and do some sort of corporate penance, he joked, “Why don’t they ride bikes?”'"
"'08-12-03,'1','“It’s a big deal,” Orender said from Florida. “But it doesn’t mean it can’t come back. Sometimes to get your footing, you have to take your sneakers off and put them back on.”The Houston Oilers, an original American Football League franchise, left for Tennessee in 1997, but the N.F.L. expanded to Houston and the Texans began play in 2002.The Comets were a critical franchise in the W.N.B.A., with stars like Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes, and an instant success. Their average attendance started at 9,703 in 1997, peaked the next season at 12,602, fell off to 11,906 in 1999, then increased to 12,255 for the fourth title run. Only the Washington, New York and Phoenix teams outdrew the Comets in those years.By the time Koch acquired the Comets for $10 million from Les Alexander, the owner of the Houston Rockets, they were less successful on the court and were following a leaguewide decline in attendance. Koch’s purchase was part of a shift in W.N.B.A. philosophy: whereas all teams were once owned by N.B.A. parents, Koch became the fifth outsider to buy into the league out of an eventual seven.Koch said he bought the Comets without a lot of time to prepare; it eventually became clear that he lacked the money to sustain the team. He cut costs by moving from the Toyota Center to the much-smaller Reliant Arena for the 2008 season. But once the season was over, talks with the league ended with him giving it control of the team. “I couldn’t sell it quickly enough to keep the team from going under,” he said.He added that if the league had sold the team, he would not have recouped his investment or his operational losses.“I only wanted to risk myself so far,” he said. “My money was only going to last so long.”By turning the team over to the league, he said, “I was just looking at what the projections would be, and we both agreed that I couldn’t lose my furniture business, which is what put me in the position to do what I did.”Orender said the Comets’ situation was more of a singular situation than another sign of the recession’s impact on sports, which has led the N.B.A. to lay off 80 workers.The W.N.B.A.’s average attendance, national television ratings and merchandise sales rose in 2008, and five new major sponsors signed up. And the league will start next season with an ESPN deal that for the first time pays it an upfront rights fee.Still, Raymond Sauer, the chairman of the economics department at Clemson University, said the recession might have limited the number of possible suitors or tempered the risk they were willing to take.Orender said: “In another time, would there have been double the amount of interested investors? I don’t know.”For Cooper-Dyke, it remains stunning that the Comets did not survive.“I thought things would work out and the Comets would be alive and well,” she said. “It’s shocking.”'"

Whatever General McCaffrey or other unnamed individuals may believe, though, I am unaware of any decision to “cut off General McCaffrey’s access to the Pentagon’s special briefings,” as stated in the article.We held briefings for former senior officials who served presidents of both parties, think-tank specialists from across the political spectrum, and many others. Divergent views were often expressed, sometimes strenuously.Secretary Rumsfeld never suggested to me, the official responsible for the program, that we stop holding the meetings, or disinvite people — including General McCaffrey — because they didn’t agree with our policies.General McCaffrey actually enjoyed special access by virtue of his relationships with senior military officers, yet it seems he benefits from brandishing the bloody shirt of alleged maltreatment by Secretary Rumsfeld.The writer was special assistant to the secretary of defense from 2001-06.

"'08-12-03,'1','LOS ANGELES — Lawyers for the film director Roman Polanski, who fled the United States before his sentencing for statutory rape 30 years ago, asked a judge here to dismiss the case against him based on claims of judicial and prosecutorial wrongdoing revealed in a documentary film.The request was filed with Judge David S. Wesley in the Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday afternoon. It cited the film “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,” in which a former deputy district attorney described having coached the judge in the case, though he was not directly involved in the prosecution.The documentary examined Mr. Polanski’s arrest in 1977 for having sex with a 13-year-old girl and subsequent conviction after pleading guilty to one count of having sex with a minor. Mr. Polanski, who was 44 at the time of the events, spent 42 days in state prison during a psychiatric evaluation, but fled the country on the eve of sentencing in 1978 after learning that the judge, Laurence J. Rittenband, planned to return him to prison. Now 75 years old, Mr. Polanski has since lived in Paris.Tuesday’s filing said Judge Rittenband, who is now dead, intentionally violated a plea agreement with Mr. Polanski after having engaged in what it called “repeated unethical and unlawful ex parte communications” with a deputy district attorney who was not involved in the prosecution, but was independently advising the judge.They described on-camera interviews with the deputy, David Wells, by the documentary’s director, Marina Zenovich.In one encounter, Mr. Wells told Ms. Zenovich “I was privy to almost everything that went on in that case.” At one point the deputy said he counseled the judge on sentencing. At another, he described prodding Judge Rittenband with a photograph of Mr. Polanski, then on bail, in the company of two young girls at an Oktoberfest celebration. “Look here. He’s flipping you off,” Mr. Wells said.'"
"'08-12-03,'1','At the meeting Tuesday in Brussels, several other countries, including Finland, Germany and Sweden, joined France in complaining about restrictions that discouraged solvent banks from taking state aid that could be used to expand lending.After the talks, Christine Lagarde, the French economy minister, said Ms. Kroes had given ground. “Mrs. Kroes acknowledged that she had radically changed her approach,” Ms. Lagarde said, adding that she would distinguish between banks considered solvent before the financial crisis and those that were already under strain.Ms. Lagarde added that she was confident that the French recapitalization plan would proceed without concessions that had been sought by Ms. Kroes’s office — particularly over dividends to shareholders that banks benefiting from state aid might be allowed to offer.This is one area where the commission has questioned whether an unfair advantage might be gained by subsidized banks.A French official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak with the media, described the commission’s earlier approach as “excessive, disproportionate and ill adapted to the situation.”The European Commission insisted that, while the latest guidance it was preparing was new, the principles governing state aid remained the same.“There must be strong incentives for the money to be repaid to the state as soon as possible,” Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for Ms. Kroes, said.The commission argues that the situation has evolved since it issued its earlier guidance in October, when the priority was to save stricken banks.Since then the proposed use of subsidies to banks to try to restart lending and cushion the impact on the economy has posed different questions, Mr. Todd said.Nicolas Véron, a research fellow at Bruegel, an economic research institute, said that the commission was giving ground but that its room to maneuver was limited because state aid rules were laid down in the European Union’s governing treaty.“I think the commission is ready to be more open in its interpretation of the treaty,” Mr. Véron said, “but they are not ready to let go blatant violations of the treaty or of established jurisprudence. It is a very fine line to walk.”Earlier the commission was confronted with the scale of the discontent with blunt criticism from Germany, which is awaiting commission approval of its approval of an 8.2 billion euro effort to refinance Commerzbank, the second-largest German bank after Deutsche Bank.“We do not approve of the schedule, of the procedure and above all of the commission’s speed,” said the German finance minister, Peer Steinbrück.The Swedish finance minister, Anders Borg, appealed for the European Union “to call off these legions of state aid bureaucrats.” Later he added that there was “disappointment, frustration and even anger,” at the failure of the banking system to restore credit lines.At the meeting Tuesday, ministers also approved calls for countries to inject an average of 1.3 percent of their own gross domestic product into the economy. But they did not endorse a call by the European Commission to divert 5 billion euros in unspent money from the European Union budget to infrastructure projects.'"
"'08-12-03,'1','Last weekend, The Times of London reported that Mr. Miller was working on a deal with Microsoft to buy Yahoo’s search business. All parties denied that report.Jerry Yang, Yahoo’s co-founder and chief executive, announced last month that he would step aside once a new chief is found. Yahoo has told at least one major shareholder that it hoped to conclude its search and announce Mr. Yang’s replacement by the end of the year, but that is an ambitious goal.A Yahoo spokesman, Brad Williams, would not discuss the timing of the search for a chief executive, and said of the report on Mr. Miller’s efforts that the company would not comment on rumors.Though Yahoo shareholders and analysts say that a private buyout remains unlikely, they do find elements of that prospect appealing. Yahoo could easily sell off parts of itself, like its search business or its Japanese division, to immediately pay off debt.Mr. Miller, who remains a popular and well-known figure in Internet circles, could probably marshal the support of large Yahoo shareholders, many of whom are desperate for a change in management. Mr. Miller was the principal architect of AOL’s transformation from a dial-up Internet service provider to an online advertising company, which is generally considered to have been a success.In the ’90s, he was an executive at media outlets like USA Broadcasting, Nickelodeon and Paramount, which could give him the background to create a future for Yahoo in the rapidly changing media business.One potential hitch is that Mr. Miller has a noncompete agreement with his former employer, Time Warner, that extends through March. Mr. Miller was forced to withdraw his name from consideration for Yahoo’s board over the summer after Time Warner indicated it would enforce the measure.Sandeep Aggarwal, an Internet analyst at Collins Steward, said that even talk of Mr. Miller’s involvement was good for Yahoo and might motivate Microsoft to get off the sidelines.“Microsoft has had no reason to hurry up and make a move,” Mr. Aggarwal said. “If Microsoft sees another strategic alternative developing, that might pressure them to move faster. It creates option value for Yahoo, and options never hurt.”But Yahoo continues to face challenges that could discourage anyone courageous enough to think about taking over the business. Though it has one of the world’s most popular Web sites, it continues to lose market share in the profitable search business to Google, a relentless opponent. And the market for display advertisements, where Yahoo is strong, is suffering amid the general downturn in advertising.All these factors, said Mr. McNamee of Elevation Partners, are poison to any potential Yahoo deal makers. “Private equity investors hate uncertainty, and the business situation at Yahoo is uncertain enough that it is bound to scare off many deep pocketed investors,” he said.'"
"'08-12-03,'1','Michael Colacino, the president of Studley, a real estate brokerage firm that specializes in representing office tenants, said the sublet space that had come onto the market recently was attractively priced.He said some tenants might do better by shopping the sublet market rather than trying to renegotiate a better rent with their current landlords. “A lot of landlords are still in denial,” Mr. Colacino said, “but the sublease space is priced realistically for the actual market conditions.”Mr. Colacino estimates that the actual rents on deals signed in the last three months are down by as much as 20 to 30 percent from the going rents at the end of the summer — to around $75 to $80 a square foot annually in Midtown and around $45 a square foot downtown.Among current offerings — including both subleases and direct leases from owners — roughly a quarter of the space in the Midtown and downtown office markets became available because a financial company either did not renew its lease or decided to market the space for sublet.But the picture could become much starker next year. Among large office blocks that brokers expect to hit the market, Mr. Sammons estimates that the financial industry will account for roughly one-third of the new space coming on the market in Midtown and more than half of the new space downtown.Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank all have leases that Mr. Sammons counted among the potential new listings of large office blocks. And that list does not include Citigroup — although the banking giant has announced that it will lay off more than 50,000 employees worldwide — because Mr. Sammons said it was too soon to know if Citigroup would give up any large office blocks in Manhattan.So far this year, brokers say, the main event in Midtown has been the completion of One Bryant Park, a 54-story office tower that recently opened at the corner of 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas.As the main tenant, Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., moves employees into this new building, it is giving up earlier leases for hundreds of thousands of square feet in other prominent Midtown office buildings, like 9 West 57th Street. Brokers also widely expect the bank to offer for sublet more than 300,000 square feet that it currently leases in 50 Rockefeller Plaza.JPMorgan Chase has already put some large blocks of space on the sublet market near its world headquarters, at 270 Park Avenue, between 47th and 48th Streets. Chase is marketing sublets for 140,000 square feet at 320 Park Avenue, and 195,000 square feet at 237 Park Avenue. The bank acquired the lease at 237 Park Avenue when it bought Bear Stearns in March.Chase plans to keep the former Bear Stearns headquarters, though, which is at 383 Madison Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets. Chase plans to move its investment banking unit into that building, which is just one block from its own headquarters.“We are looking to make the most economical use of the space that we have for our employees, businesses and shareholders,” said Darlene Taylor, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase.Downtown, some large blocks of space are expected to become available late next year, when Goldman Sachs completes its new 2.1-million-square-foot 43-story world headquarters at 200 West Street in Battery Park City. When Goldman starts moving into its new building, it plans to allow earlier leases for more than 1.5 million square feet in Lower Manhattan to expire. The bank is also marketing for sublet 600,000 square feet of space that it leases at 77 Water Street.There is also a great deal of speculation swirling around the ultimate destination of Merrill Lynch, which is to be acquired by Bank of America. The merger could close this month or early next year.Some brokers suggest that Bank of America might decide to move Merrill Lynch from its headquarters at 4 World Financial Center, where Merrill leases 2.1 million square feet, to be closer to the bank’s new Bryant Park headquarters. If that happens, it would shift even more of the financial industry from Wall Street to Midtown, following what has been a long-term trend.'"

In 2002, one of the largest federally funded clinical trials concluded that diuretics were the safest and most cost-effective therapy for high blood pressure when compared to an ACE inhibitor, a calcium-channel blocker and an alpha blocker.The latest randomized, double-blinded study included 11,506 participants in the United States and four other countries. The subjects’ mean age was 68. Sixty percent had diabetes, and all were at risk for serious cardiovascular problems.Some 5,744 patients were assigned to take benazepril with amlodipine (the ACE inhibiter and a calcium-channel blocker combination), while 5,762 took benazepril with hydrochlorothiazide (an ACE inhibiter and a diuretic).Within six months, 73 percent of patients treated with either two-in-one pill were able to lower their blood pressure into a safe range, the researchers found. By the end of the three-year trial, 80 percent of participants had their blood pressure under control.Among patients taking the pill containing a diuretic, however, 11.8 percent suffered a serious cardiovascular event, compared to 9.6 percent of those taking the pill with the calcium-channel blocker, representing an absolute difference of 2.2 percent and a relative risk reduction of 19.6 percent with the calcium-channel blocker.The researchers judged the disparity sufficient to halt the trial early, so as to give subjects the option of continuing on the more effective therapy.An editorial accompanying the study called for a reexamination of current treatment guidelines for high blood pressure and their emphasis on thiazide-type diuretics as a first-line therapy. The guidelines should be more flexible, the editorial said.Dr. Aram Chobanian, a professor of medicine and pharmacology at Boston University School of Medicine and author of the editorial, said he had questions about whether the diuretic was used appropriately in this trial, adding that a single trial is “not enough to recommend that everyone be on a calcium-channel blocker and an ACE inhibitor.”He said several other clinical trials have reported positive results regarding the combined use of a diuretic and ACE inhibitor, “so we don’t want to damn that combination.”“The most important thing in treatment is to get blood pressure down, and how you do it becomes less important,” Dr. Chobanian added.An expert panel will review the evidence and update treatment guidelines, which are expected to be available for public review in early 2009, with a final version to be published in the spring of 2010, a spokeswoman for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute said.'"

Its next distribution will be made after it is able to raise an additional $5 billion in cash, it said.But if credit markets do not improve enough to allow it to sell its short-term notes at par, it cannot return the last of investors’ money until those securities mature, it said. That may take until as long mid-October of next year.More important, some of the cash the fund raises will be set aside in a contingency fund to cover the potential costs of the lawsuits that are pending against the fund, and any claims that are assessed against it as a result of that litigation.If none of that set-aside amount is needed, the fund said, shareholders should ultimately receive 98.5 cents on the dollar.The fund is faced with fierce opposition to its current distribution plan by shareholders who redeemed before the fund officially broke the buck by reporting a share value below $1.'"
"'08-12-04,'0','PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Raymond F. Lederer, a Pennsylvania Democrat who resigned his seat in Congress and was imprisoned for taking a bribe in the Abscam investigation conducted by the F.B.I., died Monday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 70.The cause was lung cancer, said his son, Miles.In all, six House members and one senator, Harrison A. Williams Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, were convicted in the case.Mr. Lederer, who was first elected to Congress in 1976, was videotaped on Sept. 11, 1979, at a New York motel accepting $50,000 in cash from two undercover agents posing as representatives of a fictitious Arab sheik. He told the agents, “I can give you me,” in return for the money, which was shared with several co-defendants.Mr. Lederer won re-election in 1980 while under indictment and was convicted in January 1981. He resigned his seat in April, the day after the House ethics committee voted to expel him.Mr. Lederer’s first elected office, in 1974, was a State House seat that had been held by his father and older brother and, more recently, by his sister-in-law.After serving 10 months in prison, Mr. Lederer worked as a roofer, helping to deliver supplies to job sites.'"
"'08-12-04,'0','Burress has disappointed teammates, angered the front office and exasperated the head coach. This time he has infuriated the mayor of New York City.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has led an initiative to ban illegal firearms, was adamant that Burress not receive preferential treatment. “Our children are getting killed with guns in the street,” he said Monday. “Our police are getting killed. I think it would be an outrage if we didn’t prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.”The mayor continued to speak out about the case when he chided the Giants’ president, John Mara, and N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell for not quickly cooperating with law enforcement. Bloomberg told them the law says, “you see something, you got to call the cops.”“That’s the thing you should do,” he said.While the mayor’s outrage was prejudicial and premature (where is the presumption of innocence?), Burress’s recklessness is indefensible.There will continue to be finger-pointing — beginning with Burress’s decision to enter a club with a loaded, concealed weapon, to club security who apparently allowed Burress to enter the club knowing he had the weapon, to Antonio Pierce’s failure to immediately call the police and to the hospital not reporting the shooting to the authorities.Reese conceded that the Giants might be culpable because they enabled Burress, who had been fined numerous times.A less talented player would have been sent packing a dozen fines ago. But Burress was the key to last season’s Super Bowl championship and could have been the bridge to a second one.I suspect that the Giants, while not nearly as strong as they were with Burress, will continue to win. The road to the Super Bowl won’t be the waltz it may have been if Burress had been on the team. “We can take a punch,” Reese said.The Giants have played without Burress before and, in some ways, have become anesthetized to his routine transgressions. Burress has been fined several times since joining the Giants three years ago. He was suspended for a game earlier this season for missing a team meeting. He was also fined $45,000 by the N.F.L. for abusing an official and throwing a ball into the stands after scoring a touchdown.So on Wednesday, amid a firestorm, Reese called for a return to normalcy. Giants players would not talk about “distractions.” Only about the Philadelphia Eagles.Everyone used the words “focus” and “moving forward.”When the news media steered the conversation to Burress, the players steered it back to football. When a reporter asked guard Chris Snee how the Giants were dealing with the distraction surrounding Burress, he said: “What distraction? We had one of the most enthusiastic practices we’ve ever had.”Kareem McKenzie, an offensive tackle, made the point that Burress was suspended and the story had moved outside of the locker room and was no longer on the radar screen.Now Burress is down to a final thread.The larger question —and this will be debated for several months — is whether the Giants should even consider letting Burress back next season regardless of what happens with the law.On Wednesday, Richard Berthelsen, the acting executive director of the players union, confirmed that it would file a grievance on Burress’s behalf against the Giants.I’m all for compassion, but there is a thin line between compassion and enabling self-destructive behavior.The Giants have crossed the line once.

Mr. Turner has a sell rating on Fortress shares.Fortress’s plight reflects the ills plaguing much of high finance. Investors are abandoning hedge funds in growing numbers, and the industry, once so profitable, is now in the midst of a wrenching shakeout.Even before Fortress lowered the gates on redemptions at its Drawbridge Global Macro fund, other big-name hedge funds had done so. More are expected to follow suit. Some investors fear that a rush of withdrawals could force funds to dump investments en masse, unsettling already shaky financial markets.Fortress’s biggest fund is withering. In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Fortress said that Drawbridge Global would have about $3.7 billion in assets under management as of Jan. 1, compared to the $8 billion it reported having as of Sept. 30.But while Fortress’s earnings will suffer because of the redemptions — hedge funds earn fees based on both the amount of assets they manage and the performance of those funds — the withdrawals alone do not necessarily spell the company’s doom. Less than 30 percent of Fortress’s $34 billion in assets under management are subject to investor redemptions. Most are locked up in private equity funds that do not allow quick withdrawals of capital.Still, private equity firms have been hurt by the near-freeze in the credit markets, which has limited their ability to strike new deals and dealt a severe blow to many of the debt-laden companies they own.Fortress dodged a major setback when it managed to refinance IntraWest, the big Canadian ski resort. But investors worry that Fortress has taken damage from its exposure to the commercial real estate market, which is coming under severe stress. Fortress was a major lender to Harry Macklowe, the real estate mogul, who had to sell off trophy properties like the General Motors Building in Manhattan to pay back his creditors.Just as it was the first major alternative-investment manager to go public, Fortress is now being watched closely as a canary in the coal mine. The Drawbridge fund’s nearly 50 percent redemption rate far outpaces the 20 to 30 percent that the market had expected at hedge funds on average, said Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Capital.“From my standpoint, I wonder how many other funds are seeing similar redemption rates,” he said. “This is definitely a negative indicator for the industry.”For months, Fortress has been the subject of gallows humor suggesting that it might simply buy back its shares and take itself private once more. While the company’s executives have asserted their commitment to remaining public, several analysts said that Fortress’s problems were clearly intensified by the brighter light that comes with being a public company.“It forces their problems to be out in the open,” Mr. Turner said. “It made the issues that they have much more amplified.”'"
"'08-12-04,'0','An early enthusiast about the potential of interactive computing, Mr. Selfridge saw his ideas summarized in a famous 1968 paper, “The Computer as a Communications Device,” written by J. C. R. Licklider and Robert W. Taylor and published in the journal Science and Technology.Honoring Mr. Selfridge, the authors proposed a device they referred to as Oliver, an acronym for On-Line Interactive Vicarious Expediter and Responder. Oliver was one of the clearest early descriptions of a computerized personal assistant.With four other colleagues, Mr. Selfridge helped organize a 1956 conference at Dartmouth that led directly to creation of the field of artificial intelligence.“Oliver was one of the founding fathers of the discipline of artificial intelligence,” said Eric Horvitz, a Microsoft researcher who is president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. “He has been well known in the field for his early and prescient writings on the challenge of endowing machines with the ability to learn to recognize patterns.”Oliver Gordon Selfridge, a grandson of H. Gordon Selfridge, the American who founded Selfridges department store in London, was born in London on May 10, 1926. The family lost control of the business during the Depression and emigrated to the United States at the onset of World War II.Mr. Selfridge attended Middlesex School in Concord, Mass., and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he graduated at 19 with a degree in mathematics. After service in the Navy, he embarked on graduate study at M.I.T. under Norbert Wiener, the pioneering theorist of computer science. He became one of Wiener’s collaborators but plunged into the working world of computer science before earning an advanced degree.In the 1960s Mr. Selfridge was associate director for Project MAC, an early time-shared computing research project at M.I.T. He did much of this work at the M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory, a federally financed research center for security technology. He then worked at Bolt, Beranek & Newman, now BBN Technologies, which develops computer and communications-related technology. In 1983 he became chief scientist for the telecommunications company GTE.He began advising the nation’s national security leaders in the 1950s, among other tasks serving on the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and the Scientific Advisory Board of the National Security Agency.His first marriage, to Allison Gilman Selfridge, and his second, to Katherine Bull Selfridge, ended in divorce. Besides his companion, his survivors include their daughter, Olivia Selfridge Rissland of Belmont; three children from his first marriage, Peter Selfridge of Bethesda, Md.; Mallory Selfridge of Eastford, Conn.; and Caroline Selfridge of Saratoga, Calif.; a sister, Jennifer Selfridge MacLeod of Princeton Junction, N.J.; and six grandchildren.Along with producing scholarly papers and technical books, Mr. Selfridge wrote “Fingers Come in Fives,” “All About Mud” and “Trouble With Dragons,” all books for children. At his death he was working on a series of books he hoped might one day become an arithmetic equivalent of summer reading projects for schoolchildren.Mr. Selfridge never stopped theorizing, speaking and writing on what he saw as the future of artificial intelligence.“I want an agent that can learn and adapt as I might,” he once told a meeting organized by I.B.M. Such an agent would “infer what I would want it to do, from the updated purposes it has learned from working for me,” he went on, and “do as I want rather than the silly things I might say.”'"
"'08-12-04,'0','The trillions of farm animals around the world generate 18 percent of the emissions that are raising global temperatures, according to United Nations estimates, more even than from cars, buses and airplanes.But unlike other industries, like cement making and power, which are facing enormous political and regulatory pressure to get greener, large-scale farming is just beginning to come under scrutiny as policy makers, farmers and scientists cast about for solutions.High-tech fixes include those like the project here, called “methane capture,” as well as inventing feed that will make cows belch less methane, which traps heat with 25 times the efficiency of carbon dioxide. California is already working on a program to encourage systems in pig and dairy farms like the one in Sterksel.Other proposals include everything from persuading consumers to eat less meat to slapping a “sin tax” on pork and beef. Next year, Sweden will start labeling food products so that shoppers can look at how much emission can be attributed to serving steak compared with, say, chicken or turkey.“Of course for the environment it’s better to eat beans than beef, but if you want to eat beef for New Year’s, you’ll know which beef is best to buy,” said Claes Johansson, chief of sustainability at the Swedish agricultural group Lantmannen.But such fledgling proposals are part of a daunting game of catch-up. In large developing countries like China, India and Brazil, consumption of red meat has risen 33 percent in the last decade. It is expected to double globally between 2000 and 2050. While the global economic downturn may slow the globe’s appetite for meat momentarily, it is not likely to reverse a profound trend.Of the more than 2,000 projects supported by the United Nations’ “green” financing system intended to curb emissions, only 98 are in agriculture. There is no standardized green labeling system for meat, as there is for electric appliances and even fish.Indeed, scientists are still trying to define the practical, low-carbon version of a slab of bacon or a hamburger. Every step of producing meat creates emissions.Flatus and manure from animals contain not only methane, but also nitrous oxide, an even more potent warming agent. And meat requires energy for refrigeration as it moves from farm to market to home.Producing meat in this ever-more crowded world requires creating new pastures and planting more land for imported feeds, particularly soy, instead of relying on local grazing. That has contributed to the clearing of rain forests, particularly in South America, robbing the world of crucial “carbon sinks,” the vast tracts of trees and vegetation that absorb carbon dioxide.“I’m not sure that the system we have for livestock can be sustainable,” said Dr. Pachauri of the United Nations. A sober scientist, he suggests that “the most attractive” near-term solution is for everyone simply to “reduce meat consumption,” a change he says would have more effect than switching to a hybrid car.The Lancet medical journal and groups like the Food Ethics Council in Britain have supported his suggestion to eat less red meat to control global emissions, noting that Westerners eat more meat than is healthy anyway.Producing a pound of beef creates 11 times as much greenhouse gas emission as a pound of chicken and 100 times more than a pound of carrots, according to Lantmannen, the Swedish group.But any suggestion to eat less meat may run into resistance in a world with more carnivores and a booming global livestock industry. Meat producers have taken issue with the United Nations’ estimate of livestock-related emissions, saying the figure is inflated because it includes the deforestation in the Amazon, a phenomenon that the Brazilian producers say might have occurred anyway.United Nations scientists defend their accounting. With so much demand for meat, “you do slash rain forest,” said Pierre Gerber, a senior official at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Soy cultivation has doubled in Brazil during the past decade, and more than half is used for animal feed.Laurence Wrixon, executive director of the International Meat Secretariat, said that his members were working with the Food and Agriculture Organization to reduce emissions but that the main problem was fast-rising consumption in developing countries. “So whether you like it or not, there’s going to be rising demand for meat, and our job is to make it as sustainable as possible,” he said.Estimates of emissions from agriculture as a percentage of all emissions vary widely from country to country, but they are clearly over 50 percent in big agricultural and meat-producing countries like Brazil, Australia and New Zealand.In the United States, agriculture accounted for just 7.4 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2006, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.The percentage was lower because the United States produces extraordinarily high levels of emissions in other areas, like transportation and landfills, compared with other nations. The figure also did not include fuel burning and land-use changes.Wealthy, environmentally conscious countries with large livestock sectors — the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and New Zealand — have started experimenting with solutions.In Denmark, by law, farmers now inject manure under the soil instead of laying it on top of the fields, a process that enhances its fertilizing effect, reduces odors and also prevents emissions from escaping. By contrast, in many parts of the developing world, manure is left in open pools and lathered on fields.Others suggest including agriculture emissions in carbon cap-and-trade systems, which currently focus on heavy industries like cement making and power generation. Farms that produce more than their pre-set limit of emissions would have to buy permits from greener colleagues to pollute.New Zealand recently announced that it would include agriculture in its new emissions trading scheme by 2013. To that end, the government is spending tens of millions of dollars financing research and projects like breeding cows that produce less gas and inventing feed that will make cows belch less methane, said Philip Gurnsey of the Environment Ministry.At the electricity-from-manure project here in Sterksel, the refuse from thousands of pigs is combined with local waste materials (outdated carrot juice and crumbs from a cookie factory), and pumped into warmed tanks called digesters. There, resident bacteria release the natural gas within, which is burned to generate heat and electricity.The farm uses 25 percent of the electricity, and the rest is sold to a local power provider. The leftover mineral slurry is an ideal fertilizer that reduces the use of chemical fertilizers, whose production releases a heavy dose of carbon dioxide.For this farm the scheme has provided a substantial payback: By reducing its emissions, it has been able to sell carbon credits on European markets. It makes money by selling electricity. It gets free fertilizer.And, in a small country where farmers are required to have manure trucked away, it saves $190,000 annually in disposal fees. John Horrevorts, experiment coordinator, whose family has long raised swine, said that dozens of such farms had been set up in the Netherlands, though cost still makes it impractical for small piggeries. Indeed, one question that troubles green farmers is whether consumers will pay more for their sustainable meat.“In the U.K., supermarkets are sometimes asking about green, but there’s no global system yet,” said Bent Claudi Lassen, chairman of the Danish Bacon and Meat Council, which supports green production. “We’re worried that other countries not producing in a green way, like Brazil, could undercut us on price.”'"
"'08-12-04,'0','“G.M. should have started to negotiate with its various constituencies six months ago,” said Mark I. Bane, a lawyer at Ropes & Gray who specializes in corporate reorganization.G.M. hopes the exchange will help pave the way for $12 billion in federal loans and a $6 billion line of credit. The company has not formally announced the terms of its offer, but it hopes that bondholders will agree to cut its debt roughly in half in exchange for a substantial stake in G.M.G.M. has hired Evercore Partners, the investment bank, to corral creditors and get them to agree to a deal. Evercore has some experience doing just that. The firm is run by Roger C. Altman, the former assistant Treasury secretary, who helped oversee the federal rescue of Chrysler in 1980.Back then, Chrysler persuaded its creditors to accept 15 cents on the dollar for their debt, and a stake in the company, in exchange for forgiving $1.3 billion in loans. It took almost a year to strike that deal, however, a luxury G.M. does not have.“The primary question mark is, ‘How accessible are the holders of the debt?’ ” Mr. Bane said. Out-of-court workouts often end up in bankruptcy court because bondholders refuse the offer or simply can not be located, he said.G.M.’s creditors are spread around the financial world. Its bondholders include big institutions like Fidelity, Franklin Resources, Lord Abbett, and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance. G.M. also has lines of credit with banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. Hedge funds and individuals also own billions of dollars of its debt.In order to retool its balance sheet, G.M. would have to persuade creditors to exchange their long-term debt at about 30 cents on the dollar for new debt backed by the government and a substantial ownership stake in the recapitalized company, Brian A. Johnson, an analyst at Barclays Capital, wrote in a recent report.G.M. would also have to negotiate with the U.A.W., which controls a company health care trust, known as a voluntary employee benefit trust, or VEBA. G.M. owes the trust $7 billion in cash in 2010.That $7 billion would probably have to be swapped for new government-backed debt, perhaps at 60 cents on the dollar, as well as an equity stake. The U.A.W. indicated this week that it would be willing to accept some contract concessions, but the negotiations are just beginning.Kip D. Penniman Jr., an analyst with KDP Investment Advisors, said bondholders should prepare for a fight. G.M.’s unsecured debt is worth at least 40 cents to 50 cents on the dollar, he said.“There remains considerable uncertainty, to say the least, surrounding the government’s role in G.M.’s proposed oversight board and just how negotiations with debt holders — who are key to G.M.’s financial restructuring — will be conducted,” Mr. Penniman said.G.M. does not have much time. It said on Tuesday that it needed $4 billion to survive into 2009 and an additional $14 billion after that. The company also said that it would cut jobs, close factories, drop brands and reduce executive pay as part of its plea for federal aid.Renee Rashid-Merem, a spokeswoman for G.M., said the company took into account the time and complexity of debt exchanges when developing its plan.“We hope that with the involvement of the administration and the appointment of a federal oversight committee that it may help to accelerate that process,” she said.But Mr. Bane, the specialist in overhauls, said companies like G.M. should start this process before they are on the brink. “It takes a long time to set up the pieces of the puzzle,” he said.'"
"'08-12-04,'0','TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — Auburn fired Coach Tommy Tuberville on Wednesday, ending a successful tenure that included an 85-40 record and six consecutive victories over archrival Alabama.No. 1 Alabama is undefeated, while Auburn is 5-7. Tuberville’s tenure ended after three days of meetings with Athletic Director Jay Jacobs.The firing upset Alabama Coach Nick Saban, who cited Tuberville’s “body of work” and said, “I guess we’re 5-7 away from the same thing.”The most prominent name to emerge as Tuberville’s potential replacement is Texas Tech Coach Mike Leach. A person with knowledge of Auburn’s thinking said that the university had contacted Leach through the search firm of Bill Carr, who runs many searches for coaches for high-profile programs.Other possible candidates include Texas Christian’s Gary Patterson, Tulsa’s Todd Graham, Wake Forest’s Jim Grobe, Air Force’s Troy Calhoun, Connecticut’s Randy Edsall and Arkansas’s Bobby Petrino. The Birmingham News reported that Auburn contacted Petrino, who has a noncompete clause in his contract that forbids him to go to another college in the Southeastern Conference West.Leach, who led Texas Tech to an 11-1 record this season, interviewed at Washington on Tuesday. It is not known if he would prefer Auburn or the Huskies job. Leach’s relationship with Texas Tech appears strained — a person close to Leach said that the university has not offered him a contract extension, despite comments to the contrary by Athletic Director Gerald Myers. Myers told The Associated Press that Texas Tech was negotiating with Leach, which the person close to Leach said was not true.'"
"'08-12-04,'0','Pettitte battled shoulder problems last season and ended up 14-14 with a 4.54 earned run average, including a 2-7 mark to finish the year. The Yankees believe Pettitte, who pitched a team-high 204 innings, can still be an effective starter, but they consider a $16 million investment in him to be too expensive.When Pettitte was asked about possibly accepting a pay cut to come back, he dodged the topic.“Again, for me to even talk about anything right now, it does no good,” Pettitte said. “I really don’t even want to talk about it or anything, as far as what that has to do with me and all that. I’m just letting Randy and Alan and the Yankees work things out. I’m basically just trying to enjoy my off-season with my family, and that’s it.”By declining to offer Pettitte salary arbitration Monday, the Yankees did not risk having him accept it and earn at least $16 million next season. One major league executive, whose team is also pursuing starters, said he would be surprised if Pettitte received any offers close to $16 million a season.If the Yankees re-sign Pettitte, he will join Chien-Ming Wang and Joba Chamberlain in their rotation. Adding Pettitte may give Cashman some leverage in pursuing other free agents like C. C. Sabathia, A. J. Burnett and Derek Lowe. The Yankees are handling Pettitte similarly to the way they dealt with Mike Mussina, who retired last month, in 2006.After Mussina went 15-7 in the final year of a six-year, $88.5 million deal, the Yankees declined to exercise his $17 million option. But both sides wanted the relationship to continue, which resulted in Mussina’s taking a reduced salary with a two-year, $23 million deal.Pettitte told the Yankees he was exercising his one-year, $16 million option in December 2007. Ten days later, Brian McNamee, Pettitte’s former trainer, was quoted in the Mitchell report saying that Pettitte had used human growth hormone. Pettitte, who did not tell the Yankees of the possibility he would be mentioned in the report, acknowledged that he had used H.G.H.Pettitte has spoken to Joe Torre, the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers and his former manager with the Yankees, but that might have been a ploy to get the Yankees to try to offer him arbitration. Pettitte declined to discuss the Dodgers or Torre. While he was hesitant to discuss himself, he has addressed the Yankees’ $140 million pursuit of Sabathia.“Anywhere I go, that’s all anybody wants to talk about,” Pettitte said.As Pettitte’s agents negotiate with the Yankees, the Yankees realize that he has repeatedly said that they are his first choice. When Pettitte was presented with the possibility that the Yankees could re-sign him during next week’s winter meetings, he said: “I hope so. That would be great.”'"
"'08-12-04,'0','But people are already exposed to nanoparticles. Stoves and toaster ovens emit ultrafine particles of 2 to 30 nanometers, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology; the researchers reported last month that long-term contact with such appliances could constitute a large exposure to the smallest of nanoparticles.Several products already use nano-engineered materials. There are “nano pants,” stain-resistant chinos and jeans whose fabric contain nano-sized whiskers that repel oil and dirt, and nanocycles made from carbon nanotubes that are stronger and lighter than standard steel bicycles. And in lotions and creams, the use of nanocomponents may create a more cosmetically elegant effect — like uniformity or spreadability.Some ingredients may behave differently as nanoparticles than they do in larger forms. Nano-sized silver, for example, can act as an antibacterial agent on the skin. Larger particles of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide result in white pasty sunscreens; but as nanoparticles, they appear more transparent.When it comes to beauty products, however, some consumer advocates are concerned that dynamic nanoparticles could pose risks to the skin or, if they penetrate the skin, to other parts of the body. Mineral sunscreens have attracted the most attention.“Substances that are perfectly benign could be toxic at the nano scale,” said Michael Hansen, a senior scientist at Consumers Union, the company behind Consumer Reports. “Because they are so small, they could go places in the body that could not be done before.”This month, the magazine published a study it had commissioned that found mineral nanoparticles in five sunscreens, even though four of the companies had denied using them. In October, Dr. Hansen sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, asking the agency to require cosmetics and sunscreen manufacturers to run safety tests on nano scale ingredients. In the letter, he cited a few studies published in scientific journals that reported that exposure to nanoparticles of titanium dioxide caused damage to the organs of laboratory animals and human cell cultures.But cosmetics industry representatives said there was no evidence that personal care products that contain nano-size components constitute a health hazard. Furthermore, no rigorous clinical trials have been published showing that cosmetics with nanocomponents caused health problems. A review of the potential risks of nanomaterials, carried out for the European Center for Toxicology in 2006, concluded that sunscreens with metal nanoparticles were unlikely to penetrate healthy skin, but it did raise the question of whether safety studies should examine if such materials may penetrate damaged skin.“It’s very difficult to get anything through the skin,” said John Bailey, the executive vice president for science of the Personal Care Products Council, an industry trade group in Washington. “The skin is a very effective barrier.”Indeed, some nanotechnology researchers said it was illogical to assume that a nano-size component inherently carries greater risk than a larger component. Furthermore, some say cosmetics may contain molecules like a silicone fluid called cyclopentasiloxane that are even smaller than nanomaterials.“I think it’s a double standard because nanoparticles are less likely to go through the skin than solutions where you are using single molecules,” said Robert S. Langer, a chemical engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. He is developing nanoparticles for the targeted delivery of cancer medications, and is a founder of Living Proof, a cosmetics company that makes hair products. “The molecules in a cream are certainly going to be smaller than a nanoparticle.”The Food and Drug Administration does not require manufacturers to list the format of ingredients on labels. The agency does require cosmetics manufacturers to ensure that their products are safe for use; in 2006, the agency created its own task force to investigate the safety of engineered nanomaterials.Ken Marenus, the senior vice president of regulatory affairs worldwide at the Estée Lauder companies, said nanomaterials had to undergo the same kind of assessment for exposure, risk and dosage levels as any other cosmetic component. “The same toxicological standards for every chemical will apply to nano,” he said.Dr. Bailey of the Personal Care Products Council estimated that several thousand sunscreens and cosmetics currently use some kind of nanoscale component.Cor soap, for example, uses 5 nanometer particles of silver combined with silica that are smaller than the size of a skin pore. The material is designed to enter the pores and kill bacteria.“The silver suffocates the bacteria and then you rinse it off with water,” said Jennifer McKinley, the chief executive of Cor. Although a study has shown that nanosilver can permeate broken skin, Ms. McKinley said the soap was safe because it contains only a limited amount of nanosilver and the particles do not remain on the skin.Indeed, using nanoderivatives of precious metals is becoming a trend. Last year, Chantecaille introduced Nano Gold Energizing Cream, a $420 face cream that contains 5-nanometer particles of 24-carat gold encapsulated in silk fibers. Sylvie Chantecaille, the chief executive of the company, said the capsules delivered the gold particles, which work as an antioxidant, into the surface layers of the skin. “It’s a very effective way to transport beneficial ingredients,” she said.But many beauty companies are shying away from discussing minuscule particles in their cosmetics. And that kind of avoidance may itself stoke nanophobia. For example, when La Prairie introduced its Cellular Cream Platinum Rare earlier this year, the company sent out press materials promoting “nano-sized Hesperidin Smart Crystals to protect DNA” in the formula. But, in a phone interview, Sven Gohla, the company’s vice president for research and development, distanced the brand from nanotechnology. Just because the particles of hesperidin, a flavonoid, in the formula are small does not mean they are manufactured nanotechnology, he said.Last month, a consumer group in London called Which? published a survey it had conducted of 67 cosmetics companies on the prevalence and safety testing of nanomaterials in personal care products. Only 17 companies responded, of which eight acknowledged using nanomaterials.“When nanotechnology was hot, everybody wanted to talk about ‘nano this, nano that.’ Look at the iPod nano,” said Dr. Hansen of Consumers Union. “But now that the concerns have come out, people are not so sure the word nano is a good thing to be touted.”'"
"'08-12-04,'0','Was one reading the $329 tag right on a cashmere men’s blazer from the elite Italian woolen house Loro Piana, a jacket that typically costs $2,000 or more? What about the $129 price for a black satin skirt from Comme des Garçons? Was the tagged price a misprint? It was not.“What I hear at every level of retail is that no one has ever experienced anything like this in their careers,” said Ken Downing, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus. And, while Mr. Downing suggested that the 40 Neiman stores would not soon tumble to discount fever, much of their merchandise had already been marked down by 40 percent, a sure sign that the line on price reduction cannot be held by any single player in luxury goods.Privately, most retailers admit to being frightened by the severity of the economic downturn and are looking not merely to save the current season but their commercial lives.While it is true that early numbers suggest retailers across the country got a boost from Black Friday’s bargain-hunting frenzy, the margins on optimism remain slim. A report released on Tuesday by MasterCard Advisors showed that sales of luxury goods fell 24.4 percent in November compared with the same month a year ago. When individual stores disclose their own figures for November sales on Thursday, they are expected to show the deep declines of early fall continuing.On Wednesday, customers of Barneys New York received an e-mail message promoting a “designer freak-out sale.” The savings of up to 50 percent encompassed goods like Christian Louboutin suede booties (marked down to $720 from $1,195) and coveted Marc Jacobs totes (reduced to $629 from $1,250). It should probably be noted that handbags and shoes are where luxury retailers turn to hear the music of cash registers going ka-ching, and so the event was a clear indication that somebody at Barneys must be freaking out.“It’s painful,” Linda Fargo, the women’s fashion director at Bergdorf Goodman, said referring to a landscape in which carriage-trade stores are struggling not only to hold on to their profits but also their ineffable luster.What seems inevitable is that the pain will worsen as the price reductions provoke questions among consumers of how stratospheric profits must have been when the economy was riding high. How great, really, was the surcharge to consumers for participating in fashion fantasy?“I was in Saks last week, and there were these staggering discounts and it’s not even Jan. 1,” Tim Gunn, the “Project Runway” host and chief creative officer of Liz Claiborne, said Tuesday, before a discussion on “Redefining the Rules of Fashion in Today’s Economy,” sponsored by the textile manufacturer Dow XLA. “I was told by easily half a dozen sales associates that if I opened a Saks credit card, I’d get another 15 percent off. What I wonder is, “What are the real margins?’ ”That question gives rise to another: once consumers become acquainted with slash-and-burn prices, how can designer fashion regain its mystique? Will shoppers ever again want to buy luxury goods at full price? The depth of the challenge was suggested by the incongruity this week of seeing Prada wallets, usually kept under glass at Saks, dumped into display stands that at Wal-Mart are known as “end-caps”; lizard handbags at Bergdorf Goodman jumbled on counters as if that Fifth Avenue landmark were an outlet of Loehmann’s; and Ralph Lauren dress shirts at Lord & Taylor thrown together and offered at prices roughly equivalent to the cost of two McDonald’s Happy Meals.The Saks strategy may be the first sign of a radical reconfiguration of the luxury goods landscape, said Beth Buccini, an owner of Kirna Zabête, the SoHo specialty store. “The intense and early discounting will negate the power of runway shows to drive fashion in both creative and commercial terms,” Ms. Buccini said. “All anyone can afford to do anymore is to sell pre-collections,” she added, referring to the commercial collections designers offer during transitional periods between their statement-making, twice yearly runway shows.“Runway clothes next year will arrive in the store in April, and we will have three weeks to sell them at full price before the department stores have put them on sale,” she said. “What I’m worried about is the creativity. Everybody is paralyzed wondering what people want, what they’re willing to spend, what’s going to dazzle us into not being able to live without certain items.” It could be, as Zac Posen remarked on Tuesday, that we are headed into a period when designers and retailers are “either stimulated and excited and challenged,” or else follow thousands of other failed American businesses into oblivion.“It’s all going to be very Darwinian,” Ms. Buccini said.'"
"'08-12-04,'0','To cries of “Hear, hear!” from almost every corner of the Commons, he said, “An M.P. endangering national security would be a disgrace; an M.P. exposing facts about Home Office policy which ministers are hiding is doing his job in the public interest.”The central figure in the Commons cross-fire was the Commons speaker, Michael Martin, a 63-year-old Labor veteran and former sheet-metal worker from Scotland who has long been an opposition target. Mr. Martin entered the chamber knowing that his failure to prevent the raid, more than anything in his eight years in the post, had imperiled his $205,000-a-year job, along with the lavish speaker’s house in London. His response, in a nervous statement that he delivered flush-faced, was to lay much of the blame for the raid on an assistant, Jill Pay, whom he had named this year to the post of Commons sergeant-at-arms, in charge of parliamentary security.Ms. Pay, the first woman to hold the job, sat stern-faced as Mr. Martin said he regretted that she had signed a police consent form for the raid on Mr. Green’s Commons office without consulting the Clerk of the Commons, who oversees Commons staff for Mr. Martin.Mr. Martin also took aim at Scotland Yard, saying that Robert Quick, an assistant police commissioner who leads the counterterrorism squad, had failed to tell Ms. Pay that the police had no warrant for the Commons raid, and that Ms. Pay had a right to refuse.Mr. Martin said he had been told by Ms. Pay on the morning of the raid that the police planned to arrest a Commons member, but that he was given no name or details of the case. “I’m aware of the anger that’s in the chamber,” Mr. Martin said, amid a chorus of members’ shouts. From now on, he said, no police raids on members’ offices would be permitted without a warrant and without the speaker’s personal consent.In a further bid to stem the rising tide of protest, Mr. Martin said he intended to name a committee of seven senior members of the Commons to draw up a report on the raid and its repercussions. Separate inquiries have already been announced by Scotland Yard and by a standing Commons committee that deals with members’ privileges.But the Commons exchanges suggested that Mr. Martin, along with Ms. Pay, may be far from safe in their jobs. Michael Howard, a former Conservative leader, described the raid and Mr. Green’s arrest as deplorable, and entirely without precedent in modern parliamentary annals.

But long before that shock, the country had been suffering the effects of the global slump, losing capital as Western investors fled to the security of American Treasuries, undermining Indian banks and company balance sheets.Infosys recently scaled back its projections for the year, telling investors that it now expects revenue to expand 13 to 15 percent, instead of the 19 to 21 percent it had forecast and far below the 30 percent annual expansion the company had been used to.Like many of India’s outsourcing companies, Infosys is heavily dependent on the financial sector, deriving a third of its revenue from banks like Citigroup and Bank of America and other financial clients. Its fate is also closely tied to the American economy: two-thirds of its business comes from the United States. Neither factor bodes well for the company’s prospects.Technology Partners International, a consulting firm that publishes an index of global outsourcing deals, says its index is at a 10-year low. “People think that outsourcing is a recession-proof industry. It is not,” said Siddharth Pai, a partner at the firm.That realization has changed the boomtown atmosphere of this city. Young workers still flock to a rooftop terrace on Residency Road every Wednesday night to grind to house and hip-hop music. But lately, the crowds at NYKS, an upscale nightclub, are a little thinner. They drink a little bit less. They talk a little less loudly. “Now they are thinking twice before spending money,” said Supreeth Chandrasekhar, a 25-year-old disc jockey at NYKS.Mr. Chandrasekhar also said that he used to perform at corporate events but that this business had largely disappeared.In a country where most marriages are arranged by parents, the downturn has even taken a toll on the matrimonial prospects of those in technology outsourcing. “Because there is no job guarantees for I.T. people, for the last six months brides’ families have not been accepting grooms from this background,” said Jagadeesh Angadi, a matchmaker in Bangalore.The Indian National Association of Software and Service Companies estimates that the country’s technology sector will create 50,000 fewer jobs in 2008 than last year, although it predicts the sector will still have added 200,000 workers by year’s end. India’s technology outsourcing companies have laid off about 10,000 employees since September, according to the Union for Information Technology Enabled Services, a labor group that represents technology workers.Among the major players that have announced cutbacks in hiring is Satyam Computer Services, which slashed its recruitment plans to fewer than 10,000 from 15,000. Infosys, by contrast, has almost $2 billion in cash on its balance sheet, a significant amount that can help it weather the downturn. It said it intended to follow through on plans to hire 25,000 workers this year.“We made offers to people, and we need to stand by them,” Mr. Nilekani of Infosys said.But some companies that have hired recruits are postponing their start dates. The deferrals allow companies, which once hired in anticipation of future business, to better manage overhead by adding staff only when they have confirmed projects.A few so-called captive outsourcing operations — those that serve only their parent company in Europe or the United States — have also cut back. American Express laid off some 200 of its 6,000 workers in India, and Goldman Sachs announced last month that it would dismiss about 10 percent of its Indian work force.Still, for the moment, the industry has escaped large-scale job losses. Indian labor laws make it difficult for companies to drop workers, and mass firings can draw a political outcry. But outsourcing companies have begun pruning workers, citing poor job performance, a way to quietly reduce labor costs without attracting much public scrutiny.The large outsourcing company Wipro dismissed 2.5 percent of its work force in the second quarter. Outsourcing companies are also shelving expansion plans. Wipro, for instance, announced it was postponing the opening of a major new software development center in Atlanta.But India’s business leaders see opportunity in the downturn. “Once things settle down, people will start looking at their business operations and how to make them more efficient, and that is where we play,” Mr. Nilekani said.Even consolidation on Wall Street, which may eliminate some Indian companies’ clients, could help Indian workers, outsourcing executives say. Mergers require technical skills to integrate disparate systems, and there is a potential for profitable outsourcing work in areas like regulatory compliance. Banks are likely to be under stricter government scrutiny given the sense that lax oversight contributed to the financial crisis.Raman Roy, chairman of Quatrro BPO Solutions, an outsourcing firm based in New Delhi, says he has 300 employees reviewing legal documents as part of bank mergers. Copal Partners, a company that uses employees in India to help investment banks do the sort of deal-based research normally performed by the bank’s junior analysts, has continued to expand even during the downturn.Critics say that will not change the local industry’s basic disadvantage: a creativity gap with Western competitors. Indian technology companies are too focused on increasing the efficiency of their systems, not improving their clients’ own industry-specific processes, according to Navi Radjou, an analyst with Forrester Research. “They are having trouble tailoring a technical application to a particular business need,” he said.But India’s biggest tech outsourcing companies want to do as much as their European and American rivals, including expanding in Europe and the United States. And the downturn may allow them to acquire talent — and even whole businesses — on the cheap.The changes may come too late for workers like Vikram Hathwar.In July, Mr. Hathwar, a 22-year-old engineer, graduated from a technical college with a job offer from a software developer. But instead of starting his job — paying nearly $6,000 a year, a good starting salary in this country — Mr. Hathwar has been waiting for a letter from the company telling him when to report for work.“I called them and they said they would be calling two or three months later, but still they have not informed me anything about when I should start,” Mr. Hathwar said.In the meantime, he has begun looking for a temporary job. But he said most tech businesses are no longer hiring recent graduates. The few that are have begun asking applicants to intern for several months without pay and with no guarantee of a permanent position. “The recession has made for all these pressures on us,” Mr. Hathwar said. “It is very confusing to know what to do.”'"

"'08-12-04,'0','The three firms that dominate the $5 billion-a-year industry — Standard & Poor’s , Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings — have been widely criticized for failing to identify risks in subprime mortgage investments, whose collapse helped set off the global financial crisis.The rating agencies had to downgrade thousands of securities backed by mortgages as home-loan delinquencies have soared and the value of those investments plummeted. The downgrades have contributed to hundreds of billions in losses and writedowns at major banks and investment firms.Some critics, including investor advocates, say the S.E.C. rules don’t go far enough. They want new requirements to govern how the rating agencies are paid and to provide for the suspension of their licenses if they engage in unfair practices.“Any steps they take to further reduce conflicts of interest are critical to reforming the industry,” said Jeff Glenzer, managing director of the Association for Financial Professionals, a group representing finance officials at U.S. corporations that has been active on the issue.Some recommendations the group made to the S.E.C., such as requiring strict separation at rating agencies between credit analysts and employees responsible for generating revenue, weren’t adopted, Mr. Glenzer said.The rating agencies are crucial financial gatekeepers, issuing ratings on the creditworthiness of public companies and securities. Their grades can be key factors in determining a company’s ability to raise or borrow money, and at what cost which securities will be purchased by banks, mutual funds, state pension funds or local governments.The S.E.C. commissioners last June proposed the new rules and opened them to public comment.Among other things, the conflict-of-interest rules ban the rating agencies from advising investment banks on how to package securities to secure favorable ratings. Gifts over $25 from clients also will be prohibited.Rating agencies will be banned from making ratings in cases where the agency made recommendations to the company issuing securities or the investment bank underwriting them concerning the corporate structure, assets or activities of the issuing company.In addition, rating agencies will be required to disclose statistics on all their upgrades and downgrades for each asset type. They also will have to disclose how much verification they performed on the quality of complex securities in determining ratings for them.Investors will receive detailed information on the ratings process for complex securities, thereby exposing potential conflicts of interest for the agencies, S.E.C. officials said.The commissioners also voted to propose and open to public comment other rules that would require rating agencies to disclose in interactive electronic format the ratings history information for all of their assessments that companies issuing the securities pay them to do.Spokesmen for Fitch, Moody’s and S.&P. on Wednesday said they supported the S.E.C.’s efforts, already have taken steps to increase transparency and will continue to make further enhancements in the future.'"
"'08-12-04,'0','“The automobile market has taken a dive that has never before happened in this form and with this speed,” the association’s president, Matthias Wissmann, said on Wednesday. “The crisis is not limited to one country but is hitting every important market worldwide.”Porsche’s chief executive, Wendelin Wiedeking, has said that the industry is operating “auf sicht,” a German phrase connoting the desire to plan only as far as the eye can see. For a business that relies on long-term prospects to justify heavy fixed costs, that is a heavy burden, analysts said.Since Germany is in a sense Detroit writ large, the stakes could hardly be higher.According to the association, the auto industry itself employed about 750,000 Germans in 2007. Counting thousands of suppliers and dealers, the association said, that means more than five million people — one in five German workers — are tied to the auto industry.A holiday pause is standard in Germany, but all the major manufacturers are extending their assembly line shutdowns to avoid a big buildup of inventory. Daimler was the first to announce longer breaks, in October. BMW has also cut one of the two shifts from its Leipzig factory.That they are not already dealing with Germany’s tough unions over layoffs is a testament to the much more flexible labor policies that have been embraced in the industry over the last decade, analysts said.BMW is laying off about 5,000 temporary workers. At Daimler and Porsche, workers were allowed to set up “flex-time accounts,” where time worked above the contract maximum of 35 hours is stored without pay. When they work less than the maximum, they can tap the accounts to top up their paychecks.Porsche, generally regarded as the most flexible of the German automakers, has not escaped the squeeze. It halted production at its flagship factory in Stuttgart for the first time on Nov. 21, and is planning seven more shutdowns through the end of January.The industry’s best hope, which most analysts consider rather rosy, is that demand in the United States levels off and leads a global rebound in the second half of 2009.“Stuttgart is gazing across the big pond,” said Willi Diez, director of the Institute for Automotive Research in Nürtingen. “The hope, however small, is that the American market will stabilize next year.”Just as Ford Motor has worried about the disruptions that possible bankruptcies at General Motors and Chrysler would have on its business, German automakers are also nervously watching the fate of the Detroit automakers.BMW churns out premium vehicles for the American market from a factory in Spartanburg, S.C., and automaker bankruptcies “would have an effect on our suppliers,” said a BMW spokesman, Marc Hassinger.Still, Mr. Wissmann, the auto association president and former minister of research and technology, got ahead of the chief executives by broaching the subject of jobs on Wednesday, saying that “more adjustment cannot be ruled out.”Even a hint of such talk could be unsettling in Germany because the automakers have given unions employment guarantees for the next few years.“It’s not the right time to spread panic among the employees,” said Kai Bliesener, a spokesman for IG Metall, the most powerful German union. “They are already unnerved by the endless bad news.”Still, analysts said, automakers will have to address the question of downsizing their work force soon.“Nobody’s planning that now,” Mr. Diez, the institute director, said, “but by the spring this discussion will be there.”'"
"'08-12-04,'0','“I’m basically an engager,” Mr. de Hoop Scheffer said. “But engagement can’t take place in the context of spheres of influence. We have to see if Georgia is a watershed or not, and I hope not, and I’ll do my best that it will not be.”NATO continues to insist that Moscow live up to its agreement in August to return its forces to their positions before the war and rejects Russia’s recognition of independence for South Ossetia and Abkhazia.In a final communiqué, which went through 22 drafts, officials said, the foreign ministers gave their unanimous support to the planned deployment in Europe of an American missile defense system, which Washington says is aimed at Iran, not Russia. The ministers called it “a substantial contribution” to Western defense and encouraged Russia to take up American proposals for greater cooperation on missile defense.But there was no mention in the communiqué of President-elect Barack Obama’s skeptical remarks about the system, or of French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s comments last month that the missile defense would “bring nothing to security,” but instead “would complicate things and make them move backward.” Russia has threatened to respond by installing short-range missiles of its own in Kaliningrad.The NATO foreign ministers also criticized Russia for its suspension of the treaty that limits conventional arms and forces in Europe, saying: “The current situation, where NATO C.F.E. allies implement the treaty while Russia does not, cannot last indefinitely.”President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia has proposed talks on a new “security architecture” for Europe, but ministers made it clear, Mr. de Hoop Scheffer said, that there was nothing to discuss without specific proposals.He said that NATO members were “quite happy with the security structure as it exists,” and that he could not imagine them agreeing to anything that would undermine institutions like NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. “There is not a shimmer of a chance that, whatever the discussion, NATO could or would be negotiated away,” he said at a news conference with the Georgian foreign minister, Eka Tkeshelashvili.Ms. Tkeshelashvili expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the meeting, in which ministers reconfirmed that Georgia and Ukraine would eventually become members of NATO and said NATO would accelerate cooperative reform programs with both countries through existing NATO commissions.The commissions will work on annual assessments of each country’s security and political needs, and on reforms to help them on the long path of NATO membership.Ms. Tkeshelashvili said that Georgia welcomed “a commitment to the process by which we can achieve our goal” of membership, “with maximized efforts to assist Georgia.”The ministers decided to move ahead with that cooperation and leave to the future, “without prejudice,” decisions about whether both countries will also need to go through a formal “membership action plan,” as Germany and France now insist.The Russian ambassador to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, welcomed the decision to resume informal talks with Russia, saying that “I personally do not see the difference between formal and informal sittings, except that you don’t have coffee in an informal meeting but you still can order one.”Mr. Rogozin also said that the decision not to give a formal action plan to Georgia and Ukraine showed that relations with Russia were more important to NATO than with either applicant. He predicted to Kommersant daily that NATO would retreat from admitting Georgia and Ukraine, a prospect that “does not cheer anyone in the alliance.”On the Web site of a Russian state broadcaster, Vesti-24, Mr. Rogozin claimed on Wednesday that “there is an open split within NATO and it will widen if NATO tries to expand further. The schemes of those who adopted a frozen approach to Russia have been destroyed.”Mr. de Hoop Scheffer said that Mr. Rogozin can say what he likes, and American officials dismissed his comments as bluster aimed at a domestic audience.There was little controversy in the discussion here about NATO’s involvement in Afghanistan, given a new American president and unfinished American reviews of the best way forward in Afghanistan. But everyone understands that a President Obama will ask European allies for a larger commitment of troops, money and development workers.“It’s crystal clear that we need more forces in Afghanistan,” Mr. de Hoop Scheffer said, and he had no doubt that Mr. Obama will set phones “ringing in European capitals.”“The allies need to do better,” he said in the interview. “I want to see the balance in this alliance. I don’t want to just see more American troops. It has to be a combination of a military and civilian surge, and what slightly concerns me is that allies on this side of the ocean will have difficulty in matching the extra effort a new U.S. administration might put into Afghanistan.”'"
"'08-12-04,'0','“Part of the reason the money went up is that we gave them a range of what might happen with the economy and also with the industry,” Mr. Mulally said. “It shows that we’re not focused on just one base line plan, but also what if it did get worse.”G.M. said it needed $4 billion this month merely to survive into 2009 and another $14 billion after that. The company plan calls for more plant closures and job cuts, along with the sale or elimination of four brands. Chrysler, which is requesting $7 billion, also said it could collapse soon without aid. Ford asked for a $9 billion line of credit but said it did not expect to access that money unless the economy worsens or a rivals fails.At a news conference, Mr. Gettelfinger said that the U.A.W. would be open to modifying the four-year contracts that it signed in 2007 but not to completely restarting negotiations. Changes could include cuts to wages, health care or other benefits, though he did not give details, and would require approval from union members, but the jobs bank suspension does not.About 3,600 workers currently receive benefits under the jobs bank program, which the automakers created in the 1980s to win union approval for productivity improvements. The automakers have played down the need to eliminate it, but industry critics often cite it as a symbol of inefficiency for Detroit.“The jobs bank has become a sound bite that people use to beat us up,” Mr. Gettelfinger said, who will join the auto executives at Congressional hearings starting Thursday. “It’s become a lightning rod that takes away the focus from what the real issue is, and the real issue is the backbone of America.”Mr. Mulally warned in an interview that a failure of G.M. or Chrysler could also drag down Ford and countless dealers and suppliers. But he said that he was under no illusion that Ford could survive a bankruptcy filing by either of its cross-town Detroit rivals.“If one of the major automobile companies should seek bankruptcy protection,” he said, “it could easily drag the entire industry into bankruptcy, which we think would be terrible for the U.S. economy as well as for the industry.”Mr. Mulally said Ford needed a line of credit in case the automotive market — already the worst in 15 years — continues to deteriorate.“If despite everything that we’re doing as a country to arrest this recession, that things still get worse, we at Ford might need a bridge loan,” he said.Congressional leaders are reviewing the plans ahead of hearings on Thursday and Friday.“I think it is plain that Chrysler and General Motors cannot survive without government help,” Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview on Fox. “The need now is to take a detailed look at their plan to see if they have a realistic opportunity to survive.”Democratic leaders, who have been supportive of a bailout from the start, signaled their support of the new plans after they were filed, though many other lawmakers were waiting until the hearings before making a decision.A big question before Congress is where the money will come from to finance the loans.The Bush administration has declined to provide financing from the $700-billion financial rescue plan set up to help banks and other Wall Street institutions. The administration has suggested that aid for the automakers come from a $25 billion loan program for fuel-efficient vehicles already approved by Congress.However, Democratic lawmakers have balked at using that loan program for anything other than to encourage the development of cleaner cars and trucks.Mr. Mulally said that the automakers were not taking sides on where the money originates, only that it is approved before G.M. or Chrysler run out of operating cash.President-elect Barack Obama praised the three companies for producing “a more serious set of plans” to save the industry, but withheld judgment about how he thinks the federal government should help at this point.At a news conference announcing his commerce secretary, Mr. Obama said he had not seen the plans but pronounced himself pleased that the manufacturers were being more responsive to the concerns that he and lawmakers have expressed.“When the Big Three automakers came before them a couple of weeks ago,” he said, referring to Congressional testimony by auto executives, “they were not offering a clear plan for viability over the long term. And I think Congress was right to say that the taxpayers expect and deserve better than that before they are stepping up to the plate for any kind of bailout.”Now, he said, the latest plans indicate a seriousness by the auto executives.“But we should also make sure,” he said, “that any government assistance that’s provided is designed for a — is based on realistic assessments of what the auto market is going to be and a realistic plan for how we’re going to make these companies viable over the long term.”Mr. Obama said he still wanted to listen to more discussion before deciding what he thinks the government should do next. “It’s premature to get into that issue,” he said.At the U.A.W. meeting in Detroit, union officials described their members as extremely anxious about the prospect of more concessions but at the same time afraid of what would happen if the union did not aid the automakers.“We’ve helped them before, but it seems like they always come back to us,” said Shane Colvard, chairman of Local 2164 in Bowling Green, Ky., where G.M. builds the Chevrolet Corvette sports car.But a G.M. retiree, Frank Hammer, said looking to the union for givebacks does not resolve the automakers’ problems and compounds the bad economy.“More concessions mean more foreclosures,” said Mr. Hammer, 65, who worked at G.M.’s transmission plant in Warren, Mich. “Concessions are not a solution.”“We’re all getting smeared with this brush that we’re somehow greedy,” Mr. Hammer said. But if pay and benefits are cut, he told a group of reporters gathered outside the meeting, “what autoworker is going to be able to buy their product?”'"
"'08-12-04,'0','Mr. Lou’s comments represent the clearest statement yet that as global financial markets plunge and economies slow, the attention of China’s leaders is turning inward.For several months, there has been a noticeable difference between East and West in expectations of China. Financiers in the United States and Europe have frequently talked of ways to use China’s $1.9 trillion in foreign exchange reserves to rescue Western banks, most recently with speculation that the China Investment Corporation might invest more money in Morgan Stanley, which ended up turning to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan instead.But financial leaders in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, with closer links to decision makers in Beijing, have consistently maintained that having been burned on their initial financial sector investments, the Chinese are very leery of buying more. Mr. Lou confirmed this.Similarly, Western economists have hoped that China will try to take the lead in rekindling economic growth around the world with heavier spending. But while China has already announced plans for a stimulus plan of $586 billion, most of that money is earmarked for the construction of highways and railroads, categories in which China’s need for imports is fairly limited.President Hu Jintao warned at a government meeting last weekend that difficulties in the global economy threatened to undermine growth in China.Laura Tyson, who served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton, said at the same panel as Mr. Lou that the current crisis would give further impetus to Asia’s rise in economic importance.“It’s going to accelerate the move of economic power to Asia,” she said. “It was under way before, but this will accelerate it.” The China Investment Corporation has $200 billion and was initially expected to invest all of it overseas. But the fund has since made its largest investments shoring up the capital of banks in China.Mr. Lou said that the sheer pace of new initiatives and new rules issued by Western regulatory agencies was disconcerting and made it even harder for him to choose worthwhile investments. “If it is changing every week, how can you expect me to have confidence?” he asked.He did not rule out overseas investments, however, noting that, “Right now, the value of many investments is underestimated.” But he suggested that China might find some of its best opportunities in low-income countries. “We don’t want to look at only the advanced or developing countries, we also want to look at emerging markets.”The China Investment Corporation’s first investment, in the Blackstone Group, has fared badly and attracted considerable criticism within China. The sovereign wealth fund paid $3 billion at $29.605 a share; the shares closed on Tuesday in New York at $5.34, for a loss of $2.46 billion, or 82 percent.The China Investment Corporation also had heavy losses on its investment a year ago in Morgan Stanley, while value of the China Development Bank’s stake in Barclays has plunged.Like many Chinese officials lately, Mr. Lou expressed concern about rapidly slowing growth in American purchases of Chinese goods, which has led to large-scale layoffs at export-oriented factories in China, particularly in the Pearl River delta region near Hong Kong. He blamed a shortage of letters of credit from American banks, which he described as making it hard for American importers to obtain the money they need to buy Chinese goods even when they have ready buyers.“Citibank, Morgan Stanley and the government, they are very tight on their credit, so even when there is demand, they can’t make things happen,” he said.'"

The first is the president-elect’s order to ratchet back severely on the special-interest money that traditionally floats Washington’s panoply of victory celebrations. Planners have barred lobbyists, corporations, political action committees and well-heeled foreigners from making their usual down payments on access to the new administration.The other encouragement is the stroke of generosity by which a Virginia businessman is spending more than $1 million to rent prime hotel rooms and promising that assorted down-and-out citizens — from the poor to the terminally ill to wounded soldiers — will have a perch of privilege on Pennsylvania Avenue for the parade.The Capraesque gesture — dubbed “The People’s Inauguration” replete with two gala balls — is the gift of Earl Stafford, a 60-year-old Air Force retiree who made a fortune founding a military technology company.Mr. Stafford is picking up the tab for three nights with meals at the hotel for scores of the normally uninvited and overlooked. He’s even promising gown, tuxedo and hair-dresser costs for those most in need. “We just need to get back to caring about one another,” Mr. Stafford told The Washington Post, paraphrasing the Bible: “To whom much is given, much is required.”Mr. Stafford is one-upping Obama inaugural vows to “open this up to the public.” It’s heartening to contemplate a few of Washington’s steam-grate hoboes partying spiffy as expense-account insiders.For the official partying, Mr. Obama set an individual’s maximum contribution at $50,000, a fifth of the last Bush inaugural. It remains to be seen how much Mr. Obama’s campaign army of Internet donors might subsidize festivities that most are not likely to be attending. But the urge for change — at least in the ways Washington parties on — is taking shape.'"
"'08-12-05,'1','NASA announced that it would push back the launching of its next Mars mission by two years because of delays and technical issues. The Mars Science Laboratory, an S.U.V.-size rover that is to explore the Martian surface for two years, is now scheduled for launching in 2011. It had been scheduled to lift off next October and arrive at Mars in 2010. Problems with its electrical motors have not been solved, and officials said they did not think they could meet the original schedule without compromising rigorous testing. Because the Earth and Mars come closest to each other every 26 months, the next chance for launching is fall 2011. The delay comes at considerable cost. The project, approved at $1.63 billion in 2006, is now budgeted at $1.88 billion, and the delay will add $400 million.'"
"'08-12-05,'1','Fortunately, there is a way out of this legal morass. Indeed, the law is very clear — we just seem to have forgotten about it.The solution to piracy lies in the very nature of piracy itself. The Roman lawmaker Cicero defined piracy as a crime against civilization itself, which English jurist Edward Coke famously rephrased as “hostis humani generis” — enemies of the human race. As such, they were enemies not of one state but of all states, and correspondingly all states shared in the burden of capturing them.From this precept came the doctrine of universal jurisdiction, meaning that pirates — unlike any other criminals — could be captured wherever they were found, by anyone who found them. This recognition of piracy’s unique threat was the cornerstone of international law for more than 2,000 years.Though you wouldn’t guess it from the current situation, the law is surprisingly clear. The definition of pirates as enemies of the human race is reaffirmed in British and American trial law and in numerous treaties.As a customary international law (albeit one that has fallen out of use since the decline of traditional piracy) it cuts through the Gordian knot of individual states’ engagement rules. Pirates are not ordinary criminals. They are not enemy combatants. They are a hybrid, recognized as such for thousands of years, and can be seized at will by anyone, at any time, anywhere they are found.And what of the Emden’s problem? Are pirates a species of terrorist? In short, yes. The same definition of pirates as hostis humani generis could also be applied to international organized terrorism. Both crimes involve bands of brigands that divorce themselves from their nation-states and form extraterritorial enclaves; both aim at civilians; both involve acts of homicide and destruction, as the Convention on the High Seas stipulates, “for private ends.”For this reason, it seems sensible that the and the international community adopt a new, shared legal definition that would recognize the link between piracy and terrorism. This could take the form of an act of Congress or, more broadly, a new jurisdiction for piracy and terrorism cases at the .There is ample precedent. In the 1970s, the hijacking of airliners was defined by the United Nations as “aerial piracy.” In 1985, when terrorists seized the ship Achille Lauro and held its passengers hostage, President called the hijackers “pirates.” Recent evidence also indicates that the Somali pirates hand over a part of their millions in ransom money to , the Somali rebel group that has been linked to .The similarities and overlaps between the two crimes have prompted some jurists to advocate abandoning the term piracy altogether in favor of “maritime terrorism.” By reasserting the traditional definition of pirates as hostis humani generis, and linking it to terrorism, the United States and other nations will not only gain a powerful tool in fighting the Somali pirates, but other incidents of terrorism around the world as well.Recognizing piracy as an international crime will do something else: It will give individual states that don’t want to prosecute pirates an alternative — the international court. If pirates are recognized under their traditional international legal status — as neither ordinary criminals nor combatants, but enemies of the human race — states will have a much freer hand in capturing them. If piracy falls within the jurisdiction of the international court, states will not need to shoulder the burden of prosecution alone.Today the world’s navies are hamstrung by conflicting laws and the absence of an international code. A comprehensive legal framework is the only way to break the stalemate off Somalia. In a trial before the Old Bailey in 1696, Dr. Henry Newton, the Admiralty advocate, declared, “Suffer pirates and the commerce of the world must cease.”More than 300 years later, the world is suffering again. Fortunately, this time we have the answer.'"

"'08-12-05,'1','Browne said the police received their first call from an N.F.L. security official between 10:30 and 11:30 a.m. on Saturday, about 10 hours after the shooting. That call, Browne said, came from Bob Joyce, a former police lieutenant who is employed by the league.“A detective in the 34th Precinct gets a call from this guy, Bob Joyce, of the N.F.L., who says they’ve heard news reports Plaxico may have been wounded,” Browne said. “He’s asking our detectives if there’s been any 911 calls about it or if he was admitted.”Browne said Joyce told the police the N.F.L. knew little about what had occurred and wanted to know what the police knew.Later Saturday, at about 12:20 p.m., Browne said, Joyce called a lieutenant he knew and asked for more information, saying all the N.F.L. knew was what it heard on the radio.“The Giants have said they told the National Football League to call the police,” Browne added. But he said the notion that the N.F.L. security officials “called us to provide details is not the case, and they did not tell us what they knew.”“Don’t try and make it sound like you notified us of a shooting and provided us with details; the press notified us,” Browne said.“They weren’t making a notification, they weren’t calling to make a notification,” Browne said of the security officials. “They were calling in to see if we had heard.”He added: “We deal with people who don’t provide us with information all the time, but they are usually career criminals.”Finally, Browne disputed Ahlerich’s statement that high-ranking police officials had been contacted. “The highest-ranking official who was contacted was a lieutenant; that’s not high,” Browne said. “Don’t describe a lieutenant as a high-ranking official; no lieutenant would describe themselves as such.”The N.F.L. issued a statement in which it said that “we continue to cooperate with the investigation and will assist the N.Y.P.D. in any way that we can.” The league declined to make Ahlerich available for an additional interview.Browne said the first concrete information that the police received from the N.F.L. came at 4 p.m. Saturday, about 15 hours after the incident. It was then, he said, that N.F.L. security officials told the police that the gun with which Burress had shot himself could be recovered from the New Jersey home of Antonio Pierce, a teammate of Burress’s who was with him in a Manhattan nightclub when the gun went off.Hours earlier, Browne said, a police detective learned of the shooting only when he saw it “scrolling along on ESPN.”“That’s how he knew,” Browne said.'"
"'08-12-05,'1','Mr. Sarachek said in a telephone interview that he had rushed to reopen the plant because Agriprocessors owned 700,000 chickens that needed to be slaughtered. A bankruptcy judge authorized him to spend $2.5 million to run the plant through next Friday.“Our game plan is to begin with the chickens, then deal with some of the cooked meats and to actively market the company for sale,” he said. He has hired as top assistants two consultants with decades of experience in kosher meat production, Arnold Mikelberg and Allan Gluck.Mr. Sarachek said the budget he was given to run the plant was not enough for him to cover the $500,000 owed in back wages. So he promised to repay quickly only those people who were rehired, as a way to attract workers back to a plant. (Others owed back pay need to apply to the bankruptcy judge.)At the meeting on Wednesday, one woman, eager for her job and back wages, shouted, “Tell me where I’m supposed to go and what I’m supposed to do.”The plant, which employed more than 800 workers last spring, has long been the economic heart of Postville, a town of about 2,000 residents. Its closing created shock and despair.Some 160 workers legally in this country from Palau were stranded, but many have since been hired at other meatpacking plants in Iowa. Scores of Orthodox Jewish workers who lived in Postville were left without work, as were dozens of African-Americans from around the Midwest who had moved to Postville to take jobs at Agriprocessors.“The disaster has so many layers,” said Maryn Olson, the acting coordinator of the Postville Response Coalition, a group of religious organizations, news media and government agencies helping to provide food, shelter and money to hard-pressed families. “I’ve seen dozens of people every day coming for help. People need money to do their laundry. People need $5 to put gas in their car to take someone to the doctor. People need rent money, money for their heat, their lights.”Each Wednesday, 150 people line up at the local food pantry. Local churches are playing a pivotal role in feeding and sheltering more than 30 Hispanic women arrested at the plant and awaiting deportation — for some it has been slowed by their having children born in America. The churches are also helping some 20 Hispanic workers who were arrested, given G.P.S. ankle bracelets and ordered by prosecutors to stay in the area, so they can testify against Agriprocessors and its managers.The plant’s former chief executive, Sholom Rubashkin, is in jail, awaiting a trial on felony charges of bank fraud, harboring illegal immigrants for profit and abetting document fraud and identity theft.Referring to the plant’s long-time practice of hiring illegal immigrants before the raids last May, the Rev. Paul Ouderkirk of St. Bridget’s Catholic Church, said, “The sword of Damocles was hanging over the Rubashkins and it fell, and when it hit them, it hit the city.”Like many other residents, Father Ouderkirk said he remained unsure whether to be optimistic or pessimistic about the potential sale of the plant.“I’d say Hanukkah and Christmas are to be very sad in town,” he said. “A lot of people are unemployed, including a lot of Jewish families. It’s a major catastrophe, what’s happened here.”'"
"'08-12-05,'1','Hedge funds are facing many agonies. They are tortured by redemptions. Then there are “high water marks,” another now-troublesome part of their model. They need to fix such flaws if they are to fight another day.The list of funds blocking investors from withdrawing their money is growing daily. Tudor Investment, the Fortress Investment Group and dozens of others have done so, at least temporarily. The rationale is to protect the fund’s remaining investors, who can be harmed if the fund needs to deplete its cash balance or sell assets at fire-sale prices.The need to slam the gates on investors highlights a big flaw in the hedge fund model. If funds make illiquid, long-term bets, it is risky to offer investors the chance to get out every month, as many funds do. Some funds are now locking investors in for longer, in exchange for fee reductions. An alternative is for a fund to limit its investments to truly liquid securities. That, for example, is Tudor’s new approach.This is not the only problem. Most hedge funds have high-water-mark policies that require managers to earn back any losses before they start again collecting their performance fees. This is predicated on the traditional view that hedge funds should make positive returns in virtually all market conditions.Except for a tiny loss in 2002, that is exactly what the average fund has done every year since 1990, according to Hedge Fund Research — until now. This year, the average fund is down more than 20 percent. So a typical fund now needs to gain back 25 percent or more before it can again collect its 20 percent take of investment gains.'"
"'08-12-05,'1','Mr. Obama’s advisers are acutely aware that moving too quickly can cause mistakes. But accounts of the process emerging from participants suggest that the president-elect is trying to be decisive as well as methodical and secretive in filling out his administration, perhaps foreshadowing how he intends to run the government.“You don’t have time to waste,” said Rahm Emanuel, the incoming White House chief of staff, who was named to his post two days after the election. “This is the worst economic situation since the Great Depression and the largest commitment of troops overseas since Richard Nixon. That’s the world we’re inheriting, and the president-elect said we don’t have a moment to waste putting things together.”Aides said Mr. Obama had been determined to expedite the cumbersome selection and vetting cycle that had bogged down previous transitions, in the hope that Senate confirmation of top nominees would be accelerated. They said he had been particularly committed to avoid what happened in 2001, when many top national security positions were still unfilled at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks.So far, none of Mr. Obama’s appointees have run into serious controversies, although questions are being raised about the involvement of Eric H. Holder Jr., the choice for attorney general, in Mr. Clinton’s last-minute pardon of Marc Rich, the fugitive financier. In other cases, Mr. Obama avoided difficulty by passing over early front-runners, among them John O. Brennan, a candidate for director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who could have run into trouble.“If you make a mistake, it has more resonance in the early period than it does later on,” said Martha Joynt Kumar, the director of the White House Transition Project, a scholarly effort.According to transition officials, Mr. Obama set the process in motion in August by recruiting John D. Podesta, Mr. Clinton’s former chief of staff, to lead his transition. Mr. Obama began to meet secretly with potential candidates before Election Day, transition officials said, though it is not clear exactly when that process began.Advisers contacted General Jones and asked him to catch up with Mr. Obama on the campaign trail. General Jones, who had spoken with Mr. Obama only twice before, rode by car one day from Washington to Richmond, Va., for the meeting.No promises were made that morning, but it touched off a series of telephone calls about possible jobs and issues like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. “We did a walk around the world a couple of times,” General Jones said in an interview. Shortly after the election, he was asked to come to Chicago, where he met again with Mr. Obama and talked about becoming secretary of state or national security adviser, people close to the transition said.Likewise, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was not sure what Mr. Obama wanted to talk about when she was summoned here last month, said another person close to the transition. She had heard speculation about jobs, but only after she arrived at Mr. Obama’s office did he ask her to think about being secretary of state.Only a handful of advisers are intimately involved as Mr. Obama makes his selections, including Mr. Emanuel; Mr. Podesta; Valerie Jarrett, his longtime adviser; Pete Rouse, his chief of staff in the Senate; and Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., aides said.Mr. Obama has personally interviewed all of his senior appointees and has sometimes met with more than one candidate before deciding, aides said. At one point, he was set to make Peter R. Orszag, the Congressional budget director, his White House budget director without a meeting because they had worked together. But Mr. Orszag was brought to Chicago anyway.The interviews played a critical role in settling on a Treasury secretary. Although Mr. Obama knew former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, he did not really know the other main candidate, Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. After meeting with him, Mr. Obama told some people he felt temperamentally in sync with Mr. Geithner, who is the same age as Mr. Obama, 47, and shares a certain low-key wonkish quality.But Mr. Obama saw Mr. Summers as a brilliant economist adept at distilling complex issues, despite past controversial statements that might have caused confirmation problems. So Mr. Obama persuaded him to head the White House National Economic Council, an appointment that does not require Senate approval.“I think he fell in love with Tim,” said someone familiar with the meeting. “But he also felt he needed to have Larry.”In trying to put his team together rapidly, Mr. Obama is fighting history. It took a little more than two months after inauguration on average for John F. Kennedy’s nominees to be confirmed by the Senate, according to data compiled by Paul Light, a professor at New York University. By Mr. Reagan’s presidency, it took twice that long. President Bush’s appointees on average took nine months.New legislation and extensive efforts by the Bush administration are helping to speed that up. Clay Johnson III, a Bush aide coordinating with the Obama team, called the president-elect’s selection process “well organized and staffed” and said he was on track to put his senior team “on the field faster than any incoming president in recent history.”'"
"'08-12-05,'1','“The museum has a very significant role beyond the culture of Los Angeles,” said Connie Butler, a former curator there who is now chief drawings curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. “People in the art world feel they are going to wake up one morning and one of the greatest resources in terms of contemporary art in the Western world is going to be permanently altered.”Museum officials say they expect a solution to the crisis by the end of the year, if not by the next board meeting, on Dec. 16. A possible merger with the has been discussed and is supported by some trustees, although the museum’s official position is that it wants to remain independent., the billionaire philanthropist who frequently plays the role of Medici here, offered $30 million last month in support of the Museum of Contemporary Art, on the condition that half of it be matched by contributions from other donors. So far, no other donors have stepped forward.Museum officials would not agree to be interviewed for this article or to discuss the scope of the state’s audit. In written responses to questions, the museum said it was “pursuing and assessing all of its options,” including talks with Mr. Broad and with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art about possible partnerships. “Central to all these discussions is MOCA’s commitment to its core mission,” the museum said.Part of its challenge may be that the very people who are considering the museum’s options include those who oversaw its decline. One of the board’s two co-chairmen, Tom Unterman, for example, has served on the board’s finance committee for the last eight years and was finance chairman the last three. David G. Johnson, the other co-chairman of the board, was previously head of its governance committee.“It’s obvious that there needs to be new management,” said Jane Nathanson, a member of the boards of both the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. “MOCA needs to look deeply into the way it has functioned and move forward to rebuild the reputation of the museum.”Some trustees have departed in recent years, frustrated with what they called the museum’s financial recklessness and lack of leadership. “I saw the train wreck coming,” said Susan Nimoy, a collector who left the board in 2006 after pushing hard, she said, to bring the budget in line with available money.“My main complaint to the board was that none of you would run your household budget the way this institution is run,” Mrs. Nimoy said. “I think every one of those trustees should resign and Jeremy should resign.”The museum was founded in 1979 by a corps of collectors after the demise of the Art Museum left Los Angeles without a major museum dedicated to modern or contemporary art. The city agreed that if the founders could raise $10 million for operating costs, it would help pay for construction of a new museum downtown.While the building was in development downtown, a nearby city warehouse was renovated for use as a temporary home. It opened in 1983, three years before the main building was completed on Grand Avenue. (The warehouse, known as the Geffen Contemporary, remains in use, and the museum also maintains a small gallery at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood.)Dean Valentine, a media entrepreneur and former museum trustee, described the museum as central to the city’s becoming a major cultural center. “For many artists in Los Angeles, it was the first institution that expressed interest in their work,” Mr. Valentine said, comparing its importance for West Coast artists to that of in New York for the Abstract Expressionists some 50 years ago.Historically, one problem dogging the museum has been the lack of a proper home for its permanent collection, which features early work by John Baldessari, and , among others. The Grand Avenue building is considered too small by today’s standards while the larger Geffen Contemporary lacks necessary climate controls to preserve art.“It’s a source of frustration for many of us,” Mr. Valentine said. Like Mrs. Nimoy, he left the museum board in 2006, unhappy with the leadership; both have since joined the board of the Hammer Museum here.Given its financial crisis, the Museum of Contemporary Art has announced plans to close the Geffen for six months next year and is promoting the location online for rental to film crews.According to its financial statements, the only time in the last seven years that the museum has managed to finish with a surplus was in the 2007 fiscal year, when its revenues topped expenses by $3 million. But much of that surplus came from a gain on the sale of investments; admissions and membership revenues had declined, and the budget surpassed $21 million, the highest ever.The museum said it expected its audited financial statements, once completed, to show that it generated a surplus in the 2008 fiscal year as well, although it declined to provide details.Yet in nearly every year since 2000, the museum has drawn down on the principal of its endowment to pay for operations, a practice frowned upon as risky in the museum world.And at times the museum has secured financing for exhibitions in ways that many other museums would shun. To help pay for last year’s exhibition, the museum solicited hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from art galleries that represented the artist and therefore stood to gain from any related career boost.The museum said in a statement that it recently bolstered its ability to raise money, hiring a new director of development and nearly doubling its donations in the last two years. It noted that in the last seven years, 20 of the board’s 40 members, including life trustees, have given more than $1 million in addition to their required annual gifts.But others say the reluctance of potential donors to respond publicly to Mr. Broad’s offer of matching money stems from a lack of confidence in the museum’s stewardship.Meanwhile, his rescue plan has stirred concern that Mr. Broad will try to call the shots at the Museum of Contemporary Art, as he did while a trustee there in the 1980s, before a rift led to his departure. Some potential donors have said privately that his role as a major benefactor of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art would give him too much power if he were to lead the rescue of the Museum of Contemporary Art.In an interview this week, Mr. Broad offered details of his plan, saying he would give the museum $15 million in installments equal to however much the museum raised, plus $3 million a year for five years to pay for operations and exhibitions.Mr. Broad has also said privately that he favors a management change, according to people who have been part of the discussions. Although the museum does not receive direct city financing, its main buildings were financed by or leased from the city. Eric Garcetti, who as president of the Los Angeles City Council is a nonvoting member of the museum’s board, said, “There does seem to be a consensus forming that new leadership should be brought in to run the museum, that the board should be reinvigorated and there should be a paring down of the budget.”“I believe,” Mr. Garcetti said, “that the public deserves more reassurance that an institution that the public helped fund will be held to a higher standard.”'"
"'08-12-05,'1','“Would you consider the biggest depression we have had in this country since 1929 to be such an event? I would,” he said in an interview. “A depression is not within the control of the borrower.”He wants a state judge in the Queens borough of New York to order the bank to delay efforts to collect the loan until “a reasonable time” after the financial crisis ends.Deutsche Bank thinks the idea that an economic downturn should free people from the obligation to pay their debts is laughable.Mr. Trump, it may be noted, does not think remorseful condominium buyers are in a similar position. When I asked him if he would let them walk away from contracts to buy apartments at predepression prices, he said he would not. “They don’t have a force majeure clause,” he said.The suit, and a parallel one by Deutsche Bank seeking the money, provide a glimpse into both how Mr. Trump does business and into the way the real estate loan market was operating in 2005, when the loan was made.For this big project, built on the site of the old Chicago Sun-Times building, it appears from the court papers that Mr. Trump put in little of his own money. He got a construction loan for up to $640 million from a syndicate headed by Deutsche Bank and a $130 million junior loan from another syndicate headed by Fortress Investments, a hedge fund operator that has troubles stemming in part from bad loans made for other real estate projects.The people who negotiated the construction loan did not think real estate prices could tumble. The loan agreement requires partial repayment each time an apartment is sold and provides a detailed list of the minimum prices to be charged.According to Mr. Trump’s suit, he cannot cut prices without the unanimous consent of the lenders, and that has not been forthcoming. There are a lot of lenders in the deal, and some of them appear to be banks and hedge funds that are no longer in good shape.The loan was due Nov. 7, and the lenders did not grant a requested extension. Mr. Trump filed his lawsuit just before that deadline.Mr. Trump sees a dark conspiracy. He says Deutsche Bank, through a subsidiary, owns $30 million of the junior loan, and he says that is a blatant conflict of interest because in some cases the interests of the two loans can differ. To Mr. Trump, the bank’s actions suggest it is trying to seize the building just before its great success is assured.The bank responds that the loan agreement makes clear that it has a right to do everything it has done, and that Mr. Trump should live up to his obligations, paying $40 million of the $334 million outstanding balance on the construction loan. The rest is owed by the Trump-controlled company sponsoring the project but is not personally guaranteed by him.If Mr. Trump was forced to pay the $40 million, he would be unlikely to permanently lose it, since his company would owe it to him. If the project went under, his claim would rank higher than the Fortress loan. Deutsche will make nothing from its investment in the junior loan if Mr. Trump does lose any money.Some sort of settlement seems wise. It is in everyone’s interest that construction be completed, and in fact the bank advanced $13 million to pay contractors’ bills this week.Mr. Trump has not said by how much he thinks the apartments are overpriced, and he did not tell me. But it seems unlikely that sales will be very good until prices are cut.In his suit, Mr. Trump claims that the bank’s “predatory lending practices” are harming his reputation, “which is associated worldwide with on-time, under-budget, first-class construction projects and first-class luxury hotel operations.”The bank seized on the opportunity to discuss Mr. Trump’s reputation. “Trump is no stranger to overdue debt,” it said in asking that his suit be thrown out of court. It noted that Mr. Trump’s casino operations have filed for bankruptcy twice, adding, “This suit is classic Trump.”The bank did not discuss why that history did not dissuade it from making the loan. One explanation might be that the fees it got for arranging the loan more than offset the risk from the small part of the loan it kept on its own books.Mr. Trump is vigilant in protecting his reputation. After I interviewed him and two associates, his general counsel sent me a note saying “it was a pleasure” talking to me, and adding: “Please be assured that if your article is not factually correct, we will have no choice but to sue you and The New York Times.”The Friday after Thanksgiving was not a really good one for Mr. Trump. Trump Entertainment Resorts, the casino company, announced it would miss an interest payment on its bonds, raising the likelihood of a third bankruptcy. Most of the shares are publicly owned, having been distributed to creditors in the last bankruptcy. They have fallen from a peak of $23.80 two years ago to 24 cents on Thursday.Mr. Trump is doing his best to sound like that is not important to him. The casino company’s announcement emphasized that Mr. Trump was the “nonexecutive chairman” who was “not involved in the daily operations” of the company. He told me that “less than 1 percent of my net worth” is in the casino company.At the current price, no shareholder could have a large net worth in that stock.On the same day, in New York, Deutsche Bank asked a judge to issue a summary judgment requiring Mr. Trump to pay the $40 million.In that filing, the bank quoted from a best-selling book Mr. Trump wrote last year, “Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and Life.” In it, the developer said he loved “to crush the other side and take the benefits” and mocked the banks that had lost money on loans made to him before another real estate downturn, in the 1990s:“I figured it was the bank’s problem, not mine. What the hell did I care? I actually told one bank, ‘I told you you shouldn’t have loaned me that money. I told you the goddamn deal was no good.’ ”If Mr. Trump manages to persuade a judge that the current crisis provides him with a good reason not to meet his obligations, he will have some great tales to tell in his next book.'"
"'08-12-05,'1','In “How to Publish Without Perishing” (Op-Ed, Nov. 30), James Gleick accurately describes the difficulties the publishing industry confronts. But he may be a bit shortsighted when he concludes, “Go back to an old-fashioned idea: that a book, printed in ink on durable paper, acid-free for longevity, is a thing of beauty.”Just as music can be downloaded into computers, so can words and pictures. Soon we will have devices with many blank “pages” that look and feel like a book, which will be “filled up” by purchasing a digital download. Readers will have the experience they have grown accustomed to, or something close to it, as the book enters the modern age.The writer was publisher of Citadel Press, University Books, Lyle Stuart and Birch Lane Press.James Gleick underestimates the utility of this “ancient technology” as a storage device.Unlike computers, books require no energy at all. One does not need to plug in the original edition of Milton’s “Paradise Lost” (1667) or Thomas More’s “Utopia” (1516) to read them. The book is not only efficient, but the ultimate in green technology as well. It is even biodegradable.Second, the technology required to retrieve the data stored in books (that is, our brains and reading) does not change, whereas one must constantly update digital storage devices. For example, data stored on zip drives or data stored using a defunct program can be accessed with great difficulty, if at all.'"
"'08-12-05,'1','Mr. Lu, a computer scientist with a Ph.D. and a former I.B.M. researcher who holds 20 patents, left Yahoo in August after 10 years there.

Microsoft declined to make an executive available to discuss the appointment of Mr. Lu.Mr. Ballmer reiterated recently that Microsoft was no longer interested in acquiring Yahoo but said that it remained open to a search advertising partnership between the companies. He also said that there were no active talks between the companies.On Thursday, a Microsoft spokesman, Frank Shaw, said: “There is nothing new with regard to Yahoo.”Mr. Squali said that if Microsoft and Yahoo struck a search deal, Mr. Lu’s knowledge of Yahoo’s operations could be important to Microsoft. “It will make the prospects of any integration that much easier,” he said.But Mr. Squali added that short of such a deal, Microsoft would continue to struggle to build a sizable audience for its search service.A continuing exodus of executives has depleted Yahoo’s management ranks. Many of the departures were prompted by Yahoo’s struggles to turn around its business and frustration with the slow pace of change. Jerry Yang, the chief executive, announced last month that he would step down as soon as the board appointed a successor.Last month, Microsoft hired another Yahoo search executive, Sean Suchter, to run its Silicon Valley search technology group.Microsoft said Mr. McAndrews agreed to remain in a “consultative capacity” to Mr. Lu and Mr. Ballmer for the next several months. Scott Howe will oversee Microsoft’s advertiser and publisher solutions business, previously headed by Mr. McAndrews.Mr. Johnson was also in charge of Microsoft’s Windows operating system business. He left Microsoft in July to become chief executive of the networking technology maker Juniper Networks.'"
"'08-12-05,'1','NASA has pushed back the launching of its next ambitious Mars mission by two years because of lengthening delays and lingering technical issues, agency officials announced Thursday.The Mars Science Laboratory, a S.U.V.-size rover that is to explore the Martian surface for two years, is now set to be launched in 2011. It had been scheduled to lift off in September or October next year and arrive at Mars in 2010. With unsolved issues with some of the spacecraft’s electrical motors, however, NASA officials no longer thought they could meet that schedule without rushing the testing program.“We’ve determined that trying for ‘09 would require us to assume too much risk, more than I think is appropriate for a flagship mission like Mars Science Laboratory,” Michael D. Griffin, NASA’s administrator, said at a news conference Thursday.Because the Earth and Mars come close to each other only once every 26 months, the next chance for launching is not until fall 2011.The delay comes at considerable cost. Originally approved at a cost of $1.63 billion in August 2006, the Mars Science Laboratory’s budget has already swelled to $1.88 billion, and NASA officials said in October that they anticipated the mission needed another $200 million next year to meet the 2009 launch date.'"
"'08-12-05,'1','Starbucks warned Wall Street on Thursday that its profit would fall short of analysts’ expectations this quarter, just hours after the chief executive, Howard Schultz, tried to assuage concerns about the recession’s effect on the retailer’s sales and profit.The chief financial officer, Troy Alstead, said that same-store sales deteriorated by 9 percent in the United States since the company’s fiscal first quarter began at the end of September. In its fiscal fourth quarter, the company reported a decline of 8 percent in the United States — a drop that many investors had hoped would be the company’s steepest.Sales have been particularly dismal in those states hardest hit by foreclosures, most notably in California and Florida, which make up about 30 percent of the company’s store base.The comments came during an analyst conference that began with Mr. Schultz trying to curb anxiety on Wall Street about the chain’s sliding sales and profit.He said he had confidence that “when, not if, this environment does get better that Starbucks is going to be a stronger company for having gone through it.”'"
"'08-12-05,'1','In a sign, however, that Russia might be ready to put past antipathy aside to cooperate with the incoming Obama administration, he pulled back from the harsh criticism of the United States that has peppered his similar performances.“We are really counting on this being a positive change,” he said, adding that “positive signals” had been coming from President-elect Barack Obama and his team. “If these are not simply words, if they are transformed into practical policies, then, of course, our reaction will be adequate, and our American partners will immediately notice this.”Mr. Putin was less accommodating of Ukraine and Georgia, two former Soviet republics that have become staunch foes of Moscow.He praised NATO’s decision this week to put off granting Ukraine and Georgia a concrete time frame for joining the alliance.He said Russia would continue to insist that Ukraine pay back some $2.4 billion in debt on Russian natural gas shipments, and did not rule out a cut in supply if Ukraine failed to comply.And Mr. Putin again blamed Georgia for starting the war with Russia in August. He said Georgia’s leaders were responsible for effectively losing two Georgian separatist enclaves, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, at the heart of the Russia-Georgia conflict.Most of the 70 or so questions Mr. Putin answered during the call-in program focused on domestic issues, and the prime minister spent much of the time trying to remain positive on the country’s flagging economy.“We have a very good chance of passing through this difficult period, I repeat, a difficult period, but one with minimal costs for the economy, and, most importantly, for our people,” he said.Mr. Putin said pensions would grow by 34 percent next year, and made guarantees that salaries and other benefits would remain stable. He also said the government would move forward with plans to reform education, health care and housing.Still, Russia has been hit hard by the economic crisis, particularly because of plummeting oil prices. The country relies heavily on revenue from energy resources, and Mr. Putin has been criticized for a failure to adopt policies that would have allowed for economic diversification.The worry was palpable in the questions submitted to Mr. Putin, a fraction of more than two million sent in via the Internet, telephone, text message and live video feed.The first question came from a metals worker who recently lost his job. The worker, from a village in central Russia, worried about how he and others like him would support their families.Mr. Putin vowed to increase unemployment benefits, and said he was working with regional governments on a number of measures to try “to save jobs where it is possible to do so.”“I still hope that we won’t have mass unemployment, but the number of people temporarily losing their jobs will definitely rise,” Mr. Putin said later in the broadcast.The broadcast was Mr. Putin’s first as prime minister, and his decision to preside over it, rather than defer to the current president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, had fueled already buzzing speculation that he might seek to return to his old post before the current presidential term expires in 2012.In a news conference later on Thursday, Mr. Putin denied that early presidential elections would be held, but did not rule out possibly running for president after Mr. Medvedev’s term is up, according to the Itar-Tass news agency. “The next elections of the Russian Federation are in 2012,” he said, according to the Russian government Web site. “We will live until that time and see what happens.”'"

"'08-12-05,'1','Merck & Company forecast 2009 earnings and revenue below Wall Street expectations on Thursday, citing a harsh impact from the stronger dollar and continuing sluggish sales of several big medicines.The drug maker, whose shares fell 4 percent in morning trading, projected flat or little 2009 growth for sales of three major products: the asthma medicine Singulair, the blood-pressure drug Cozaar and the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil.“It is possible that, as in the past, this is intentionally conservative initial guidance that will be revised upwards through the year but we cannot be certain,” a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, Tim Anderson, said in a research note. Between foreign exchange rates and several struggling franchises,” he said, “the company does face significant headwinds in ’09 and possibly beyond.”Merck’s chief financial officer, Peter Kellogg, also told analysts in a conference call that he expected combined global sales of its Vytorin and Zetia cholesterol fighters, which Merck sells in partnership with Schering-Plough, to fall next year because of flagging United States demand.On the positive side, Merck projected strong growth for its relatively new Januvia diabetes franchise, as well as for its HIV drug Isentress and shingles vaccine Zostavax. The company also expects to seek approval next year for two new medicines for migraines and acute heart failure.'"
"'08-12-05,'1','HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank, said Monday that it would cut 500 jobs at its British banking business, and Standard Chartered, a British bank that makes most of its profit in Asia, announced 200 cuts in Hong Kong.Credit Suisse plans to abandon certain proprietary and principal trading activities and said the job cuts, which will be made in the first half of next year, would reduce costs by 2 billion Swiss francs, or $1.7 billion. Investment banking will remain a “valuable contributor to the integrated bank” but will be less volatile and risky, the Zurich-based bank said.The staff reductions, which include 650 job cuts in London that were reported this week, will bring the number of employees in Credit Suisse’s investment banking business to 2005 levels, the chief executive, Brady W. Dougan, said in a conference call.“These actions will better position us to weather the continuing challenging market conditions, capture opportunities that arise amid the continuing disruption and prosper when markets improve,” Mr. Dougan said.Mr. Dougan, along with Walter Kielholz, the bank’s chairman, and Paul Calello, head of its investment bank, will forgo bonuses for this year after the bank lost about 3 billion francs in October and November and the investment banking unit had a “significant” pretax loss. The private banking division bucked the trend and attracted “solid” asset inflows, the bank said.Credit Suisse shares initially fell on the news, but closed 10.11 percent higher in Zurich on Thursday. Shares of its rival UBS, which announced about 9,000 job cuts earlier and had to seek government help to cope with its exposure to the subprime mortgage market, closed up 5.31 percent.When Nomura, the Japanese bank, took on about 2,500 Lehman employees in Europe in September, it said it expected to avoid job cuts, but on Thursday it said about one-fifth of its London work force would have to leave, including some former Lehman employees, as the costs of taking on the new businesses rose.The job cuts in financial services centers like London have already started to affect other industries, including the leisure, luxury goods and housing sectors. Luxury home prices in London are expected to decline 14 percent next year after a similar drop this year, according to the real estate adviser Savills. London may lose as many as 62,000 financial jobs by the end of 2009, and bonuses for this year may drop by 60 percent, to £3.6 billion, the Center for Economics and Business Research said.'"
"'08-12-05,'1','BANGKOK — King Bhumibol Adulyadej did not appear Thursday to deliver his traditional birthday address, though many of his subjects had been waiting for his calming words at this highly charged political moment.On Wednesday, a court disbanded the country’s governing party and barred many of its leaders from politics and also two smaller coalition parties, while the parties’ opponents ended their blockade of the capital’s airports. Still, the possibility of a violent confrontation remained.In remarks broadcast from a ceremonial hall, Crown Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn said the king, who turns 81 on Friday, was receiving medical attention for a throat infection.“Yesterday when I saw him he looked O.K.,” she said. “He could eat what we served him, but today he had a throat infection so he could barely eat. Therefore, the doctors prescribed him medicine and put him on a saline drip.”The king, whose moral influence overrides the temporal power of politicians and generals, has intervened in the past at critical moments to avert bloodshed. There had been hope that he could somehow reconcile the dangerous political and social divide that has recently deepened, as populist forces loyal to the ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra try to retain their hold on power in the face of deepening disquiet among Thailand’s elite and middle class. Some analysts said the complexities of the political fractures might have convinced the king that silence was the best approach.'"

"'08-12-06,'0','Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, a Romanian dissident who spent many years in prison during the Communist era and later led the fight to open the files of the Securitate, the feared secret police, died Friday in Bucharest, the capital. He was 80.His death was reported by Agerpres, the Romanian national news agency, which said he had been released from a hospital two weeks ago after being treated for liver disease.“We have lost one of the most powerful voices against Communism,” Traian Basescu, the president of Romania, said in a statement, adding that Mr. Dumitrescu was “one who remained upright and dignified during thousands of days of prison and interrogation.”Mr. Dumitrescu (pronounced doo-ma-TRES-koo), a lawyer, was declared an “enemy of the state” in 1949 and sentenced to 27 years in prison for his role as a member of National Peasants’ Party, which opposed Communist rule. He was held in jail or under house arrest until 1964. He was barred from legal practice after his release and worked for many years in construction.Nicolae Ceausescu, the Communist dictator, was deposed and executed in 1989, ending 24 years of iron-fisted rule. Soon after, Mr. Dumitrescu was elected to Parliament as a senator.'"
"'08-12-06,'0','“I used to say that all the decisions in Atlanta were made between 6:30 and 8 in the morning, and they were made at Paschal’s,” Mr. Young said. “Any politician in Atlanta who wanted to get elected needed the black vote, and the best place to get it was Paschal’s.”Over the years, Paschal’s expanded and evolved, to the perpetual concern of loyalists. The speakeasy atmosphere yielded to an upscale, white-linen setting. Its signature elbow-to-elbow seating was replaced with spacious but less conversation-friendly tables. And in 2002, the restaurant changed locations, abandoning the one at 530 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, which became part of Clark Atlanta University, for a vaulted building several blocks away. (It also has two outposts at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport for travelers needing a soul food fix.)“It used to be the kind of place where everybody talked,” said Curtis Paschal, the son of Mr. Paschal and an executive at the company that owns the restaurant. “A politician could sit and have a coffee with a local artist. A Ph.D. in physics could sit down with the local numbers guy and discuss theoretical physics.”Mr. Lewis ate his first meal in Atlanta at Paschal’s, in 1963, but feels less attachment to the new location. “The new place just doesn’t have the same feeling,” he said. “It’s much more sophisticated and contemporary.”On a recent afternoon, Charles Releford Jr., a chief of staff in the Fulton County government, returned to Paschal’s for the food he has been having for the last 40 years: fried chicken, collard greens and macaroni and cheese. “When you come here, you always see everyone you know,” Mr. Releford said. “It’s not just people from Atlanta either. When friends from New York come to town, they always just say, ‘I’ll meet you at Paschal’s.’ ”The restaurant’s clientele once included members of the King family, Julian Bond, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery and Maynard Jackson. An adjacent jazz club, La Carrousel, also run by the Paschals, drew performances by Aretha Franklin, Dizzy Gillespie, Ramsey Lewis, Lena Horne, Cannonball Adderley and Joe Williams.Even in the 1950s, the restaurant seated white and black patrons together, a daring violation of segregation laws in Atlanta. At La Carrousel, Connie Curry, the first white woman on the executive committee of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, enjoyed her first dance with a black man.Mr. Paschal’s funeral service, at Morehouse University’s chapel, attracted more than 500 people. Overlooking a coffin draped in red roses and lined with poinsettias, a parade of civil rights veterans paid effusive tributes to the restaurant.To shouts of “Amen” and “Oh, yes,” they told how Mr. Paschal, the son of a sharecropper, became a millionaire without forgetting his roots or his community. They described his patience, the little bow of his head that he gave every customer as he went table to table asking about the service.“He provided the place where we could meet, strategize and plan to go to jail,” said the Rev. Timothy McDonald, the former president of the Concerned Black Clergy.The restaurant was also a place to calm frayed nerves after arrests, death threats and beatings. “You’d leave the front lines of the movement, in South Georgia or Alabama,” Mr. Lewis said, “and when you made it to Paschal’s you were safe.”But Mr. Paschal was also a businessman, interested in profit as well as social progress.“He’d always say, ‘I don’t just want y’all to meet in here,’ ” Mr. McDonald recalled. “ ‘I want y’all to eat in here, too.’ ”'"
"'08-12-06,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — The Defense Department said Friday that it had shot down a missile in a simulated attack designed to test a proposed shield against strikes by long-range ballistic missiles.The Missile Defense Agency at the Pentagon used an interceptor missile launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to strike a missile that had been fired to simulate the speed and trajectory of a missile from North Korea. The interceptor struck the missile on Friday shortly after the target was launched from a site in Alaska.In the past several years, the military has conducted tests of the different components of the defensive shield, which is scheduled to include Patriot air defense batteries, antiballistic missiles launched from Navy ships and lasers mounted on planes.The Friday test, which cost $120 million to $150 million, incorporated many of the network’s systems. The Navy, for example, tracked the target from one of its ships but did not fire.“It was the largest, most complex test we have ever done,” said Lt. Gen. Patrick O’Reilly, director of the Missile Defense Agency.'"
"'08-12-06,'0','On the final day of the Fall North American Championships in Boston last Sunday, the Bill Keohane North American Swiss Teams title was captured by Carolyn Lynch of Scottsdale, Ariz.; Mike Passell and Curtis Cheek of Las Vegas; Joe Grue of New York; Bart Bramley of Dallas; and Eddie Wold of Houston. This was Lynch’s first national title, and it was all the more impressive because the team led after each of the three days.Wold (East) found a great defensive play to obtain a flat board in the diagramed deal against a top Polish pair, Piotr Tuszynski (North) and Apolinary Kowalski (South), who finished in eighth place with Melanie Tucker, Erez Hendelman and Melih Ozdil of New York, and Mark Lair of Canyon, Tex.About his three-club opening, Bramley (West) observed in an e-mail message, “I chose a modern sick pre-empt; sometimes I do and sometimes I don’t.”South, in answer to Roman Key Card Blackwood, showed first one key card (an ace or the heart king), then the heart queen and one side-suit king. After East doubled the six-club grand-slam-try for the lead, South signed off in six hearts.After West led the club ten, Declarer won with dummy’s ace, and East smoothly played his king.South now planned the play on the assumption that this was a singleton king. He cashed dummy’s heart ace, played a heart to his queen, took the spade ace, led a spade to dummy’s king, ruffed a spade in his hand and played a trump to dummy to give this position:South confidently called for a spade and discarded a club from his hand. He thought East would be forced to lead a diamond into dummy’s ace-jack, so that declarer would take the last five tricks with dummy’s spade jack, his heart ten and three diamonds. Wold, however, produced the club deuce out of his pocket for down one.South should have conceded a club trick after taking the first spade ruff. Then he could have used a club ruff with the heart king to reach the dummy for a second spade ruff. He would have drawn East’s last trump, crossed to dummy with a diamond and discarded a diamond on the spade jack.'"
"'08-12-06,'0','Gubernatorial portraits received a spike in attention this week. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Mr. Pataki’s predecessor, the three-term Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, has thus far refused to sit for his official portrait.Encased in a gold frame, Mr. Pataki is pictured from-the-knees-up, standing in a navy suit and a patriotic tie, with United States and state flags in his lapel. One hand is in his pocket, and his face, of course, has that habitual off-kilter smile. He looks off into the distance; the Hudson River unfolds behind him as the hills rise in the distance.“The portrait is very indicative of George Pataki, his casual manner, his style of living; he’s on the front porch standing tall,” said Charles A. Gargano, who wore multiple hats during Mr. Pataki’s administration.Mr. Lattimore said that he wanted to portray Mr. Pataki “looking to the left and towards the sun.”“The light, the future, he’s looking towards the warmth and hope of what tomorrow can bring,” the artist explained.The artist’s online gallery has a collection of still lifes and nudes, but when asked if Mr. Pataki had requested a nude portrait, a look of alarm crossed Mr. Lattimore’s face.“I wanted that, but after seeing me in my underwear he rejected that,” Mr. Pataki said. “I’m kidding,” he quickly added.Mr. Pataki, 63, sat, or rather stood, for Mr. Lattimore on several occasions. The first sitting, he erred on the casual side: “I thought about a coat and tie and jeans, but cooler heads prevailed.”“I wish everybody was that easy to work with,” said Mr. Lattimore, who has known the governor for more than a decade. Mr. Pataki said working with Mr. Lattimore was vastly different from posing for his wax likeness for Madame Tussaud’s in 2000. “You don’t pose. They measure you with calipers, you have to give your own clothes,” he said.On the ninth floor of Tussaud’s, Mr. Pataki looms over former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani near an exhibit commemorating 9/11. (A wax Cuomo is absent there as well.) Mr. Pataki’s wax figure was recently sent out for day’s cleaning: hair wash, dry clean and touch-ups.Mr. Pataki’s portrait will hang in Peekskill until a date is found for it to be added to the hall, which predictions say may happen by summer.Mr. Pataki doesn’t hazard a guess as to whether Mr. Cuomo will add his mug to the hall. “I’m sure when he deems it appropriate, he’ll do it,” he said, slipping into what he referred to as “governor-speak.”'"
"'08-12-06,'0','North Dakota’s cheery circumstance — which economic analysts are quick to warn is showing clear signs that it, too, may be in jeopardy — can be explained by an odd collection of factors: a recent surge in oil production that catapulted the state to fifth-largest producer in the nation; a mostly strong year for farmers (agriculture is the state’s biggest business); and a conservative, steady, never-fancy culture that has nurtured fewer sudden booms of wealth like those seen elsewhere (“Our banks don’t do those goofy loans,” Mr. Theel said) and also fewer tumultuous slumps.As it happens, one of the state’s biggest worries right now is precisely the reverse of most other states: North Dakota has about 13,000 unfilled jobs and is struggling to find people to take them.“We could use more people with skills for some of these jobs,” Marty Aas, who leads the Fargo branch of the state’s Job Service North Dakota, said as his offices — where the unemployed might come for help — sat quiet and nearly empty. State employees outnumbered the six clients on a recent afternoon. (Mr. Aas insisted that such a slow afternoon was rare.)State officials and private companies have begun looking elsewhere to recruit workers, including traveling in October to Michigan, where tens of thousands of workers have been laid off, and, this month, holding an “online job fair,” anything to lure people to a place that is, at least for now, removed from the deep financial dismay — if also just plain removed.“Our problem is that everybody thinks that it’s a cold, miserable place to live,” said Bob Stenehjem, a Republican and the State Senate’s majority leader. “They’re wrong, of course. But North Dakota is a pretty well-kept secret.”With 635,867 residents, North Dakota is among the least populous states, and, in the past few years, more people have moved away, census figures show, than have moved here.Katie Hasbargen, a spokeswoman for Microsoft’s Fargo campus, which is in the middle of a $70 million or so building expansion and is, even now, looking for a few additions to its work force (of more than 1,500), said false perceptions of the state are the problem when it comes to recruiting workers. “The movie,” Ms. Hasbargen said, referring to the 1996 Coen brothers’ film that bears this city’s name, “didn’t do us a lot of favors.”On a recent evening, as the night shift arrived at DMI Industries, where 383 workers (an all-time high) weld gigantic towers for wind turbines and where a $20 million expansion is under way, Phillip Christiansen, the general manager, wandered the plant, noting those who had been recruited from elsewhere — three from Michigan not long ago, another from Louisiana. “It’s very competitive around here trying to find people,” he said. “In this environment, it’s a little hard.”Not that people are complaining much. Downtown, in the line of gift shops along Broadway, where shop owners reported sales that were healthy (though always sensible), residents said they were pleased — if a tad guilty — about the state’s relative good fortune.No one was gloating. No wild spending sprees were apparent. No matter how well things seemed to be going, many said they were girding, in well-practiced Midwestern style, for the worst.“You’re always a little worried,” Mr. Christiansen admitted. “You get a tickle at the pit of your stomach.”In truth, economic analysts said North Dakota has already begun showing some of the painful ripples seen elsewhere. Some manufacturing companies here have lately made temporary job cuts as orders for products have dropped nationally. Shrinking 401(k)’s — “201(k)’s,” some here grump — are no bigger here than anywhere else. And, most of all, drops in oil prices and farm commodity prices are sure to sink local fortunes, experts said.An economist at Moody’s Economy.com recently warned that conditions in North Dakota had “slowed measurably in recent months, and the state is now at risk of being dragged into recession.” In an interview, Glenn Wingard, the economist, described North Dakota as “an outlier” up to now in a broad, national slump.“It’s not going to hold,” Mr. Wingard said, suggesting that the state would now probably have to suffer through a reversal, or at least, a slowdown, much like other places that benefited from rising fortunes tied to energy, high oil prices and booming farm commodity prices.Still, Ernie Goss, an economist at Creighton University in Omaha, who conducts a regular survey of economic conditions in nine states through the nation’s middle, found North Dakota to be the only one expected to experience an expanding economy over the next three to six months. “This will hit North Dakota,” Dr. Goss said of the recession, “I just don’t think it’ll ever be as significant.”Just as state officials in Minnesota — due east of here — this week revealed a staggering $5.2 billion deficit, Gov. John Hoeven of North Dakota gathered with lawmakers at the State Capitol to talk, in part, about the $1.2 billion budget surplus — the result, in part, of increased revenues from oil, and a sum that is all the more astonishing given the size of the state’s total budget, $7.7 billion over the next two years.Mr. Hoeven, a Republican whose party controls both chambers of the state legislature and who was re-elected last month with more than 70 percent of the vote, offered proposals few other states are likely to hear this year: $400 million in property and income tax relief, $130 million more for kindergarten through 12th-grade education, 5 percent raises for state workers, $18 million for expansion of a state heritage center, and so on.The surplus, several lawmakers asserted, will actually make their jobs and choices far more complicated.“Now that there is money,” said State Senator David O’Connell, a Democrat and the party’s minority leader, “I could go to three meetings a day with people who will say they want more money or want a one-time spending package or something.”Mr. Stenehjem, who likewise complained that “when you have $1.2 billion sitting around, there’s about 50 billion ideas of what to spend it on,” quickly noted that there were worse budget problems to have.“Don’t get me wrong,” he said. “I would rather deal with this.“Prudence is important at this point,” Mr. Stenehjem, a lifelong North Dakotan, went on. “North Dakota never gets as good as the rest of the country or as bad as the rest of the country, and that’s fine with us.”'"

"'08-12-06,'0','Need a vacation from watching your stocks drop?Hoping to lure travelers as the economy slumps, a resort chain in the Caribbean is offering to trade rooms for depressed stock.Elite Island Resorts, a chain of upscale hotels — including the St. James’s Club on Antigua and the Palm Island Resort in the Grenadines — announced Friday that it would accept payments in stock for vacations booked by Jan. 31, using the value the stock was trading at on July 1. The deal, in effect, gives travelers a chance to roll back the value of currently depressed stocks to levels before the market began to really sink.“Things are so quiet you have to do things out of the box,” said Steven E. Heydt, president of Elite Island Resorts, who concocted the idea. “I’ve been thinking about what could I do to turn things around and somehow relate to the overall economy and the stock market declines.”Here’s how the promotion works: An all-inclusive seven-night stay for a family of four begins at $4,445 based on a nightly rate of $635 at the Verandah Resort and Spa in Antigua. A traveler with American Express stock, which closed at $21.78 Friday, would need about 111 shares for the trip, with Elite Island Resorts valuing the stock at $40 a share or approximately what it was trading for on July 1.Merrill Lynch stock is even better. It closed at $13.04 Friday, down from $32.25 on July 1.The deal is good for vacations through mid-December of next year, with no blackout dates. So travelers can use stock for payment even during peak holiday travel periods like Christmas, New Year’s or Easter, as long as space is available.

"'08-12-06,'0','Introducing a bill does not guarantee its passage, but it does indicate that the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, is preparing for the possibility that it may be approved. And given the urgency of the city’s budget problems, and the abbreviated calendar, council members and city officials are now expressing guarded optimism that a broader agreement on budget adjustments — program cuts, tax increases and other measures — may be imminent.“It’s like the weather,” said Mr. Fidler, who opposes the property tax measure. “The forecast may say it’ll snow on Saturday, and when you start to see flurries on Friday, there’s a good chance that it will snow on Saturday, but it’s not a certainty.”The prospect of higher taxes has been part of a broader package of belt-tightening measures put forth by Mr. Bloomberg in the last month.One of the most controversial has been Mr. Bloomberg’s idea of withholding a $400 property tax rebate that homeowners have come to expect every October for the last four years.Mr. Bloomberg angered some council members in November when he said that the city would not send out the checks because it could not afford the $256 million cost.Later, the city acknowledged that it was legally required to send out the checks by June, but said it was not obligated to do so any earlier.But in recent days, council members and city officials have privately expressed growing hope that the checks may indeed be mailed out, if not in time for Hanukkah or Christmas, then shortly thereafter.“Logistically, it might be physically too difficult to get the checks out by Christmas,” said Councilman David I. Weprin of Queens, who is chairman of the Finance Committee. “But as long as we can tell people by Christmas that they’re getting their checks, so they can plan ahead, a week or two later might be O.K.”Council members have warmed to one Bloomberg proposal, to allow property tax payments to be made in four payments a year rather than two, as easing the pain of any increase that might occur.When asked about the bills, Marc LaVorgna, a Bloomberg spokesman, said, “We have ongoing discussions with the City Council on what the city needs to do to deal with the financial crisis.”Jamie McShane, a spokesman for Ms. Quinn, declined to comment on the bills themselves. But he said that in her view, “sending out the property tax rebate checks is critical to moving the discussion forward.”For his part, Mr. Weprin said that he had been encouraged by the tenor and substance of discussions, citing recent talks over hundreds of millions of dollars worth of alternative cuts proposed by the Council.“They recognize a lot of this staff is a heavy lift, and there’s no time for the normal gamesmanship when the budget process plays out over three, four months,” he said. “So I’m pretty confident that we’re going to reach an agreement relatively soon.”'"
"'08-12-06,'0','The academy owns more than 7,000 works, most of which have never been publicly shown.Ms. Branagan also argued that the academy, founded and long known as the National Academy of Design, has never functioned as a traditional museum — it does not buy works of art but acquires them only through donations — and should not be considered as such by the museum directors association, from which the academy recently withdrew.If not for the sale, she said, “the academy would close — and that is an honest and sincere statement.”“There are vendors who have not been paid,” Ms. Branagan added.The sale was reported early on Friday by Lee Rosenbaum, a blogger at artsjournal.com.Last year the academy’s members voted against a proposal to sell the institution’s six-story mansion at Fifth Avenue and 89th Street, which has been its home since 1942. They then began discussing the possibility of selling art that was not so-called diploma works, those created by the academy’s members and given to the institution when the members are inducted.Such works are the heart of the collection and would never be sold, Ms. Branagan said. Though Church and Gifford were both academy members, the two paintings that were sold were donated to the academy in 1865 by another painter, James Augustus Suydam.The sale was approved last month by a vote of 183 of the academy’s 370 members. Only one member voted against the sale, and another abstained.Ms. Branagan said that the deal had been arranged privately and that she did not know the identity or location of the buyer, only that it was “a private foundation that has agreed to hang the paintings publicly.”The membership also approved the sale of two other paintings, more minor works, but those are being held back for now because of the uncertain state of the art market.Ms. Branagan said the academy would start using the money to repair its operating budget and to begin renovations and painting conservation that it hopes will enable it to begin exhibiting much more of its collection in about two years. The academy also hopes to organize more exhibitions of American art borrowed from elsewhere, she said.“This institution has a role to play in the cultural life of New York City and the country,” Ms. Branagan said, adding that it wanted to be known “as a place to come to celebrate American art and American artists.”The sale is reminiscent of the New York Public Library’s decision in 2005 to sell “Kindred Spirits,” an 1849 masterpiece by Asher B. Durand — a founder of the National Academy — to raise money for its endowment. The Wal-Mart heiress Alice L. Walton bought the canvas for an estimated $35 million.The library was criticized for allowing that beloved Hudson River School painting to leave New York. It said in its defense that it was not a museum and that the sale of the painting — among 19 works deaccessioned from its collection — would help it focus on its mission of buying materials for its research libraries.'"
"'08-12-06,'0','Yvonne Leach, a spokeswoman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, declined to comment on the reports of the delay, adding Friday that she would neither confirm nor deny them.“We’re currently conducting the assessment and it’s not complete yet,” Ms. Leach said. Asked when any decision might be announced, she said: “We don’t have a firm date. We truly have not decided when we are going to announce.”She added that Boeing would try to notify customers and suppliers 24 hours in advance of a public announcement, although she said that any notification “could come earlier” than that.News of the possible delay was not unexpected. At first it caused Boeing’s shares to fall in early trading on Friday, but the stock recovered and closed at $39.53, up 34 cents. The shares have fallen by 55 percent since the beginning of the year, hurt by the Dreamliner delays, a two-month strike by machinists and the weakening stock market.“There has been a lot of buzz out there for some time about the 787,” said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies & Company. “So it is not a revelation that there will be delays with the 787. It’s been clear for a while that a slippage had developed.”The next-generation jet had faced a number of production setbacks, including the strike by 27,000 assembly workers that shut down Boeing’s commercial aircraft factories for two months earlier this fall. But the larger issues looming over the program are linked to an optimistic timetable promised by Boeing when it first announced the plane, and a series of complicated production problems that the company is seeking to fix.The Dreamliner, a midsize twin-engine plane, was an instant hit among airlines, which lined up to buy it because of its fuel-sipping engine and lightweight airframe, both of which save on fuel consumption and bills. Since then, however, engineering and production problems have presented one challenge after another.Many of these issues are chronicled in an internal study by Boeing’s main rival, Airbus. The study, titled “Boeing 787 Lessons Learnt,” was posted Wednesday on Flightblogger, a widely followed aviation Web site.The problems, some of which have been resolved, concern software glitches, the plane’s titanium wings and the use of low-wage foreign workers in other countries with little aerospace experience. There have been shortages of parts, especially fasteners, and the plane still remains overweight.“It is very easy not to get everything right,” Mr. Rubel said. “The human challenges in putting this together are beyond belief. What’s causing the delay? It’s just been a lot of little things.”Mr. Rubel added, however, that given the current slowdown in aviation, the fact that the Dreamliner is delayed may be a blessing in disguise because an on-time delivery would have added capacity in an airline system that already has too many planes.'"

"'08-12-06,'0','For the Americans, they include efforts to open China’s financial sector to United States securities firms and longstanding tensions over government control of the yuan, whose weakness against the dollar has contributed to a yawning trade gap between the two countries.For the Chinese, there were oblique criticisms that America’s profligate ways had sent the global economy into a tailspin and threatened China’s stability. Largely unspoken is the fact that the Chinese government has become the largest holder of United States Treasury securities, with about $600 billion of China’s savings invested in American debt.“The important reasons for the U.S. financial crisis include excessive consumption and high leverage,” Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of China’s central bank, said in a statement. “The United States should speed up domestic adjustment, raise its savings rate and reduce its trade and fiscal deficits.”Wang Qishan, China’s deputy prime minister, was more blunt: The United States, he said, should stabilize its economy as soon as possible to “ensure the safety of China’s assets and investments in the U.S.”In his public comments, Mr. Paulson was careful not to criticize the Chinese about their resistance to a currency overhaul, although at a time when both countries are grappling with enormous economic pressures, the yuan’s sudden 1 percent drop against the dollar Monday could not have helped lighten the mood.Although it is largely conjecture, some economists say China’s government is intentionally pushing down its currency, a move that would help Chinese exporters by lowering prices on goods they sell overseas. Others have suggested the downward swing the last week was aimed at warning the United States against pushing China too hard on trade, currency and other economic issues.Mr. Paulson would not take the bait offered by reporters, saying that China had made strides on the currency question in recent years, although more progress was needed. “The Chinese understand, as do we, how important currency reform is to balanced growth in China,” he said.This will be Mr. Paulson’s fifth and final conference, and it remains to be seen whether the Obama administration will continue the meetings.Although Mr. Paulson started the talks partly as a way to soothe Congressional fury over the exchange-rate issue, the forum quickly became a catch-all venue for a range of issues frustrating American trade negotiators.In an interview after the conference, Mr. Paulson suggested that people should not judge the forum by bullet-point achievements but by its role in fostering economic dialogue between high-ranking officials in both governments.He said the meetings — which this year included Stephen L. Johnson, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator; Elaine L. Chao, the labor secretary; and Michael O. Leavitt, the health and human services secretary — had always been refreshingly candid. “People aren’t just making speeches to appeal to the other members of their team that are there,” he said.Sitting in an armchair and sipping a Diet Coke, Mr. Paulson made an appeal for the dialogue to continue. “This is something that works,” he said.'"

"'08-12-07,'0','It won’t necessarily be such a difficult choice. As in Hollywood, superstars drive the sports business, for reasons of talent and box-office appeal. The shock over how much money elite players make has gradually dissipated since salaries began soaring with the advent of free agency in the 1980s. It’s even arguable that the sports business is in a “post-money” era.Today’s fans — including a generation that has grown up managing fantasy-team payrolls — not only are inured to the fact that jocks make outlandish coin, they understand why and might even like it. “It makes superheroes a little more superhuman,” said Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College in Northampton, Mass. “That’s part of the allure of sports.”So big-city teams signing big-name players to lucrative contracts won’t prompt angry comparisons to the plight of the working class. “Money well deserved and well spent,” one fan posted on the Boston Red Sox message board “Sons of Sam Horn” last week after the team signed the 25-year-old second baseman Dustin Pedroia to a six-year, $40.5 million deal shortly after he was named the American League’s most valuable player. Sabathia, late of the Milwaukee Brewers, appears so unconcerned that the worsening economy will reduce his value that he has sat on the Yankees’ offer for three weeks while testing the market.In down times, teams need marquee players to give penny-pinching fans additional reasons to attend games and bolster the team’s bottom line. “You’re not going to see Matisse and Cézanne available at your local dollar store,” said Andy Dolich, chief operating officer of the San Francisco 49ers.In addition, club owners always want to win. “There’s enough ego and competitive instinct to make the big splash in free agency,” said Andrew Brandt, who managed the Green Bay Packers’ salary cap from 1999-2007. “The issue will become how dramatic a drop-off there will be beyond the top 5 or 10 players.”That’s where teams are likely to become more judicious. In sports where athletes enjoy guaranteed contracts — baseball, basketball and hockey — non-elite players are likely to see contract offers with fewer years and less money. More players could be forced to accept league-minimum salaries. Teams might be reluctant to release players or fire coaches still owed tens of millions of dollars.Fans ultimately might expect their favorite team to be fiscally responsible, if for no other reason than to mirror their own economic problems. But they won’t let owners use the recession as an excuse to scrimp on players. Last month, shortly after withdrawing a two-year, $45 million offer to Ramírez, the president of the Dodgers, Jamie McCourt, wondered aloud whether giving an athlete millions of dollars while average people were losing their jobs would be “a little weird.” She then mused whether Dodgers fans might prefer to see some of that money spent by the team on charitable work in the community.It’s a false choice, of course. Fans know that the labor marketplace dictates how much a player receives, and they are hip to how much teams are capable of spending. Indeed, the Dodgers last week offered Ramírez salary arbitration, which could obligate them to pay him as much as $30 million in 2009. (Ramírez has until midnight Sunday to accept or decline arbitration.) After her remarks were lambasted in the news media and among online commenters, Ms. McCourt said the Dodgers were committed to winning.Dodgers fans will believe it when they see it — the latter “it” being a string of zeros on the contract of a star. “I can do without the shallow, self-interested explanations on the appropriateness of spending free-agent dollars while companies go under,” the sports blogger Brian Kamenetzky wrote on the Web site of The Los Angeles Times. “Put the best product on the field you can afford, period.”'"
"'08-12-07,'0','That should be a warning to the Mets, who have shown interest in Rodríguez. They showered a big contract on Billy Wagner in 2006, only to lose him to an injury for the last year and a half of the deal.Even a healthy star closer can have only so much impact on a team. If a team’s top reliever is hurt, the manager can promote the club’s setup man — also a well-above-average pitcher — to closer, ensuring that he will still have a strong hurler working the ninth. A middle reliever then takes over the setup job, and a mop-up man becomes the new middle reliever, leaving the journeyman who replaces the closer on the roster to pitch exclusively in blowouts.As a result, a reliever with a 2.00 W.P.A. improves his bullpen’s aggregate performance by about 1.65 wins, which will be worth some $8 million on the current free-agent market if the recession does not stop salaries from increasing by their customary 10 percent a year.By contrast, if a team loses a starter with a 2.0 W.P.A. like Roy Oswalt, a journeyman replacement will be forced into the rotation. Since starting is more difficult than relieving, the substitute would probably post a negative W.P.A. of 2.0 to 2.5 in 200 innings, making Oswalt worth a total of 4.0 to 4.5 wins above his substitute. Assuming teams do not cut back their spending, that would merit an annual salary of $20 million or more.Kinzer can make two strong counterarguments on behalf of Rodríguez. First, most managers misuse their bullpens. According to data provided by Tom Tango, a co-author of “The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball,” a shrewd club could increase the value of an ace closer about 12 percent by eliminating his three-run saves and deploying him more often in tie games and in the eighth inning.Second, although closers may be of limited use in the regular season, they are critical assets in October. Rivera, for example, has pitched less than 5 percent of the Yankees’ regular-season innings, but more than 10 percent of those in the playoffs. As a result, the market for closers may be significantly different from the one for starters or position players.In general, because playoff series are short and unpredictable, general managers should focus on simply reaching the postseason, regarding everything that happens afterward as a crapshoot. This means that over all, free agents are most valuable to teams on the edge of contention.But ace relievers are an exception; their impact is far greater in getting a team from the division series to a championship than it is in securing a playoff berth to begin with. As a result, their contribution will be the greatest not for fringe contenders, but rather for clubs that are a strong bet to make the playoffs. That does not necessarily mean the best team over all, but rather the one that has the biggest gap between the quality of its roster and that of its closest competitors.One club in particular stands out as a strong team that lacks a top reliever in an otherwise weak division. Moreover, its penchant for low-scoring games means it can derive extra regular-season utility from a bullpen ace. It is Rodríguez’s current employer, the Los Angeles Angels, perhaps the only club that could pay him $8 million to $10 million a year and still make a profit. Sometimes, home cooking is the best recipe.'"
"'08-12-07,'0','The culture clash over helping the auto companies was less Main Street vs. Wall Street than it was the usual battles in Washington: White House vs. Congress, House vs. Senate, Democrat vs. Republican. Politics, timing and the broader economic circumstances also factored into the debates on Capitol Hill.While some have suggested that the American public was less sympathetic to the auto industry because more people than ever prefer to drive Toyotas and Hondas, lawmakers say that they actually heard much louder opposition from their constituents to the Wall Street bailout than to the rescue plan for the auto industry.By Friday afternoon, Representative John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky, had received roughly 700 calls about the automakers’ pleas for help, running 60-40 in favor of a taxpayer rescue, a spokesman, Stuart Perelmuter, said. In September, Mr. Yarmuth received thousands of calls about the $700 billion bailout, at first with 20 to one opposed, and then four to one against, after the House initially voted the plan down and stock markets plummeted.But the biggest difference, officials say, was that the case for the $700 billion was made to Congress directly by the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, two public officials, who testified that urgent Congressional action was needed to prevent a global economy cataclysm. And Congress did not have to pick and choose among the financial firms to help.“We authorized the program but the specific beneficiaries, the specific details were worked out by Treasury,” said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, adding that Chrysler, General Motors and Ford have had to make their own case for aid.“They are making the presentation themselves, not a public official who says we need a program to help these people, and in that sense it’s harder for them to get traction.”Mr. Reed, who favors a government rescue plan, said that if the individual financial firms had been forced to plead their case in the same way, Congress would have debated the merits of each request, just as the Treasury had to make separate decisions about Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, American International Group and Citigroup.And just as lawmakers questioned why the American automakers seemed to be so much worse off than their foreign-based counterparts, Mr. Reed said Congress would have raised similar questions about the financial firms.“They would have run into the same types of perceptions,” Mr. Reed said. “Why this company? What about the other companies in this industry?”The automakers also faced a much steeper climb because of their unfortunate timing, coming to Washington tin cup in hand during a post-election, lame duck session, and at a time when there is severe bailout fatigue on Capitol Hill.Unlike the financial system bailout, which was debated six weeks before a major election, with the entire membership of the House facing the voters’ judgment, there was not a similar level of political urgency, despite the projections by some experts that General Motors could collapse before year’s end.The awful November jobs report helped provide some of that urgency.In recent days, outrage among many Democrats over the Bush administration’s handling of the bigger bailout, fueled by a sharply critical report by the Government Accountability Office, only added to the reluctance to put taxpayer money on the line.Whether that reluctance can be overcome will be known when Congressional Democrats put the rescue package up for votes later this week.The White House flatly dismissed suggestions that it favored white-collar financial firms over the blue-collar automakers and accused Ms. Pelosi and Democrats of playing politics. The administration said it was working with Congress toward a deal.“The financial rescue isn’t about white collar vs. blue collar or Wall Street vs. Main Street,” said Tony Fratto, the deputy press secretary. “And it’s not about knee-jerk Democratic class warfare. It’s about preventing the collapse of our entire economy.”Mr. Fratto noted that thousands of financial firm employees had lost their jobs in recent months, and that the federal government’s intervention in the case of Bear Stearns led to the dissolution of the storied investment bank — not exactly a cheery ending.At times there were also charges of regional bias, and some defenders of the auto industry suggested that there was an anti-union animus among lawmakers from areas where organized labor has only a small presence.Still, some lawmakers said they could only conclude that the automakers were forced to travel an unduly rough road, and that the financial firms got a free pass.At a banking committee hearing on Thursday, Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, gestured angrily at a chart showing the billions that have been received by the financial firms. “You guys have been put under far more scrutiny, far more scrutiny than the people up here on the board, for far less money,” he told the auto executives. “I would love to have those birds in here again because they need to be talked to.”Mr. Frank noted on Friday that the United Auto Workers had agreed to cuts in base pay while the financial bailout legislation required only the end of bonuses and golden-parachutes for high-flying financial executives.“I am sure the autoworkers would be willing to give up their bonuses,” Mr. Frank scoffed.'"
"'08-12-07,'0','For Mr. Davidson, Dubai’s greatest weakness lies in its autocratic governing system. Politics in the emirate, as in most of the Middle East, pivots not on institutions but on clans — a ruling dynasty and its favorites who own and run Dubai in opaque fashion.True enough, but most of the Middle East is authoritarian, yet Dubai’s enlightened despotism and welcoming social environment have stood out for fostering economic advance. Like China, albeit on a tiny scale, Dubai is engaged in an experiment of economic liberalization without political democracy.Mr. Davidson further contends that unstable neighbors threaten Dubai’s success, but here he may have matters reversed. When Egypt and Iran stifle their entrepreneurs, many of them find a wide berth in Dubai. When Saudi Arabia imposes cultural restrictions on its population, Dubai offers a place to drink and let loose. When India and Pakistan have trouble creating jobs for their large populations, Dubai absorbs labor migrants. When Iraq or Lebanon descends into war, Dubai profits from rebuilding them.In short, until a vast arc of countries from East Africa to Southeast Asia changes substantially, Dubai will remain poised to benefit by providing a relatively open, secure, low-tax, business-friendly alternative.Mr. Davidson makes a broad brush point when he stresses the “nondemocratic ruling bargain” whereby Dubai nationals, who lack ways to participate in political decision-making, are, in his view, bought off with government handouts and no-show jobs. Noting the “legions of able-bodied young men drinking coffee and playing video games” at Dubai’s numerous malls during the ostensible workday, he writes that a tour of government departments would reveal many empty desks. That’s a contrast with the indefatigable Chinese in Singapore, Dubai’s lodestar.The number of Dubai nationals, according to Mr. Davidson, stands at only 80,000, which includes up to 40,000 assimilated non-Arab immigrants from Iran. His figure for Dubai nationals is about half the official number, but even the higher estimate is no more than about 8 percent of the emirate’s approximately two million inhabitants. Most of the noncitizens are huddled into ethnic enclaves.Dubai relies on a sizable imported professional class. (On a trip to Dubai last month, I met an Australian, an Irishman, a Pakistani, an Egyptian, an American and many other foreigners, as well as Dubai nationals, among the top executives of the major Dubai-based companies.) Mr. Davidson sees a dangerous dependence on expats who lack a path to local citizenship and could choose to relocate elsewhere.But again, although many places in the Middle East share Dubai’s prime location — almost midway between London and Hong Kong — not many offer Dubai’s outsized opportunities for using one’s skills, except perhaps Abu Dhabi.When asked what accounts for Dubai’s success, most of the top-shelf people single out a dearth of oil and corresponding big bets on modern infrastructure.As Mr. Davidson notes, it was even before the era of full containerization, in the 1970s, that Dubai’s rulers built their first major shipping facility and dry dock, Jebel Ali. Some people derided these facilities as white elephants, but they became operational just as globalization was about to take off. Today, Jebel Ali is among the largest container ports in the world.Mr. Davidson’s book bears some scars of graduate school (“dependency theory,” “cores” and “metropoles”). It was also written before the credit crisis and global contraction, and he makes no mention of Dubai’s economic vulnerabilities. In fact, the world’s searing financial debacle could turn out to be salutary for an overleveraged Dubai, reining in local inflation as well as an insane real estate market.Whatever the short-term pain, the U.A.E. is awash in liquidity, and Dubai’s hefty investments in infrastructure appear likely to persist and to yield future dividends. Above all, accumulated expertise should enable Dubai to continue aggressive pursuit of global market share across its service industries. That growing prowess abroad, no less than pathologies at home, is a central story about Dubai that has been missed amid the glitz.'"
"'08-12-07,'0','Moody’s had assigned high grades to many securities containing Countrywide mortgages. Those securities and mortgages, issued during the lending spree of recent years, later soured — leaving investors with large losses and homeowners and communities struggling with foreclosures.That was not the only time Moody’s softened its stance on Countrywide securities. It elevated ratings several times after Countrywide complained, the people briefed on the matter say.Since the subprime mortgage troubles exploded into a full-blown financial crisis last year, the three top credit-rating agencies — Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings — have faced a firestorm of criticism about whether their rosy ratings of mortgage securities generated billions of dollars in losses to investors who relied on them.The agencies are supposed to help investors evaluate the risk of what they are buying. But some former employees and many investors say the agencies, which were paid far more to rate complicated mortgage-related securities than to assess more traditional debt, either underestimated the risk of mortgage debt or simply overlooked its danger so they could rake in large profits during the housing boom.A Moody’s spokesman, Anthony Mirenda, said the company would not change ratings without substantive reasons. “As a matter of policy, Moody’s is obligated to reconvene a rating committee if there is new information put forth by an issuer that could have a material impact on a security’s creditworthiness,” he said, “and our policies prohibit changes to ratings for anything other than credit considerations.”He added that “Moody’s knows of no instances in which a reconvened rating committee resulted in improper changes to ratings on Countrywide securities.”Bank of America, which took over Countrywide earlier this year, said it could not verify details of prior management’s interactions with Moody’s.Members of Congress have grilled the agencies, asking their executives to answer accusations of incompetence and to say whether they assigned glowing ratings to keep clients happy and expand their business.State and federal officials are also making inquiries. Moody’s recently disclosed in its regulatory filings that it had received subpoenas from state attorneys general and other authorities pertaining to its role in the credit crisis.Moody’s said it was cooperating with the investigations.“Moody’s credit ratings play an important but limited role in the financial markets — to offer reasoned, independent, forward-looking opinions about relative credit risk, based on rigorous analysis and published methodologies,” Mr. Mirenda said. The company denies that it went easy on ratings to generate income.That the credit-rating agencies missed immense problems in the mortgage-related securities they blessed is undeniable. Moody’s declined to say how many classes of the securities it has downgraded. But the number is in the thousands and the original value in the hundreds of billions of dollars.When Moody’s began lowering the ratings of a wave of debt in July 2007, many investors were incredulous.“If you can’t figure out the loss ahead of the fact, what’s the use of using your ratings?” asked an executive with Fortis Investments, a money management firm, in a July 2007 e-mail message to Moody’s. “You have legitimized these things, leading people into dangerous risk.”Whether such risks were truly undetectable, or were ignored by Moody’s and the other agencies, is at the core of what regulators, legislators, investigators and investors are trying to determine.Moody’s current woes, former executives say, were set in motion a decade or so ago when top management started pushing the company to be more profit-oriented and friendly to issuers of debt. Along the way, the firm, whose objectivity once derived from the fact that its revenue came from investors who bought Moody’s research and analysis, ended up working closely with the companies it rated, and being paid by them.And in 2000, when Moody’s issued stock to the public for the first time, executives hungry to churn out quarterly profit growth had another incentive to redirect the firm’s focus from low-margin ratings of relatively simple bonds to highly lucrative assessments of much more complex debt securities.As it rode the mortgage wave, Moody’s came to enjoy profit margins that were higher than those of the mightiest of Fortune 500 companies, including Exxon and Microsoft.“Moody’s was like a good watchdog that had regarded the financial markets as its turf and barked and growled when anybody it didn’t know came near it,” said Thomas J. McGuire, a former director of corporate development at the company who left in 1996. “But in the ’90s, that watchdog got muzzled and gelded. It was told to turn into a lapdog.”A key reason for the soaring housing market was a process known as securitization. The machinery, devised by Wall Street, packaged individual mortgages into ever larger and more complex bundles. This allowed banks to sell their loans to investors, thereby reducing the banks’ risk and allowing them to lend more to aspiring homeowners.Wall Street made handsome profits bundling and selling the loans, and investors stepped up to buy the packaged debt, often because rating agencies like Moody’s had graded it as safe enough for the investors’ portfolios.The agencies divided the securities into slices known as tranches and analyzed each based on its risk. The securities deemed safest received the rating Moody’s called Aaa.Consider a residential mortgage pool put together in summer 2006 by Goldman Sachs. Called GSAMP 2006-S5, it held $338 million of second mortgages to subprime, or riskier, borrowers.The safest slice of the security held $165 million in loans. When it was issued on Aug. 17, 2006, Moody’s and S.& P. rated it triple-A. Just eight months later, Moody’s alerted investors that it might downgrade the top-rated tranche. Sure enough, it dropped the rating to Baa, the lowest investment-grade level, on Aug. 16, 2007.Then, on Dec. 4, 2007, Moody’s downgraded the tranche to a “junk” rating. On April 15 of this year, Moody’s downgraded the tranche yet again; today, it no longer trades. The combination of downgrades and defaults hammered the securities.Reversals like this have enraged investors. Internal e-mail messages disclosed by Congress in October, for example, recounted a July 2007 conversation Moody’s had with an irate customer at Pimco, a major money management firm.“He feels that Moody’s has a powerful control over Wall Street but is frustrated that Moody’s doesn’t stand up to Wall Street,” the e-mail stated. “They are disappointed that in this case Moody’s has ‘toed the line. Someone up there just wasn’t on top of it,’ he said.” For decades after its founding in 1909, Moody’s was an independent and respected arbiter of credit quality. Today, the company’s 1,200 analysts rate debts of 100 nations, 12,000 corporate issuers, 29,000 public issuers like cities and 96,000 complex securities known as “structured finance.” It is a franchise that generated revenue of $1.35 billion and earnings of $370 million in the first three quarters of this year alone.Edmund Vogelius, a Moody’s vice president, explained the company’s business model in a 1957 article in The Christian Science Monitor.“We obviously cannot ask payment for rating a bond,” he wrote. “To do so would attach a price to the process, and we could not escape the charge, which would undoubtedly come, that our ratings are for sale.”In the early 1970s, Moody’s and other rating agencies began charging issuers for opinions. The numbers of securities — and their complexity — had increased and the agencies could no longer finance their operations on revenue from investors who bought Moody’s publications.In 1975, the Securities and Exchange Commission secured the rating agencies’ positions by allowing banks to base their capital requirements on the ratings of securities they held. The upside of this was that it theoretically created an elegant self-policing mechanism: any firm that ran afoul of the agencies also would run afoul of investors. The heavier hand of direct government regulation could be scaled back.But for Mr. McGuire, the former director of corporate development at Moody’s, there were also dangers in relying on ratings as a form of regulation because the agencies would be able to sell ratings even if they failed investors.“Rating agencies are staffed by ordinary people with families to support and bills to meet and mortgages to pay,” he said in a speech to the S.E.C. in 1995. “Government regulators are inadvertently subjecting those people to improper pressure, and share accountability for any scandals which may result.”As the agencies exerted growing sway, they became the arbiters that issuers loved to hate. Yet instead of viewing that ire as a reflection of their independence, Moody’s executives decided that it signaled a need to become more friendly to issuers of debt, according to Jerome S. Fons, a former managing director for credit quality at Moody’s.“In my view, the focus of Moody’s shifted from protecting investors to being a marketing-driven organization,” he said in testimony before Congress last month. “Management’s focus increasingly turned to maximizing revenues. Stock options and other incentives raised the possibility of large payoffs.”An early proponent of the profit push was John Rutherfurd Jr., who joined Moody’s in 1985. In 1998, he became chief executive; a news release that year praised him for helping the company’s bottom line.According to people who worked with him at Moody’s, Mr. Rutherfurd was very focused on profit. They recall a conversation about 10 years ago in which he said he wanted every Moody’s analyst to produce at least $1 million in revenue each year. This encouraged Moody’s to generate as many ratings per analyst as possible.In an interview, Mr. Rutherfurd said that he might have discussed such a goal but that he did not recall it specifically.“Moody’s has to be all the time both a standards business and a service business,” he said. “I wasn’t in Moody’s in the old days, so to speak, but I think I always understood both elements of what we had to do.”By the time Moody’s became a public company in 2000, structured finance had become its top source of revenue. Employees in this unit rated bundles of assets like credit card receivables, car loans and residential mortgages. Later they rated collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s, yet another combination of various bundles of debt.Moody’s could receive between $200,000 and $250,000 to rate a $350 million mortgage pool, for example, while rating a municipal bond of a similar size might have generated just $50,000 in fees, according to people familiar with Moody’s fee structure.A standard of profitability at many companies is its operating margin, which measures how much of its revenue is left over after it pays most expenses. While operating margins at Moody’s were always enviable — in 2000 they stood at 48 percent — they climbed even higher as revenue from structured finance rose. From 2000 to 2007, company documents show, operating margins averaged 53 percent.Even thriving companies like Exxon and Microsoft had margins of 17 and 36 percent respectively in 2007. But Moody’s and its counterparts were not founded to be profit machines.“The mistaken notion that Moody’s was a company like any other, that was very fundamental,” said Sylvain Raynes, a former Moody’s analyst who is co-founder of R&R Consulting, a firm that helps investors gauge debt risks. “It is not just a profit-maximization entity like Exxon or Microsoft. Moody’s has a duty to the American public. People trusted it.”Moody’s soaring fortunes were tied to the housing boom. When the Federal Reserve Board cut interest rates to 1 percent in 2003, Moody’s structured-finance revenue stood at $474 million, more than twice the amount generated just three years earlier.As low interest rates fed the housing surge, Moody’s structured-finance business continued to rack up impressive gains. In 2005, structured finance generated $715 million, or 41 percent, of Moody’s total revenue.In both 2005 and 2006, almost all of the unit’s growth came from mortgage-related securities, the company said, rather than other forms of debt like credit card receivables or auto loans. By the first quarter of 2007, structured finance accounted for 53 percent of Moody’s revenue.The man overseeing Moody’s structured-finance unit in the midst of the mania was Brian M. Clarkson, 52. He had joined Moody’s as an analyst in 1991 and rose through the organization until he became president in 2007. He resigned last May; he declined to comment for this article.As mortgage securities grew more complex, investors leaned more heavily on the agencies’ ratings. There was little transparency around the composition and characteristics of the loans held in the pools, and the securitization process grew so complicated that it required sophisticated systems to assess the risks embedded in each bundle.Even though the standards at many lenders declined precipitously during the boom, rating agencies did not take that into account. The agencies maintained that it was not their responsibility to assess the quality of each and every mortgage loan tossed into a pool.By early 2007, it was becoming more and more obvious that the subprime mortgage boom was ending. Yet Moody’s did not start downgrading mortgage-related securities until that summer. In July and August, the firm cut the ratings on almost 1,000 securities valued at almost $25 billion.“These loans are defaulting at a rate materially higher than original expectations,” Moody’s said. Investors sharply criticized Moody’s over the tardiness of the response, internal documents made public in Congressional hearings show.Two e-mail messages in July 2007 recount conversations Moody’s had with executives at Vanguard, BlackRock and Fortis, three huge money management firms. While Fortis offered some of the harshest assessments, none of the firms were pleased.The Vanguard executive, the messages show, was frustrated that Moody’s was willing to “allow issuers to get away with murder.” As a result, the Moody’s messages say, Vanguard “finds itself ‘less and less relying on the opinions of rating agencies.’ ” BlackRock, meanwhile, said that Moody’s “relied too much on manufactured data that is weak” when rating residential mortgage securities.Two months later, Moody’s executives held a meeting for their managing directors to talk about the crisis. The tone of the meeting, according to a transcript released by Congress, was defiant.Moody’s had become a “punching bag,” said one of its executives, an easy target for investors eager to deflect responsibility for escalating mortgage losses.“One of the questions everybody asks is, ‘Why does everybody hate us so much?’ ” Mr. Clarkson said during the meeting. “The theory that I’ve come up with lately is the fact that it’s perfect. It’s perfect to be able to blame us for everything.”During the meeting, Moody’s executives predicted that the current crisis of confidence would pass, just as investor outrage over the company’s failure to detect trouble at Enron and Worldcom had several years earlier.Other employees at the meeting were not so sure. When asked by top management if the meeting addressed the topics of greatest concern, one managing director whose anonymous comments were part of the documents given to Congress said there had been “really no discussion of why the structured group refused to change their ratings in the face of overwhelming evidence they were wrong.”And two months later, Christopher Mahoney, former vice chairman of Moody's and the person who led its credit policy committee, e-mailed Raymond W. McDaniel, the firm's chief executive. The e-mail contained a copy of a message board post that said although mistakes had been made in subprime mortgage loss estimates, “more importantly I think sector wide risk management rules should have done more to alert investors of problems.”'"
"'08-12-07,'0','The investigation here led to the indictments of 55 people and the seizing of 187 pit bulls, breaking up what officials described as one of the largest dogfighting rings in the country.“It’s like the Saturday night poker game for hardened criminals,” said one of the undercover agents, Sgt. C. T. Manning, describing the tense atmosphere at the fights.In between screaming obscenities at the animals locked in combat, Sergeant Manning said, the participants smoked marijuana, popped pills, made side deals about things like selling cocaine and fencing stolen property, and, always, talked about dogs.Dogfighting drew national attention in 2007 when Michael Vick, the quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons, was convicted of felony conspiracy after holding dogfights on his property in Smithfield, Va. On Monday, officials in Los Angeles announced the breakup of a dogfighting ring. It was the outcry among animal-welfare groups after Mr. Vick’s arrest that prompted the Texas Legislature to make dogfighting a felony in September 2007. Before that, the police in Texas had largely ignored the phenomenon because the offense was a misdemeanor.In the Texas case, law enforcement officials described a secretive society of men who set up prize fights between their pit bulls and bet large sums on the outcome. Many of those indicted had long criminal records, but they also include a high school English teacher, a land purchaser for an oil company and a manager at a Jack in the Box restaurant.The participants generally arranged the fight over the phone, matching dogs by weight and sex, and agreeing to a training period of six or eight weeks.The training techniques were brutal. One man who was indicted trained a dog by forcing it to run for up to an hour at a time through a cemetery with a chain around its neck that weighed as much as it did. Then he forced dogs to swim for long periods before running on a treadmill. Every day the dogs would be given dog protein powders, vitamins and high-grade food to build muscle.Then, as the fight date approached, the trainers would starve the dog, give it very little water and pump it full of an anti-inflammatory drug.The fights were held in out-of-the-way places — an abandoned motel in the refinery town of Texas City, a horse corral in a slum on the Houston outskirts, behind a barn on a farm near Jasper and at a farmhouse in Matagorda County, south of Houston.The two undercover agents, Sergeant Manning and his partner, S. A. Davis, posed as members of a motorcycle gang who stole automated teller machines for a living. They infiltrated the ring, allied themselves with a group of people who owned fighting dogs and rented a warehouse in Houston, where fights were eventually held.People came to the contests from as far away as Tennessee, Michigan and the Czech Republic. Every weekend, fights were held throughout the area for purses that usually ran about $10,000. The agents documented at least 50 fights.“The undercover cops were sometimes invited to three different dogfights in a night,” said Belinda Smith, the Harris County assistant district attorney prosecuting the cases, along with Stephen St. Martin.The ring members called the fights “dog shows.” The two dogs would be suspended from a scale with a thin cord tied around their neck and torso. If one of the dogs did not make weight, the owner would forfeit his half of the prize money, or the odds would be adjusted. After the weigh-in, the owners washed each others’ dogs in water, baking soda, warm milk and vinegar to make sure their coats were not poisoned.Then dogs were forced to face off in a portable plywood box two feet tall, usually with a beige carpet on the floor, to show the blood, officials said. At the command of “face your dogs,” the animals were turned toward each other. When the handlers released them, the dogs would collide with a thud in the center of the ring, tearing at each other’s mouths, jaws, necks, withers and genitals, officials said. A referee usually would let the dogs fight until one backed off, then the handlers would take them back to their corners and wash them for 30 seconds.During the fight, the exhausted animals would sometimes overheat, lock onto each other and lie in the ring. The handlers would blow on them to cool them off and force them to fight.The fight usually ended when a dog refused to cross a line in the center of the ring to confront the opponent, known as “standing the line.” Such dogs were usually drowned or bludgeoned to death the next day, officials said.“These guys take it very personally,” Sergeant Manning said. “It’s a reflection on them.”Most of the dogs seized were kept outside in muddy yards, chained to axles sunk in the ground, with only six feet of tether and no shelter, beyond, in some cases, a toppled plastic 40-gallon barrel. All suffered from multiple parasites, veterinarians said.“These dogs were kept in more than cruel conditions — they were subjected to torturous conditions,” said Dr. Timothy Harkness, of the Houston Humane Society. “Death was more pleasant than what they had to exist for.”Many of the surviving animals had battle wounds on their necks and mouths, Dr. Harkness said. Although some were not aggressive toward people, they were all bred to attack other dogs, and officials made the decision to euthanize them last week.Dr. Dawn Blackmar, director of veterinary public health for Harris County, said that putting down more than 80 dogs in her care was heart-wrenching. “It was absolutely awful,” Dr. Blackmar said. “It’s not the dogs’ fault. It’s that people have taken and exploited this breed.”The members of the dogfighting ring were careful about who attended a fight, often limiting each side to 10 guests and quizzing people about who they were, who they knew.The principals would keep the location of the fight secret until the last minute and then go in a caravan of cars to the rendezvous point, making it difficult to collect evidence, law enforcement officials said. They were also secretive about where they kept their dogs, for fear of robbery.“People would go to the fights and talk about their yards,” said Ms. Smith, the assistant district attorney. “But they were very secretive about where their yards are.”Ms. Smith said dozens of people who attended fights had yet to be identified, despite photos, because they piled into cars that did not belong to them to go to the events and never used their real names.“There are a lot of people doing this,” she said. “We could have gone on and on and on with this investigation.”'"
"'08-12-07,'0','While teams that rely heavily on credit to finance long-term contracts are acting more frugally this off-season, others have more cash to spend. Boras’s guiding principle is that it takes only one team to set the market, and he offered a hint of that theory when asked his opinion about the effects of the overall economy on baseball.“I think there are 30 economies in baseball,” Boras said, referring to the 30 major league teams, and adding later: “We know baseball had record revenues, and the profits that are in the barn for many owners are extraordinary. There are clubs that run their business appropriately, and we all know it’s good business to have good players.”In recent years, Boras has found a willing partner in the Detroit Tigers, who parlayed the signing of three clients — Ordóñez, Kenny Rogers and Iván Rodríguez — into an unlikely American League pennant in 2006. The Tigers ranked second in payroll last season, at $138.6 million, but their attendance could dip sharply in 2009 because of the economy in Michigan.Still, the teams directly above and below the Tigers were the Yankees, at $209 million, and the Mets, at $138.2 million. They are moving into new stadiums and have their own cable networks; in theory, they will have plenty of room in their budgets for free agents.The Yankees have at least some degree of interest in the three most prominent free agents — Teixeira, Ramírez and C. C. Sabathia, who is scheduled to meet with General Manager Brian Cashman this weekend. Boras said many teams were waiting for those players to sign, explaining the stalled market.“There may be as many as seven or eight clubs after each one of those players,” Boras said. “Those clubs are waiting for those players, and they’re not pursuing the next players in line. So you have as many as 12 or 14 teams locked up, looking at those players and not making a decision until those players make their decisions. If those players sign with another team, those clubs may have a great deal of money to allocate.”Yet even the Yankees showed last week that they have limits to the amount they are willing to risk. As much as they value compensatory draft picks, they did not offer salary arbitration to outfielder Bobby Abreu for fear he would be unable to find an appealing deal on the free-agent market and accept their offer.In most years, Abreu would have widespread appeal; despite declining defensive skills, he has six successive seasons of 100 runs batted in, an active streak matched only by Alex Rodriguez and Albert Pujols. But the Yankees surveyed the landscape and chose not to risk an offer.Abreu is not represented by Boras. His agent is Peter Greenberg, who negotiated a six-year, $137.5 million contract for Johan Santana with the Mets before last season. That was a record for a pitcher, but the Yankees’ offer to Sabathia — six years, $140 million — would top it.If the Yankees can persuade Sabathia and his agent, Greg Genske, to take it, the deal will be one of the first signs that at least some players are unaffected by the economy. The way Boras sees it, Sabathia will have plenty of company among satisfied players by the time spring training begins.'"
"'08-12-07,'0','Schiano & Company say it is all about the process, the creation of a program that is strong and lasting and eventually lucrative. Eight years into the Schiano era, the evidence suggests something of a lesser stature: a competitive Big East team but one enhanced by a cupcake schedule and a devalued conference that may or may not be contractually tied to whatever elite postseason infrastructure there is in the future.Not to say that regional supremacy isn’t a reasonable or worthy pursuit for a university in Rutgers’s position. This obsession with a playoff system, with national prominence, with settling once and for all who’s really the world champion of the global superpower in the end only fuels an arms race that has driven spending on college football programs through the proverbial roof.With all due respect to what Schiano has built at Rutgers from the ground up and to the impressive academic achievement of his players, shouldn’t the ambitions of the program be modified to meet the harsh realities all around it? Wasn’t that the underlying implication of a recently issued and harshly worded report investigating Rutgers’s athletic department excesses and ethical trespasses with regard to football?“The system of internal checks and balances is more than what is written on paper,” said Alfred Koeppe, a co-chairman of the nine-member group that was commissioned by the Rutgers president, Richard L. McCormick. “Ultimately, you can’t blink away the things that have come out.”In published reports, the Rutgers program has been cited for hidden spending in order to compete on a scale to the satisfaction of Schiano and the athletic director, Robert E. Mulcahy III.Two years ago, after an 11-2 season that for a time landed Rutgers in the top 20, if not in a B.C.S. bowl, Schiano was suddenly a hot leveraged property. That was the moment Mulcahy blinked when he should have had his eyes wide open to what Koeppe called “the balance of consequences.”Do the Schiano supplicants really believe no other coach is capable of recruiting enough talent to take Rutgers to the International Bowl? Right down the turnpike, Temple, not long ago a program in utter disrepair after being booted from the Big East, has its own savior of sorts in another Jersey boy, the conveniently named Al Golden.None of this is medical school material. While some critics inside Rutgers have been told to not complain publicly, Koeppe said in a telephone interview, “Everything we recommended, frankly, could have been recommended five years ago.”First and foremost, know your limitations, what rung on the ladder Rutgers can reach.When accountability to the taxpayers, the students and especially those athletes whose minor sports were cut from varsity status was called for, Rutgers convinced itself that Bear Bryant was about to slip away. Side deals were made to keep Schiano from hitting pay dirt elsewhere. A construction site behind one end zone at Rutgers Stadium reflects a $102 million seating expansion stalled of its own malfeasance.Ryan E. Cooke, the nonvoting student representative on the Rutgers board of governors, said in an interview that most students he knows seldom questioned the value of the football team to the university “on a national stage” — when it succeeds, that is.But success is relative, and what it takes is also a matter of debate. Rutgers may be the Big East’s best team after its midseason transformation from impotent to one that averaged 46.2 points over its last five games, but Cincinnati did win the title without great fanfare and with a stadium that has a smaller seating capacity than Rutgers’s.Now Cincinnati is promising its coach, Brian Kelly, 10,000 more seats. The arms race continues in the face of a sobering financial reality.'"
"'08-12-07,'0','IN the vestibule of Grace and St. Paul’s Lutheran Church on the Upper West Side on a recent Tuesday, the mood was somber. Those present had gathered to grieve, as so many churchgoers do, but the unusual object of their mourning was a black and white husky named Sebastian who was killed in May by stray electrical voltage from a lamppost.“It’s important to note that this hazard impacts on everyone,” said Blair Sorrel, who hosted the benefit for Sebastian’s bereaved owner, Celia Sing, and is the founder of Streetzaps.com, a Web site dedicated to raising awareness of stray voltage from fixtures such as streetlights and sidewalk metal plates. “It’s a fairly mundane occurrence.”Preventing stray voltage is the shared responsibility of Con Edison and the city’s Department of Transportation. Each said it was doing its part. According to Craig Chin, a transportation spokesman, the agency performs random tests throughout the city to detect stray electricity and, since 2005, has painted 170,000 streetlight shafts with nonconductive paint that prevents shocks.Chris Olert, a spokesman for Con Edison, said his company’s vigilance on the issue had produced impressive results.“Any reports of stray voltage we’ll check out, but we’re finding fewer and fewer incidents because of our aggressiveness after Jodie Lane,” Mr. Olert said, referring to the graduate student who was electrocuted while walking over a metal service plate in the East Village in 2004. The number of electric shocks related to Con Ed equipment has since declined by 78 percent, to 46 in 2007 from 210 in 2004, according to the company’s Web site.The lamppost that electrocuted Sebastian was the property of the Transportation Department and was replaced shortly after the accident, but Ms. Sing, 50, a former employee of the Police Department who volunteers at a cat shelter, still mourns her loss. She used to walk her two dogs separately so that each could have quality time with her. “It took me so long to be able to say Sebastian’s name” after his death, she said through tears, adding that she had refused several offers to replace him.'"
"'08-12-07,'0','BACK home in the Indonesian city of Semarang, Dinar Puspita, a slight and cheerful 17-year-old, says her afternoon prayers with friends at the mosque in her school. In Riverdale in the Bronx, Dinar is now a high school exchange student in an increasingly Orthodox neighborhood where synagogues are prevalent.Among them is the Riverdale Jewish Center, which sits conveniently across the street from Dinar’s public school on Independence Avenue at West 237th Street. Because Dinar cannot pray in the school, the Riverdale/Kingsbridge Academy, her host Naomi Erickson e-mailed the synagogue’s rabbi to see if the girl could pray there instead.“I was very pleasantly surprised at how gracious the rabbi was,” said Ms. Erickson, a retired accountant.“I didn’t think that they will let me pray in here,” she said the other day, seated on a green cushioned bench in the synagogue after finishing her prayers. “I mean, it’s not my religion.”As it turned out, the rabbi, Jonathan Rosenblatt, was happy to offer Dinar a few places within the large building in which to pray on days when after-school activities preclude her from going home to pray.The sanctuary was one option, but sometimes it is locked, and other times it is crowded. So Dinar has taken a liking to a long, quiet hallway lined with large windows and plaques memorializing synagogue members and their loved ones.'"
"'08-12-07,'0','Peppermints were a popular European candy as early as the mid-19th century. “Brandy balls,” a sweet made with peppermint and cinnamon — “all the spices that warm the tongue, like brandy does,” explained Francine Segan, a food historian — were sold on the street in London in the 1850s. And peppermint candies in all forms were found throughout Europe by then.But until Wrigley’s spearmint gum was introduced in America in 1893 and peppermint LifeSavers appeared on the market about a decade later, mint candy was something you mostly made at home. Making candy was one of those things that every woman seemed to know how to do, like recaning a chair and boning a lamb. A recipe for peppermints, which ran in The Times in 1879, is a surprise in that it actually gives precise measurements for all of the ingredients, not always the case in the newspaper’s 19th-century recipes.Without any personal candy-making expertise, however, I quickly ran into trouble: I boiled a pound of sugar and a little water for about 5 minutes, at which point the mixture began to caramelize. Off the heat, I added peppermint extract and followed the instructions to beat the mixture until it thickened. But even if I’d beaten it with an airplane propeller, the mixture was determined to remain loose and glistening, so I gave up and poured the caramelized sugar onto a greased baking sheet.Once cooled, the candy looked like a shiny, amber inkblot, attractive, certainly, but not terribly promising. It wasn’t candy as we know it. Then I tasted a piece and suddenly understood why you would in fact want to make your own candy at home. The caramelization of the sugar gave it an unexpected buttery flavor and bitterness, and the peppermint was alive in a way that you would never find in store-bought confections. Plus it took me all of five minutes to whip together. I like that the candies are a dark caramel color and that the mint comes as a surprise to all who try them.I knew immediately whom to send this recipe to: Claudia Fleming, the pastry chef and an owner, with her husband, Gerry Hayden, of the North Fork Table and Inn on Long Island. Fleming is known for giving familiar desserts distinction, a style epitomized in her chocolate-caramel tarts dusted with fleur de sel, which she made while working as the pastry chef at Gramercy Tavern. “It was supereasy, superfast,” she said of the peppermint candy, “but a little, just … well, it is what it is.”True, but what’s wrong with a simple candy? (I guess I don’t have to agree with every chef in this column.)Fleming continued: “I’m not a candy-cane fan, I’m not a hard-mint fan. So to make most candy palatable for me, I think chocolate.”'"
"'08-12-07,'0','One way they can do that is to voluntarily enter the affordable housing council’s program. If a town accepts the council’s calculations, based on the amount of vacant land and projected growth, it is protected from lawsuits alleging exclusionary zoning. Towns not in the program risk being sued. Today, 305 of New Jersey’s 566 municipalities are under the council’s auspices, and another 80 are trying to hammer out solutions in the courts.The current furor over affordable housing began in June, with new rules requiring towns to provide one unit of affordable housing for every five homes built, plus one affordable unit for every 16 new jobs. (A typical “affordable” two-bedroom town house would sell for $81,000, and a two-bedroom apartment would rent for $700, according to the State Department of Community Affairs, the council’s parent agency.)The ratios are double those proposed in 2004. Moreover, every municipality has lost an important tool for meeting its housing obligations. In the past, many suburbs were able to use a loophole that allowed them to transfer part of their share, along with some money, to willing cities. In July, the State Legislature abolished that mechanism.Nearly 200 mayors formed a coalition to fight the new rules.“They said we needed 891 units. Where would we put them? We no longer have the land available to do it,” Patricia Flannery, a coalition member and the mayor of Bridgewater, in Somerset County, said in a recent interview.Bridgewater will meet the deadline, but will dispute the council’s analysis of how much vacant land it has, she said.Many towns will do the same, and some will probably succeed in having their numbers reduced. The council has admitted that it relied on imperfect data for the blueprint it devised to predict growth. “There were sites shown as vacant that weren’t necessarily so,” said Lucy Vandenberg, the council’s executive director.In Old Tappan, the council listed as vacant portions of backyards, school property, utility rights of way and land adjoining the Hackensack River, said Sean Moronski, the borough’s planner.“We did a real review,” Mr. Moronski said. “They projected 91 units. We think a realistic projection would be 19.”The controversy is not just about numbers. Some towns say they will be crushed by construction costs.Yet more than half of the 54,000 units of affordable housing built statewide since 1986 were subsidized by the private sector, according to state officials. Towns allowed developers to build “inclusionary” housing at higher-than-usual densities, on condition that they market some of the new units to people of limited means.Many towns say they no longer have the room, or desire, for such projects. Others fear the current housing slump has scared off developers. All point to a recent report from the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services that said affordable housing could cost towns $2 billion a year.The report was flawed, said Kevin Walsh, associate director of the Fair Share Housing Center, a nonprofit group in Cherry Hill. “They just fundamentally didn’t know what they were talking about,” he said. “It assumes the public sector is going to pay for everything. That’s just not going to happen.”In fact, towns across New Jersey have $215 million in unspent affordable housing trust funds, according to state housing officials. The money was raised through local ordinances establishing developer fees. State and federal subsidies for construction are also available.Not all towns have big surpluses in local trust funds. Bridgewater, which boomed in the 1990s, has $4 million; Old Tappan, $170,000.One other new wrinkle is complicating the picture. Towns in environmentally sensitive regions like the Highlands, whose growth is controlled by a central planning agency, must also provide affordable housing.Just how much is in contention. Environmental advocates say such towns should finish mapping out natural resources before they commit to new development.“We’re an organization that has always supported affordable housing. But the latest set of rules are illogical, stupid and chaotic,” said Jeff Tittel, director of the Sierra Club’s New Jersey chapter, one of 15 environmental groups asking the governor to push back the Dec. 31 deadline.Amid the clamor, some towns are forging ahead.Andover Township, in Sussex County, has talked about turning an empty abbey into affordable housing. Bridgewater signed on with Habitat for Humanity for nine new homes. Toms River, in Ocean County, plans to take advantage of the state’s deepening foreclosure crisis.Under a new program, Toms River would buy down the mortgages of residents threatened with foreclosure. A deed restriction would be placed against the property, requiring any future owner to be income-qualified. The town might also buy already foreclosed homes and convert them to affordable housing, said John F. Russo Jr., Toms River’s affordable housing lawyer.“The idea of developing big inclusionary developments on raw land is a dinosaur. It drives up the cost of other houses, and puts a burden on taxpayers,” Mr. Russo said. “New Jersey is a very different place than it was in 1975, when Mount Laurel was decided. Most of the land has been developed. Most of what isn’t, has environmental issues.”'"
"'08-12-07,'0','Renter incomes have not kept pace, and “those with low incomes are far more vulnerable, because their housing options are so limited,” Mr. Hanratty said.As the economy deteriorates, increasing numbers of landlords are encountering financial difficulties, and tenants are bearing the brunt, said Lyndon D. Williams, a county legislator from Mount Vernon. That has a big impact in some areas; 59.5 percent of residents in Mount Vernon pay rent and 50 percent do so in Yonkers, according to 2006 census data.At the 497-unit Levister Towers in Mount Vernon, where more than half of renters receive federal Section 8 housing subsidies, the owner defaulted on an installment agreement with the city for back taxes and failed to file state and federal income taxes last year, said Helen M. Blackwood, of the city’s Law Department.Meanwhile, tenants at the complex are at the mercy of vendors who have not been paid by the Sheldrake Organization, which took over the run-down and drug-infested 59-year-old complex of five buildings in 2001 and began to make improvements. Con Edison temporarily shut off gas service this fall, and although that problem was rectified, residents continue to wrestle with myriad other problems, said Sylvia Tyree, the Levister Towers tenants’ association president.Elevators in the 10-story buildings are often out of service, for example. “We’re angry and frustrated, because we had hoped for a better situation with the new owner,” Ms. Tyree said.As Mr. Williams, who helped the Levister tenants form their association, observed, “Unlike the wealthy, low-income tenants don’t always have the resources to fight back and hire lawyers.”At the American Red Cross of Westchester headquarters in White Plains, John Ravitz, the chief executive, reported that his organization is responding to more requests for aid from fire victims, who often live in overcrowded, poorly maintained buildings where tenants have doubled and tripled up to make ends meet.And at Westchester Residential Opportunities, Mr. Anderson, the chief executive, said older residents constitute another at-risk group of tenants, often unable to cope with changes in their housing. “We certainly would hope landlords would give some extra thought to that group, especially going into the holidays,” Mr. Anderson said.Sarah Lawrence College, which owns an 87-unit apartment complex in Yonkers, is reclaiming 20 rent-regulated units that are leased or rented to non-college residents, some of whom are older tenants receiving housing subsidies. In an attempt to find alternative housing for those residents, many of whom are paying between $700 and $1,500 a month rent, the college consulted with the Housing Action Council in Tarrytown, said Rosemarie Noonan, the council’s executive director. It has decided to allow tenants to remain and to reassign the apartments for student housing when a tenant leaves.Over all, though, the outlook is bleak for low-income tenants who need alternatives, said Debbie Perkins, a social worker with Community Housing Innovations, an advocacy organization in White Plains and Patchogue on Long Island that is working to prevent homelessness.“If you have a fairly low rent and a low income and you lose that rent, there are very few choices out there,” she said. “If you’re earning a higher income and paying $1,500 a month for rent, you can probably find another apartment, but if you can only afford $1,200 a month, that may not be possible.“Especially when people are working hard and doing everything they can to make ends meet, they get angry.”Some tenants resist, like Walton Punter, who lives at 6 East Sydney Street, where Ms. Howlett also rents an apartment. “Why should I leave?” asked Mr. Punter, who is single and works as a housekeeper at a nursing home in the Bronx. “Most people got up and ran when the landlord told them to move, but I won’t. Let him take me to court.”Sometimes, though, overwhelmed tenants despair and end up homeless, Ms. Perkins said. In what bodes ill for this winter, homeless shelters in Westchester have already begun to fill up. Occupancy did not dip during the summer as it usually does, and shelter providers report that they are already at 90 percent capacity. And food pantries are running low.“We’re worried about what the coming months will bring,” Ms. Perkins said. “When it gets very cold, we’ll really be in trouble.”'"
"'08-12-07,'0','With the opening of MGM Grand in May of this year — flaunting, in addition to Craftsteak, Chef David Burke’s steakhouse (David Burke Prime) — Foxwoods seems to be stepping up its game.Part of the draw of casino culture is the promise of luxurious, even decadent adventure, with a concordant price tag. The question is, then, are those steaks worth all that money?Yes, and no.Craftsteak’s menu offers three types of steak: corn-fed, grass-fed and, when I was there, Australian and American raised wagyu (wagyu refers to a type of cattle known for its densely marbled meat).Cowed by the prices, we ordered the least expensive wagyu, a skirt steak ($69). Tender, buttery, with big, round beef flavor — I can say unequivocally that this is the best steak I’ve ever eaten.At $55, a 28-day dry-aged New York strip was excellent. By contrast, however, the flavor of a 28-day dry-aged, corn-fed rib-eye ($69) was disappointing, and its texture chewy.In the dim lighting, we failed to notice that the grass-fed, flat iron steak on the menu was bison, rather than beef. Its gamey flavor was lovely but it was slightly overcooked (it was the only piece of meat I ate here that was less than perfectly cooked).The best of the appetizers was a plate of three plump, and beautifully cooked, local (Stonington) scallops, with honey and black truffle. Five small slices of raw, yellowfin tuna, seasoned with lemon, were tasty, but at $21, they deserved to have been more chilled. Local (Noank) oysters and clams were appropriately bright and fresh tasting, if terribly expensive at $3 to $4 apiece. Kuri squash soup was sweet — not my style — and ought to have been thinned.Sides are a la carte, as is traditional at steak houses. For the most part, the kitchen did a fine job but because of the prices, I feel obliged to quibble: the French fries might have been crisper, and they were overly browned. Sautéed mushrooms were a little dry, and a pumpkin risotto, which was both too rich and undercooked (the interior of the rice chalky), was frankly disappointing. Sautéed Swiss chard, however, was delicious, and the shallow, golden-crusted spinach gratin was lightly creamed, not drowned in white sauce as is too often the case.The kitchen also does a nice job with its yeasted breads, as we discovered when we ordered two for dessert: the monkey bread and doughnut holes. Both were as expertly made as the warm, buttery dinner rolls that kicked off the evening. The monkey bread (a standard on the Craft menu), a buttery spiral of brioche layered with caramel and garnished with pecans and whipped crème fraiche, was a wonderful thing. Doughnut holes were warm and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.Astonished by the cost of the meal, I returned a second time to see whether I might be able to construct a less expensive, nonsteak meal. My companion and I split two salads — Caesar, and a lemon-and-Kalamata dressed calamari salad — before tasting the braised short ribs (another Colicchio classic) and roasted wild king salmon.Served with an expertly made Parmesan crisp, the Caesar was very good; in the squid salad, the mild taste of the seafood disappeared under the strong flavor of the olives. Short ribs were appropriately tender and luscious, and the salmon well cooked. And this time, the fries were crisped to perfection.Warm peanut butter chocolate fondant for dessert was more chocolatey than peanut, but was no less tasty for that. I loved the topping on my individual apple-cranberry crisp, but left the undercooked apples uneaten.Even steakless, the meal was very expensive. Salads, sides and dessert portions, however, are large enough to split easily.In a phone call with the Craftsteak general manager, Tom Timmons, I discovered that it’s likely that some of the guests on that Saturday night were eating on their dream cards, a system by which points accrued during gambling can be redeemed at casino restaurants. For the rest of us, if you want the steak of your dreams, you’ll have to pay for it.THE SPACE Vast, sleek high-ceilinged dining room with contemporary design elements in steel, bronze, glass and wood. Separate bar/lounge. Lighting is very dim at banquettes along the sides of the room, and room is noisy when crowded. Wheelchair accessible.THE BAR Full bar and hefty wine list, the bulk of it over $50. Wine by the glass, $10 to $22.WHAT WE LIKE Noank oysters, yellowfin tuna and lemon, Caesar salad, scallops and local truffle honey; braised short ribs, corn-fed strip steak, bison flat-iron steak, wagyu skirt steak; French fries, spinach gratin; monkey bread, doughnut holes, peanut butter chocolate fondant.IF YOU GO Dinner: Sunday to Thursday, 5 to 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 5 to 11 p.m. Reservations recommended on weekend evenings.'"
"'08-12-07,'0','Despite its oversize heft and glossy nature photography, ANIMAL LIFE (DK/American Museum of Natural History, $50) is not a coffee-table book to breeze through. Edited by the zoologist Charlotte Uhlenbroek, the book is both a stunning pictorial essay and a dynamic textbook that serves as a key to the animal kingdom.Coming in at 512 pages, “Animal Life” organizes its subject matter into three sections. The first dutifully gets the historical foundation of animal study out of the way, covering evolution and so on. There’s also an illustrated outline of the classification system devised by Carl Linnaeus — the kingdom-phylum-class-order-family-genus-species business that most people probably remembered by the mnemonic (“King Philip came over for great spaghetti”) just long enough to pass that freshman biology test. Here, it’s actually interesting.The first section rounds out with an overview of different animal groups, like birds and mammals, illustrated by hundreds of images across the pages. As visually dense as it is, this is the boring part compared with the other two sections.The middle section is devoted to anatomical matters, discussing how those skeletons, skins, scales, feathers and fins come together to give each type of animal its particular look and movement. It’s sprinkled with engaging little topics (set off in their own boxes) like the mechanics of snake locomotion and an explanation of “pronking” — a stiff-limbed vertical leap performed by many antelopes and gazelles. Another memorable factoid reveals that a European mole can excavate an average of 65 feet of tunnel a day (with that kind of productivity, perhaps it’s time to subcontract them for the Second Avenue subway project).“This book reflects the extraordinary body of work carried out by biologists who have devoted years, often whole lifetimes, to the patient observation of animals in the field and in the lab, and to designing ingenious experiments to learn why animals behave in the ways they do,” Uhlenbroek writes. The third and largest section, on animal behavior, reflects that focus.This part sprawls over several hundred pages and explains why animals do the things they do, from hunting to defending themselves to reproducing and communicating. The text is concise and lively, keeping the general reader in mind while not dumbing down the subject.'"
"'08-12-07,'0','Honda’s entry is the 2009 DN-01, an intergalactic-looking bike with a V-twin engine and a continuously variable transmission, or C.V.T. This $14,599 luxury cruiser has a seat height of just 27 inches and features that include an antilock brake system that is linked front-to-rear. A somewhat more conventional design, the Aprilia Mana 850, also makes its debut with a C.V.T. But its transmission design is quite different from the Honda’s.Inventors as far back as Leonardo da Vinci have been attracted to the C.V.T. idea and have come up with several ways to achieve the same goal of juggling drive ratios in a seamless fashion. The big difference between a C.V.T. and a typical automatic transmission is that the C.V.T. can deliver an infinite range of gear ratios in a silky continuum; conventional automatics, by contrast, have up to eight fixed ratios.C.V.T.’s are more widely used than many people realize. In addition to scooters, snowmobiles are equipped with C.V.T.’s, as are vehicles offered by Audi, Mini, Nissan and other makers.Straddling the Mana 850 for the first time, a rider is likely to get the feeling that something is missing. A glance at the left handlebar solves the mystery: there is no clutch lever.The Mana’s clutch is a centrifugal type that engages and disengages as engine r.p.m. rises and falls — no pull on a handlebar lever is needed. Neither does the Mana have the customary tachometer; there is little need for one when the shifting decisions are out of your hands. I found that the absence of these features freed my mind to savor the passing scenery — more than I might on a bike that invites one to consider engine r.p.m. and select another gear.The $9,899 Mana is powered by an 850 cc V-twin engine with little vibration and very pleasant power delivery. At first, pulling away from a stoplight on the Mana feels like riding a bike with a severely slipping clutch. No, it’s actually more like riding a giant Vespa.That’s with good reason; Piaggio, Aprilia’s parent company, owns Vespa. As a result, the company has plenty of experience with the type of C.V.T. that uses variable-diameter pulleys, the most popular design.In this arrangement, a V-belt connects two pulleys with angled sides. The pulley sides can move closer together or farther apart, repositioning where the V-belt rides. The effective change in pulley diameters varies the ratio of engine speed to rear-wheel speed, doing the job normally handled by steel gears in a manual transmission. A control chip adjusts the spacing of the pulley halves according to what the rider is asking the bike to do: accelerate, slow down or cruise at a steady speed.One of the strongest cues a motorcycle delivers to its rider is the sound and feel of the engine’s rotational speed rising and falling as the gears are shifted. But listening to the Mana’s engine speed meandering modestly under computer control can be deceptive. The bike accelerates from 60 m.p.h. to 80 m.p.h. for a typical passing maneuver so subtly that a glance at the speedometer is advised to discover just how quickly the speed has piled up. The C.V.T. is programmed to keep the engine running near its 5,000 r.p.m. torque peak, where strong acceleration is always available. Pulling away from a stoplight on the Mana is endearingly brisk — like a Vespa, but much quicker.To satisfy customers who still want to change gears for themselves, Aprilia has built what it calls a sequential mode into the C.V.T. This mode lets the rider select among seven fixed ratios using a conventional left-foot shift pedal or by a switch on the left handlebar.In fully automatic mode, the rider can select among touring, sport and “rain” settings that optimize the shifting for everyday riding, maximum acceleration or soft power delivery to preserve traction on slippery roads. I found that leaving the Mana in touring mode and forgetting the other options provided rapid and satisfying riding. The handling is deft and the brakes are formidable.After the bike is stopped, the Mana rider engages the parking brake using a lever on the bike’s left flank. A parking brake? With the ignition shut off, the centrifugal clutch leaves the rear wheel disconnected from the engine, requiring a parking brake to prevent accidental rollaway on sloping pavement.The Mana 850’s styling might be described as coming from the late-origami school of motorcycle design. What looks like a fuel tank turns out to be a hinged lid covering a lighted storage area large enough to hold a full-face helmet and includes a 12-volt power outlet for recharging a cellphone. The actual fuel tank is under the seat. Features like these combine to make the Mana an appealing choice both for commuting and for overnight trips.Honda calls the DN-01’s compact hydromechanical automatic transmission an H.F.T., which stands for human-friendly transmission. Envisioning what’s inside is a bit of a brain-buster.The bike’s 680 cc V-twin engine powers a hydraulic pump, which has seven pistons arranged in a circle, like the cylinder of a revolver. Driven by a wobbling plate, the pump sequentially pressurizes fluid in the cylinders.At the other end of the device is a 7-cylinder hydraulic motor powered by the fluid pressure. This motor also sits on a wobbling plate whose angle can be varied by an electric motor to accomplish drive-ratio changes. The rider can also select a manual-shifting mode that provides six fixed-drive ratios for that old-time feeling of changing gears.The H.F.T. has been in development since the 1950s, and Honda says that the transmission, which is also used in some of its all-terrain vehicles, requires no scheduled maintenance. It was first used in a motor scooter called the Juno M85 in 1962. At the heart of the design is a patent licensed from an Italian machine-tool builder.In another sign that motorcycle manufacturers are paying attention to ease of use, Yamaha has equipped its FJR1300AE sport-touring bike with a computer-controlled clutch. It too deletes the left-hand clutch lever, and the $16,290 machine pulls away from a stop with only a gentle twist of the throttle.Inside the engine cases lurks a conventional 5-speed manual transmission, however, so the rider changes ratios with either a push-pull control on the left handlebar or by using the traditional left-foot shift pedal. Removing some of the wrist strain and complexity from motorcycle riding is clearly on the makers’ minds these days.'"
"'08-12-07,'0','“You can try the newest equipment on the market and change it up as often as you like,” based on that day’s snow conditions, said Dan Sherman, a spokesman at . Many rental stores also offer ski valets or overnight storage so you don’t have to carry your gear to and from the lifts every day.A four-day sport package for renting skis, poles and boots at Breckenridge in Colorado is $125 a person through Ski.com, just $45 more than checking two bags round trip on most carriers.Keep an eye out for two-for-one discounts, which ski shops tend to offer periodically throughout the season. For example, Ski.com offers up to two free rentals for children age 12 and under with two paid adult demo rentals for five days each at most major resorts out West. At Winter Park Resort in Colorado, that comes to $330 for a family of four renting skis for five days, compared with at least $120 if each family member checked a ski bag on one of the major carriers. If two of those bags were counted as a second bag instead, as would be the case if the family checked four ski bags and two suitcases, the cost for checking would be closer to $220.SnowSports Industries America, known as SIA, a trade association representing winter sports companies, has started an advertising campaign called Ship Your Gear to promote shipping as an alternative to airline baggage fees. “As though gas prices, economic concerns and weren’t bad enough for our industry, now airline baggage fees are adding yet another travel fee for consumers,” states the Web site, . “This SIA initiative, Ship Your Gear, fights back against the airlines and declining equipment sales, letting consumers know that shipping their own gear is an easy alternative.”For example, shipping an average ski or snowboard bag via Ground takes three days from to Vail, and is just $23.49, according to , which offers a list of sample rates for shipping a 25-pound, standard-size (72 by 12 by 8 inches) ski or snowboard bag. That’s about $8.50 more than the $15 several airlines now charge for the first checked bag. Shipping the same bag from to Aspen costs $32.44, taking four days.SNOWLINK.COM also offers a cheat sheet for travelers checking snow sports gear. One tip: Watch your bag’s weight. Bags that weigh more than 50 pounds but less than 70 can incur a $50 charge each way. And while most airlines count a ski and boot bag as one piece of luggage, airline policies do not specifically address so-called double bags, which can handle two pairs of skis in one piece of luggage. Two people traveling together using a double bag may be at the mercy of the check-in employee when it comes to fees, according to Snowlink. The same goes for duffel bags with a boot compartment.Some airlines recently adjusted some of the checked luggage fees they had instituted earlier this year. United, which had planned to increase its domestic second-bag fee from $25 to $50 one way, will now keep the fee at $25. The new checked-bag fees that Delta adopted as part of its merger with Northwest, will apply to customers who purchased tickets on or after Nov. 6 for domestic travel on or after Dec. 5. Customers who purchased Delta tickets on or before Nov. 5, 2008 and who are traveling on or after Dec. 5 will be charged $50 for a second bag, but will be permitted to check their first bag without charge pursuant to Delta’s previous policy.Some airlines offer a discount on checked bag fees when you pay for it online. United, for example, is offering customers a 20 percent discount on the fee to check a first bag when they pay for it on from now to Jan. 31, 2009.Airlines that don’t charge for the first checked bag include , and Virgin America. doesn’t charge a fee for the first or second checked bag. Travelers flying in first or business class are exempt from the fees, and frequent fliers with elite status can generally avoid the new checked bag charges.Of course, expert packers can avoid most luggage fees. It’s not uncommon to see travelers with boots slung over their shoulders in International Airport, for instance.Dan Keller, a skier from , points out that most airlines count a ski bag and boot bag as one piece of luggage, not two. “You can usually jam a bunch of clothes in the bag with the boots and even around skis in a ski bag,” he said. “The clothes also help to pad the skis and bindings.”'"

"'08-12-07,'0','A cursory survey of Princess Gloria’s loft confirms her obsession, with pieces by Cristoph Steinmeyer, Thomas Ruff, Jean-Michel Othoniel, Andy Warhol, Bill Viola and Arnold von Wedemeyer fighting for attention. (She also has a healthy collection of work by art stars like Anselm Kiefer, Paul McCarthy and Jeff Koons at her main residence, Schloss St. Emmeram, the sprawling Thurn und Taxis palace in Regensburg that in her words “makes Buckingham Palace look like a hut.”)But it’s the row of photographs on a living room bookshelf — framed snapshots of Princess Gloria, her three children, her mother and her sister with Pope John Paul II and his successor, her friend Pope Benedict XVI — that reveals her greatest passion, for which she is more than happy to proselytize. Princess Gloria has assumed many roles: fairy tale bride, couture-wearing paparazzi bait, businesswoman, regent for her under-age son after the death of her husband. Yet despite her unrelenting candor, even on the thorniest of topics, her latest incarnation, as an unfiltered messenger of God, may turn out to be the hardest for her to pull off.“A lot of people refer to my conversion,” said Princess Gloria, who spent part of her childhood in Togo and Somalia, where her father was stationed with the German Foreign Office, “but my parents raised us as Catholics. And even when I was partying and going to Studio 54, I was still attending church — maybe just not the early Mass.”She attributes her wholehearted immersion in the Roman Catholic Church to the death of her husband in 1990, which left her with not only three children to raise but also with debts and inheritance taxes estimated at the time to be more than $350 million. To regain her financial footing, she sold off some of the family’s satellite businesses, including a bank, two breweries and — in a move that didn’t sit well with some members of the Thurn und Taxis clan — much of the family jewelry and silver.“When my husband died, I found myself with many problems but no one to speak to about them for the most part,” she recalled, as she served a lunch of soup and spaghetti prepared by her cook, Maria, who travels with her around the world. (In addition to Schloss St. Emmeram and the New York loft, Princess Gloria also owns an apartment in Paris and an oceanfront property in Watamu, Kenya.) “That crisis was when I really went back to praying regularly.”Since then, she has been a major donor to the church, hosted conservative Catholic salons and liturgical concerts in Rome, made numerous trips to Lourdes as a volunteer under the auspices of the Order of Malta and recently released a book of her conversations with Cardinal Joachim Meisner (an outspoken conservative who, when not trying to outlaw abortion in Germany, has branded modern art “degenerate”).It’s hard to reconcile Gloria the Devout with the image of her as a party animal who was once caught in possession of hashish at Munich Airport, though it makes perfect sense in the gospel according to Gloria. “Catholicism is a very sensual religion, which means that flesh and soul are compatible,” she said in a husky, Teutonic tone that is fitting for someone with a rosary’s worth of Germanic names. “It’s not a mental religion that denies the body. And so drinking, partying and having fun is part of the religion.”Not all of her urges are so neatly reconciled. Princess Gloria, who once had Keith Haring design one of her birthday parties, has many gay friends. But despite having been a kind of Cyndi Lauper of the Shiny Set, she believes that homosexuality is contra natura — at least according to her disparaging comments about homosexuals in interviews. (She also told a German television host in 2001 that Africa had a high incidence of AIDS because “blacks like to copulate a lot,” a statement she tried to amend earlier this year by explaining that the reason for this was the continent’s intense heat.)With that in mind, I asked Princess Gloria if she had heard the rumors that her friendship with Princess Alessandra Borghese, a fellow conservative Catholic, was of the biblical kind. “Yes,” she said. “But I don’t think that it really matters. I think that everyone has the right to decide for him- or herself what they want to do behind bedroom doors, and no one of us would ever judge that. And I don’t think the Catholic Church does that.” (This might be news to gay Catholics.)It’s tempting to see such quotable contortions as shrewd attempts to garner publicity by someone who has lived most of her adult life under the scrutiny of the press. After all, many of her more controversial media appearances have coincided with the debut of one of her business ventures, which include everything from books to the licensing of a Thurn und Taxis board game, in which she sadly does not feature as a character. And she’s also, by her own admission, aware that her reputation as “the crazy woman who used to have the crazy hair” doesn’t hurt her attempts to turn the family palace into a tourist destination. (Plans to convert parts of St. Emmeram into a hotel were scrapped, but she does rent out the quadrangle for a musical festival in July and an outdoor market at Christmastime.)Those close to Princess Gloria insist that the disconnect between her lifestyle and her belief system is just one of the many contradictions that have always defined her. “The odd thing about Gloria,” said her brother Alexander von Schönburg, “is that she is riddled with paradoxes. On the one hand, she is staunchly conservative, even reactionary; on the other, she is a total free spirit who enjoys reading G. K. Chesterton as much as William Burroughs.”The filmmaker Caroline Haertel, who recently finished shooting “My Life: Gloria von Thurn und Taxis,” a documentary to be released next year, agrees. “Gloria sees the humanity in all people,” Haertel said, “so she can embrace contradictions like admiring the pope and having a friendly conversation with a well-known whore in Hamburg. People either love her or hate her, but she always speaks her mind.”Princess Gloria wouldn’t have it any other way. As she explained in reference to Cardinal Meisner: “I think it’s far more interesting to talk to somebody who is less wishy-washy and tells you straight what they think. Everyone is trying to please everyone else nowadays.”At the height of her obloquy, Princess Gloria famously barked like a dog on David Letterman’s television talk show. “I really wish he would invite me on again,” she said. “I remember those two visits to his show fondly, and I have changed so much since then.” In the event that Letterman extends another invitation, it will be interesting to see if Princess Gloria reprises the Rin Tin Tin act or assumes the more pastoral role of German shepherd.[?][?][?] HORACIO SILVA'"

"'08-12-07,'0','There is inescapable irony in this week’s entire edition of the magazine being devoted to the subject of screens. Screens are the face, as it were, of the very technology that poses the biggest threat to conventional print media.Rather than avoid the topic, however, The New York Times confronts it head on with an insightful, wide-ranging treatise on the subject. It is that sort of courageous objectivity that endears this paper to its readers, many of whom will not be relinquishing their preference for the printed page any time soon.Rather than a harbinger of a dubious digital future, this issue may be a challenge to the technology that would violate our screen-free, Sunday-morning sanctity. Was that merely the “thwack” of The Times hitting my driveway this morning, or was it the sound of a gauntlet landing at the feet of its adversary?'"

"'08-12-08,'1','“Studs used to say, I tape, therefore I am,” said Katrina vanden Heuvel, The Nation’s editor in chief. “Only one other person used the tape recorder with as much fervor: Richard Nixon.”The program for the tribute contained a favorite Terkel quotation: “If I did one thing I’m proud of, it’s to make people feel that together they count.”In the 1960s, André Schiffrin, who ran Pantheon Books at the time, was looking for someone to write a book about the lives of ordinary Americans, and he enlisted Mr. Terkel, then a well-known radio host. Mr. Terkel went into Chicago’s working-class neighborhoods with his tape recorder and produced “Division Street,” the first of his many best-selling books of oral history.“Studs was able to get the best out of people,” said Mr. Schiffrin, now director of The New Press, Mr. Terkel’s publisher when he died. “He understood the country. He understood its past. He understood its culture in a way that very few people I have ever met could do.”At the tribute, Mr. Terkel was embraced by friends who praised him as an unapologetic and courageous man of the left.“If he had an ism, his ism was underdog-ism,” said Ms. vanden Heuvel.Mr. Zinn said: “One of the things you learn from him is this incurable optimism. Not that everything’s going to be O.K., but that human beings are essentially good, maybe not all human beings, but enough human beings to change the world, and that’s all we want.”In 1952, when Senator Joseph McCarthy was campaigning to purge government and the news media of Communists, NBC kicked Mr. Terkel off his Chicago television show because of his habit of signing leftist petitions. “He never met a petition he didn’t like,” said his son, Dan Terkell, who changed the spelling of his surname.His son told of his father’s hearing a new folk music group in the 1930s and then asking his wife, Ida, at 2 a.m. to take in the group, which included Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, for the night.“I honestly don’t know whether there is a heaven or hell,” said his son, and then referring to Senator McCarthy said, “But I would guess that Tail Gunner Joe and my father are not in the same place.”Then, to huge applause, he borrowed one of his father’s favorite phrases, saying: “Here’s to you, Pop. Take it easy. But take it.”'"
"'08-12-08,'1','The officers said they believed they saw Mr. Mineo smoking marijuana outside the subway station and chased him into the station. In the course of an ensuing struggle, Mr. Mineo said he was pinned by three officers while a fourth officer shoved an object into his rectum, an assertion that the police have said was not supported by civilian witnesses. Mr. Mineo was hospitalized for four days after the encounter and then readmitted days later to a different hospital.The police, the Brooklyn district attorney’s office, which impaneled the grand jury, and members of the police union refused on Sunday to comment on the Mineo case or discuss the charges against the officers.But now that the grand jury, which met for the first time on Oct. 28, has appeared to have reached a conclusion, the focus of the case will shift to the legal strategies that the prosecution and the defense might employ.Indictments of police officers for actions while on duty are unusual, and convictions are even rarer. Lawyers who have been involved in past police trials said Officer Kern could claim that the assault happened accidentally, while the officers struggled to subdue Mr. Mineo, or that the injuries were caused by a separate episode. Officer Kern, who has been on the force at least four years, had no disciplinary record, according to his lawyer, John D. Patten.Mr. Patten said on Sunday night that because he had not seen Mr. Mineo’s medical records, he knew nothing about his injuries or medical condition beyond the fact that Mr. Mineo’s lawyers have said he was admitted to two hospitals at different times.“We very much want to see these records and have them carefully examined by our medical experts,” Mr. Patten said. He added, “I’ve said frequently and repeatedly that Officer Kern denies these charges and did nothing improper and at no time did he shove or push anything into Mr. Mineo’s rectum.”As the case proceeds, the other two officers charged in the case could disassociate themselves from Officer Kern and his actions in building their own defense, said Marvyn M. Kornberg, a lawyer who represented one of the five police officers charged with torturing Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, in a precinct house in 1997.While parallels have been made between the Mineo and Louima cases, Mr. Louima’s injuries were far more grave and required him to undergo emergency surgery and to be hospitalized for two months.In handing up the indictments, the grand jury appeared to have given weight to the testimony of a transit officer who was involved in Mr. Mineo’s arrest. The officer, Kevin Maloney, told grand jurors that he saw Officer Kern shove or push a baton against Mr. Mineo’s buttocks, according to accounts of his testimony. The other two officers involved in the encounter were Noel Jugraj and Andrew Morales.Stephen C. Jackson, one of Mr. Mineo’s lawyers, appeared on the Rev. Al Sharpton’s radio program on Sunday morning and said Mr. Mineo would sue the city for violating his civil rights. Mr. Mineo also called in to the program to express his gratitude for the grand jury’s decision, as well as Officer Maloney’s testimony.“I do appreciate him coming forward and verifying my claim, my story,” Mr. Mineo said.In a separate interview on Sunday, Mr. Jackson said Mr. Mineo would continue psychological and physical treatment.Mr. Mineo’s lawyers have not released their client’s hospital records, saying they were awaiting the grand jury’s decision and also wanted to preserve their client’s privacy.Mr. Jackson said the attack left Mr. Mineo with a tear to his rectum that became abscessed and had to be surgically drained. In earlier interviews, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Mineo’s other lawyer, Kevin L. Mosley, said the hospital records showed that Mr. Mineo had suffered from an “anal assault,” and that the diagnosis reflected an independent medical conclusion. One law enforcement official said Mr. Mineo suffered a tear to his rectum that was both internal and external.Legal experts said Mr. Mineo’s medical records would play a crucial role in determining the course the case will take.“The more serious the injuries, the more implausible the ‘it was an accident’ theory becomes,” said Alan Vinegrad, who was the lead prosecutor in the Louima case.Another crucial piece of evidence will be what, if any, DNA evidence is found on the retractable police baton allegedly used in the assault. A law enforcement official has said that early forensic tests on one officer’s equipment found no presence of hair, fibers, bodily tissue, fecal matter or blood, though the results of more sophisticated DNA tests have not been revealed.Rae Koshetz, a former Police Department deputy commissioner of trials who presided over administrative hearings of officers, said the defense would almost certainly bring in a medical expert who could gauge how much force would have been necessary to inflict Mr. Mineo’s wounds, and if indeed they could have been caused by the attack he described.In weighing the charges against Officer Kern, jurors would also have to measure if his intent was to inflict pain on a man after he had tried to flee from the police.The contents of Mr. Mineo’s medical records were “critical,” Ms. Koshetz, said because they could reveal what sort of instrument caused Mr. Mineo’s injuries and when they were inflicted.“If an expert said that there’s no way in his or her opinion that this could happen by accident, that’s pretty damning evidence,” she said.'"
"'08-12-08,'1','The search continued on Sunday for Laura Garza, the 25-year-old Brooklyn woman who vanished on Wednesday and was last seen with a convicted sex offender. The authorities also sought other women whom the sex offender may have approached.The sex offender, Michael Mele, 23, was in the Rockland County Jail, where he was being held on a probation violation, according to Detective Lt. William Barbera of the Rockland County sheriff’s office.Mr. Mele was sentenced to probation in cases involving forcibly touching four women at the Palisades Center mall in Rockland County, according to an employee of the State Division of Criminal Justice Services’ sex-offender registry.The probation violation, for drinking and failing to report to a probation officer, is unrelated to the disappearance of Ms. Garza, the authorities said. He turned himself in to the police in Newburgh, N.Y., on an unrelated charge on Friday and was then charged with the probation violation.In a statement released on Sunday, the New York State Police, the agency heading the investigation into Ms. Garza’s disappearance, said that Mr. Mele “has a history of being sexually aggressive toward women and confronting women in secluded areas to perform lewd acts.”The agency said it was seeking information from women he may have approached but who never reported those contacts.'"
"'08-12-08,'1','Certainly the evidence against University Hospital was strong. In 2006, patients at University were three times as likely to develop infections stemming from hospitals as were patients at the average New York hospital. HealthGrades, a company that rates hospitals using data from , ranks University among the least safe hospitals in the — although the hospital’s executives strongly dispute that assertion. University, meanwhile, is expensive to run.Yet, today, University remains under state ownership. And far from shrinking, University is expanding.Unlike some other nations, including , the United States has no federal agency charged with hospital oversight. Instead, it relies on a patchwork of state health departments and a nonprofit group called the Joint Commission that sets basic quality standards for the nation. Hospitals are rarely closed or hit with significant financial penalties for hurting patients.One of the reasons is that even troubled hospitals are major employers, and communities generally rally behind them when they face the threat of cuts, as Syracuse did for University.“We haven’t been forthright about the dirty little secret, the huge variation of quality and safety in the system,” said Arthur Aaron Levin, director of the Center for Medical Consumers, a nonprofit patient advocacy group. Nearly a decade after the report, preventable errors remain shockingly common, said Mr. Levin, who was a member of the commission that wrote the report.“It’s nine years later, and we can’t even tell you if it’s better,” Mr. Levin said. “How is that permissible?”Any effort to maintain national standards is left largely to Medicare and the Joint Commission, a nonprofit group based in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., which along with state health departments certifies that hospitals are operating safely.But the commission lacks the heft and enforcement powers of a federal regulator. With fewer than 1,000 employees, it accredits and sets patient safety goals for 17,000 hospitals, and assisted-living providers nationally. A typical survey lasts less than a week and involves fewer than a half-dozen examiners, said Dr. Mark R. Chassin, the president of the Joint Commission.Hospitals account for the largest single slice of the nation’s medical spending, 31 percent, or about $650 billion in 2007, according to Medicare. Despite that enormous bill, hospital care is uneven, and often deadly. In 1999, a report from the Institute of Medicine found that hospital errors caused as many as 98,000 deaths a year in the United States.Medicare is pressing for quality improvements, using as leverage the $155 billion it spends on hospital care annually. But Herb Kuhn, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Services, said hospitals would not make patient safety their top priority until Medicare changed its reimbursement system.At present, Medicare pays the same amount to a hospital for treating a patient, whether that patient lives or dies — even if the hospital made a preventable error that caused the patient’s death. On Oct. 1, Medicare began a project to end payments for a handful of “hospital-acquired conditions,” Medicare-speak for illnesses caused by preventable errors. But the program is scheduled to reduce reimbursement by only $21 million in 2009, not enough to make a major difference, Mr. Kuhn said.“We’ve got to get our payment systems changed,” he said.While Medicare experiments, states are making their own halting efforts to improve quality while lowering costs. Among the first was New York, which in April 2005 created an 18-member panel to make systematic recommendations about which hospitals and nursing homes should be closed statewide.The need for change is acute in New York, which has among the most dysfunctional and expensive health-care systems in the nation. In 2004, New Yorkers and their insurers spent an average of $6,535 for each patient on health care, 24 percent more than the national average. Yet New Yorkers are more likely to die from chronic disease than people in any other state.The legislation that created the panel, generally called the Berger Commission, after its chairman, Stephen Berger, provided that its recommendations would become law unless lawmakers overruled them.But the legislation also provided that the state Health Department, not the commission itself, would enforce the commission’s recommendations. That loophole would eventually prove crucial.On Nov. 30, 2006, after studying the state’s health-care system for almost two years, the commission announced that nine hospitals should close and 50 others should shrink or merge. Among the commission’s recommendations was that University Hospital be joined with Crouse Hospital, its neighbor in Syracuse, and that the new hospital have fewer than 600 beds, compared with the 366 beds at University and 576 beds at Crouse, a private nonprofit hospital.Both hospitals had problems. In 2006, patients at University had a 1-in-37 chance of suffering postoperative blood infections, compared with a 1-in-65 chance statewide, according to the Niagara Health Quality Consortium, a nonprofit group that analyzes hospital billing records.They had an 8.6 percent chance of dying from , compared with a 5.5 percent chance statewide. Like HealthGrades, Niagara tries to adjust the data so that hospitals are not penalized if the patients they treat are sicker to begin with than those that the average hospital treats.Crouse, for its part, had filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001 and was running at 50 percent occupancy. Of all the commission’s recommendations, merging University and Crouse “was the most obvious,” Mr. Berger, an investment banker, said in a recent interview.But University and Crouse disagreed. Days after the commission released its report, Dr. David R. Smith, the president of Upstate Medical University, the state-run medical school that owns University Hospital, began lobbying , then the governor, and Dr. Richard Daines, the state health commissioner, to undo the recommendation.“We’re a university, not just a hospital,” said Dr. Smith, who took over Upstate in September 2006.Dr. Smith and other officials at University say that the patient safety statistics are misleading because they do not fully capture the fact that the hospital treats very sick patients.Dr. David Duggan, an associate dean at Upstate Medical, said that other surveys show that University Hospital’s patient safety record is generally on par with other hospitals. “There are some areas where I think we are above average,” Dr. Duggan said, “and other areas where I think we need to work.”In his battle to keep University independent of Crouse, Dr. Smith had a powerful ally: the hospital’s unions. Most hospital employees in New York, including those at Crouse, are represented by Local 1199. But those at University are represented by state employees’ unions, which have richer contracts than 1199. In 2007, University Hospital received a state subsidy of $42.2 million, about $2,500 for each patient it admitted, to make up the difference. Not surprisingly, University unions paid for television advertisements, lobbied lawmakers and filed a lawsuit to overturn the recommendations.Within Syracuse, University also had support. The medical school and hospital are by far the largest employer in the city. “They employ people at decent jobs,” said James Tallon, the president of the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit group that studies health care in . “And the money comes from — money comes from elsewhere.”By spring 2007, the state Health Department backed off the plan to join University and Crouse, saying both could remain open and independent.But Mr. Berger, whose commission had no authority after it filed its report in late 2006, says the public would be better off if the state had followed its recommendation by folding University into Crouse.“The place that I’m most unhappy about,” he said, “is Syracuse.”Sharon Yacketta, 56, has not had an easy life: four brief marriages, three children given up for adoption, six months in jail for welfare fraud. She lives in a two-room apartment near downtown Syracuse, with dingy gray carpets and a hulking black television.On March 12, 2004, she entered University Hospital for an operation by Dr. Lai to relieve her incontinence. But during the surgery, a suture punctured her right ureter — the duct connecting the kidney to the bladder — and urine began leaking into her abdomen, according to a lawsuit she has filed against University that takes its details directly from her medical records.Then the errors snowballed, according to the complaint, which lays out in flatly clinical language three years of suffering.Ms. Yacketta suffered near-fatal infections, endured severe pain and watched in horror as urine and stool leaked from her body. Since the first surgery, she has had at least 19 operations. In October 2005, she moved to St. Joseph’s Hospital, which by many measures is the highest-rated hospital in Syracuse.Since then, she has been under the care of Dr. B. Sivikumar, director of St. Joseph’s surgical intensive care unit. Dr. Sivikumar said that Ms. Yacketta’s continuing problems were very likely caused by the initial operations at University.After examining Ms. Yacketta’s claims, Dr. Jonathan Fine, a retired internist and founder of At Your Side, a nonprofit group that trains volunteers as bedside advocates for patients, said University had repeatedly made preventable errors in her care.“This case alone merits, from ground up, a total revamping of the procedures that are in place in that hospital, and the culture of the hospital,” Dr. Fine said.Dr. Duggan said he could not comment specifically on Ms. Yacketta’s suit but cautioned against reading too much into any one case. “We are not going to be able to prevent every problem from occurring,” he said.Other lawsuits, and reports from the state Health Department, also point to problems at University. A 2005 state report refers to a case of surgery on an infant in which “generally accepted standards of professional care were not consistently provided,” leading the infant to be discharged prematurely and return in less than 48 hours with .Another report, after a surgery in December 2006 in which doctors operated on the wrong part of the body, criticizes the hospital for failing to make changes promised after another “wrong-site surgery” two years before.Dr. Smith said he had made patient safety a priority for University. “It is a major focus of this institution,” he said.But without faster and more accurate data gathering, no one outside University — or any other hospital — can know whether it is doing a good job, or penalize it if it is not, said Dr. Donald Berwick, the president of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a national nonprofit group trying to reduce hospital mistakes.“We need to act with more speed and diligence to stop practice where it’s actively harmful,” Dr. Berwick said. “Let the needs of patients come first, not the needs of a hospital.”'"
"'08-12-08,'1','DETROIT — The Sunday service at Greater Grace Temple began with the Clark Sisters song “I’m Looking for a Miracle” and included a reading of this verse from the Book of Romans: “I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.”Pentecostal Bishop Charles H. Ellis III, who shared the sanctuary’s wide altar with three gleaming sport utility vehicles, closed his sermon by leading the choir and congregants in a boisterous rendition of the gospel singer Myrna Summers’s “We’re Gonna Make It” as hundreds of worshipers who work in the automotive industry — union assemblers, executives, car salesmen — gathered six deep around the altar to have their foreheads anointed with consecrated oil.While Congress debated aid to the foundering Detroit automakers Sunday, many here whose future hinges on the decision turned to prayer.Outside the Corpus Christi Catholic Church, a sign beckoned passers-by inside to hear about “God’s bailout plan.” Roman Catholic churches in the Detroit area distributed a four-page letter from Cardinal Adam Maida, the archbishop, offering “some pastoral insights and suggestions about how we might prepare to celebrate Christmas this year when economic conditions are so grim.”In the letter, Cardinal Maida acknowledged that “things in Michigan will probably never be the same” but encourages the region’s 1.3 million Catholics to maintain their faith. “At this darkest time of the year, we proclaim that Christ is our light and Christ is our hope,” he wrote.'"
"'08-12-08,'1','Some analysts had hoped the worst was over after October’s market shocks, which spooked consumers and choked off credit.Instead, Americans retrenched even further in November, sending sales at the nation’s retailers tumbling to the weakest level in more than 35 years and leading the Detroit automakers to record their worst sales in a quarter-century. Manufacturers have not seen conditions this bad since 1982.The decline in spending is likely to continue, depriving the economy of its primary growth engine, as layoffs continue to mount. Half a million Americans, from financial analysts to factory workers, were dismissed in November alone. Rarely has a labor downturn affected such a broad swath of income levels.Most frightening of all is that the worst job losses may be yet to come. If history is any guide, millions more Americans could lose their jobs before businesses start to expand again.The worst jolts to the labor market tend to be only the precursor of six months or more of additional layoffs. Employment suffered a major contraction in December 1981 and January 1982, and workers did not see a stable market for about 10 months, including another big round of layoffs in July 1982.A similar pattern occurred in the other great postwar recession, in 1974, when several months of a stagnant labor market were followed by a violent contraction over the new year. After the worst month, December 1974, the job market took about six more months to stabilize.So in the best case — where November’s 533,000 lost jobs signals the bottom of the labor market contraction — workers could face six more months or so of hard times.“We’ll be lucky if the unemployment rate is below double digits by the end of next year,” said Jared Bernstein, who will be the chief economic adviser to Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. “Even if the economy improves, the growth won’t be enough to rehire laid-off workers, much less absorb those coming into the labor force.”There is no guarantee, of course, that November’s numbers will be the worst of the current round of layoffs. Even before Lehman Brothers collapsed, employers were on the defensive, cutting more than 400,000 jobs after Labor Day.Now that the full magnitude of the financial crisis is apparent, companies are tightening their belts further. Just last week, AT&T, Credit Suisse, DuPont and Viacom announced deep cuts. Layoffs are expected in the financial and automotive industries after the new year.“This current environment requires action, and that’s what we’re doing,” said Mohammed Nakhooda, a spokesman for Nortel Networks, the maker of telecommunications equipment, which has lost business this fall from large corporate clients cutting costs.Nortel, based in Toronto, said it would cut about 1,300 jobs, or 5 percent of its work force, including some at its United States operations. It will also begin a hiring freeze and cut back on employee travel.“It’s tough but it’s necessary,” Mr. Nakhooda said. “The business environment has obviously changed pretty drastically over a short period of time.”Some economists predict that the economy could lose as many jobs in the first six months of 2009 as the entirety of 2008. Nearly two million jobs have been lost since the start of the recession last year, two-thirds of them since September. Still, some forecasters say the pessimistic talk may be overblown, and possibly a problem in itself.“The numbers are giving us a darker view than is actually the case,” said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisors, a research firm, adding that some of the economic indicators that have been flashing red are based on subjective surveys of businesses and households.“There is such a thing as self-fulfilling prophecy,” he said.Americans who are lucky enough to still collect a paycheck are likely to save more, cut back on luxury items and restaurants, and channel more of their income into savings accounts for college and retirement.“Even Americans who still have a job are looking around and saying, ‘Well, you know, how much longer?’ ” said Joshua Shapiro, chief domestic economist at MFR, a research firm.All of this is likely to make many people hesitant to invest any money they do have. Many Americans chose to save over the last two decades by investing in stocks and real estate. Now, the jar-in-the-kitchen approach may return, analysts said.“It is quite conceivable — many would say probable — that the severe asset price collapses that have occurred in both equity and real estate will prompt a lasting increase in the desired saving rate, at least on the part of many consumers,” Ed McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note last week.Those who benefit from the downturn could be those still willing to take a trip to the mall, where they will find deep discounts on a range of products. First-time home buyers may also find deals, as long as they can obtain a mortgage — no easy task in a time of tight credit.Many economists pointed to government stimulus as the way out of the economic mess, and they applauded the federal government’s announcement that it might try to drive down interest rates on mortgages to 4.5 percent, about one percentage point lower than current rates.A major stimulus package is also expected to be announced in January or February, soon after Mr. Obama takes office. Economists hope the package will create jobs and stimulate spending, and many predict that economic growth will improve slightly after this quarter with the federal help.In an address taped for broadcast Saturday morning on radio and YouTube, Mr. Obama committed to the largest public works program since the creation of the interstate highway system a half century ago. “We need action — and action now,” he said.Still, analysts said that government assistance would probably not result in a full recovery by May, which would signify the 16-month point of the recession. That would match the record for the longest postwar recession, set in 1975 and reached again in 1982.“Up until mid-September, a plausible scenario was that it would be a short and shallow recession,” said Edward Yardeni, the investment strategist. “After mid-September, it became quite obvious that that was wishful thinking.”'"
"'08-12-08,'1','Lawmakers have indicated they may give G.M. and Chrysler about $15 billion in emergency aid to keep them in business until the spring, when the Obama administration and the new Congress can craft a longer-term rescue plan.Throughout four hearings on Capitol Hill, the chief executives of G.M., Ford and Chrysler have tried to assure lawmakers that all they need is temporary assistance until the sick economy and the depressed auto market recover.G.M.’s chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner, tried to assure Congress last week that G.M. can be profitable again with $18 billion in federal loans and an aggressive reorganization plan.“Our plan is far reaching and extensive,” Mr. Wagoner said. “It is a different way of thinking and our team is committed to achieving it.”Still, there are many variables that could derail the Big Three’s recovery plans.Despite an infusion of $700 billion into financial institutions, there are few signs that car loans are becoming more available to consumers — a critical component in any rebound in vehicle sales, which have fallen to their lowest level in 25 years in the United States.Important foreign markets in Europe and Asia are also deteriorating, further reducing revenues at G.M. and Ford.And Detroit is also facing huge bills — interest payments on their enormous debt loads, large contributions to health care trusts for retired hourly workers as well as tens of billions of dollars in expenses to meet stringent new government fuel-economy requirements.The magnitude of the companies’ obligations left some lawmakers groping for answers during the testimony of the Big Three executives.“Do we know what we’re doing? Do we know what we’re trying to achieve?” asked Representative Peter King, Republican of New York. “If I was reasonably convinced that the money was going to work, I would support it.”Detroit has lost tens of billions of dollars in recent years; credibility has evaporated among investors and analysts who have seen a series of reorganization efforts and new products fail to produce a lasting turnaround.The fact that the companies first asked for $25 billion in mid-November, then upped the ante to $34 billion two weeks later hardly gave lawmakers confidence in the automakers’ current plans.“I don’t want to send you home again because it’s going to get more expensive in another two weeks,” Representative Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of New York, said at last Friday’s hearing.Because it is the biggest and most troubled of the automakers, G.M. generated the most skepticism with its plan. The company says that it needs $10 billion to get through March, another $2 billion for the remainder of 2009, and a $6 billion line of credit beyond that.But this is a company that has lost $20 billion so far this year, spent $2 billion a month in cash since July, and consistently missed its sales targets and financial benchmarks.G.M. has already cut its American work force in half in the last three years. Yet its latest reorganization plan calls for downsizing its brands and dealerships and cutting another 30,000 jobs — without addressing how it would generate new revenue.Because G.M. also has more than $60 billion in debt outstanding and a bill for $21 billion in retiree health care benefits coming due, experts cannot see how it will survive with temporary government loans.“Even with the most generous assumptions as to operating results and carefully adhering to G.M.’s proposed restructuring, G.M is still a highly distressed company and likely to go bankrupt, probably within in one year,” said Professor Edward I. Altman, of the Stern School of Business at New York University.Despite the willingness of the United Auto Workers union to make concessions on job security and health care payments, G.M. desperately needs its bondholders and other creditors to allow it to revamp its debt payments.G.M. could accomplish those ends if it sought bankruptcy protection, but the company maintains steadfastly that a Chapter 11 filing would ruin its already shaky reputation among consumers.In a bankruptcy proceeding, the U.A.W. would be in jeopardy of losing its $28-an-hour wage scale and its long-term health care benefits. The union’s president, Ron Gettelfinger, argued during the hearings that Congress should appoint a trustee or oversight committee with authority to force concessions from G.M.’s debtors.“What Congress can and should do is put in place a process that would require all the stakeholders to participate outside of bankruptcy,” Mr. Gettelfinger said.But a federally appointed “car czar” would hardly have the same legal authority as a bankruptcy judge to demand that bondholders, for example, take equity in exchange for reducing their debt.The situations at Ford and Chrysler are a little different, but both companies still have large obligations to debtors and union health care trusts.While Mr. Obama has repeatedly said that Chapter 11 is not preferable for the companies, several lawmakers see bankruptcy as the only viable way for the Big Three to get a fresh start as smaller, less-indebted entities.“They could come out leaner and more vibrant and more successful,” Senator Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama, said Sunday in an appearance on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “This is the way to save jobs.”Beside debts and legacy costs, Detroit faces substantial costs to meet new federal fuel-efficiency requirements for cleaner vehicles. The automakers have said it may require $100 billion to remake their fleets, far beyond the $25 billion program that Congress approved to help the companies meet the new standards.The mounting cost issues obscure what lies at the heart of the Big Three’s current cash crisis — a shrinking share of a vehicle market that has sunk to levels not seen since the 1980s.G.M., Ford and Chrysler have based their turnaround plans and loan requests on market projections that would have seemed outrageously low just a year ago.G.M., for example, is tying its profitability to maintaining at least a 20 percent share of an annual United States sales market of about 13 million vehicles.That level is far below the 16 million in annual sales that the industry has achieved in recent years, but in line with the depressed levels of 2008.'"
"'08-12-08,'1','The Tribune Company, the newspaper chain that owns The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times, is trying to negotiate new terms with its creditors and has hired advisers for a possible bankruptcy filing, according to people briefed on the matter.Tribune is in danger of falling below the cash flow required under its agreement with its bondholders, but it is not clear how seriously Tribune is thinking about seeking bankruptcy protection. Analysts and bankruptcy experts say that the hiring of advisers, including Lazard and Sidley Austin, one of the company’s longtime law firms, could be a just-in-case move, or a bargaining tactic. The company would not comment on Sunday.Tribune went private last December, paying more than $8 billion in a deal that put Samuel Zell, a real estate billionaire, in control of the company. It has struggled since then under the resulting debt, forcing deep cuts at its newspapers. It also sold Newsday to raise cash.The Tribune Company owns 23 TV stations and 12 newspapers, including two of the eight largest in the country by circulation. As of Sept. 30, The Los Angeles Times had weekday circulation of 739,000 and the Chicago Tribune had 542,000.Tribune has been trying to sell the Chicago Cubs baseball team; the team’s stadium, Wrigley Field; and the company’s share in a regional cable sports network. Such a deal, which could bring the company more than $1 billion, has been a crucial part of its strategy since last year.'"
"'08-12-08,'1','Back in September, Treasury officials similarly argued that bailing out Lehman would have wrongly rewarded it for its bad behavior and excessive risk-taking, and thereby would have given the nation’s financial sector a green light for future bad behavior.Seeing how Lehman’s collapse shocked the stock and credit markets, Robert Barbera, chief economist at ITG, an investment firm, cautioned that not bailing out the Big Three could prove short-sighted.“It’s very different from Lehman because you don’t have the systemic financial system risk, but it would be equally stupid,” Mr. Barbera said. “If Congress allows the auto companies to fail and with the effect that this would have on sales and production, what this means to the real economy will have instantaneous and brutal effects on the stock market.”In other words, Mr. Barbera warned that opposition to lending either the $17 billion agreed to — or the $34 billon that the car companies originally requested — could result in the stock markets’ plunging by hundreds of billions of dollars. And that does not include the billions of dollars in unemployment insurance benefits and pension bailouts that would be required to assist not just the displaced auto workers, but also the many other workers, like truck drivers and waitresses, whose jobs depend on the Big Three.“There will be tremendous regret if we don’t help them avoid bankruptcy in the next few weeks or months,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody’s Economy.com. “If they go into bankruptcy now, they’ll go into liquidation and there will be the loss of hundreds of thousands, if not a million, jobs — on top of the four or five million we’re going to lose. That will add almost a point to unemployment by itself.”At a House Committee hearing Friday about Detroit’s woes, Edward I. Altman, a professor of finance at New York University, recommended that the automakers enter bankruptcy reorganization. Through such a move, he said, the automakers could sharply cut their costs by negotiating deals with their creditors, dealers and labor unions.Many supporters of a bailout say that filing for bankruptcy reorganization could quickly lead to liquidation because car buyers might lose faith in the companies and worry that their auto warranties would not be honored.Professor Altman said that large-scale debtor-in-possession lending — either by the federal government or banks that would have priority over other creditors — could help keep the automakers operating (and guaranteeing their warranties) as they reorganize and reduce costs on the way to regaining their competitiveness.He said a revamping, helped by such financing under the bankruptcy laws, could actually reassure the stock market that “the damage can be minimized with a large debtor-in-possession financing” because “there will be more assurance that G.M. will be around for a long time.”Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Financial Services, which held Friday’s hearing, warned against a wholesale liquidation, saying it would jeopardize three million jobs. Yet he also opposed a federal bailout “because it’s just taking money and putting it into an inefficient operation and that money will be simply washed down the drain.”Mr. Bachus voiced confidence that bankruptcy filings by one or more auto company would not cause markets to plunge. “I think a restructuring plan done with the protection of certain benefits of bankruptcy might be positively perceived,” he said.But Mr. Barbera warned against overconfidence, saying that Treasury officials thought they would carefully exact only a pound of flesh from Wall Street by letting Lehman fail, helping teach other investment banks not to take excessive risks.“But,” he said, “it turned out not to be a pound of flesh that was taken. It was a ton.”'"

"'08-12-08,'1','The sensual sounds of Renaissance vocal music reverberating through the Church of St. Mary the Virgin near Times Square on Thursday evening made it easy to understand why such colorful polyphony irked the Council of Trent, which tried to ban it in the 16th century.In William Byrd’s “Vigilate” vocal lines from the five-part chorus intertwine with swelling crescendos and striking harmonies. The work opened a Christmas concert by the Vox Vocal Ensemble, conducted by George Steel, who founded the group in 1992 to focus on early and contemporary music. Mr. Steel, the former executive director of the Miller Theater, which presented the performance, is now the general director of the Dallas Opera.There are many ways of narrating the Christmas story, including pageants and the like. Vox illustrated the tale by singing sacred works, carols and hymns in narrative order. The third work, Philippe Verdelot’s four-part motet “Gabriel Archangelus,” sets a gospel text quoted in the liturgy for the feast of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist.In Robert Parsons’s “Ave Maria,” which came next, Vox sang with a stirring pulse and momentum, carefully controlled dynamic shadings and elegant phrasing. There were a few intonation problems throughout the evening, but the ensemble mostly sang with polish and elegant musicianship.One highlight of the program was the triumphant “Magnificat,” the only surviving work by Henry Prentyce, which alternates the somber purity of plainsong with intricate counterpoint.Vox also offered sweet-toned renditions of Byrd’s gentle “Lullaby, My Sweet Little Baby” and Jean Mouton’s evocative “Illuminare Jerusalem.”'"
"'08-12-08,'1','Once a bill offering aid to the industry is completed by Congressional Democrats and the White House, it would still need the approval of some Senate Republicans. Senator , Democrat of , one of the auto industry’s biggest supporters, said on Sunday that it was uncertain whether the plan would win the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate.President-elect , whose has been involved in the talks, made starkly clear in an interview and at a brief news conference on Sunday that any aid to the Big Three auto companies should not come without significant concessions.“They’re going to have to restructure,” Mr. Obama said in an interview on “Meet the Press” on . “And all their stakeholders are going to have restructure. Labor, management, shareholders, creditors — everybody is going to recognize that they have — they do not have a sustainable business model right now, and if they expect taxpayers to help in that adjustment process, then they can’t keep on putting off the kinds of changes that they, frankly, should have made 20 or 30 years ago.”Still, the bill seemed likely to stop short of authorizing the broad powers that some lawmakers had urged to allow what could have amounted to an out-of-court bankruptcy proceeding, in which the automakers’ creditors could be forced to accept reduced payments, labor contracts could be rewritten and executives could be summarily dismissed.Senator , the chairman of the banking committee that is drafting the legislation, called for the dismissal or resignation of , the chief executive of , which is the most imperiled automaker.“I think you’ve got to consider new leadership,” Mr. Dodd said Sunday in an interview on “Face the Nation” on . “If you’re going to really restructure this, you’ve got to bring in a new team to do this, in my view.”Asked specifically about Mr. Wagoner, Mr. Dodd said: “I think he has to move on.”A G.M. spokesman, Steve Harris, said that the company was grateful for Mr. Dodd’s assistance and that it was willing to accept tough oversight, but that it retained confidence in Mr. Wagoner.“We appreciate Senator Dodd’s support in trying to provide some assistance for the industry, but General Motors’ employees, dealers, suppliers and the G.M. board of directors feel strongly that Rick Wagoner is the right person to continue the transformation of the company that he began and has presented plans to Congress to continue and accelerate,” Mr. Harris said.All of the proposals made clear that Congressional Democrats and the White House, furious over the need for another huge corporate bailout, intended to make the automakers pay a price far greater than the 5 percent interest on the emergency loans.Congressional Democrats said that if any of the companies failed to meet government requirements by the end of March, the emergency loans could be called in for immediate repayment.At the news conference in , Mr. Obama affirmed his position that it would be unacceptable to allow the auto industry to collapse. But using somewhat tougher language than he had before, he said it made “no sense for us to shovel more money into the problem” if the companies are unwilling to reorganize.The Bush White House, in its proposal for an auto rescue plan, called for the creation of a “financial viability adviser” within the Commerce Department charged with negotiating a “long-term financial viability plan” for each of the auto companies.If such a viability plan could not be negotiated, the White House proposal called for allowing the adviser to mandate one.Democrats were weighing counterproposals calling for the creation of a full oversight board, made up of the secretaries of commerce, energy, labor, transportation and of the Treasury, and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.Many lawmakers in both parties say they are troubled by the Bush administration’s handling of the $700 billion financial system rescue, which Congress approved in October. Several lawmakers said they did not want to be pressured again into spending billions of taxpayer dollars to rescue private companies.“I think Congress is tired of being stampeded,” Senator , Republican of , said on “Face the Nation.” “We haven’t even seen a bill yet. So I think there’s still a lot of skepticism out there.”Senator of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, on “Fox News Sunday” urged his Republican colleagues to filibuster a bailout bill. “I think this is a bridge loan to nowhere,” he said.As lawmakers grappled with ways to aid the auto industry. Mr. Obama cautioned on “Meet the Press” that it was critical to think about both short- and long-term solutions to the nation’s economic woes. “Things are going to get worse before they get better,” Mr. Obama said.'"

Hindery Jr., the former chief executive of the YES Network, who runs InterMedia Partners, a media equity fund.Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, who was accused of insider trading in a civil suit filed last month by the Securities and Exchange Commission, had been a vocal suitor for a while, but it is not known if he is still involved.It is not unusual for certain subsidiaries to be excluded from the Chapter 11 filing of a parent. In the spectacular bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, for example, the money-management firm Neuberger Berman was not part of the filing. Yet its sale, announced last week, must still be approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court, as will any sale of the Cubs, Wrigley Field and another asset excluded from the bankruptcy filing — the Cubs’ 25 percent stake in Comcast SportsNet Chicago, the regional sports network.“The general explanation for not including a subsidiary in a bankruptcy is that it’s a stand-alone company and not in need of reorganization,” said Harvey Strickon, a counsel to Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, who specializes in bankruptcy law.Saul Burian, managing director of the financial restructuring group at Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, an investment bank, said: “Why disrupt subsidiary operations if you don’t have to? You may get the best of both worlds: the urgency and competitive auction dynamic that helps get a deal done and access to the bankruptcy court to give the buyer certainty” — with immunity from creditor challenges if the judge approves the sale.Separation from the filing is not a reason for Lou Piniella to strip off his shirt and crack open a beer or three in Wrigley’s bleachers. Under certain circumstances, Tribune creditors could try to force the Cubs into bankruptcy or seek to impose court oversight on its operations. “The Cubs and Wrigley are legally under the control of the parent in bankruptcy,” said Robert M. Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law.The Cubs — worth $642 million according to Forbes’s survey of team value this year — have been on the auction block since April 2007. The process, which has moved as slowly as Ernie Lombardi ran the bases, reached a peak within the past two weeks with the submission of formal bids. Tribune has reportedly sought $1.3 billion, but time, the deep recession and the credit freeze may force it to accept less.Getting $1 billion as fast as it can to help Mother Tribune is in the company’s best interest. Still, Bob Dupuy, the president of Major League Baseball, said no one in M.L.B. had counseled the Tribune Company to keep the Cubs out of Chapter 11 to expedite a process in sore need of speed.“They have to do what’s necessary for their shareholders,” Dupuy said.Baseball teams have dealt with bankruptcy before. The Baltimore Orioles were sold to Peter Angelos out of Eli Jacobs’s bankruptcy in 1993. A car dealer named Bud Selig acquired the Seattle Pilots out of bankruptcy in 1970 and moved them to Milwaukee.For the winning Cubs bidder, the critical element will not only be the highest price, but also having the highest amount of certain financing — not easy at a time when Detroit’s automakers have been genuflecting before Congress for loans to stay out of bankruptcy.'"
"'08-12-09,'0','Once there, seated in conference rooms that lent credibility to his charade, he peddled forged promissory notes — utterly worthless paper — linked in some way to his unwitting hosts, the complaint said. He backed up his claims with phony financial statements and bogus audit opinions from a reputable accounting firm, correspondence on the stationery of the New York real estate developer who supposedly issued the debt, and the help of a few confederates, the government said in court papers.With these tools and little more, he allegedly took hedge fund executives for $100 million in one instance alone, money that the authorities say remains unaccounted for.Mr. Dreier, 58, is charged with stealing $113 million since October, according to the complaint, although the case is continuing and a spokesman for the acting United States attorney in Manhattan, Lev. L. Dassin, whose office investigated the matter, would not say whether other alleged frauds are under scrutiny.Indeed, Mr. Dreier was working on getting an additional $33 million last Tuesday, according to the complaint, when that scheme unraveled in a bizarre tableau played out in the offices of a Toronto pension fund, court records and officials said.He was arrested in Canada and held by local authorities for several days on relatively minor charges. But the disclosure of that arrest eventually sent the law firm, Dreier L.L.P., reeling, and as details of the strange doings there began dribbling out, it became apparent he was also under investigation by federal authorities in Manhattan.Suddenly, the law firm could not make its payroll, people there said; the Christmas party at the Waldorf-Astoria was canceled; the firm lacked the ability to pay the rent at its Park Avenue offices (once occupied by Bloomberg L.P.); lawyers started packing up; and what had once been a lucrative law practice — a conglomeration of several separate firms — began to collapse.On Monday afternoon, a United States magistrate judge, Douglas F. Eaton, ordered Mr. Dreier detained until a bail hearing on Thursday. However, because the Securities and Exchange Commission has sought to freeze his assets and those of Dreier L.L.P. in a parallel civil action, it is unclear how he might post bond.Mr. Dreier’s efforts to enrich himself apparently did not end with his arrest, according to authorities. In a hearing on the S.E.C. action, which immediately followed the arraignment, a lawyer for the commission told Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum of Federal District Court that Mr. Dreier “did attempt and may have transferred assets” while he was jailed in Canada last week. But the lawyer, Nancy Brown, would not elaborate.Raymond J. Lohier and Jonathan R. Streeter, the assistant United States attorneys who are prosecuting the criminal case, and Mr. Dreier’s lawyer, Gerald L. Shargel, said little during the arraignment that preceded Judge Cedarbaum’s hearing.Afterward, Mr. Shargel noted, “This is a very complicated matter — the facts are beyond reach of a sound bite.”Outside the courtroom, when reporters asked whether Mark F. Pomerantz, the receiver expected to be appointed to oversee Dreier L.L.P.’s finances, would also run the law firm, Mr. Shargel alluded to the swift departure of some members of the firm.“The lawyers have apparently manned the lifeboats,” he said. “Given the reaction of the partners, I don’t think there is any law firm to run,” he said.Questions in the case abound. Why — and perhaps more important, when — did Mr. Dreier begin the multimillion-dollar con game detailed in the criminal complaint? How did sophisticated investors, and his highly educated colleagues, get duped?“Look, it’s a tragic story,” said a lawyer who worked with Mr. Dreier years ago, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the inquiry focused on the firm.“I don’t know what happened to him,” added the lawyer. “I don’t know if he was always this way or not but it’s just an amazing story.”Mr. Dreier’s résumé included high-level stints at Rosenman & Colin and at Fulbright & Jaworski, where he was head of the litigation department. His credentials and his no-nonsense demeanor helped him attract talent to his legal firm.He has a triplex apartment on the East Side of Manhattan, along with a house near the beach in Southampton, N.Y., and a 120-foot yacht. The walls of his Park Avenue office drip with expensive modern art, and he kept three personal assistants busy.The criminal complaint, sworn out by James J. Otten, an investigator with the U.S. attorney’s office, tells a remarkable story of hubris.The seven-page document, which was filed under seal on Thursday and made public on Monday, details three schemes and charges Mr. Dreier with one count each of wire fraud and securities fraud.In one scheme, it says, Mr. Dreier sought to sell a total of $146 million worth of bogus promissory notes that he created using the name of a real estate firm, unnamed in the complaint. He convinced a receptionist at the Manhattan offices of the firm (which people involved in the matter said was Solow Realty, a firm that had in the past retained Mr. Dreier) that the firm’s chief executive had authorized him and three other people to use a conference room for a meeting with the executive.In fact, the chief executive had not scheduled such a meeting. But he later saw Mr. Dreier conducting a meeting in Solow’s conference room, where he was negotiating to sell the notes.At some point in the investigation, according to the complaint, a cooperating witness secretly recorded Mr. Dreier admitting that he had “participated in the fabrication” of certain financial statements that he was to give to a hedge fund. On the tapes, the government contends, Mr. Dreier “further stated that he was ‘ashamed’ of his role in fabricating the documents and that it was “very serious what’s happened here.’ ”'"
"'08-12-09,'0','The fact that there is so little protest in the air now — certainly less than Mr. Truman heard — reflects the desperation of the moment. But it is a strategy fraught with risks.The first, of course, is the one the president-elect himself highlighted. Government’s record as a corporate manager is miserable, which is why the world has been on a three-decade-long privatization kick, turning national railroads, national airlines and national defense industries into private companies.The second risk is that if the effort fails, and the American car companies collapse or are auctioned off in pieces to foreign competitors, taxpayers may lose the billions about to be spent.And the third risk — one barely discussed so far — is that in trying to save the nation’s carmakers, the is violating at least the spirit of what it has preached around the world for two decades. The United States has demanded that nations treat American companies on their soil the same way they treat their home-grown industries, a concept called “national treatment.”Yet so far, there is no talk of offering aid to , , or the other foreign automakers that have built factories on American soil, employed American workers and managed to make a profit doing so.“If Japan was doing this, we’d be threatening billions of dollars in retaliation,” said Jeffrey Garten, a professor at the Yale School of Management, who as under secretary of commerce in the 1990s was one of many government officials who tried in vain to get prepared for a world of international competition. “In fact, when they did something a lot more subtle, we threatened exactly that,” referring to calls for import restrictions.Mr. Garten said he was stunned by the scope of the intervention that Washington was now considering. “I don’t know that we’ve seen anything like this since the government told the automakers what kind of tanks to make during World War II,” he said. “And that was just for the duration of the war — this could be for much, much longer.”It is hard to measure just what kind of chances Mr. Obama may be taking with this plan, in part because so many parts of it are still in motion.In the short term, Democrats are floating the idea of linking $15 billion in immediate loans to the designation of a “car czar” who, in doling out the money, could require or veto big transactions or investments — essentially a one-man board of directors. The White House indicates that President Bush, who has spent his entire presidency proclaiming that the government’s role is to create an environment that spurs free enterprise and minimizes government regulation, would very likely sign the rescue plan.The first $15 billion and the car czar who oversees it, however, are only the beginning. “After that, we’re in uncharted water,” said Malcolm S. Salter, a professor emeritus at Harvard Business School who has studied the auto industry for two decades and, until a few years ago, was an adviser to and . “Think about this: Who in the federal government would have the tremendous insight needed to fix this industry?”Depending on how the longer-term revamping of the industry proceeds, Washington could become a major shareholder in the Big Three, it could provide loans, or, in one course that Mr. Obama seemed to hint at on Sunday, it could organize what amounts to a “structured bankruptcy.” In that case, the government would convene the creditors, the unions, the shareholders and the company’s management, and apportion a share of the hit to each of them. If that “consensus building” sounds a lot like the role of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry in the 1970s and the 1980s, well, it is.To promote the Japanese car industry on the way up, the trade ministry nudged companies toward consolidation, and even tried to mandate which parts of the market each could go into. (Soichiro Honda, the founder of the company, rebelled when bureaucrats told him he was supposed to limit himself to making motorcycles.) By the 1980s, Congress was denouncing this as “industrial policy,” and arguing that it put American makers at a competitive disadvantage — and polluted free enterprise.Now, it is Congress doing exactly that, but this time as emergency surgery. Other nations will doubtless complain, or begin doing the same for their own companies. “We’re at this moment in history, in which the Chinese are touting that their system is better than ours” with their mix of capitalism and state control, said Mr. Garten, who has long experience in . “And our response, it looks like, is to begin replicating what they’ve been doing.”'"
"'08-12-09,'0','“Sex is a steady demand, because everyone needs it, and it used to be taboo, which made a service like ours all the more attractive,” said Mr. Borowitz, who looks more like Harry Potter than Larry Flynt. “But the problem today is that there is too much competition and our clients don’t have as much disposable income as before.”In the Czech Republic, where prostitution operates in a legal gray zone, the sex industry is big business, generating more than $500 million in annual revenues, 60 percent of which is derived from foreign visitors, according to Mag Consulting, a Prague-based research firm that studies the industry.Big Sister is not the only brothel suffering the effects of a battered global economy. While the world’s oldest profession may also be one of its most recession-proof businesses, brothel owners in Europe and the United States say the global financial crisis is hurting a once lucrative industry.Egbert Krumeich, the manager of Artemis, Berlin’s largest brothel, said that in November, usually peak season for the sex trade, revenues were down by 20 percent. In Reno, Nev., the famed Mustang Ranch recently laid off 30 percent of its staff, citing a decline in high-spending clients.Big Sister is not struggling as much as some of its more traditional rivals, since its revenues are largely derived from the 30 euros a month, or about $38, its 10,000 clients pay to gain access to its site.But Mr. Borowitz said Big Sister hoped to offset a 15 percent drop in revenues over the past quarter by expanding into the United States. The brothel also produces cable TV shows that air on Sky Italia and Britain’s Television X, as well as DVDs like “World Cup Love Truck.”Ester, an 18-year-old prostitute at Big Sister who declined to give her last name, said that big-spending clients had diminished, but that she was still earning nearly 2,000 euros a month — enough to pay the rent and buy Louis Vuitton bags. “The reason to do this is for the money,” she said, after gyrating half-naked on a pole. Being filmed, she added, made her feel more like an actress than a sex object.Since the fall of Communism in 1989, the Czech Republic has become a major transit and destination country for women and girls trafficked from countries farther east like Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Moldova, according to the police.For nearly 20 years, tens of thousands of sex tourists have streamed into Prague, the pristinely beautiful Czech capital, drawn by inexpensive erotic services, an atmosphere of anonymity for customers and a liberal population tolerant of adultery. According to Mag Consulting, 14 percent of Czech men admit to having sex with prostitutes, compared with a European Union average of 10 percent.Dozens of cheap flights to Prague have also ensured a flow of bachelor parties from across Europe, with multiple daily flights from Britain alone.Jaromir Beranek, an analyst with Mag Consulting, said the strength of the Czech crown against the euro, lower spending power and competition from lower-cost sex capitals like Riga, Latvia, and Krakow, Poland, were threatening one of the country’s most thriving sectors.Many Czechs are more than happy to see Prague shrug off its reputation as one of the world’s top 20 sex destinations. But some in the hotel industry are so alarmed by the drop in tourists that they are lobbying the government to legalize the trade, in the hope that it will help lure more clients.While some critics have warned that legalization would effectively transform the Czech state into the country’s biggest pimp, the Czech government is considering whether to emulate the Netherlands and Germany by regulating prostitution like any other industry. It is considering passing legislation by the end of the year that would require the Czech Republic’s estimated 10,000 prostitutes to register with the local authorities.Dzamila Stehlikova, a minister from the Green Party, who is shepherding the bill through Parliament, argued that by forcing the business out into the open, it would make it harder for human traffickers to thrive, while helping to ensure mandatory health checkups for prostitutes. Other advocates argued that legalization would generate millions of euros in lost tax revenue from an industry that was largely underground.Not everyone is enthusiastic; the prostitutes themselves say that being issued prostitution identification cards would further stigmatize them.Hana Malinova, director of Bliss Without Risk, a prostitution outreach group, said she feared the current credit crunch was pushing more poor women into prostitution, since they could make more money selling their bodies — about 120 euros for a half-hour session at some upscale sex clubs in Prague — than flipping burgers at McDonald’s.Even with the downturn, she added, prostitution was far more resilient than other industries, though the downturn was discouraging adultery.“An Austrian farmer from a remote area who is not married will still cross the border to the Czech Republic looking for sex,” she said. “On the other hand, the recession is helping to keep husbands at home who might otherwise be cheating on their wives.”In Czech towns near the German border in northern Bohemia, long blighted by a daily influx of sex tourists, many are happy that the business is suffering.Only a few years ago the town of Dubi was so overrun by prostitution that a nearby orphanage was opened to provide refuge for dozens of unwanted babies of prostitutes and their German clients. Sex could be purchased for as little as 5 euros — the price of a few beers in Dresden — drawing a daily influx of more than 1,000 sex tourists.Today, more than three dozen brothels have been winnowed down to four; several were converted into goulash restaurants or golf clubs.Petr Pipal, Dubi’s conservative mayor whose zero-tolerance policy was a key reason for the change, said that installing surveillance cameras and police officers at the entrance of brothels had deterred sex tourists. Rising prices for sex services and the global financial crisis, he added, were also helping to tame demand.“Two or three years ago, we would get 1,000 men coming here for sex on a Friday night, which is a lot for a town of 8,000 people,” he said. “The one good thing about the economic crisis is that it is helping to keep sex tourists away.”In Prague, even brothels in the most touristy areas complain they are suffering from economic hardship. On a recent night near Wenceslas Square in Prague, dozens of young men loitered outside a row of neon-lighted sex clubs, beckoning passing tourists with offers of complementary alcohol and racy strip shows.Inside Darling, a multilevel cabaret famous for cancan shows modeled on the Moulin Rouge in Paris, young women gyrated on a stage, surrounded by leopard skin couches, flashing disco balls and paintings of naked women.Suzana Brezinova, the club’s marketing director, said some high-spending businessmen still visited Darling to shrug off economic doldrums.“People have less money,” she said. “But hard times also mean that people want to be cheered up.”'"
"'08-12-09,'0','For hotels and airlines, loyalty programs are a way to establish or improve relations with frequent travelers. Online shopping malls, where travelers can accumulate points or miles with each purchase, are money earners for the hotel and airline companies; retailers pay airlines and hotels for the miles and points given for purchases. Merchandise redemption programs, which let travelers make purchases with their miles or points, require airlines and hotel companies to pay for the goods or services.But Tim Winship, who tracks loyalty programs for SmarterTravel.com, said “at the end of the day, these programs are profit generators for the airlines and hotel companies because they are generating more revenue from the sale of miles and points” than their costs from redemptions.While similar incentives have been offered in past years, many programs have become more diverse. Delta Airlines, for example, increased the number of retailers in its online mall to more than 500 in September from about 150.Joe Rhodes, a vice president of Hilton, said the company got into the merchandise redemption business last year because “some members travel so much, they prefer giving gifts of merchandise to their family instead of using points for trips for themselves.” Mr. Rhodes said merchandise redemptions were 30 percent higher last month than in November 2007, an increase he attributed, in part, to members’ efforts to extend their holiday gift-giving budget.Redemption options vary by travel company. Delta, for example, lets members redeem miles for merchandise and experiences like a tandem skydive. Hilton’s “Rewards Store” offers products from Apple and Cartier, and members can redeem points for items like a pair of tickets to “Saturday Night Live” and entry to the post-show cast party. (The price: four million points.)Marriott and InterContinental allow members to create their own redemption opportunities — participants submit whatever goods or services they desire and request a price in points. Among items recently ordered this way from Marriott were a pair of tickets to the 2009 Masters Tournament, for 400,000 points.Edward Pizzarello, a real estate developer based in McLean, Va., who participates in the loyalty program of American Airlines, said he is a devotee of the carrier’s online shopping mall. Last year, he earned 25,000 to 30,000 miles doing his holiday shopping there, buying presents like a Mac Mini computer for his daughter. This year, he said, he has used the mall to buy her a children’s digital camera at Target.Doing holiday shopping at American’s mall also lets him “get the stuff I want, from the merchants I want to buy it from, at the lowest price possible,” he said. “And I don’t have to leave the house or spend money on gas.”To make the most of loyalty program shopping opportunities, industry experts suggest first comparison-shopping online to find the lowest prices. Then compare bonuses or other incentives these retailers offer on Web sites like WebFlyer.com and EvReward.com. To receive appropriate mileage or points, shoppers must also visit the Web site of their travel loyalty program and register before making purchases.Mr. Winship, of SmarterTravel.com, said he is skeptical about redeeming miles or points for merchandise rather than for airline tickets or hotel rooms. “Although it’s been very difficult to redeem miles for frequent flier award seats, generally speaking you get better value for your miles by redeeming them for a free ticket than for an iPod,” he said. “On the average, if you redeem a frequent flyer mile for a ticket, you get just below 1.5 cents per mile, but with merchandise redemptions, you often get less than 1 cent per mile in value.”Randy Petersen, publisher of WebFlyer.com, disagreed. “If you have enough miles or points and feel comfortable spending this amount, go ahead and do it,” Mr. Petersen said. “Most people still view this as funny money.”'"
"'08-12-09,'0','The company has cut its staff and products, deeply and repeatedly, in an attempt to stay ahead of debt payments. In May, it also sold one of its most profitable newspapers, Newsday, to Cablevision for $650 million.Tribune faces more than $900 million in interest payments over the next year, and a $512 million principal payment due in June.Tribune filed under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, which allows it to continue operating while negotiating with lenders to try and reduce its interest payments and possibly its debt.The unusually heavy debt burden means Tribune’s bankruptcy is not a harbinger for the newspaper industry, said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute. “He took on a huge amount of debt at just the wrong time,” he said of Mr. Zell.The bankruptcy came together in just a few days, largely to protect the position of banks that hold the bulk of Tribune’s debt, according to people briefed on the talks between them, who were given anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Those banks hold Tribune’s senior secured loans — that is, the first in line to be paid in a bankruptcy — but the company also has junior debts, including a $69.55 million payment that was due on Monday.On Friday, these people said, Mr. Zell called a meeting with the main senior creditors, including Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup, and warned that continuing to pay the junior debt reduced the company’s ability to pay senior creditors later on. In meetings over the weekend, the banks reluctantly advised bankruptcy. The company said it did not make the $69.55 million payment on Monday.In a note sent to Tribune employees, Mr. Zell cited the state of the industry and the economy, saying, “It has been, to say the least, the perfect storm,” which has made it “extremely difficult to support our debt.” But he did not refer to the role of last year’s deal in creating most of that debt.The deal created an employee stock ownership plan, which bought all of Tribune’s stock and made the company tax-exempt. That made the employees the titular owners of the company, but they had no say in the matter and have no control over its management. They were promised the possibility of gaining access to their shares and cashing them in several years in the future, but in a bankruptcy, share values are often wiped out.Mr. Zell, who put up just $315 million of the purchase price, gained control, and the right to buy as much as 40 percent of Tribune’s stock in the future.A note on an internal Tribune Company Web site said, “All ongoing severance payments, deferred compensation and other payments to former employees have been discontinued and will be the subject of later proceedings before the court.” That made it apparent that employees who recently were laid off or took buyouts would join the long list of unsecured creditors.James Gerstenzang, a reporter who left The Los Angeles Times’s bureau in Washington last month, said he was trying to figure out whether he was one of those people. He said he had just sent in the last paperwork to approve his expected buyout payment — 49 weeks of pay, after more than 24 years.“What, I’m supposed to be shocked that Sam Zell isn’t keeping his word?” he asked. “This was their commitment and their credibility.”A crucial part of Tribune’s strategy for surviving the next year has been to raise cash by selling the Chicago Cubs and its stadium, Wrigley Field, but that effort has been delayed. The company excluded the Cubs and the stadium from the bankruptcy filing, so that it could press ahead with a sale that it hopes will reap more than $1 billion.The bankruptcy filing “will take pressure off our operations,” Mr. Zell said in a statement. “This restructuring focuses on our debt, not on our operations.”But bankruptcy — a rare step for a big newspaper company — calls into question the future shape of a company with more than $4 billion a year in revenue and thousands of employees.James H. M. Sprayregen, a bankruptcy lawyer at Kirkland & Ellis, said companies will often choose to file for bankruptcy when it becomes clear that they will eventually need protection, even if they are making their debt payments. “It obviously wasn’t an emergency or they would have filed Sunday night,” he said. “They chose a time that was financially advantageous.”Tribune arranged for $50 million in credit from Barclays, and an agreement with Barclays to continue a $300 million line of credit, on which it has already drawn $225 million.In addition to the banks, the major creditors listed in the bankruptcy filing are hedge funds that hold Tribune loans. The largest individual creditor listed is Mark H. Willes, former chief executive of Times Mirror, the Los Angeles-based newspaper company bought by Tribune in 2000, who the filing says is owed $11.2 million in retirement benefits and deferred pay.Mr. Zell took control of the company on Dec. 20, 2007, and installed top managers who, like him, had no background in newspapers. They vowed to shake up the company. But Tribune’s results kept declining like those of the industry as a whole. The company had a profit of $37.1 million in the third quarter — down from $216.8 million in the year-earlier quarter — and a $26.2 million loss on its newspapers.In the Los Angeles Times newsroom, word of the bankruptcy brought few words of surprise.“I think people are pretty disgusted by the direction things have gone,” said Mitchell Landsberg, a reporter. “There’s no love lost between the employees here and Sam Zell.”'"
"'08-12-09,'0','BERLIN — Microsoft offered Monday to abide by a European privacy panel’s request that it reduce the length of time it kept records of Web searches if its rivals, Yahoo and Google, did the same.Google and Yahoo, in separate statements, said that for now they were unwilling to change their policies.Microsoft said it made the offer in a letter to the Article 29 Working Party, a European Commission advisory panel made up of data protection commissioners from each of its 27 member countries. In April, the panel recommended that search engines keep search records no longer than six months before making the data untraceable.Microsoft’s MSN Live Search currently retains search data for 18 months.

The Italian tenor Giuseppe Filianoti, above left, was to play the lead role in Verdi’s “Don Carlo” on Sunday but was replaced by the American tenor Stuart Neill, above right, after Mr. Filianoti made mistakes at a dress rehearsal.

"'08-12-09,'0','The Cowboys are tied with the Atlanta Falcons for the sixth playoff spot (the loser of Monday’s National Football Conference South showdown between Carolina and Tampa Bay, both 9-3, would be in the first wild-card spot). But the bigger problem is that the Cowboys have realized their potential for only fleeting moments this season.The Cowboys spent a lot of money to build a team designed to outscore opponents. You do not put Terrell Owens and Roy Williams on the field together with the idea that you are going to win a lot of defensive battles. But Owens is ranked 28th in the league in receptions and 19th in yardage, and the Cowboys are just 12th in points per game. Too often, the Cowboys have not been able to push the ball down the field when they have most needed to, as was glaringly obvious against the Steelers.The wind made passing difficult Sunday, but not impossible, as the Steelers’ biggest offensive playmaker, in this case Nate Washington, showed when he caught three passes in the fourth-quarter scoring drive that ended with a touchdown pass to Heath Miller. The biggest Cowboys playmakers — Owens and Williams — caught five passes total, as many as running back Tashard Choice.The Steelers were no thing of beauty. They have to get their protection problems straightened out and Ben Roethlisberger has to get rid of the ball faster before the playoffs start. And they have now been stopped three times on the 1 at home in the last month, a weird development for a team that once employed someone nicknamed The Bus. But in the mark of a good team merely having a bad day — rather than a not-as-good-as-we-thought team having a bad year, like the Cowboys — the Steelers did just enough to win. When someone asked Coach Mike Tomlin about his offense’s “terrible” performance, he replied: “Terrible is a strong word. Very poor.”The Cowboys, despite superior talent, were very poor, too.After the fourth-quarter interception, Owens was seen yelling at a Cowboys assistant coach. Naturally, Owens intimated that the pass intended for Witten, which ended up in Deshea Townsend’s hands, and in the end zone for the Steelers’ winning touchdown, should have gone to him. He said he had one-on-one coverage and that the Steelers defender was playing 10 to 12 yards off him. That was a fair assessment.This was not: “It’s his job to go out there and assess what the defense is, and he made that decision,” Owens said, implying that Tony Romo’s decision to throw to Witten was the wrong one.That is just what the Cowboys do not need, a little more strife in a season that has overflowed with it. Adam (used-to-be-Pacman) Jones returned to action after his latest suspension and it was nothing more than a note.The Cowboys have three brutal games remaining against the Giants, the Ravens and at the Eagles. The Cowboys have sunk into the depths of adversity before and bounced out, but this time Romo cannot come off the injured list to rescue this season — this team — that looks beyond saving.“I hope this gives us more fight,” receiver Patrick Crayton said. “But to come away with a loss like this is deflating.”It might be time to just say it: the Detroit Lions are probably going to go 0-16. With an inexplicable tendency to get a lead, and then lose it (something the Lions have done in six of their last seven games), Detroit is steaming toward the ignominious.They might have blown their last best chance Sunday when they lost to the Vikings, who were led, if you want to call it that, by the former starting quarterback Tarvaris Jackson.With games remaining against the roaring Colts, the Saints and the Packers (only the Saints go to Detroit), the Lions appear doomed to being a punch line.They can take some solace from the fact that last year’s joke — the Dolphins, who were 0-13 before finally winning their only game of the season — are now tied for first place in the American Football Conference East. Then again, Bill Parcells is unlikely to leave Florida to engineer a turnaround in Detroit any time soon.The Vikings should not be feeling too great right now, though. Gus Frerotte may miss this week’s game against Arizona with a back injury that forced him from Sunday’s game. Jackson could take back the starting job, which he lost after two games.More ominous is that a judge could decide the fates of Pat and Kevin Williams, who were allowed to play Sunday while their Starcaps-based league suspensions were reviewed. If those suspensions are upheld, the Williamses will head to the bench and the Vikings will try to cling to their one-game lead without the heart of their defense.They Just Keep GoingThe New England Patriots are back in a tie for first place in the A.F.C. East thanks, in part, to the extraordinary workers they brought back from furlough this week. Rosevelt Colvin and Junior Seau played a significant number of snaps on Sunday.The Patriots play the Oakland Raiders this week and, after Tedy Bruschi did not return Sunday after leaving the game with a knee injury, you have to wonder if Lawrence Taylor is next on the Belichick/Pioli speed dial.The Patriots still could miss the playoffs, but in a season beset by injuries, Scott Pioli, the team’s vice president for player personnel, has done a remarkable job fitting in spare parts to keep the engine running — hello, BenJarvus Green-Ellis.The Patriots deserved raves last year for the dominant team they assembled, but this season might serve as a quieter, but more impressive example of their resourcefulness. Shouldn’t the Lions make Pioli an overwhelming offer to try to bring that resourcefulness to Detroit?'"
"'08-12-09,'0','To the list of the qualities of dogs — enthusiastic and steadfast come to mind — can be added another. That pooch of yours, researchers say, may be envious.Scientists in Austria report in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that a dog may stop obeying a command if it sees that another dog is getting a better deal.In this way dogs may be showing a sensitivity that is similar to, although perhaps more primitive than, that shown by chimpanzees and some monkeys. Until now those primates were the only nonhumans to show what is called “inequity aversion” in the absence of a reward.The finding may come as no surprise to some dog owners, and it didn’t completely surprise Friederike Range, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Vienna who led the study.“We have a dog at home,” she said, “and I know how jealous she is of different people and situations.”The study tried to quantify the behavior by using well-trained dogs that readily offer a paw on command. The researchers used two dogs side by side but treated them differently, giving one a better reward (sausage) and the other a lesser one (bread) when the paw was given, or giving one dog no reward at all.'"
"'08-12-09,'0','Allison said the parents of a few of her classmates at the Salk School of Science, near Gramercy Park, had done little more in the last three months than scout prospective high schools. She said these friends were constantly talking about which colleges each high school sends its graduates to, where there might be more interesting students, how long the subway ride would be.For Allison, a precocious and self-aware city kid, the cleanliness of the school mattered greatly.“It’s like your whole life is resting on this one decision,” Allison said one night last week, sitting on a rocking chair in the family’s cozy Upper East Side apartment. “I know it’s not true exactly, but everybody kind of makes you feel that way.”Last week, more than 80,000 eighth graders submitted a ranked list of up to 12 of the city’s 400 high schools to their middle-school guidance counselors. Separately, students submit essays and other materials to individual schools, which do not know where they rank on the students’ lists. (Allison and her mother asked that their top choice not be revealed for fear it could hurt her chances elsewhere.)Come spring, each student will be matched with one high school — generally, that student’s top choice among the schools that accepted him or her. Last year, just under half the applicants received their first choice. The decision can be appealed, but typically such appeals are long and unfruitful endeavors.So students and their parents pour their energy into the application process, which can start as early as seventh grade, as it did for Allison, when she toured Beacon last fall. (Her older brother, Max, attends the High School of American Studies at Lehman College, one of eight so-called specialized schools citywide that determine admission by a lengthy exam rather than applications).But while Allison happily went along with her mother’s urging to attend the tour, she put her own limits on the process. She declined this fall, for instance, to attend any of the city’s five huge high-school information fairs, where teachers and principals from hundreds of high schools passed out pamphlets to recruit the class of 2013.“Stuff like that just really overwhelms me and stresses me out,” Allison said.Her mother did attend one fair, at Brooklyn Technical High School in late September, though she spent the first hour selling copies of her book outside (there were more than 100 takers).When she went inside, Ms. Hemphill found the rowdy atmosphere somewhat of a shock. She walked up and down the rows of booths for more than an hour, but never found the space for Eleanor Roosevelt High, one of her daughter’s top prospects. Once she located LaGuardia, the legendary performing arts school, an official told her they were not offering any tours this year.Then there was the Lab School in Chelsea. Ms. Hemphill said she tried to sign up for a tour on the school’s Web site, which directed her to call the school, where a recording directed her back to the Web site and apologized for the voice mailbox’s being full.“The problem is that the public schools are being asked to do what is a private school process with public school resources,” Ms. Hemphill said. “Instead of having three people who handle admissions, they have nobody.”In the end, Allison narrowed her choices fairly simply. She focused on smaller schools that were no more than 45 minutes from home and would offer her a chance to take advanced classes but also give her enough time to focus on dance and theater after school.Instead of going on endless school tours, she spent many hours this fall preparing for her bat mitzvah on Nov. 22.“As a family, we had to decide how much we were going to freak out about high schools and how much we were going to freak out about the bat mitzvah,” Ms. Hemphill said, laughing. “We basically did the bat mitzvah, had a couple of days off, and then started freaking out about high school, too.”'"
"'08-12-09,'0','The number of hospital patients with bedsores has risen dramatically over a 14-year period, leading to longer, more expensive hospital stays, according to a new government report.Some 503,300 patients admitted to U.S. hospitals in 2006 suffered from a bedsore that developed either before or during their stay. That figure was 281,300 in 1993, representing an increase of 78.9 percent, the report by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found.By contrast, overall hospital admissions increased by just 15 percent between 1993 and 2006.Most of the inpatients who had bedsores were ages 65 and older, and the cost of their care was borne largely by government health plans, primarily Medicare, according to the report.“Bedsores are preventable, but it’s not easy,” said William Spector, an agency researcher. “It’s not like you just get a prescription and one physician can take care of it. It’s a major team effort that requires a multidisciplinary team of dietary aides, nurses aides, physical therapists and physicians all playing a role.”Although the report did not explain why bedsores had become so much more frequent, an official with the American Hospital Association speculated that the increase may be due to rising numbers of very frail, elderly patients arriving in hospitals.“We know we’re seeing older patients, patients who are sicker than they were a decade or more ago, and more patients whose immune systems are compromised by advanced age and some drug regimens,” said Nancy Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety policy with the A.H.A.'"
"'08-12-09,'0','The 3M Company, which makes everything from Post-it Notes to Scotch Tape, lowered its 2008 earnings outlook on Monday. It also said its 2009 profit would fall below Wall Street expectations because of slowing revenue in the weakening economy.The company said it would cut nearly 1,800 positions in the fourth quarter, mainly in the United States, Western Europe and Japan. The cuts are expected to save $170 million in 2009, and are in addition to the 1,000 jobs eliminated in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.The shares of 3M were down $2.47, or 4.13 percent, to $57.38 even as the broader markets surged.3M is looking at 500 more job cuts that will primarily affect the company’s international business, the company’s chief financial officer, Patrick D. Campbell, told analysts Monday at a presentation in New York.The manufacturer now expects earnings for 2008 at about $5.10 to $5.15 a share, down sharply from its previous estimate of $5.40 to $5.48 a share. Wall Street’s average forecast was $5.43 a share, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Mr. Campbell offered a grim perspective of the future, saying the company would do minimal share repurchases and careful planning “to make sure that we don’t get our inventories out of whack.”3M has closed about 15 plants in the last 18 months and has drawn down inventory, cut capital spending and made other moves to cut costs.'"

The report was published on Tuesday in The Archives of Opthalmology.“These are alarming numbers,” said Dr. Jinan B.

"'08-12-10,'1','Anti-choice advocates may try to paint a rosy picture of their intentions, but they can’t accurately be considered pro-life advocates when the results of their actions can end up hurting and even killing women.An unexpected, unwanted pregnancy can be mentally, emotionally and physically devastating for a woman. It can be a financial catastrophe (more than half of all teenage mothers end up on welfare) and can result in a woman’s death. Exactly which part of this agonizing ordeal is Ross Douthat willing to compromise on?Democrats have been promoting educational and informational programs that lead to fewer unwanted pregnancies, and these programs have helped reduce the number of abortions in humane and compassionate ways. Inexplicably, conservatives in the Republican Party have forcefully opposed many of these educational programs, so it is Democrats who actually represent the real pro-life party.President-elect Barack Obama and the Supreme Court must continue to protect the lives of women by maintaining pro-choice laws. On this there can be no compromise.I have been forced to vote twice for George W. Bush and once for John McCain precisely for the reasons expressed by Ross Douthat in his Dec. 7 Op-Ed article.The dismissal of my concerns, even by so-called pro-life Democrats (my natural place as a voter) who have given in to the radical, and I would say rabid, demand for “freedom” (in truth, license), has left me no alternative, even before such an impressive figure as Barack Obama.However much I knew my vote was for the incompetent candidate all three times, I would subject this country to that rather than allow such distortion to stand. As a Roman Catholic, I despair for a court that has so obviously passed judgment on itself.It is only political force that will, as it did with slavery, break a failure in reason, law and civility.Ross Douthat is out of touch with this country when he characterizes abortion bans and mandatory parental involvement as “compromise.”Last month, South Dakota considered an abortion ban with extremely limited exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Meanwhile, in my state of California, we faced a ballot with a parental notification initiative.The verdict? In both South Dakota and California, the majority said no.As a gynecologist who cares for adolescents, I know that it’s impossible to legislate good family communication. I am grateful to these voters for keeping my patients’ decisions about their health private.Overturning Roe v. Wade would not be a compromise, but a repudiation of what Americans believe about abortion.The writer is a board member of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health.For some people, abortion is a nonnegotiable issue. A nation that runs out of people cannot perform the activities of a sophisticated society.We have a shortage of primary care doctors. There are other skilled-worker shortages. You cannot kill the future population of a nation and then wonder why that nation does not have the people it needs to do the jobs it requires to function.Our nation needs to face up to the 48 million lives lost through abortion since 1973. I think at least some of that number would have become the skilled people we need now and will need even more as our population ages.Abortion is at the very center of a host of our troubles.'"
"'08-12-10,'1','The topics range from the general, like Treasury’s overall strategy, to the practical, like the method it is using to decide which institutions get bailed out. But they all pose detailed questions that the panel says have not yet been answered by the administration.Several questions are aimed at assessing the bailout program’s success so far in reducing foreclosures, stabilizing markets and helping American families. It specifically challenged Treasury to explain publicly why it did not support a foreclosure reduction plan proposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It also asks the Treasury to outline its approach to bring down foreclosure rates.In a particularly pointed criticism, the report said private investors seemed to have received much better terms on their investments in troubled financial institutions than the government had.For example, the Treasury Department worked out a complex blend of taxpayer investments and loan guarantees from federal bank regulators to aid the troubled Citigroup.But, as the report said, Warren E. Buffett invested in Goldman Sachs in September, getting a future equity stake and an immediate issue of preferred shares that pay a 10 percent dividend and can be redeemed only at a 10 percent premium. Those terms were roughly similar to a deal under which a Mitsubishi unit invested $9 billion in Morgan Stanley in October.And the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority invested $7.5 billion in Citigroup itself in November, obtaining equity units paying an 11 percent dividend that can be converted into common stock in the future.In comparison, the report said, the Treasury received a future equity stake in Citigroup and an immediate issue of preferred shares that pay an annual dividend of 5 percent for five years and 9 percent thereafter — less than the privately negotiated deals. Unlike the Goldman Sachs shares issued to Mr. Buffett, those shares are redeemable at face value, not at a premium, after three years.The panel said it intended to work with the Treasury, the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Budget Office to determine how these and other capital investments were negotiated by the Treasury and whether taxpayers were adequately rewarded and protected by those arrangements.The panel also questioned a Treasury and Federal Reserve initiative to support consumer credit by providing $20 billion in credit protection to the secondary market for car loans, credit card balances, student loans and loans to small businesses.While increased consumer spending is important for economic recovery, financing that spending by increases in consumer debt will only add to the financial stress American families are experiencing, the report said.It also questioned whether Treasury was demanding enough of the institutions that received its help, particularly those engaged in consumer lending.For instance, the British government has ordered credit card companies there to “work with consumers,” in some cases providing a 60-day moratorium on payments, as a condition of getting public money.It called on the Treasury to use its leverage as rescuer in chief to demand the kind of corporate reforms and improved business plans among financial institutions that Congress was considering imposing on the auto industry as a condition of its bailout plan.It is not clear yet whether the squabble surrounding the panel’s first vote will deter its effort to provide Congress with a clearer road map for monitoring the bailout effort.Both Elizabeth Warren, the panel’s chairwoman and a consumer bankruptcy law professor at Harvard, and Mr. Hensarling are scheduled to testify on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee as it continues its examination of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the keystone in the financial rescue plan.Ms. Warren said Mr. Hensarling had not raised any specific disagreements with the report, which calls for more focused attention on how the bailout program is working. Indeed, Ms. Warren said, he had contributed one of its main sections.Nor had he or others in the Republican leadership complained that political considerations were shaping the panel’s research, Ms. Warren said. “How the Treasury Department has spent American taxpayers’ money is not a partisan question,” she said. “We all realize that.”The bailout legislation was approved with bipartisan support in both houses of Congress and signed into law by President Bush in early October. A five-member oversight panel was created by that law, with the Democratic Congressional leadership naming three members and the Republican leadership naming two.Mr. Hensarling is still on board, but the Republican leadership has not yet filled the vacancy created when Mr. Gregg stepped down.'"
"'08-12-10,'1','“The election of Barack Obama was like a culmination of a struggle that we were going through, wanting to be pilots,” said William M. Wheeler, 85, a retired Tuskegee combat fighter pilot who lives in Hempstead, N.Y. He tried to become a commercial pilot after the war but was offered a job cleaning planes instead.Mr. Obama has acknowledged his debt to the airmen, issuing a statement in 2007, when they received the Congressional Gold Medal. It said in part: “My career in public service was made possible by the path heroes like the Tuskegee Airmen trail-blazed.”The invitation to his swearing-in was extended Tuesday by Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.Howard Gantman, staff director for the committee, said of the decision to invite them: “They served honorably on behalf of our country, helped fight the battle to overcome racial barriers and because of the historic nature of this election, we thought they deserved to be there.”Tickets to the Jan. 20 inauguration are the most sought-after commodity, with more than 1.5 million people expected in Washington. Of the 240,000 tickets, the airmen would have seats among the 30,000 on the terrace below the podium, along with former members of Congress and others.For logistical reasons, the actual invitation ended up with Robert D. Rose, a retired Air Force captain in Bellevue, Neb., who was not a Tuskegee airman but is the first vice president of the Tuskegee Airmen Inc., an association of the original airmen and their supporters.The onus is on the association to extend the invitation to the airmen, who must respond by Dec. 19. Each can bring one guest. The tickets are not transferable, so if an airman cannot make it, he cannot give his ticket away.“We’ll have a lot of happy fellows and ladies,” said Mr. Rose, who predicted that many would try to attend.He said that before the invitation was made Tuesday, he had already been trying to get word to higher ups that the airmen would like to be invited. “I thought if the name ‘Tuskegee’ surfaced at a high enough level, someone would recognize it and it would make sense to invite them,” he said.There is no firm handle on how many are still alive. More than 300 came forward in March 2007 to collect their bronze replicas of the Congressional Gold Medal at a ceremony at the Capitol. The actual Gold Medal itself was given to the Smithsonian Institution.In all, 994 pilots and about 15,000 ground personnel collectively known as the Tuskegee Airmen were trained at the segregated Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama from 1942 to 1946.About 119 pilots and 211 ground personnel are still alive, according to Tuskegee Airmen Inc. They are in their 80s and 90s, many are frail, and it is unclear how many will be able to make the trip to Washington. And those who make it will face various challenges: they will most likely have to walk some distance, the weather could be harsh, the crowds will be huge and accommodations are scarce.Still, these are some of the airmen who flew more than 150,000 sorties over Europe and North Africa during World War II, escorting Allied bombers and destroying hundreds of enemy aircraft. Some were taken prisoner. And most faced fierce discrimination during and after the war.“Even the Nazis asked why they would fight for a country that treated them unfairly,” President Bush said in awarding the medals.Mr. Rose, of the airmen’s association, said he saw a direct connection between the Tuskegee experience and Mr. Obama’s election.“The Tuskegee Airmen preceded Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, and if they hadn’t helped generate a climate of tolerance by integration of the military, we might not have progressed through the civil rights era,” he said. ”We would have seen a different civil rights movement, if we would have seen one at all.”'"
"'08-12-10,'1','In 1991, Congress was forced to increase the premiums that F.H.A. homeowners pay to the agency’s insurance fund when it was overwhelmed by claims from bad mortgages.And a HUD audit released this month suggests that fund may soon face trouble again; over the fiscal year, its capital ratio dropped to 3 percent, from 6.4 percent, reflecting a sharp increase in claims. By statute, that capital ratio must be at least 2 percent.In addition, principal and interest on mortgage-backed securities containing F.H.A.-insured loans are guaranteed through the Government National Mortgage Association, known as Ginnie Mae. That means the taxpayer is responsible if the mortgages underlying those securities fail.Howard Glaser, a onetime HUD official who is a mortgage industry consultant in Washington, said that F.H.A. had largely been treated as a stepchild. Over the last five years, for instance, the agency’s staffing levels have remained essentially flat. “If we don’t have the capacity to monitor systemic risk in F.H.A., then we are in real trouble,” he said.HUD officials did not respond to repeated requests to be interviewed for this article. But a department spokesman, Lemar C. Wooley, said in a statement that HUD was effectively dealing with F.H.A.-related fraud and abuse. “For decades, the F.H.A. has successfully undertaken measured risks while consistently evolving its programs to protect the integrity” of the insurance fund, Mr. Wooley stated.In many ways, F.H.A. is far better suited to deal with fraud than lenders that issued subprime loans. F.H.A. borrowers need to have down payments and are expected to meet strict criteria to make sure they are capable of paying their mortgages.But HUD’s weak point has long been its oversight of the thousands of mortgage lenders and other companies that effectively act as outside contractors in originating and endorsing F.H.A.-backed loans, studies by the Government Accountability Office and others have found.To work with the agency, companies must meet financial standards. It can take years to dislodge firms suspected of creating problems for the system, however, according to federal studies and as demonstrated by some recent cases.In October, for instance, federal prosecutors persuaded a judge in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to block a lender, Madison Home Equities of Carle Place, N.Y., and its owner, Nadine Malone, from approving any more F.H.A. loans. In court papers, prosecutors charged that the firm had, among other things, falsified data to certify unqualified borrowers and artificially inflated the prices of homes it sold.It was not the first time that federal officials had tried to rein in Madison. Since 1996, federal records show, HUD, on separate occasions, has imposed sanctions on the firm, fined it, sued it and even debarred it for a time as an approved F.H.A. agent.Through it all, the firm and Ms. Malone denied they had done anything wrong and, after Madison’s debarment ended in 2005, it worked again with F.H.A. Prosecutors now charge it abused the system, which Ms. Malone denies. Whatever the case, some recent home buyers who got F.H.A.-backed loans through Madison face foreclosure because, prosecutors say, the firm overstated their resources.“We are barely hanging on,” said Julius A. Collins Jr., who bought a house last year in Ellenville, N.Y. He said he was surprised, given his family’s finances, that he qualified for an F.H.A. mortgage, adding he was unaware of charges against Madison.Part of the problem, experts say, is that mortgage companies like Madison and others that act on F.H.A.’s behalf face a conflict. While they must abide by HUD guidelines to qualify borrowers, the more loans they approve, the more money they make.To track lenders, HUD monitors how frequently their loans are defaulting, a sign that a firm may be certifying unqualified borrowers or possibly even engaging in fraud. But while officials can take action when a firm’s default rate reaches twice the local average, they often act after it is far too late, said several mortgage industry experts.“You can find lenders with ridiculous default rates,” said Brian Chappelle, a consultant in Washington.For example, federal officials began to review one lender, Great Country Mortgage Bankers of Coral Gables, Fla., five months after its default rate exceeded twice the average, according to Mr. Wooley, the HUD spokesman. But it was not until last month that HUD officials ended the firm’s ability to act as an F.H.A. agent. By then, its default rate was more than 13 times the local average, federal data shows. Mr. Wooley said a HUD inspector general’s review of the firm led to the delay.Great Country’s situation is by no means unique. About 80 of the 1,800 mortgage companies authorized to endorse F.H.A. loans, including some no longer in business, have default rates from 2 to 11 times the average of local lenders, federal data shows. Madison’s rate was four times as high as the local average, data shows.Both Mr. Glaser and Mr. Chappelle, the two industry consultants, said they believed HUD needed to find ways to screen out companies issuing bad loans much earlier in the process.HUD can take a variety of actions when it suspects a company of abusing F.H.A., such as referring the most egregious cases to the Justice Department for criminal or civil action. But it can also bring administrative action against lenders and others through a HUD panel, the Mortgagee Review Board, composed of top department officials.The review board can penalize or debar F.H.A. participants. While its power to impose fines is limited, the panel can take other substantial financial actions. For example, it can require a lender to reimburse the agency’s insurance pool for claims paid out to it on mortgages that the company should not have approved.In addition, it can require a lender that has violated guidelines in approving loans to indemnify F.H.A. against future losses if those mortgages go bad. In the 2008 fiscal year, which ended in September, the review board handled 95 cases, about the same number it looked at during the four-year period from 2004 to 2007, federal data shows. And in recent years, it has handed out some substantial penalties.But in other cases, the review board accepted fines or penalties smaller than those recommended by HUD auditors. For example, a 2006 HUD inspector general’s audit of a Louisiana-based lender, America’s Mortgage Resource, found that a company official had been involved in a practice by lenders and home builders that was once widespread and is now banned — the use of an unapproved charity to funnel down payments to home buyers so they could qualify for F.H.A. loans.Among other things, the audit found that one of the firm’s managers had set up a charity, the Imagine Foundation, which gave about $405,000 to 73 homeowners so they could qualify for F.H.A.-backed loans, which America’s Mortgage Resource profited from issuing. The report recommended that the firm, among other things, reimburse HUD $303,261 for claims already paid on four loans that had failed and indemnify it against future losses on loans worth $7 million.America’s Mortgage Resource disputed the audit’s findings and argued that any missteps by the firm or its official were unintentional, its filings show. Last year, the board agreed to let the firm settle the case, without admitting liability, by paying $64,000.Last month, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, sent a letter to Mr. Donohue, the inspector general, asking his office to do an audit of the board.Mr. Wooley, the HUD spokesman, pointed to several recent steps F.H.A. had taken to improve its oversight of approved lenders, including requests for additional indemnification.“The department has increased enforcement against entities and individuals that demonstrate poor performance and abusive lending practices,” he said in a statement.Mr. Glaser and Mr. Chappelle, the consultants, said they believed that some of HUD’s problems could be remedied by allotting additional money for oversight and enforcement, and Mr. Donohue agreed. But they all said that the time to correct problems was short. “We have to get our arms around this thing,” Mr. Donohue said.'"
"'08-12-10,'1','Looking at extended forecast models, Pleas said there was only about a 30 percent chance of epic surf at Pipeline by Dec. 20.Last year, the final, won by Bede Durbidge of Australia, was held in some of the worst surf in memory. The waves were in the 3-foot range, too small for the classic tube rides associated with the Pipeline.Even at its best, Pipeline may not be the biggest, the most difficult or the shapeliest wave in the world. Still, as host to the longest-running contest in professional surfing at 38 years, it is the standard by which other waves are judged.“It would be my No. 1 if I could pick an event to win,” said Taj Burrow, ranked third on the Association of Surfing Professionals world tour.There was a sense of anticlimax to the 2008 competitive surfing season because Kelly Slater clinched his ninth world title in October. But Burrow, who has never won at Pipeline, said the Masters represented a chance to finish the season on a high note.“It’s the most prestigious event in the world by far,” he said.On Tuesday, 48 surfers competed, half of whom advanced, including Jamie O’Brien, who won the Pipeline Masters in 2004. Those who advanced will have a chance to compete against the likes of Burrow and Slater, who has won a record five Pipeline Masters titles, the last in 1999.“Pipe was sort of the ultimate challenge for me since I was a little kid,” Slater said. “In my eyes, it’s sort of the ultimate wave.”Although the wave has remained the same since it was first surfed nearly 50 years ago, the scene surrounding the contest has grown. Hundreds of spectators gather on the sand to watch the waves break just 75 yards from shore. Most of the oceanfront homes nearby are owned by surf apparel manufacturers, and are packed with people during the competition.“There’s not a set breaking that I don’t want to watch,” Slater said. “Somebody could die on the next wave.”For years Pipeline was regarded as too formidable to even try, until December 1961 when Phil Edwards caught an eight-foot wave that was documented on film. Soon after, the wave had a name — taken from a pipeline construction project under way nearby.Although no official figures exist, more than 30 people are believed to have died at the break, according to the book “The Pipeline: Deep Inside the World’s Most Respected Wave,” which was published in November.Burrow suffered a nasty wipeout during the 1999 contest, striking his back and head on the rocky reef that is only feet below the surface.“I just came up seeing stars,” he said. Several waves washed him to the beach, where he collapsed before being taken to a hospital by ambulance. Doctors diagnosed a bone bruise and released him.The psychological damage, however, persisted. “It spooked me on the wave for years after that,” Burrow said.That sense of uncertainty makes Pipeline so intriguing.As of Tuesday afternoon, it was unclear when the second day of competition would be held. A low-pressure system hovered off Oahu, threatening to shred any swell with wind and rain by Wednesday.Baker and his crew would not know until early Wednesday if the conditions were right.“If you’ve got good swell, good weather, it’s a committee of none,” Baker said.'"
"'08-12-10,'1','OTTAWA — Michael Ignatieff, a former journalist, documentary producer and academic, became the effective leader of the Liberal Party of Canada on Tuesday.At a news conference, Mr. Ignatieff’s only remaining rival for the position, Bob Rae, the former Ontario premier, abandoned the party’s leadership race and backed the candidacy of Mr. Ignatieff, who was once his college roommate.Mr. Ignatieff must go through several formal approvals, the first of which will be in his party caucus on Wednesday. But when those rituals are complete, Mr. Ignatieff will formally head a coalition of opposition parties that was on the verge of taking power from Canada’s Conservative government last week.Canada now has a potential prime minister who has lived outside the country for most of the past 39 years, whose extensive résumé is short on political experience and whose past views on major issues were sometimes at odds with the broad Canadian consensus.While the director of a human rights center at Harvard University, Mr. Ignatieff, 61, supported the invasion of Iraq, a position in opposition to the Liberal Party’s stance, though he subsequently retracted his support. Though Mr. Ignatieff has also lived in Britain, he has strongly identified himself with the United States and its values in a way that is unusual for a Canadian politician.'"
"'08-12-10,'1','“They cannot continue to go down this path,” said Mr. Scanzoni, who is also chairman of the Mediaedge:cia unit of GroupM, so the arrival of the new Leno show could be “positive for the advertising community.”One plus Mr. Scanzoni sees is that the skit-and-shtick format of “The Jay Leno Show” would fit a growing trend of viewers being “more inclined to snack on television programs,” he said, “instead of digesting them week in and week out.”NBC is already benefiting from that trend as clips from series like “Saturday Night Live” find new fans on Web sites like hulu.com. Not only can online viewership stimulate interest in shows on TV, NBC and its partner in Hulu, Fox Broadcasting, sell commercials on the Web site.“Welcome to the future,” said Tim Spengler, United States president at Initiative, a media agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. “And there’s probably more of this to come.”Just as adults of a certain generation “have a remote in their hands,” Mr. Spengler said, “today’s kids are going to have a mouse in their hands,” making programs that can be nibbled rather than devoured more appealing.Another appeal of the new Leno show, Mr. Spengler said, is the ability to integrate brands and products into the content, which is known as branded entertainment.“The Tonight Show” has long afforded sponsors a chance to do that, dating to the days when hosts like Johnny Carson, Steve Allen and Jack Paar delivered commercials for products like Alpo dog food and Polaroid cameras. Recently, Mr. Leno has worked on branded entertainment with “Tonight” advertisers including Dockers, Garmin and Klondike.“We look forward to sitting down” with NBC executives, Mr. Spengler said, “and finding smart ways to elevate sponsor brands.”Jeff Zucker, chief executive at NBC Universal, said on Tuesday that he had discussed the concept of a weeknight show for Mr. Leno with advertisers and stations affiliated with the NBC network. He also said he had been talking to advertisers about branded entertainment ideas for the show.Brad Adgate, senior vice president for research at Horizon Media, suggested that advertisers and affiliates would welcome “The Jay Leno Show” if it delivered more viewers to the local 11 p.m. newscasts than do scripted series now.“I could see interstitials with local news personalities” during the show, Mr. Adgate said. “What Oprah Winfrey does at 4 o’clock, Jay Leno could do at 10 o’clock.”As a result, he added, “the show doesn’t have to win the time period and generate the highest ad rates to be a financial success for NBC.” That is particularly true because the production costs for the Leno show will be significantly less than for scripted series.“We have enough police procedurals on the air,” said Gene DeWitt, chairman at DeWitt Media Strategies. “This will counterprogram everything on the other networks.”“And you can count on Leno to be positive,” he added. “It’s not going to be controversial and it’s not going to be tasteless.” Such considerations are important to marketers that eschew buying commercials during contentious or polarizing programs.Mr. Leno is “family friendly,” said Andy Donchin, director for media investment at Carat, a media agency owned by the Aegis Group, who praised the NBC decision as “a bold step.”“Every year we go to the networks’ upfront presentations and they pontificate how all the new shows will be hits,” Mr. Donchin said, “but 8 out of 10, 9 out of 10, do not work.”“This is a move to protect the power of network television,” he added, “so we continue to have a platform to get broader reach, greater awareness and a high level of engagement for our clients.”Don Seaman, vice president and director for communications analysis at the MPG media agency, part of Havas, called the new show “a big opportunity,” but wondered if “Jay will translate into prime-time.”Mr. Spengler of Initiative said he saw a potential pitfall in differentiating “The Jay Leno Show” from Mr. Leno’s work on “The Tonight Show” — as well as from “Tonight” under its new host as of May 2009, Conan O’Brien.If Mr. Leno “is going to do the same show at 10 o’clock, it’s almost like, ‘Why bother?’ ” Mr. Spengler said. “It has to be somewhat different to be relevant.”A drawback suggested by Mr. Adgate of Horizon Media was that unlike scripted series like “Law & Order,” there would be “obviously little shelf life” for the new Leno show, making the reruns less valuable to NBC and advertisers.And Mr. Scanzoni of GroupM questioned the choice of the 10 p.m. time slot for “The Jay Leno Show” because many viewers choose that time to play back programs taped earlier in prime time on their digital video recorders.At a presentation on Monday at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference, David Poltrack, chief research officer at the CBS Corporation, shared data showing that at 10 p.m. “live television viewing goes down” as viewers play back shows they taped at 9 p.m., like “Grey’s Anatomy” and “The Office.”It is a problem already familiar to Mr. Leno. As popular as playback is at 10 p.m., Mr. Poltrack said, it is “the No. 1 viewing choice in late night, more than ‘The Tonight Show.’ ”One aspect of a Leno show that appeals to Madison Avenue is the relative novelty of the concept. The last time NBC offered advertisers a host of “The Tonight Show” in a prime-time talk and comedy show was “The Jack Paar Program,” from September 1962 through September 1965. But it was on Friday night only, not five nights a week.And what seems to have been the last time NBC offered advertisers the same entertainment show five nights a week was “Kukla, Fran & Ollie,” from November 1948 through June 1952. But it was on at 7 p.m. rather than in late prime time.'"
"'08-12-10,'1','Facing falloffs in ticket sales and donations, the Baltimore Opera Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday. The 58-year-old company canceled its two remaining productions of the season, “Porgy and Bess” and “The Barber of Seville,” and released its singers from their contracts, but plans to continue fund-raising. In October, The Baltimore Sun reported, a shortfall of more than $200,000 in ticket sales for the company’s season-opening production of “Aida” led to a significant cash shortage; last month a board member had to guarantee performers’ salaries for a production of “Norma.” In a statement cited by The Sun, the company’s board said it was pursuing these steps “to preserve one of the region’s most significant cultural institutions.”'"
"'08-12-10,'1','The Kuma Bolognese ($9) is tapas-size: three rice crepes steamed then fried and served with ground pork cooked down with bean paste. But there’s so much flavor in a sauce brightened with lime and chili it’s as satisfying as a main course. The lechón ($10) is simply an entree in small-plate’s clothing. A sizable slab of deep-fried pork belly, it’s more than enough pig for two.Diminutive as it is, Kuma Inn had two waiters, one more than at Gazala Place (709 Ninth Avenue, near 49th Street, 212-245-0709), a Druze-tinged spot with some of the best Middle Eastern food in New York. That single waiter never lost her good humor and never stopped moving, swinging like a metronome between the kitchen and the dimly lighted tables, delivering bowls of chickpea-studded hummus moudammas ($5), which arrive with saag pita, a thin flatbread made daily on the dome-shaped saag in front, and burekas, flaky pastries filled with goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. As my companion put it, it tasted like the best Croissanwich ever.The kitchen has a light and sure touch. The kebab halabi ($12.95), grilled skewers of ground spiced lamb and beef, was tender and juicy with a satisfying char. The osh al-saraia ($3.50), a yogurt and spongecake dessert soaked with rosewater and honey looked like cafeteria pudding, but had the delicate flavors of a more elegant confection.Gazala Place squeezes you into an alliance with your neighbors: you have to listen to their conversations and envy their food. It couldn’t be more different at the grand Congee Bowery (207 Bowery, near Delancey Street, 212-766-2828), a multilevel Chinese place with shark fins on display by the register and a private karaoke hall in the basement.The menu is so exhaustive it’s exhausting. I followed a friend’s advice and ordered House Special Chicken ($18), a whole roast chicken for two splayed open, varnished with soy sauce, crisp and succulent. It sounds familiar but it tastes unusually lively. Even snow pea shoots with garlic ($11.95), so often stringy, arrive in a generous, leafy mound.In fact, generosity is a virtue all of these restaurants have in common. Take the kaima idli ($7.99) at the vegetarian Southern India-style restaurant Saravana Bhavan (81 Lexington Avenue, near 26th Street, 212-684-7755). It is an enormous serving of chopped idli, fried until crisp and sautéed in a sauce of spices and onions. It had an appealing touch of heat, and I would have been satisfied with half the portion, but that didn’t stop me from eating the whole thing. And regretting it a little when served a Mysore onion dosa ($9.15) so large it extended well beyond the bounds of its platter.But I still don’t understand the economic model behind the chicken Pio ($9.75), a whole Peruvian-style roasted chicken that’s the trademark dish at Pio Pio Salon (702 Amsterdam Avenue, at 94th Street, 212-665-3000), the sixth of seven Pio Pios, and the largest in Manhattan. The chicken has an addictively tangy note, and it arrives with a spicy sauce made from cilantro, lime and huacatay, an Andean mint; it would be a bargain at twice the price. Add sides of rice ($3) and maduros ($3), sweet plantains, and it’s an avalanche of food.But you should still start with ceviche Lima style ($10), tender marinated corvina, a kind of bass. And order a round of frothy pisco sours ($8 each), the most authentic Peruvian version I’ve found in New York. Even on a budget you should be able to indulge in what makes dining out so much fun.'"
"'08-12-10,'1','WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J. (AP) — The drug maker Merck & Company said Tuesday that it was taking steps to become a leader in generic biotechnology drugs and sales in emerging markets, diversifying its research through partnerships and new technologies and working to maximize long-term sales of crucial products.During its annual business briefing, Merck tried to reassure investors that it has the right strategy to resume growing — after recently announcing another major restructuring and forecasting lower profits and flat revenue in 2009 because of generic competition, the recession and other problems.“Merck has been through tough times before and has rebounded in ways that few other companies have,” the chief executive, Richard T. Clark, told analysts, probably referring to the debacle over the withdrawn painkiller, Vioxx.He vowed to ensure the company rebounds after a year of transition in 2009, predicting Merck “will be one of the winners in the pharmaceutical industry of the future.”The company makes the respiratory drug Singulair and the cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia. It has been dogged by plans to seek approval for three new drugs next year, has seven more in late-stage testing and will start late-stage tests on six others in 2009.Merck is starting a new division called Merck BioVentures to make both new and follow-on, or generic, biotech drugs, management told analysts gathered at its headquarters. Such generic biologic drugs, while starting to arrive in Europe, are not yet allowed in the United States — but that will probably be a hot issue in Washington next year.The unit will use new science to speed up drug development, including glycoengineering, a technology Merck got with a 2006 acquisition that uses yeast to rapidly make antibodies and other proteins for drugs.'"

"'08-12-11,'0','In a statement Wednesday before the conference call, the league said: “Despite rumors and reports to the contrary, all A.F.L. teams are continuing to work towards ArenaBowl XXIII. As it has previously stated, the A.F.L. continues to work on long-term structural improvement options. Some of the options may impact the 2009 season.”The A.F.L. has delayed the release of the 2009 schedule. The New Orleans VooDoo folded during the off-season, and the longtime commissioner David Baker resigned in July.The 16-team A.F.L. has produced talented players — most notably Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner, a former Super Bowl most valuable player — but it is known as much for its high-scoring games and famous owners as it is for the teams on the field.The former N.F.L. players in front-office positions include John Elway of the Colorado Crush, Mike Ditka of the Chicago Rush and Ron Jaworski of the Philadelphia Soul. The rock star Jon Bon Jovi is a majority owner of the Soul, the 2008 ArenaBowl champion. In 2006, the league signed a five-year television contract with ESPN. The network had no comment on the league’s business activity.The A.F.L. experienced record attendance in the 2008 season, averaging 12,958 fans per game. Also, it said, viewership of the league’s games on ESPN2 rose 12 percent from 2007.“We had agreed to review whether an investment made sense for us,” Mark Barnhill, a principal with Platinum Equity, said. “At that point in the process, it was premature to speculate whether the transaction would be consummated. I’m just not in a position to make a comment other than that.”Luke Stahmer, the vice president for operations of the Colorado Crush, said: “I think if you just look at assets and expense and what it costs to run a football team and what we’re spending and what we’re taking in, the model is currently not favorable for continuing a profitable operation. Like any business model, we have successful high-profile owners who don’t want to be throwing their money out the window.”Although many team officials declined to comment on the league’s economic status, some executives said the A.F.L. and its teams would need to evaluate their budgets by reducing spending. Those cuts may come from the salaries for players and executives, among other areas that could be re-evaluated.“We need a model that collectively works for the group,” Jason Jones, the owner of the Utah Blaze, said. “At this point in time — and given the limited revenue streams that this model has — we have to look at prudent expense management and ways to produce revenue. There are numerous paths to pursue, but until they are presented, I’m not sure the extent of what they entail.”'"

"'08-12-11,'0','A little-noticed provision in the proposed bailout plan for Detroit’s automakers blesses an aggressive tax shelter sold by large banks and insurers to municipal transit agencies across the country.The provision asks the government to help the agencies by guaranteeing the economics of the complex shelter, despite years of efforts by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service to shut it down and collect billions of dollars of unpaid taxes, interest and penalties owed by the banks and insurers.The shelter, known as Silo, for sale-in, lease-out, was one of the costliest corporate tax dodges in recent years and allowed participants, including the American International Group, to avoid paying tens of billions of dollars in taxes by buying and then leasing back depreciation rights and assets at the agencies.Many of the deals are faltering because of the credit crisis and have put the agencies at risk of having to make large payments to banks and insurers. Last month, the agencies asked the government to back their role in the deals. The I.R.S., which banned the shelter in 2004, offered a so-called amnesty in August to more than 45 corporations that engaged in more than 1,000 Silo deals involving municipal property.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, said on Wednesday that the provision was “a dark-of-night move that unravels an important tax reform and benefits tax shelter participants, including transit agencies, corporations and foreign banks, on the U.S. taxpayers’ dime.”'"
"'08-12-11,'0','PARIS — The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, made his reputation as a fierce proponent of human rights, founding Doctors Without Borders and famously helping to carry rice up the beach in Mogadishu, Somalia, in the middle of severe civil warfare in 1992.Mr. Kouchner, a Socialist, shocked many supporters when he agreed to join the center-right cabinet of President Nicolas Sarkozy. But he shocked them again on Wednesday when he admitted in an interview that “there is permanent contradiction between human rights and the foreign policy of a state, even in France.”Speaking to the newspaper Le Parisien for the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on Wednesday, Mr. Kouchner said: “One cannot decide the foreign policy of a country only as a function of human rights. To lead a country obviously distances one from a certain Utopianism” — in French — “angélisme.”Mr. Kouchner, 69, known for his frankness and his emotional politics, also said that he had erred in asking Mr. Sarkozy to name a minister of state for human rights in the Foreign Ministry. Mr. Sarkozy granted that request, and Rama Yade, 32, a Senegal-born French lawyer, was given the job.But it was a mistake, Mr. Kouchner said. “I think I was wrong to ask for a secretary of state for human rights.” The contradiction between human rights and foreign policy can be productive, he said, “but was it necessary to give it a governmental character by creating a secretary of state?” He answered: “I no longer believe so, and it was an error on my part to propose it to the president.” Ms. Yade, he said, “has done, with talent, as well as she could.”Later in the day, Ms. Yade said she was not naïve enough to think that foreign policy “is constructed simply on the values” of human rights, but she said that “France has not renounced its role as the country of human rights,” and that the French people “know that human rights serve a purpose.” There has been talk that Mr. Sarkozy would like to move Ms. Yade to another job, perhaps as one of the leaders of his party’s legislative list for the European Parliament.Others were quick to defend her and the job, including the leader of the party’s deputies in the National Assembly, Jean-François Copé, who said the job was useful. Hélène Flautre, a Green European legislator who leads that Parliament’s human rights commission, criticized Mr. Kouchner, calling his remarks “intolerable” and “scandalous.”'"
"'08-12-11,'0','In a sweeping critique made public Wednesday, an expert panel of the National Research Council said the federal government was not doing enough to identify potential health and environmental risks from engineered nanomaterials. It called for a sweeping new effort, involving key players in and out of government, to assess them.Nanomaterials are engineered on the scale of a billionth of a meter, perhaps 1/10,000 the width of a human hair. They are turning up in a range of items including consumer products like toothpaste and tennis rackets and industrial products like degreasers or adhesives. But some experts say they may pose health or environmental risks. For example, researchers in Scotland reported this year that carbon nanotubes may pose the same health risks as asbestos.“Industry wants to run with it,” said Andrew D. Maynard, chief science adviser to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnology at the Woodrow Wilson Institute, who was the chairman of the panel. But he added, “one of the big barriers at the moment is understanding how to use it safely.”The panel analyzed the risk research strategy of the National Nanotechnology Initiative, the program to coordinate federal efforts in nanotechnology research and development. Its report concluded that the initiative’s strategy “does not present a vision, contain a clear set of goals, have a plan of action for how the goals are to be achieved, or describe mechanisms to review and evaluate funded research and assess whether progress has been achieved.”The panel’s vice chairman, Martin Philbert, a toxicologist at the University of Michigan, said a better risk assessment method was crucial because “right now we have no good way of measuring how much of this material is in the environment and what form it is in without going to herculean efforts and using expensive equipment that is not easily deployed in the field.”'"
"'08-12-11,'0','Hundreds of actors are already on board, including names like Ed Asner, Justine Bateman and Viggo Mortensen, judging from their public comments. But other working actors appear to be balancing the fight for a better contract against their desire to walk picket lines during a recession.“Getting the strike authorization will be a tall order given the economic crisis,” said David M. Smith, a labor economist at Pepperdine University. “I expect leaders wouldn’t be pushing for this vote if they didn’t think they could win, but I think it will be very close.”So SAG leaders are digging in for battle with their own members, using a multifaceted sales strategy. Their campaign includes e-mail messages to members, strongly worded fact sheets and imploring video messages. In the latest video, posted on the SAG Web site on Tuesday, Alan Rosenberg, the guild president, looked calmly into the camera and tried to address fears about striking at such an awkward time.The studios, Mr. Rosenberg said, “hope to use the economic uncertainty of 2008 to scare you into making a deal you will regret in 2010 and beyond.”The centerpiece of the campaign is a series of meetings — some with members, some with publicists and managers — to press the case for a strike authorization and to generate media attention. On Monday, SAG held a three-hour informational meeting in Los Angeles that was attended by an estimated 500 members.“The meeting confirmed that there is a great deal of support for a strike authorization,” said Doug Allen, the guild’s executive director. “I’m feeling positive.” A similar event is planned for New York next Monday, with a much larger Hollywood event planned for the middle of next week.On Wednesday, SAG summoned publicists and managers who represent prominent actors to meetings in Los Angeles and New York.SAG leaders say the contract offer from producers is not adequate when it comes to the streaming of professionally produced video on the Internet. They also say actors should receive more money from the sale of DVDs, and compensation and control over the integration of products into television programs and movies.The guild plans print ads and more videos over the next two weeks. A guild spokeswoman described the financial drain of the campaign as significant; insiders estimate the price tag at several hundred thousand dollars.SAG is battling the deep-pocketed Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the organization that negotiates labor contracts on behalf of the major studios. The group has introduced its own aggressive public relations effort against the strike authorization, orchestrated by a cadre of studio communications experts.Most visibly, the group took out a full-page ad in The Los Angeles Times on Dec. 1. Signed by the chief executives of the industry’s eight largest filmed entertainment companies, the strongly worded “open letter to the entertainment industry” implied that SAG was lucky producers have not revised their offer downward as the economy has slumped.Studios have also taken the unusual step of posting their entire contract offer on the Internet for actors to scrutinize for themselves, and have been encouraging actors to reject SAG’s stance in ads in industry trade newspapers and via fliers distributed at casting agencies. An animated graphic on the organization’s Web site estimates that a strike will cost actors $2.5 million a day.Many other factions are lining up against a strike, too. Many agents, still suffering the aftermath of the 100-day writers’ strike of a year ago, are waging a private campaign against any work stoppage.The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the unions representing directors and writers have already settled, adding to the pressure on SAG members. And a wide variety of businesses that serve the entertainment industry — dry cleaners, lumberyards, florists, restaurants — have been warning actors about the pain a strike would inflict on them.In his most recent video, Mr. Rosenberg addressed these people. “We are sensitive to the needs and concerns of everybody who works in this industry,” he said, adding that a strike authorization vote “is a last-resort option but one that is critical.”'"
"'08-12-11,'0','“People are saying: ‘It’s that time of year; I want to buy something, but I feel a little weird,’ ” Ms. Goldberg said. “Often they tell me, ‘I don’t want to be out there making an announcement with a big bag that says Harry Winston.’ ”Private dealers, many of them dilettantes who acquire their wares from designer friends, at trade shows and from dealers and artisans in exotic locales, are the bane of recession-battered high-end merchants. Established retailers are hard pressed to compete with such luxury pop-up shops while maintaining inventories and absorbing the high costs of operating their businesses.But under-the-radar parties offer the well heeled, and the well connected, a chance to snap up temptations without an inner censor chiding them for their spendthrift ways.“There is certainly a stigma to spending openly in this economy,” said Eric Spangenberg, a consumer psychologist and the dean of the business school at Washington State University. “These people don’t want to appear flippant by disregarding the woes of the economy,” he said, “but they still want to get their shop on, and they’re going to find a way.”Those who cannot wean themselves off the shopping habit flock to events that are, in Dr. Spangenberg’s phrase, “the high-end equivalent of a Tupperware party.” There they trade gossip and air kisses — and spring for crewelwork pashminas or pavé diamond pet collars.Sure, they are shopping. “But they are also enjoying the camaraderie and a social experience,” said Joan Horton, an event planner and decorator who offered a selection of shrugs she bought during buying trips abroad. Last week she displayed those items, sold under the Shrug Shop label, at a lavish three-day shopathon in the apartment of a friend.The gathering, the brainchild of a clutch of freelance stylists, designers and merchants, offered handmade Balinese lace blouses, ikat patterned tablecloths, Indian shawls, snakeskin bags and Bakelite bangles.“We were looking for a retail outlet,” said Amy Eller, an organizer of the event. But then the Dow went into free fall, putting a crimp in their plans. “We decided we would just become a floating marketplace,” she said.That marketplace took the form of a haute bohemian souk on Park Avenue, stocked with items priced from $25 to $700, shown off against a backdrop of crimson walls, 19th-century lithographs and faux leopard carpeting worthy of Elsie de Wolfe. Ten percent of the proceeds from the event, which drew about 300 guests and took in an estimated $60,000, went to VetDogs, which provides service dogs for disabled veterans.“People like the private atmosphere,” Ms. Eller said. “And they also felt they were giving back a little while they shopped.”SIMILAR opportunities for altruism may have eased the consciences of the 250 guests at the International Fashion party, a by-invitation event held last week at the Clift Hotel in San Francisco to benefit Rebekah Children’s Services, which aids children with emotional and behavioral problems. But the party, which attracted the social figures Vanessa Getty, Sloan Barnett and the wives of several Silicon Valley executives, was also a magnet for trophy hunters. Filigreed chokers and diamond-studded earrings with an ornate Asian cast were offered alongside hair and eyelash extensions and a rack of furs supplied by Saks Fifth Avenue, which saw an opportunity to reach affluent clients. Prices ranged from $100 to $10,000 — or, furs apart, about 10 percent above the wholesale cost.“We don’t need to mark up items so much as a store might,” said Dorothy Toressi, an organizer of the benefit. “We don’t need to hold inventories or pay salaries or other costs of overhead.”After checking in at the door and filing by a phalanx of security guards, guests sipped Champagne, fingered baubles arranged on muslin-draped tables and tested the heft of new handbags, happy all the while to be mingling with their own.“These parties can be social networking opportunities,” said Susanna Stratton-Norris, a London-based knitwear designer who offered her opulent cashmeres for sale last month in a suite at the Regency Hotel in New York. She pulled her guest list together from a roster of clients she had cultivated in an earlier career as a decorator.“These people felt as if they belonged to a club,” Ms. Stratton-Norris said, one that caters to their tastes “and where they could meet like-minded people.” Socially at ease, they were free to indulge an acquisitive streak, “not embarrassed to purchase in multiples or to tell me, ‘I’ll have one of these in every color.’ ”Other covert shoppers conduct their operations on the Web.“It seems counterintuitive, but the big ticket items are flying out,” said Ricky Serbin of Ricky’s Exceptional Treasures, a luxury resale store on eBay. Mr. Serbin said that in one week in November, he sold three Oscar de la Renta gowns, each for about $3,000. In flusher times they might have languished while shoppers indulged a yen for finery at luxury boutiques and upscale department stores.What’s changed? “People like the anonymity of the Web,” Mr. Serbin suggested. “No one can see you coming out of Neiman Marcus moving a ball gown.”Tatiana Sorokko, who recently bought a Ralph Rucci ensemble from Mr. Serbin, supported that theory. “In this economy, the people I know are making adjustments. Their transactions tend to be between themselves and the seller,” said Ms. Sorokko, a former model and the owner with her husband, Serge, of a gallery in San Francisco.Stealth shopping provides the satisfaction of “buying something special from a person who you trust,” she said. “But you haven’t gone public. No one will talk.”'"
"'08-12-11,'0','“The anecdotal evidence is still overwhelming that there are people who think they are good borrowers who can’t get loans,” Mr. Frank said.The criticism fell largely on Neel T. Kashkari, the Treasury’s interim assistant secretary for financial stability, who came under the most intense questioning throughout the five-hour hearing.Mr. Kashkari said Treasury firmly intended to develop the tools to measure bank lending with federal capital. The department is working now with bank regulators to determine whether data that is already being gathered from banks can become the basis for that kind of monitoring.Mr. Frank warned him that Congress was unlikely to approve the next $350 billion installment in the overall $700 billion bailout program unless it was convinced the Treasury was effectively measuring lending by participating banks. To that end, Mr. Frank said, he has agreed to a request from lawmakers that he summon bank executives to explain how they are using federal money.On Wednesday evening, before a final vote on a rescue of the auto industry, the House unanimously approved an amendment sponsored by Representative Steven C. LaTourette, an Ohio Republican, that would force banks receiving federal bailout money to disclose new lending in their quarterly reports.Mr. Kashkari was repeatedly questioned on whether the Treasury had tied enough strings to the bailout money disbursed since the program was enacted in October.In response, Mr. Kashkari drew a distinction between the conditions imposed on failing institutions as they were being rescued and strings tied to the money being injected into healthy banks to strengthen the financial system.The Treasury has been “very aggressive” in dealing with failing institutions like Fannie Mae and the American International Group, he said. It has required the replacement of top management and demanded “the ultimate sacrifice” from shareholders as the price of the bailout.But he argued that it would be counterproductive to impose similarly drastic conditions on healthy banks that receive money because the goal of those investments is to encourage the private sector to invest alongside the government.Overly harsh conditions “will discourage private investors from getting in,” he said. “We don’t want to scare them off.”Throughout the hearing, lawmakers also mentioned their concern that not enough was being done to prevent foreclosures.“You have done nothing,” said Maxine Waters, Democrat of California. “What is your resistance to helping homeowners stay in their homes?”Mr. Kashkari, while polite, nevertheless stoutly defended the department’s efforts to stabilize the financial system, saying that the nation had avoided a major bank failure and that credit markets had shown some improvement.“People often ask, ‘How do we know our program is working?’ ” he said. “First, we did not allow the financial system to collapse. That is the most direct, important information. Second, the system is fundamentally more stable than it was.”While he said Treasury was working with bank regulators to address foreclosures, he added that the preservation of financial stability was not an unrelated achievement.“Imagine how many foreclosures we would have had if we’d allowed the financial system to collapse,” he said.The committee also heard from Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and a member of the Congressional oversight panel monitoring the bailout, and Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor and the panel’s chairwoman.The panel’s initial report, posing a set of questions it intended to explore as it studied the bailout program, was delivered on Wednesday without Mr. Hensarling’s endorsement.He told the committee he did not endorse the report because he was not sure the oversight panel was working as he thought it should, though he commended it for its efforts. He wondered if “every panel member has the resources and rights necessary to conduct effective oversight.”'"
"'08-12-11,'0','“I told them, this is just a civilian proposal and there’s nothing to be afraid of,” he said by phone shortly after his release. “But they said senior officials attach great importance to it. I don’t think this is the end of it yet.”Human rights advocates said they were especially worried about the fate of Mr. Liu, who may be charged with “inciting subversion of state power,” a more serious crime that carries a three-year term. It would not be his first experience in the Chinese penal system. He spent 20 months in jail for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations. In 1996, he was sentenced to three years of hard labor for criticizing the Chinese Communist Party.Such experiences have done little to quiet Mr. Liu, 53, a former philosophy professor who directs the Independent Chinese PEN Center, a group of writers who advocate for broader free speech.The letter that Mr. Liu and others wrote does not mince words. It calls the current political system “disastrous” and blames the government for “stripping people of their rights, destroying their dignity and corrupting normal human interaction.” Among the charter’s 19 recommendations are a new constitution, legislative democracy, freedom of religion and an independent judiciary.“Authoritarianism is in general decline throughout the world,” the letter says. “In China, too, the era of emperors and overlords is on the way out. The time is arriving everywhere for citizens to be masters of states.”Pu Zhiqiang, a free speech lawyer and one of the signers, said the authorities should embrace the letter as a set of suggestions to help them reach the goals they have annunciated in their laws and directives. “We’re not saying anything new here,” Mr. Pu said. “This is not some plot to overthrow the Communist Party.”He acknowledged that the letter was making a big splash, and with the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown six months away, the authorities are wary of any public agitation. “This only shows they lack confidence in their rule and are afraid to confront history,” he said.Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher in Hong Kong for Human Rights Watch, said he feared that the prosecution of Mr. Liu would signal a harder government line against political dissidents. In recent years, he noted, public security officials have largely tolerated Mr. Liu’s advocacy, but the letter may have crossed a line.“It cuts across social classes and brings together people from all over the country,” Mr. Bequelin said. “This kind of thing traditionally rings alarm bells in police headquarters.”A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the letter or Mr. Liu’s detention, saying that he knew nothing about either. China Daily, a state-run newspaper, observed Human Rights Day with a full-page article piece by Wang Chen, minister of the State Council Information Office.The article documents what Mr. Wang called China’s three-decade pursuit of human rights, noting that China has 229 laws and 600 administrative decrees that protect individual rights. China added “respecting and protecting human rights” to the Constitution in 2004, he added.“I firmly believe that so long as we unswervingly implement the constitutional principle of respecting and protecting human rights, constantly improve democracy and the rule of law, our society will become more harmonious and people will live a still better life,” he wrote.But he ended with a warning that pushing China would poison international relations and harm the development of human rights. “All people of all countries should enjoy freedom and equality,” he wrote. “But restrained by economic development level, cultural traditions and social systems, people have different understandings and demands with regard to human rights.”'"

"'08-12-12,'1','California regulators on Thursday adopted the country’s first comprehensive plan for curbing emissions of heat-trapping gases. The plan establishes the broad outlines of a system of trading pollution permits and allocates among various industry sectors — transportation, smokestack industries, housing and others — the responsibility for cutting emissions to 1990 levels in the next 12 years.The plan also commits the state to a goal that many industries in California have resisted: auctioning all the pollution permits created under the new plan, rather than giving some away to the industries that produce emissions. But the California Air Resources Board, the agency that voted unanimously to adopt the plan, stopped short of setting a timetable for reaching that goal.The plan affects a broad swath of the state’s economic life, including how people get to work and how they build and heat their homes.Mary Nichols, the chairwoman of the Air Resources Board, said in a statement that the plan would spur the development of new technologies.The California plan is in many respects a work in progress — akin to a house that has a roof and walls, but with an interior not yet finished.

"'08-12-12,'1','LOS ANGELES — California is starting what banking experts call the nation’s largest, most ambitious effort by a state government to enable people, especially immigrants and the poor, to open and maintain bank accounts.The program, Bank on California, which is to be announced Friday in Sacramento, will seek to create 100,000 accounts over two years among residents here and in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and Fresno. It is based on a two-year trial in San Francisco, where 31,000 accounts were opened by first-time users.“For a governor of a state the size of California to stand up and say access to financial services for everyone is a critical issue is very significant,” said Jennifer Tescher, director of the Center for Financial Services Innovation, a nonprofit research group affiliated with the Shore Bank in Chicago.Under the program, more than 30 banks and credit unions will receive grants from the William J. Clinton Foundation to enable them to offer residents low- or no-fee accounts, to train them how to use banks and in many cases to waive overdraft fees the first few times.“When there are such a staggering amount of people that are not having a checking account or a savings account and getting their paychecks cashed in some other place where they have to pay dearly for that,” Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said in a telephone interview, “you say to yourself, ‘I think we have to do a better job.’ ”'"
"'08-12-12,'1','G.M. has said its cash reserves are falling by more than $2 billion a month, and the company has hired bankruptcy advisers, including Harvey R. Miller of the firm Weil Gotshal & Manges. Chrysler is a private company, but its sales are falling faster than any other company in the industry, and has acknowledged it will run out of money soon, too.Many of their suppliers are teetering on the verge of bankruptcy themselves, and do not have the luxury of extending credit much longer.“I don’t think that suppliers will be able to get through the month without continued payments on their receivables,” said Neil De Koker, chief executive of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association in Troy, Mich., a trade group.When suppliers big and small start failing, the flow of parts to every automaker in the country will be disrupted because as suppliers typically sell their products to both American and foreign brands with plants in the United States.“There’s no question it will hit Toyota, Honda and Nissan too,” said John Casesa, principal in the auto consulting firm Casesa Shapiro Group.“Many of the small suppliers will simply liquidate because they don’t have the resources to go reorganize in Chapter 11 bankruptcy,” Mr. Casesa said. “They’ll just go away.”It is the dire scene laid out at the first set of Congressional hearings on an auto bailout in mid-November by Ford’s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally.“Should one of our domestic competitors declare bankruptcy, the effect on Ford’s production operations would be felt within days, if not hours,” Mr. Mulally said. He has said his company has enough cash to last through 2009, even if the current sales environment for new vehicles — down 16 percent over all so far this year — continues.In years past, suppliers have often been able to assist a troubled automaker by extending payment periods to get through tough times.But by Mr. De Koker’s estimation, hundreds of suppliers no longer have that flexibility. They cannot borrow money in a frozen credit market, and they cannot buy raw materials without first being paid for parts they already shipped.The Big Three, along with their foreign competitors, are what most people think make up the entire auto industry. But the car manufacturers are just the top of the pyramid.While G.M., Ford and Chrysler employ 239,000 people in the United States, the country’s 3,000 or so auto suppliers have more than 600,000 workers.Suppliers range from large, publicly held companies that make car seats and axles, to much smaller firms that provide clamps, hoses and stamped metal parts.Like the Big Three, most of the bigger suppliers have been restructuring their operations drastically to match the shrinking demand for new vehicles.For example, Dura Automotive Systems, which makes brake pedals, doors and glass parts, has cut 2,600 jobs in the last 60 days and consolidated seven corporate divisions into four, and cut travel expenses and subscriptions.“We’re operating as if we don’t know where the bottom is,” said Timothy D. Leuliette, Dura’s chief executive. “It’s as if we are hungry all the time, and we don’t know where things are going.”Dura, a global company with sales of $1.8 billion, is in better shape than many other suppliers. Even so, Mr. Leuliette joined other supplier executives on a trip to Washington last week to knock on Congressional doors in support of federal aid to the automakers.“Most of the suppliers are not highly waged; they have no big pensions,” Mr. Leuliette said. “People affected by all this are just the average Joes. Washington has a myopic view of the auto industry. They just think of the Big Three and don’t think of us.”Suppliers make most of the 15,000 parts that go into a single car. More than 70 percent of a car’s value — from the seats to the chassis, from the electronics to the bumpers — are sold to the automakers by suppliers.Since 2004, the supplier workforce has fallen by 23 percent from 783,000, according to the Original Equipment Suppliers Association.The thousands of auto suppliers operating today — most along a line stretching from Detroit down to Kentucky close to assembly plants — are expected to shrink by half, to around 1,500, over the next three years, according to estimates from Plante & Moran, a consulting firm in suburban Detroit.At Dura, tough times seem to be the order of the day. The company emerged from bankruptcy this year, which allowed it to cut $1.2 billion from its debt load and close 16 manufacturing facilities out of 48 worldwide. Still the company has been able to land $1 billion in new orders and still has around 13,000 employees worldwide — with foreign operations in Brazil, Europe, China, Japan and India.Some 27 percent of Dura’s revenues come from Ford, 9 percent from G.M. and 9 percent from Chrysler, according to the company’s federal filings. Volkswagen and Japanese automakers also represent a large portion of its business.And, like others, Dura cannot get any bank to lend it money while it waits for payments from the Big Three, who are holding off paying their bills.“For suppliers there is no place to go, no place to hide,” Mr. Leuliette said. “The automakers are not paying, so we have to carry them. They are forcing the suppliers to loan money to Ford and G.M. Until G.M., Ford and Chrysler are viewed as financially stable, the worldwide spigot is turned off to suppliers.”Mr. Leuliette said that he has worked through five previous downturns in the auto industry, but the difference with this one is the lack of bank lending. “In a normal recession, we could have gone to the capital markets, but the capital markets are closed to us,” he added.The same is true for companies further down the supply chain like TNT-EDM, a precision tool and die shop in Plymouth, Mich., that provides parts used by larger suppliers like Dura.“It’s like the dog chasing the tail,” said Tom Mullen, the company’s chief executive. “When G.M. isn’t paying the tier one guys, they are not paying us. It’s like a spoke on a hub that keeps falling off a bit. Normal course of business, we’d get paid in 35 to 45 days, 60 days max. Now, if you get paid in 120 days, you are doing good.”Mr. Mullen has seen his revenues fall from $15 million a year over the last few years to around $10 million, while saying that his plant has capacity to run at $20 million a year. He has held off investing the $1 million to $2 million he spends annually in new equipment and he has cut back on the hours of his 35 employees to avoid layoffs.“Everyone is stretched like a bungee cord,” he said. “We are waiting to hit the bottom of the river and waiting to be slingshot back up, hopefully.”“We still sell 80 percent to auto,” he added. “I’d love to sell that much to aerospace. But automotive, it’s in our blood.""'"
"'08-12-12,'1','Epstein said the Red Sox had “basically ignored” what the Yankees had done and “focused exclusively on ourselves and tried to build a foundation where we could have success year in and year out.” The Red Sox have strengthened themselves with strong scouting and player development, which has yielded stellar players like Dustin Pedroia, Kevin Youkilis and Jon Lester.“So why then would the first instinct of an observer be that, since the Yankees did something big that we have to do something big?” Epstein said. “I think the first reaction should be: O.K., the Yankees did something big to improve themselves. The Red Sox are probably going to continue to do what they have done.”In this instance, the Red Sox are expected to steer away from their philosophy and pounce on Teixeira. By focusing so heavily on nurturing young players, the Red Sox have several inexpensive players on their roster, allowing them to chase a pricey free agent when he is the right fit. Even as Scott Boras, Teixeira’s agent, pushes suitors for a $200 million contract, Teixeira is the right fit for Boston. He has averaged 34 homers and 113 runs batted in his first six seasons.Epstein admitted that signing a marquee free agent to a huge contract was “always an option” for the Red Sox, but, using a golf metaphor, he added that it was “not the go-to club in our bag.” Epstein also stressed that the Red Sox were “always looking for the right player to have.”If the Red Sox win the sweepstakes for Teixeira, they would likely shift the versatile Youkilis from first to third and try to trade third baseman Mike Lowell. Lowell, the most valuable player of the 2007 World Series, had hip surgery after the season, so he would have to prove he is healthy in spring training before a deal could be engineered.In addition to waiting for Lowell to show that his hip had healed, a deal could be difficult to execute because the Red Sox would not be willing to just unload him. Boston would want something decent for Lowell, a four-time All-Star and Gold Glove Award winner who has two years and $24 million left on his contract. Epstein said the Red Sox “have an infield,” but he added that he was open to adding someone.Epstein declined to elaborate on Boston’s interest in Teixeira and merely called him a “well-rounded player” who could help virtually any club. He said it did not behoove the Red Sox to discuss negotiations until they were complete. That measured approach could further indicate how much Boston craves Teixeira.Rather than shudder about Sabathia joining the Yankees, Esptein was effusive in praising him. Esptein gushed about how Sabathia pitched on short rest to help the Milwaukee Brewers reach the postseason in October. Since Epstein said he assumed the Yankees would always have great players, Sabathia was just a new player in the rivalry.“It’s been that way for a long time,” Epstein said. “We’ve done pretty well going toe to toe with them with a slightly different model.”'"
"'08-12-12,'1','With his dark whirlpool eyes and sensual clown’s mouth, Jeff Goldblum has always suggested an actor poised to reveal a thousand faces, many of them nightmarish apparitions. In “The Fly” we saw a few of them; more emerge in the Holocaust survivor drama “Adam Resurrected.” The movie’s unsettling opening image is a close-up of his character, Adam Stein, in clown makeup, rolling his left eye while keeping the right stationary.In no particular order Mr. Goldblum’s shape-shifting character is an imperious circus magician and knife thrower, a dog whisperer, a wily seducer, a raging drunk and a traumatized observer of genocide. Mr. Goldblum’s tour-de-force performance, alas, is not enough to transmit a steady emotional current through the movie, directed by Paul Schrader from Noah Stollman’s adaptation of a 1968 novel by an Israeli, Yoram Kaniuk.A charismatic Jewish circus performer in 1930s Berlin, Adam survives the Holocaust by exploiting his skills as an entertainer. As the film goes on to explore his extreme case of survivor’s guilt after the war, it poses familiar questions about who is sane in an insane world and assumes that simply reiterating those questions will suffice. The film is so flat that it leaves you wondering if Mr. Kaniuk’s book is ultimately untranslatable to the screen.The novel, which won extravagant critical acclaim and earned comparisons to “Catch-22” and the magical realism of Gabriel García Márquez, takes the concept of being treated like a dog to its absurdist limits. After Adam is scooped up by the Nazis, he is forced to accept a Faustian arrangement: he lives in comfort at a concentration camp as the pet dog of Commandant Klein (Willem Dafoe), a Nazi officer who remembers Adam’s nightclub animal act.This human dog is expected to amuse his owner by doing what David Letterman might call stupid human tricks, which distract Klein from the gruesome business at hand. Spending days on all fours, begging, rolling over and seizing hunks of meat with his teeth from the mouth of the commandant’s German shepherd — with which he forms an animal bond — Adam is a “good dog.” When not a pet, Adam is forced to play the violin and serenade his fellow prisoners, including his wife and daughter, as they are marched to the gas chambers. The scene in which they pass him on the way to the crematorium is one of the potentially wrenching moments that the film throws away.'"
"'08-12-12,'1','Re-signing Oliver Pérez remains a priority, but the Mets do not expect a resolution on his status until Derek Lowe — like Pérez, a free-agent client of the agent Scott Boras — makes a decision. Minaya was unable to meet with Boras during the first three days of the winter meetings but hoped to connect before leaving. The Mets could also pursue the left-hander Randy Wolf and have revealed an interest in obtaining the right-hander Jason Marquis from the Cubs. They do not seem interested in Jon Garland, who, as a Type A free agent, would cost the Mets a draft pick.“Before I start moving my dollars to offense, I’ve got to move my dollars to pitching,” Minaya said.The Mets are hopeful for a rebound from Duaner Sánchez, who in spring training will be two years removed from his second shoulder operation. They are also keen on the other reliever they got from the Mariners, Sean Green. The hard-throwing right-hander Bobby Parnell could factor into the bullpen mix or compete with Jon Niese, a left-hander, for a spot in the rotation.Shopping Scott Schoeneweis is still probable, as part of what the Mets’ chief operating officer, Jeff Wilpon, cryptically called “addition by subtraction” in October. If they are successful, the Mets could be left with only one left-hander, Pedro Feliciano, in the bullpen. Minaya suggested he would then try to add another, but the arrival of Putz and Rodriguez mitigates that need.Their high strikeout rates — each averaged more than 10 per nine innings last season — make them effective against both left-handed and right-handed hitters. Putz held left-handed hitters to a .258 average, his highest mark in three seasons, but over his career he has limited them to a .233 average. Manager Jerry Manuel did not have those true crossover pitchers in 2008, particularly after Wagner was lost for the season, and had to match up specialists to piece together the final innings.Benefiting most from the Putz trade is Rodríguez, who has not spoken with the Mets since they acquired Putz. Still, Minaya said, during their discussions Rodríguez asked him, “Who is going to get me the ball?”Putz, at one point, was considered an unlikely choice. The Mets were initially interested in obtaining their closer via trade and tried to pry loose Putz, as well as Bobby Jenks of the White Sox and José Valverde of the Astros. If he had obtained Putz before the winter meetings, Minaya said he still would have tried to sign Rodríguez.As he negotiated the trade, Minaya said he was not concerned whether Putz would feel slighted about no longer being a closer. Putz may receive opportunities to close games on the days when Rodríguez needs a rest.When they spoke late Wednesday, Minaya said Putz sounded excited about joining the Mets. He added that he and Manuel would meet with Putz to specify how he could expect to be used.That conversation will come later, perhaps not even until spring training. For now, with his bullpen transformed, Minaya can afford to relax for a bit.“Done?” Minaya said. “I think for today we’re done.”The Mets, seeking more help for their revamped bullpen, chose relievers Darren O’Day from the Los Angeles Angels and Rocky Cherry from Baltimore in the Rule 5 draft. Players chosen in the Rule 5 draft must stay on the active major league roster with their new club all season or be offered back to their old team for $25,000. (AP)'"
"'08-12-12,'1','The past week the Bagger has been in Los Angeles, but much of the Oscar talk has been drowned out by fretting about a possible strike by the Screen Actors Guild, which will seek its members’ authorization for a walkout beginning Jan. 2. The pall brings to mind last year, when the writers’ strike clobbered the Golden Globes and dampened the Oscars. The Bagger would get in a tizzy about the prospect that it will happen again, except for the small fact that people are fighting for their economic futures. A few canceled parties seem like pretty small beer by comparison.Still, it’s nice to be someplace where the world does not seem to be ending from the moment you wake up. Oscar-motivated signs and hype dapple much of the landscape, and there is something reassuring about that. Yes, our toes have not touched bottom, but jeez, aren’t all those stars beautiful?Armed with a GPS unit and a rented Chevy Impala, the Bagger found there was plenty of tempo in the Oscar story even though we are more than two months away from the big event. On Thursday the Golden Globes gave a hit of oxygen to “The Reader” and “Revolutionary Road,” two Oscar hopefuls that seemed to be faltering, by nominating them in the best drama category. And as the Bagger wandered through studio lots and industry watering holes, he came across other signs to help guide his Oscar prognostications.In the past week “Wall-E,” which is, um, a cartoon in old-timey speak, has gotten serious consideration as best picture, never mind the animated part. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association named it movie of the year, and critics from Time and Entertainment Weekly have put it at the top of their lists. “The Dark Knight” seemed to surge as well, making many of the lists and getting a lot of love from the Bagger’s contacts.The state of play for best picture nominations? “Slumdog Millionaire” seems very likely, as does “Milk,” which got kudos from the New York Film Critics Circle but not much from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the keeper of the Golden Globes. “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” while not universally adored, seems ambitious enough to satisfy many. “Frost/Nixon” will have significant demographic appeal (much of the academy came of age during this signal moment in American history), “Doubt” is fighting for a place to stand, and “Australia” seems dead on arrival, crushed under the weight of high expectation and underdelivery.'"
"'08-12-12,'1','“This announcement today is probably the best news Bell can hear,” said Brahm Eiley, a principal at the Convergence Consulting Group, a telecommunications analysis firm based in Toronto. “They were going to be saddled with a debt which would have meant that they could not have done anything.”Bell is a humbled giant. It is now the No. 3 player in Canada’s wireless market behind Rogers Communications, which also leads the cable television business, and Telus, the dominant telephone company in Alberta and British Columbia.Bell’s satellite television service has always lagged well behind cable. And Rogers in Ontario, along with Vidéotron in Quebec, are now poaching about 10 percent of Bell’s traditional local phone customers a year. Mr. Eiley estimates that cable companies now provide about one-quarter of Canada’s local telephone service after entering the business in 2004.Bell’s sole remaining area of dominance is providing services to businesses and governments, although fierce competition from Telus in that segment has lowered its profitability.While the takeover has collapsed, it did have one effect on Bell. At the request of the buyers, George Cope, a former Telus executive, was appointed as the company’s chief executive in July, replacing Michael J. Sabia.Mr. Cope’s early steps have not dealt with the company’s broad strategic issues. Instead he has mainly focused on cost cutting, eliminating 2,750 mostly middle management jobs and introducing a new logo and advertising campaign for the company.Many of Bell’s most pressing problems date back to the technology boom of the late 1990s. At that time, Bell focused on media company acquisitions rather than on network upgrades. It paid premium prices for, among other things, Canada’s largest private television network, CTV, and control of The Globe and Mail newspaper.Mr. Sabia came in and unwound the company’s media foray. But while Rogers can now compete with Bell in all of its consumer product areas including wireless, Bell’s aging network means that the company is fast losing ground in the Internet and television businesses.Bell never fulfilled plans to start selling television through an upgraded wired network about three years ago. That leaves it offering only a satellite television service. Because Canada is far north of the equator, where the system’s satellites orbit, many potential customers are unable to receive it.At the same time, Rogers and Vidéotron, a unit of the publisher and broadcaster Quebecor, are increasingly offering Internet services in some areas that offer speeds well beyond Bell’s service.Vidéotron has also recently won approval, along with three other companies, to compete in the wireless market.Troy Crandall, a telecommunications analyst with MacDougall, MacDougall and MacTier in Montreal, expects that Bell will be forced to make substantial network investments.“Sure it’s expensive,” he said. “But if they continue on the way they were going, we’re going to see cable making more inroads while the new wireless entrants take the low end of their market.”Mr. Eiley cautions that both Bell and Telus, which he said faced several of the same problems as Bell, would have to weigh carefully the potential returns from investments in network upgrades. That situation, he added, might delay or even block substantial change.“Bell could just muddle along for a pretty long time,” he said. “You can run your business that way, but you end up being a much smaller player.”'"
"'08-12-12,'1','CNBC, which has seen sharp ratings gains in recent months, initially called the economic situation a “credit crisis.” Eventually it became a “Wall Street crisis,” and before long it was a “Wall Street/Main Street crisis.” In the last week, “Great Recession” has become a popular phrase.“Sometimes there are no easy names for things that are this big and important,” Mr. Wald said. CNBC used a temporary title, “Is Your Money Safe?,” for special reports from 7 to 9 p.m. in March when Bear Stearns collapsed, and again in September and October when other investment banks folded or revamped. But in mid-November, the network renamed its 7 to 9 p.m. hours “CNBC Reports,” partly because the other title was “asking a question no one could really answer,” Mr. Wald said.The titles and logos that news organizations bestow upon major events, unseemly as they sometimes are, can affect public opinion. Already, language has influenced the debate about the economy: the depiction of the government’s $700 billion “troubled assets relief program” as a bailout helped inflame opposition to the proposal. More recently, Democrats have moved to call their stimulus plan an “economic recovery program.”The art of language did not go unnoticed during the 1930s, either. Eric Rauchway, a professor of history at the University of California, Davis, and the author of “The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Very Short Introduction,” said that by 1932, Americans were already referring to the economic downturn as a singular event. By 1933, the Stuart Chase book “A New Deal” had used the phrase “Great Depression,” and in 1934, the British economist Lionel Robbins had published a book titled “The Great Depression.”The label indicated that the downturn was “qualitatively different” from previous economic contractions. “Regarding it as exceptional probably helped people think a bit about exceptional solutions — although, you know, the problem with the New Deal was basically that it wasn’t exceptional enough,” Mr. Rauchway said in an e-mail message.Wars also receive capital-letter titles, although sometimes only with the passing of time. World War I was called The Great War and “the war to end all wars,” Mr. Williams wrote, “until we learned there would be another.”As for the current economic crisis, he added, “Sadly, we’ll come up with something to call it, soon enough ... just as soon as we figure out what it is, exactly.” Other journalists agree. “Crisis” is the most common term being used by the news media, said Ali Velshi, the chief business correspondent for CNN, but a full accounting of the story will require some distance.“We need some time to go by before we know what the turning points are and what actually happened,” he said. Mr. Velshi, whose book about the crisis, “Gimme My Money Back,” will be on bookshelves in January, says he believes that a title like the Great Intervention may suit the story. “It’s the defining characteristic,” he said. “This is the greatest intervention of the government since the Depression.”That said, assigning a name and a logo to a news event runs the risk of devaluing it in the public’s mind. The propensity to name every potential scandal a “gate,” in an allusion to the Watergate break-in that led to Richard Nixon’s resignation, “tends to cheapen it,” Mr. Wald said.Moreover, he said, reporters, editors and anchors also have a responsibility, one often discussed within news organizations in the last months, not to overreact or offer an undue sense of panic about the economic situation, whatever history winds up calling it. “Nobody wants to title it worse than it is,” Mr. Wald said.'"
"'08-12-12,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — Two banking giants, Citigroup and UBS, agreed on Thursday to buy back nearly $30 billion in risky auction-rate securities that regulators said the banks had marketed to customers as safe.The Securities and Exchange Commission formally approved the settlements with the two banks after preliminary deals that were reached in August.Securities regulators in Texas and New York also announced details of final agreements with the banks.Tens of thousands of the banks’ customers bought the auction-rate securities before the $330 billion market for them froze in mid-February, the S.E.C. said in announcing the final accords.The new settlements were the largest return of customer money in the agency’s history and all the investors will be made whole, the chairman of the S.E.C., Christopher Cox, said in a statement.Citigroup and UBS of Switzerland neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the settlements.Citigroup agreed to buy back about $7 billion in the securities from affected customers, while UBS’s repurchase totaled $22.7 billion.'"
"'08-12-12,'1','For the sake of heart disease research, 809 members of the Old Order Amish community agreed to go to a clinic in Lancaster, Pa., near their homes, and drink a rich milkshake that was made mostly of heavy cream. Over the next six hours, a group of investigators took samples of their blood, determining how much fat was churning through their bloodstreams.Most of the study participants responded as expected — their levels of triglycerides, a common form of fat in the blood, rose steadily for three to four hours and then declined. But about 5 percent had an extraordinary reaction: their triglyceride levels started out low and hardly budged.It turns out, the researchers report in the Friday issue of the journal Science, that those individuals who barely responded have a mutation that disables one of their two copies of a gene called apoC-III. The gene codes for a protein, APOC3, that normally slows the breakdown of triglycerides.With the mutated gene, people break down triglycerides unusually quickly. And, the investigators find, they also have low levels of LDL cholesterol, which at high levels increases heart disease risk. They have high levels of HDL cholesterol, which is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease. And they appear to have arteries relatively clear of plaque.To find the gene mutation, the researchers, led by Toni I. Pollin, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, scanned the entire genomes of their study subjects, looking for genetic regions that were linked to levels of blood triglycerides. That led them to a region containing the apoC-III gene. When they sequenced it, they found the mutation that destroyed its function.'"
"'08-12-12,'1','Zimbabwe’s once promising economy, disastrously mismanaged by Mr. Mugabe’s government, has been spiraling downward for almost a decade, but residents here say the free fall has gained frightening velocity in recent weeks. Most of the nation’s schools, which were once the pride of Africa, producing a highly literate population, have virtually ceased to function as teachers, whose salaries no longer even cover the cost of the bus fare to work, quit showing up.With millions enduring severe and worsening hunger, and cholera spilling into neighboring countries, there are rising international calls for Mr. Mugabe to step down after 28 years in power. But he seems only to be digging in, and his announcement about the epidemic’s end came just a day after the World Health Organization warned that the outbreak was grave enough to carry “serious regional implications.”Water cutoffs are common and prolonged here, but last week the taps went dry in virtually all of the capital’s densely packed suburbs, where people most need clean drinking water to wash their hands and food, essential steps to containing cholera. On rutted streets crowded with out-of-school children and jobless adults, piles of uncollected garbage mounted and thick brown sludge burbled up from burst sewer lines.The capital’s two largest hospitals, sprawling facilities that once would have provided sophisticated care in just such a crisis, had largely shut down weeks earlier after doctors and nurses, their salaries rendered virtually worthless by the nation’s crippling hyperinflation, simply stopped coming to work.Inflation officially hit 231 million percent in July, but John Robertson, an independent economist in Zimbabwe, estimates that it has now surged to an astounding eight quintillion percent — that is an eight followed by 18 zeros.The situation has deteriorated to such a degree that soldiers — Mr. Mugabe’s enduring muscle — rioted last week on the streets of the capital, breaking windows and looting stores, after waiting days in bank lines without being able to withdraw their meager salaries from cash-short tellers. A midlevel officer who participated in the mayhem, but spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of prosecution, said troops were enraged that they could no longer afford to buy food or send their children to school.“As we talk, children of chefs are in private schools learning while ours are playing in dusty roads,” he said bitterly, using the local term for the people in power.Rumors about this extraordinary unrest in the army’s ranks have circulated feverishly, with some speculating that the rioting was staged to justify imposing a state of emergency. Others hoped it finally signaled the beginning of the end for Mr. Mugabe.Still, the Mugabe government’s ability to clamp down on dissent seems intact. The police quelled the riot. Sixteen soldiers now face a court-martial. Beyond that, about 20 opposition party activists and human rights workers have recently disappeared. Last week, armed men abducted a well-known human rights activist, Jestina Mukoko, at dawn while she was barefoot, still in her nightgown and bereft of her eyeglasses and as her teenage son looked on helplessly.Political analysts have long predicted that Mr. Mugabe’s hold on power — which he has refused to loosen since September, when he signed a power-sharing deal with his nemesis, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai — would be broken only after the economy completely imploded and daily life became intolerable.But as the endgame of the octogenarian Mr. Mugabe’s rule plays out, the human tragedies mount.In a country with the terrible distinction of having the second highest proportion of orphans in the world — one in four children has lost one or both parents — the closing of schools and hospitals is hitting these most vulnerable children mercilessly.Aisha Makombo, 15, has been raising her 11-year-old sister, Khadija, since their mother died of AIDS last year. An expressive girl with a soft, round face, Aisha, who is H.I.V. negative, has been struggling to get drug treatment for Khadija, who is now sick with AIDS.She took her little sister, so stunted she appears half her actual age, to Parirenyatwa Hospital, the nation’s largest referral hospital, last year, but crucial test results needed to qualify Khadija for life-saving medications were inexplicably misplaced.On a later visit, Aisha was told the machine that performed the tests was broken. Now the hospital is virtually closed. Aisha said she was referred to private doctors who demanded payment in South African rand or American dollars, but the girls had no money.Aisha’s eyes filled with tears as she explained that she had been able to obtain only cotrimoxazole, an antibiotic used to treat opportunistic infections, for her little sister.Aisha used to escape the sadness of her life by going to school, but two months ago the teachers at her high school stopped showing up.“She didn’t bid us farewell, she just left,” Aisha said of her math teacher, the one she misses most of all. “At first, we thought she would come back, but then we gave up hope.”Aisha now scrambles to barter her labor for food, while her little sister, too weak to work, attends a small school run by a nonprofit group. Last week, Aisha started a four-day job, bent over in a field, readying it for planting. In exchange, she was to get two pounds of flour and a bottle of cooking oil, as well as a shirt and blouse for Khadija.The girls pray together each night before going to sleep in the tiny, grubby, windowless room they share. The small house belongs to their grandfather, but he admitted it was Aisha who provided the food for him and her 45-year-old uncle who sometimes steals the cornmeal she earns, as well as the girls’ clothes to sell secondhand.Yet the girls say they cling to their dreams. Aisha’s is to be a doctor, Khadija’s a bank teller, each hungering for what the sisters do not have — health and money for medicine and food.Zimbabwe has one of the world’s highest rates of H.I.V. infection, and now a raging cholera crisis. But with the economic collapse decimating revenues needed to run the country’s public health systems, mortality rates among cholera victims here are five times higher than in other countries, public health experts said.Mr. Mugabe’s government — in its pursuit of power and money — has also contributed to both catastrophes, analysts say.Earlier this year, the government jeopardized $188 million in aid from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria by taking $7.3 million the organization had donated and spending it on other, unrelated expenses. Only at the 11th hour, under threat that the money would be withheld, did the government reimburse the Global Fund for the missing funds.And two years ago, the government took control of Harare’s water and sewer systems from the opposition-controlled city council, depriving the local government of a crucial source of revenue to keep services functioning.“The real motive was to dilute the influence of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change and cripple them financially,” said Justice Mavezenge, an officer with the Combined Harare Residents Association, a civic group.Last week, even Mr. Mugabe’s mouthpiece, the newspaper The Herald, castigated the state-run water authority for running out of chemicals to purify Harare’s water supply — chemicals it said could have been trucked in from South Africa in less than 24 hours.The United Nation’s Children’s Fund and international donors have stepped into the void. They have begun trucking 50 tankers of fresh water into the most densely settled suburbs and will be providing water treatment chemicals for the city over the next four months, said Unicef’s acting country director, Roeland Monasch.But some aid officials fear that the epidemic will be impossible to contain because of the failing water and sanitation systems in places like Budiriro, the Harare suburb where the Chigudu children died and where half the country’s cases have occurred.“We’re not going to be able to control it,” said one aid agency adviser, speaking anonymously for fear of retribution. “The likely scenario is that people who get sick in places like Budiriro will go home for the festive season and you’ll get flash points all over the rural areas.”Cholera stole the five Chigudu children in just two days, on Nov. 17 and 18, and the grandmother and aunt who helped care for them died just days later. Their father, who returned home just hours after the last of his children died, got his first inkling of unspeakable calamity when his youngest ones weren’t there to clamber all over him as he walked in the door.“I will never get my children back,” he said.The death toll mounts each day. Chipo and Tecla Murape rushed their orphaned 5-year-old niece, Moisha, to the clinic in Chitungwiza, a city just south of Harare, last week. Nurses told the family the veins in the girl’s arms had collapsed because she had lost so much fluid. No doctor ever saw her, her relatives said, and the nurses never hit a vein. Moisha, a shy, but friendly girl, instead drank rehydration fluids.Throughout the day, she complained of a terrible thirst and a stomachache. On the advice of clinic workers, her aunts did not even hold her hand as she lay dying, fearing infection. After night fell, the nurses said there was nothing more they could do and suggested that Moisha’s relatives take her to the city’s hospital, some two and a half miles away.But there was no ambulance. Tecla Murape, 42, swaddled Moisha to her back and set off hurriedly for the hourlong walk, her heart pounding with worry. Under a dark, moonless sky, she took a shortcut through a maize field, leaping across yet another putrid sewage spill. By the time they arrived, Mrs. Murape’s clothes were soaked with Moisha’s watery diarrhea. Hours later, Moisha died.'"
"'08-12-12,'1','Mr. Reid added: “This is going to be a very, very bad Christmas for a lot of people as a result of what takes place here tonight.”The Republican leader, Senator of , said: “We have had before us this whole question of the viability of the American automobile manufacturers. None of us want to see them go down, but very few of us had anything to do with the dilemma that they have created for themselves.”Mr. McConnell added: “The administration negotiated in good faith with the Democratic majority a proposal that was simply unacceptable to the vast majority of our side because we thought it frankly wouldn’t work.”Moments later, the Senate failed to win the 60 votes need to bring up the auto rescue plan for consideration. The Senate voted 52 to 35 with 10 Republicans joining 40 Democrats and 2 independents in favor.The White House issued said it would consider alternatives but offered no assurances.“It’s disappointing that Congress failed to act tonight,” Tony Fratto, the deputy press secretary, said. “We think the legislation we negotiated provided an opportunity to use funds already appropriated for automakers, and presented the best chance to avoid a disorderly bankruptcy while ensuring taxpayer funds only go to firms whose stakeholders were prepared to make difficult decisions to become viable. We will evaluate our options in light of the breakdown in Congress.”Immediately after the vote, the administration was already coming under pressure to act on its own to prop up G.M. and Chrysler, an idea that administration officials have resisted for weeks.House Speaker and other lawmakers called on the administration to use the Treasury’s bigger financial system stabilization fund to but there may not be enough money left to do so. About $15 billion remains of the initial $350 billion disbursed by Congress and Treasury officials have said that money is needed as a backstop for existing programs.Democrats also immediately sought to blame Republicans for the failure to aid , but“Senate Republicans’ refusal to support the bipartisan legislation passed by the House and negotiated in good faith with the White House, the Senate and the automakers is irresponsible, especially at a time of economic hardship,” Ms. Pelosi said in a statement.“The consequences of the Senate Republican’ failure to act could be devastating to our economy, detrimental to workers, and destructive to the American automobile industry unless the President immediately directs Secretary Paulson to explore other short-term financial assistance options.”So far, the also has shown no willingness to step in to aid the auto industry, but Democrats have argued that it has the authority to do so and some said the central bank may have no choice but to prevent the automakers from bankruptcy proceedings that could have devastating ripple effects.The rescue plan approved by the House on Wednesday by a vote of 237 to 170 would have extended $14 billion in loans to the troubled automakers and required them to submit to broad government oversight directed by a car czar to be named by Mr. Bush.But even before the House vote, Senate Republicans voiced strong opposition to the plan, which was negotiated by Democrats and the White House. At a luncheon with White House chief of staff, , they rebuffed his entreaties for support.On Thursday morning, Mr. McConnell dealt a death blow to the House-passed bill, giving a speech on the Senate floor in which he said that Republican senators would not support it largely because it was not tough enough.“In the end it’s greatest single flaw is that it promises taxpayer money today for reforms that may or may not come tomorrow,” Mr. McConnell said.But Mr. McConnell also held out slim hope for a compromise suggesting that Republicans could rally around a set of proposals by Senator Bob Corker of who said that the bill did not set stiff enough requirements for the automakers.Mr. Obama, whose had consulted with Congressional Democrats and the Bush White House on the efforts to help the automakers, used his opening remarks at a news conference in to urge Congress to act.“I believe our government should provide short-term assistance to the auto industry to avoid a collapse while holding the companies accountable and protecting taxpayer interests,” he said. “The legislation in Congress right now is an important step in that direction, and I’m hopeful that a final agreement can be reached this week.”But in Washington, there was little appetite among Senate Republicans for yet another multibillion-dollar bailout of private companies. Still, with the Democrats and the White House eager to reach a deal, Mr. Corker’s proposal became the subject of intense negotiations well into the evening.Under his plan, the automakers would have been required by March 31 to slash their debt obligations by two-thirds — an enormous sum given that G.M. alone has more than $60 billion in outstanding debt.The automakers would also have been required to cut wages and benefits to match the average hourly wage and benefits of , and employees based in the , and the companies would have to impose equivalent work rules.It was over this proposal that the talks ultimately deadlocked with Republicans demanding that the automakers meet that goal by a certain date in 2009 and Democrats and the union urging that the deadline wait until 2011 when the U.A.W. contract expires.G.M., Chrysler and industry experts have said that the two companies would likely not survive until the end of this month without government aid, and the companies had already agreed to carry out sweeping reorganization plans in exchange for the help.The negotiations over Mr. Corker’s proposals broke up about 8 p.m. and Mr. Corker left to meet with Republican senators to brief them on the developments. The Republicans emerged from their meeting an hour later having decided they would not agree to a deal. Several of them blamed the autoworkers union.“It sounds like the U.A.W. blew it up,” said Senator , Republican of .Senator of , the senior Republican on the banking committee and a leading critic of the auto bailout proposal, said: “We’re hoping that the Democrats will continue to negotiate but I think we have reached a point that labor has got to give. If they want a bill they can get one.”The last-ditch negotiations made for a dramatic scene on the first floor of the Capitol, where high-level lobbyists for G.M. and , as well as Stephen A. Feinberg, the reclusive founder of Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm that owns 80 percent of Chrysler, gathered with senators and legislative staff in a conference room.A Democratic aide said that there were no lobbyists present who represented Chrysler.At times, various participants huddled in corners of the cavernous hallway outside the conference room, shielding their documents and whispering into their cellphones, as a throng of reporters and photographers waited nearby. Some of the lobbyists and banking committee staff members huddled by two towering windows, looking out on a frigid rain that had been falling all day.Negotiators in the talks included Mr. Corker; the assistant majority leader, Senator , Democrat of ; and the chairman of the banking committee, Senator , Democrat of .'"
"'08-12-12,'1','“We’ve underestimated how bad this crisis would get,” Mr. Braconi said, sitting behind a wooden desk in his brown-on-brown workspace a block from City Hall. “That’s what we’re trying to explain.”A few minutes before, his supervisor, Marcia J. Van Wagner, the deputy comptroller for budget, had appeared in his doorway to discuss the report on the shrinking city budget that they must deliver by Dec. 15. During the brief interchange, Ms. Van Wagner pressed him to spell out how the global slowdown is affecting the city and ribbed him about his more optimistic nature.“I’m always on the ledge,” Ms. Van Wagner said, describing her outlook. “Frank is always trying to pull me in, and I’m always trying to get him to come out on the ledge with me.”The precipice is getting crowded as the financial crisis drags on, leaving even the optimistically inclined with no silver lining to cling to. At a gathering last month at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, economic analysts tested several projections on computer models of the regional economy. The models spat back estimates of job losses in the metropolitan area during this recession that ranged from about 325,000 to nearly one million. (The latter result would be far worse than in any other recession in the last 30 years.)With such a wide spread of possible outcomes, it is no wonder that John Kenneth Galbraith, the famed economist, once said that “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.”Still, a core group of economists like Mr. Braconi are paid to try their hands at this mixture of art and dismal science. Their forecasts are predicated on mounds of data and established patterns.But some long-held notions have proved faulty in the last couple of years, like the idea that there would never be a nationwide housing slump or that investment banks would prosper whether times were good or bad.Now that some of the biggest firms on Wall Street have failed or received federal bailouts and the prices of apartments in Manhattan and houses in Queens are tumbling, the old rules do not necessarily apply.“These historical relationships, which is fundamentally what the models are based on, break down when there are structural changes in the economy,” said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the Independent Budget Office, which also forecasts how the city’s economy will perform. “It’s not just that New York City is entering into recession, but also that the driving industry in our region seems to be in the midst of longer-term structural changes that we’re going to have to take into account as well.”Like the Independent Budget Office, the office of the city comptroller serves as a check on the budgets drawn up by the mayor’s staff. After every revision to the city’s plan for collecting taxes and spending money, the comptroller responds, telling the City Council where his projections differ from the mayor’s.Though Mr. Braconi says politics do not influence their economic calculations, his staff must, of course, weigh the economic impact of political decisions and government policies. For example, in the report due out this month, the comptroller will question the mayor’s assumption that the city would not send out $400 rebate checks that had been promised to homeowners — a position that Mr. Thompson, who plans to run for mayor next year, has challenged.Believing that the City Council is likely to prevail in insisting that the checks go out, the comptroller will note a $256 million “risk” to the mayor’s plan, a gap that may require a corresponding cut in spending to balance the budget, Ms. Van Wagner said.During the heady years that followed the last recession, the comptroller’s reports tended to underestimate the surge in city revenue, from corporate and personal income taxes as well as taxes on real estate transactions. Now, with the boom over, Mr. Braconi and a team of four analysts are taking extra care to hone their estimates. “The consequences are much greater now,” he said. “The purposes to which our forecasts are being put have real consequences to real people.”Mr. Braconi, who has a doctorate in economics from the City University of New York, is sensitive to the potential impact of budget cuts, having spent more than a decade as an advocate for affordable housing. He served as the executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council before Ms. Van Wagner hired him in 2006. A Queens native with an accent to prove it, he has spent his whole life in the metropolitan area and vouches for the city’s ability to recover from recessions.Some other forecasters, like those at the Independent Budget Office, have sophisticated computer models that at a cost of several thousand dollars a month, produce estimates of employment, income and tax revenue. Mr. Braconi and his team have not purchased such a model, so they instead use arcane formulas to test hypotheses about how the recession will play out.They begin with a forecast for the national and global economies that is teased out of available data, including a consensus of widely followed economists. Feeding that number into a formula known as an input-output model produces an estimate of how much the city’s economy will grow or shrink. And — here is where art sometimes supplants science — if that estimate seems to defy reality, Mr. Braconi will tweak it using other data, or his instincts.None of that, of course, can ensure accuracy. In July, the comptroller’s report estimated that the gross city product would increase by 1.2 percent this year and that about 85,000 jobs would be lost in the subsequent downturn. But that was before the Lehman Brothers investment bank failed and the federal government rescued several big banks and insurance companies. Since then, Mr. Braconi said, there has been no denying that New York is headed into a “sharp recession.”Now, the comptroller’s office is estimating that the city’s economy did not grow this year and will shrink in 2009 and 2010. It estimates that job losses will reach 165,000 before the economy bottoms out. A higher share of the layoffs will come from outside the financial services industry — almost three-fourths compared with the estimate of 60 percent in July — because the outlook for the overall economy has worsened, Mr. Braconi said.He said he had been paying more attention to the pronouncements of Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University, who has gained fame for his early predictions of financial doom. But he said he had resisted the temptation to adopt such a dire view.“There’s a certain seductiveness to the notion that things fall apart, whether it be in economics or other walks of life,” Mr. Braconi said. “At a time like this when the chorus of doom is particularly loud, it’s important to brace yourself. There would be disastrous consequences for city agencies to fully embrace the worst scenarios.”Overstating a slowdown could lead to cuts in government programs that turn out not to have been necessary, he said. On the other hand, failing to spot a sharp drop in tax revenue can lead to drastic midyear cutbacks, like those Gov. David A. Paterson has called for in recent months.The recovery from this recession may be slow, but it will happen, Mr. Braconi said. He placed himself in the same camp as Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who is a champion of cities as hubs of creativity and dynamism.“I can’t necessarily predict the next big thing for New York or Boston other than to say that there will be a next big thing,” Mr. Braconi said. “I do have that kind of faith in New York.”'"
"'08-12-12,'1','Dollar “value meals” at fast food restaurants may not be such a bargain when you look at the potential health costs.Many of these low-cost menu items are packed with fat, salt, cholesterol and processed meat, notes The Cancer Project, a nonprofit cancer prevention organization. The group has produced a list of what it says are the five unhealthiest items sold at the nation’s largest fast food chains.The organization’s dieticians reviewed so-called value menus at five of the largest fast food chains in the nation, awarding points for such unhealthy characteristics as sodium, fat and low-fiber content. Jack in the Box’s junior bacon cheeseburger topped the list as the worst offender. The burger costs just one dollar but is packed with 23 grams of fat, including 8 grams of saturated fat, 55 milligrams of cholesterol and 860 milligrams of sodium and just one gram of fiber.The Cancer Project is affiliated with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which aggressively promotes a low-fat, vegetarian diet. The organization’s list was spurred in part by a concern that during tough economic times, more people will resort to eating inexpensive fast foods, said Krista Haynes, a dietitian with the project.A spokeswoman for Jack in the Box said that the junior bacon cheeseburger is a “great value” but that diners may also choose from healthier options, like salads and a fruit cup. They’re more expensive, however: an entrée salad with grilled chicken strips is $4.99, and a fruit cup is $2.29.'"

"'08-12-12,'1','Stocks fell Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing nearly 200 points, as investors were hit by a series of bleak economic reports that signaled further problems for exports and the labor market.The new data included 58,000 new applications for unemployment benefits last week, the highest rate since the mid-1980s, and a widening trade gap.But in a more promising sign, rates on mortgages declined.Stocks were steady most of the day but fell in late trading when it appeared that a federal bailout package for Detroit automakers was meeting strong opposition. Shares of General Motors and Ford dropped more than 10 percent.The financial sector also was under pressure and led decliners, with shares of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Merrill Lynch all down more than 10 percent after Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, said his company faced problems in the fourth quarter.At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 196.33 points, or 2.24 percent, to 8,565.09, after trading over a range of nearly 300 points during the day.

"'08-12-13,'0','Caitlin Flanagan and Benjamin Schwarz categorize gay marriage, and homosexuality in general, as “matters of morality and lifestyle.” “Lifestyle” in this context is a trivializing term, and connotes that it is a choice, on a par with deciding whether you drink red wine or white, or deciding to dye your hair.Choice is the lynchpin of the religious right’s campaigns to keep discrimination against gay people legal. Their “special rights” argument is particularly specious. If it’s not a choice, there can be no question of morality or that gay marriage, for example, is a civil right.To those who blandly assume that it is a matter of choice, please ask yourself: Did you choose your sexuality? If you did, how? And if you didn’t, why do you think I did?What all of us do choose are the beliefs we hold and follow. We are individually responsible for those choices.The deep repugnance and aversion to homosexuality held by the black church-going community revealed in the passing of Proposition 8 in California are not a wedge in the progressive agenda. They are simply a very common human failing. It is human to scapegoat.This is an opportunity to make the tent even bigger, if it is construed as an opportunity to examine prejudice from the other side.'"
"'08-12-13,'0','The paradigm has shifted. Dating is dated. Hooking up is here to stay.According to a report released this spring by Child Trends, a research group, there are now more high school seniors saying that they never date than seniors who say that they date frequently. Apparently, it’s all about the hookup.When I first heard about hooking up years ago, I figured that it was a fad that would soon fizzle. I was wrong. It seems to be becoming the norm.I should point out that just because more young people seem to be hooking up instead of dating doesn’t mean that they’re having more sex (they’ve been having less, according to the ) or having sex with strangers (they’re more likely to hook up with a friend, according to a 2006 paper in the Journal of Adolescent Research).To help me understand this phenomenon, I called Kathleen Bogle, a professor at La Salle University in who has studied hooking up among college students and is the author of the 2008 book, “Hooking Up: Sex, Dating and Relationships on Campus.”It turns out that everything is the opposite of what I remember. Under the old model, you dated a few times and, if you really liked the person, you might consider having sex. Under the new model, you hook up a few times and, if you really like the person, you might consider going on a date.'"

Maryland is a very explosive, well-coached and dynamic team, like they’ve been all season.

"'08-12-13,'0','When, as in most crises, only bad decisions were on the table, he chose the worse of the two. Let it be known.The Senate Republicans’ opposition to the bailout of the Big Three automakers confuses me. While I do understand their policy arguments, on purely political grounds it looks like suicide.Most Americans ultimately will not care much either way, but those in states with high concentrations of auto workers — Michigan, Indiana, Ohio — surely care a lot. Can the Republicans afford more disadvantages in those three states, in addition to their long-term minority status in the Northeast, Pacific West and much of the mid-Atlantic?It is telling that Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, and Richard C. Shelby, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, are both from the South. Are they unaware that their political decisions are furthering their party’s sequestration to that area of the country?I wonder if those who think the American automakers should fend for themselves recall that these companies provided employment for thousands of Americans during the Great Depression. Instead of demanding huge incentives to locate somewhere, they built many American communities and were stalwart philanthropists in those communities. They, and the state of Michigan, were considered the arsenal of democracy in our nation’s great need.I wonder if we can rely on Toyota or Honda or Hyundai or Tata Motors or Mercedes-Benz or Volkswagen in desperate times? Then again, why should I be surprised when Americans have no historical memory and a “what have you done for me lately” attitude?Both Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman would be aghast at our willingness to jettison these American companies and cast our lot with companies and nations that are fair-weather friends.You prefer that as a condition for aid, American automakers be forced to produce fuel-efficient vehicles. Yes, production must shift toward fuel-efficient vehicles. But accomplishing this through a diktat to manufacturers in exchange for loans and loan guarantees is not the complete answer.Conditions imposed on manufacturers must be married to an energy policy that establishes a floor (via a tax) on fossil fuel prices. This would send a market signal (higher prices for fossil fuels) that would catalyze not only consumer demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles, but also development of green-tech and alternative-energy industries. Increased tax revenue might be a good thing, too.Your Dec. 9 Business Day article about car dealers opens the door on one of the most challenging impediments to growth in the American auto industry: inefficient and uninspired retail distribution.Though there’s plenty of blame to go around in this national marketing tragedy, Mark Aleve of General Motors is correct in pointing out that if there were fewer dealerships with higher sales, they could invest more in facilities, people, training and advertising.In the end, the auto industry has been caught up by a powerful change sweeping consumer markets. A long period of retail cost-cutting and price discounting has led to consistent underinvestment in broader consumer experiences.Instead we’ve had poor service, me-too assortments, little assistance and declining trust in product quality. Luckily for Toyota, it figured all this out well before building its American retail system.It’s not too late for G.M., Ford and Chrysler to get back in consumers’ good graces.The writer is an adjunct professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and managing director of Chicago Strategy Associates.'"
"'08-12-13,'0','“There was a joke around that Bernie was actually the Jewish T-bill,” the executive went on, referring to the ultrasecure investment of treasury bills. “He was that safe.”Mr. Madoff had traveled far from his roots in eastern Queens, where as a young man he cobbled together a $5,000 grubstake from his earnings as a lifeguard and sprinkler installer to start the famed investment firm that eventually bore his name, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities.He had come to move easily in the clubby Jewish world that iterates between New York City and its suburbs and southern satellites like Palm Beach.Indeed, in the world of Jewish New York, where Mr. Madoff, 70, was raised and found success, he is largely still considered as a macher: a big-hearted big shot for whom philanthropy and family always intertwined with — and were equally as important as — finance.Mr. Madoff, who attended but never finished law school, was already rich by his early 50s, largely due to his intuitive grasp of the centrality of computers to high finance, he once told Forbes magazine. In an era when many, if not most, transactions were conducted on the phone, he turned his company into a fully automated operation that could make trades in as little as four seconds flat.And soon the Madoff name — if not quite the equal of the Tisch name, for example — carried a quiet power.""The guy never flaunted anything,” said one longtime friend. “And that fit with his rate of return, which was never attention-grabbing, just solid 12-13 percent year in, year out.""The friend, a private investor who knows Mr. Madoff from the Palm Beach Country Club and from the Hamptons, said friends and investors had been calling nonstop since the arrest.""The pain is just unbelievable,” the friend said. “He was part of the family for so many people. There was this quiet culture of people, slightly older-money, who maybe weren’t that interested in the market, who kept saying to each other, ‘Just give Bernie your money, you’ll be fine.’ ""That culture had perhaps its best expression at the half-dozen golf clubs he belonged to, such as the Palm Beach Country Club in Florida.“He and his wife were nice golfers,” said Denise Lefrak Calicchio, part of the Lefrak real estate family, who knew the Madoffs socially through several of their clubs. “He and his wife seemed lovely.”With time, some wealthy investors even joined clubs in order to become part of Mr. Madoff’s investments, some who knew him said. It was considered a favor to be introduced to the man as a potential investor.“There were people joining golf clubs just to get into his fund,” said one investor who declined to be named. “This guy was held in such high regard.”A member of the Palm Beach club said the Madoffs did not socialize as much as other members did, nor did they fight as aggressively as others to keep up with the club’s more aerobic social climbers. They were well-liked, and did not appear to be part of the “blister pack,” as one club member put it, a term that refers to those who get blisters on their hands and feet from ascending social ladders.“They seemed to stay apart from the herd,” the club member said. “They chose not to get into that social rat race.”Mr. Madoff was, in fact, so popular with investors that he often turned away their money. After Barbara S. Fox, president of the Fox Residential Group in Manhattan, had sold his son, Andrew, an apartment, she pleaded with Mr. Madoff — unsuccessfully — to let her invest in the Madoff funds.“I literally begged him,” she said. While Ms. Fox does not know why he turned her down, she called him “protective.”Still, his refusal to take some investors added to his allure. Robert Ivanhoe, chairman of the real estate practice of the law firm Greenberg Traurig, said that he asked one of his clients who over two decades invested at least $50 million with Mr. Madoff to approach Mr. Madoff to see if he could invest with him. He knew Mr. Madoff as a major player in charitable groups.Mr. Madoff declined. Mr. Ivanhoe said that the rejection made investing with Mr. Madoff even more appealing.“He was turning people away all the time,” Mr. Ivanhoe said. “He didn’t need to be active in a charity to get more investors. People chased to invest in him.”As Mr. Madoff’s success increased, so too did his interest in philanthropy, which was often handled, much like his business itself, as a family enterprise. He sits on the board of trustees for Yeshiva, whose officials issued a statement on Friday saying they were “shocked” at the news of Mr. Madoff’s arrest. And with his wife, Ruth, he runs the Madoff Family Foundation, a $19 million operation that last year gave money to Kav Lachayim, a volunteer group that works in Israeli schools and hospitals, and to the Public Theater in New York.It is perhaps a testament to the family’s importance in Jewish philanthropic circles that when a nephew of Mr. Madoff’s, Roger Madoff, died of leukemia in April 2006, paid death notices appeared in newspapers from charitable organizations ranging from the Gurwin Jewish Geriatric Center to the Lauri Strauss Leukemia Foundation to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum.Family, too, has always been of outsized importance to Mr. Madoff, evidenced by the number of relatives he has brought into his business. His brother, Peter, joined the firm as a senior managing director shortly after graduating from law school in the late 1960s, and both of Mr. Madoff’s sons, Mark and Andrew, joined the team after finishing their own educations. In 1978, Charles Weiner, a son of Mr. Madoff’s sister, joined the firm; 17 years later, Peter Madoff’s daughter, Shana, took a job with the company as a lawyer.The family was so close that they even lived within blocks of each other on the Upper East Side.“What makes it fun for all of us is to walk into the office in the morning and see the rest of your family sitting there,” Mark Madoff told Wall Street and Technology magazine in August 2000. “That’s a good feeling to have. To Bernie and Peter, that’s what it’s all about.”And when Mr. Madoff finally told two senior executives of his problems, he chose to confide in his sons, who would notify the authorities and begin a quick countdown to his arrest.'"

"'08-12-13,'0','It is difficult to map out the swath of damage that the Madoff firm’s collapse is likely to cut through the hedge fund industry, not to mention a wide range of other investors. But among its biggest investors were funds of funds, firms that invest in several hedge funds and are nominally among the most sophisticated judges of character in the industry. Because Mr. Madoff reported consistently positive returns for more than a decade — some say impossibly so — he drew vast amounts of business from them.Now, the collateral damage is likely to add to the chaos that has already been ravaging hedge funds. Spooked by losses and forced to raise cash quickly as the financial crisis ballooned, investors have sought to pull out their money from hedge funds, causing serious pain, and even some forced closures. A growing list of large, well-known firms have sought to block redemption requests in an effort to stem a mass exodus of investors who now desperately want to get into cash.In a letter sent Friday, the Citadel Investment Group said it was halting redemptions at its two largest hedge funds through March 31.Confidence will only weaken further with the Madoff firm scandal, intensifying pain for the industry.“If you couple this with the deleveraging already, this means one thing: more redemptions,” said Campbell R. Harvey, a professor at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University.The losses from the Madoff firm will also raise more questions about how well funds of funds perform due diligence, a concern already magnified by losses in the hedge fund industry.“Funds of funds that invested in Madoff will get a double whammy,” said Whitney Tilson, who runs the T2 Partners hedge fund. “Not only will they have to take a loss, but they are going to have to do an awful lot of explaining for how they ever got fooled here.”Indeed, while many investors are asking how regulators could have missed a towering Ponzi scheme, some are beginning to question the whole process of due diligence. Several potential investors had raised questions about Mr. Madoff’s claims of steady returns over the years, but regulators apparently took few steps to investigate.“Where were the auditors?” asked Bill Grayson, the president of Falcon Point Capital, a hedge fund based in San Francisco. “Where was his chief compliance officer? Where was the S.E.C.?”Already under heightened scrutiny, the collapse of the Madoff firm is likely to propel calls for greater regulation of the hedge fund industry, beyond the current optional registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission.What’s more, many investors in hedge funds are likely to ask tougher questions of the managers of these firms. Executives who are loath to disclose their investment strategies — instead running a “black box” model, as Mr. Madoff infamously did — will probably come under increased pressure to open the lid on their operations, at least a little bit.“I suspect that many investors are going to start asking many more questions of their managers,” Mr. Tilson said. “They will be much less tolerant of black box managers.”Still, some disagree that Mr. Madoff’s arrest will lead to widespread contagion throughout the industry. Mr. Tilson argued that most investors would see the case as an unusual circumstance whose breadth and brazenness is unlikely to be duplicated. “This is not a Lehman Brothers,” he said.'"
"'08-12-13,'0','Honda Motor said that it would further cut vehicle production in North America as it adjusted to plunging auto demand but would not lay off workers at the affected plants. Honda, based in Tokyo, said it would reduce production by an additional 119,000 vehicles for its fiscal year ending March 31, bringing expected production for the year to 1.3 million units. A Honda spokesman, Ed Miller, said the cuts would take place at five of Honda’s seven plants in the United States and Canada. Employees at the plants will be given other tasks or can take paid or unpaid vacation time, he said. The company’s latest production cuts come on top of previous reductions of 56,000 vehicles for North America in this fiscal year. Last month, Honda said it was cutting production in Japan and Europe by 61,000 vehicles. Honda fell $1.07, or 4.7 percent, to close at $21.93 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.'"
"'08-12-13,'0','Dollar sales of store brands increased 10 percent during the 52 weeks before Nov. 1, compared with a 3 percent gain for branded products, according to the Nielsen market research company.Store brands now account for nearly 22 percent of products sold at the grocery, up from 20 percent a year ago, Nielsen found. At Kroger, store brands account for 26 percent of grocery sales.In this economic climate, the numbers suggest, many shoppers are willing to try the newly developed store brands. They also say it is hard to resist the low prices of store brands for staple goods like milk, sugar and cheese.“They are less expensive and they taste just as good,” said Kim Dittelberger, 49, whose shopping cart at a Kroger store here on a recent day included store-brand “toaster treats,” aluminum foil, coffee filters and coffee. “Now even more so because the economy stinks.”Jan-Benedict E. M. Steenkamp, marketing professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said past recessions had given consumers a reason to trade down from national brands. This time, he said, the gains may stick because the quality and consistency of store brands have improved.“Sometimes, it will be disappointing,” said Mr. Steenkamp, co-author of a book on private-label strategy. “More often, it will be better than expected.”Besides the weak economy, the growth of store brands reflects a historic shift in the balance of power between packaged food manufacturers and grocery retailers. As grocery chains have consolidated and grown bigger, they are increasingly able to stock their shelves with their own products, which bring higher profits and drive customer loyalty — all to the detriment of major food brands.“The brands aren’t as dominating,” said Alex Miller, president of Daymon Worldwide, a broker for store-brand products. “The retailer is much more in the driver seat about what goes on in their stores.”The increase in store-brand sales has been a boon for some manufacturers, too. Some store brands are made by major food companies like ConAgra Foods and Sara Lee, but many of the goods are made by companies that few customers have heard of, like Ralcorp Holdings (cereal, cookies and crackers), Johanna Foods (yogurt and fruit juice) and Treehouse Foods (soups, salad dressings and salsa).“Those who are winning at retail are those who have decided that rather than be a warehouse for national brands, they have to establish their own brand,” said Sam K. Reed, the chairman and chief executive of Treehouse Foods. A former chief executive at Keebler, Mr. Reed said he started Treehouse in 2005 because “private label was consistently growing at a faster rate than branded foods across many categories.”Of course, major branded food companies dispute the idea that store brands are just as good as their products. They argue that branded products offer better taste, consistency and innovation, justifying a premium price.“We’re committed to providing our consumers with great-tasting products that are a good value against any competitor,” said Michael Mitchell, a spokesman for Kraft Foods.Others argue that store-brand manufacturers have not been able to replicate some of America’s best-known brands, like Cheerios, Budweiser and Brawny paper towels. Grocers certainly sell store brands that look like Cheerios or like Heinz ketchup, but to many palates, the knockoffs do not taste the same.“A lot of it depends on what product it is,” said Sharon Frey, 42, a Kroger shopper who was trying Kroger premium ice cream for the first time because it was on sale. “If it’s eggs, it doesn’t matter. I would buy Heinz. I prefer Heinz ketchup.”Store brands have evolved over the years from homemade items like the sauerkraut that Kroger’s founder, Barney Kroger, stocked on his shelves to the plainly labeled generics that were sold in the 1970s.In the 1980s, a Canadian grocery executive, Dave Nichol, borrowed from a British grocer the idea of introducing premium store-brand products, like a chocolate-chip cookie with more chips than national brands. Mr. Nichol, then an executive and pitchman for the Loblaws chain, sold the cookies under the President’s Choice label. Within two years, the brand was the best-selling cookie in Canada.“That’s when the alarm bells went on and that’s when I realized this was the whole answer,” Mr. Nichol said.In the United States, a growing number of grocery retailers are embracing Mr. Nichol’s philosophy, including Kroger.The Cincinnati-based chain, the nation’s second-largest grocer after Wal-Mart, hired Ms. Severin two years ago to expand Kroger’s store brands, which include a value brand, a medium tier that competes directly against national brands, and a premium category.A veteran of major food brands, Ms. Severin said her model was not competitors in the United States, but grocers in Canada and Europe, where store brands account for as much as 40 percent of the items sold. She said her focus had been on developing products that offered something other than simply low prices, like premium ingredients or innovative packaging.During a tour of the Loveland store, she pointed to store-brand packages of cut vegetables that were microwave-ready, compact fluorescent light bulbs that were environmentally friendly and dog food made with natural ingredients.She said she was particularly proud of a curved, 12-ounce bottle of hand soap with scents like cherry blossom and coconut lime. The Kroger logo was barely visible.A typical shopper wants hand soap that “looks good and smells pretty,” Ms. Severin explained, but does not want a “big Kroger logo staring out at her.” The Kroger product was also cheaper, per ounce, than nearby Softsoap, a popular national brand.Even as it develops fancier products, Kroger is being careful to keep unadorned store brands on its shelves, too, recognizing that they appeal to many shoppers for the sole reason that they are cheap.

"'08-12-13,'0','Electricity companies, which can charge customers for permits the companies receive for free, could earn windfall profits worth tens of billions of dollars over the next decade.“There is the possibility of windfall profits,” he said Friday, adding that was “one of the reasons the commission doesn’t like the extension of free allowances.”“But sometimes, to get a consensus, we need to make concessions,” Mr. Barroso said.Under the draft plan, some of the dirtiest companies in Europe, like the utilities that operate coal-fired power stations in Eastern European countries including Poland and Hungary, will no longer have to buy all of their pollution allowances starting in 2013 — as the commission had proposed in January under a draft plan. Instead, those Eastern European utilities will buy just 30 percent of their permits starting in 2013, rising, in principle, to 100 percent in 2020, if the draft is approved.Eastern European countries would also receive money from a so-called solidarity fund paid for by Western European industries.Hungary had even raised the prospect during negotiations late Thursday of ditching fundamental parts of the proposal.“It does not seem very appropriate at this stage to raise this,” Mr. Barroso said curtly on Friday, referring to the Hungarian stance.Even so — given the financial assistance offered by the European Union to the government in Budapest — the likelihood that it will seek to block the package is low.It is not just relatively poor Eastern European countries that have pressured for a retreat.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has said changes are necessary to ensure job protection at a time when recession looms large over European industry. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy has threatened to veto any deal that was not in the interest of Italy’s paper, glass, iron and ceramics sectors.A lobby group for chemicals sector, Cefic, which includes powerhouses like BASF of Germany, led a particularly forceful campaign for the rules to be relaxed.Along with companies that run factories in heavy industry sectors — like operators of steel plants and chemical factories in Germany — the chemicals sector has won guarantees of special treatment. Those sectors would receive free emissions permits if they can show their costs are increasing and that they are significantly exposed to international competition.Parts of manufacturing industry that are not exposed to international competition will have to pay for 20 percent of their permits beginning in 2013. And rather than paying for 100 percent of their permits by 2020, they would pay for only 70 percent under the draft.'"

"'08-12-13,'0','For a man who has repeatedly claimed his innocence, Mr. Kadi is caught in a legal limbo with no end in sight. The accusations against him are in the form of a government order. But because he has never been charged with a crime, he has not had the opportunity to stand before a jury or a judge to plead his case.“We have not found Mr. Kadi guilty of anything,” said Adam J. Szubin, the director of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. “But we have found that he is a supporter of terror.”Washington’s broad freedom to place sanctions on people suspected of financing terrorists has gone mostly unchallenged since the Sept. 11 attacks. Few have rushed to defend wealthy foreigners, in contrast to how civil rights lawyers and others have sought to publicize the plight of the prisoners held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.This September, Mr. Kadi’s lawyers persuaded the European Court of Justice to overturn a lower court ruling that supported Europe’s right to freeze his assets. The ruling is nonbinding, however, and the Bush administration continues to maintain that Mr. Kadi is guilty.A scion of a wealthy and well-connected businessman, Sheik Yassin, as Mr. Kadi is widely known in Saudi Arabia, has the commanding presence of a chief executive and is quite obviously accustomed to the deference that comes to those who deploy large sums of money.In interviews with government officials, Mr. Kadi has said that his net worth is as much as $65 million. While not garish, his Jidda compound is spacious and well appointed. He has servants and a chauffeur to drive his luxury cars, and he remains an active investor in world currency and stock markets.Mr. Kadi is mindful that his position is different from those serving time at Guantánamo Bay, but insists that the paradox of his legal condition is no less unfair. “When it is classified,” he said, “you can never defend yourself.”And, he says, his suffering has been acute in its own regard — he has struggled with bouts of depression, diabetes and the humiliation of having to ask family members for financial help.THE Treasury claims that it responds to new evidence presented by designees and says that it took 154 names off the list — 4,102 remain — from November 2007 to November 2008. But Mr. Kadi is unlikely to benefit from any reassessment. “We stand by our designation,” Mr. Szubin, the Treasury official, said, “and you can quote me on that.”Mr. Kadi does not dispute his ties to Mr. bin Laden but maintains that he does not support him and has not spoken to him since the early 1990s.They do share a common background: tall and in their early 50s, they were both born to wealthy families here in Jidda, studied engineering and, in Mr. Kadi’s telling, first met in Chicago in 1981. Mr. Kadi says he was working for the architectural firm Skidmore Owings & Merrill and that Mr. bin Laden — who is not known to have visited the United States — came to Chicago to recruit American-trained engineers for his family’s construction business. As Mr. Kadi remembers it, he put Mr. bin Laden in touch with a group of engineers, several of whom were eventually hired.They came together again in Pakistan in the late 1980s as enthusiastic backers of the Afghan rebels in their war with the Soviet Union and became large investors in Sudan in the early 1990s.But Mr. Kadi says he cut ties after Mr. bin Laden began to adopt an anti-American, openly radical attitude in the mid-1990s.In the absence of a full airing of the evidence against him, however, it seems unlikely that Mr. Kadi’s guilt or innocence will be established. Like many wealthy Saudis, Mr. Kadi has been an enthusiastic underwriter of Islamic-hued causes, including hospitals in Peshawar, Pakistan, and Albania; a university in Yemen; and the publication of a definitive English translation of the Koran.THIS, he says, is nothing more than a form of blessed relief — the name of his now defunct foundation. But Mr. Szubin and others say Mr. Kadi’s giving is part of a disguised money trail to Al Qaeda and Mr. bin Laden.Some of the evidence presented by his accusers, however, raises its own questions. For example, a Swiss prosecutor — who investigated Mr. Kadi but did not bring charges — tried to connect him to the fundamentalist philosopher Sayyid Qutb. The problem was that Mr. Qutb was put to death by the Egyptian government in 1966, when Mr. Kadi was 9 years old. Mr. Kadi was questioned in another case about his ties to one Saad Djebbar — who turned out to be his lawyer.On the other hand, Mr. Kadi’s ’s continued refusal to renounce figures suspected of being terrorist supporters gives ready ammunition to his critics.One of those figures is Wael Juleidan, a prominent Saudi financier who was a close ally of Mr. bin Laden’s in the late 1980s. Another is Muhammad Salah, a Palestinian-American who was accused of sending money to Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza.Mr. Salah, who was acquitted of the Hamas charges in federal court last year, ran a Chicago-based Muslim charity that received about $1 million from Mr. Kadi in the early 1990s.“If I wanted to send money to Hamas, I would do it directly, not via Chicago,” Mr. Kadi said, in his smooth, American-accented English.Such a comment, with its trace of smug self-assurance, illuminates why Mr. Kadi remains a target for so many antiterrorism investigators.He is a man who does not easily hide his disdain for the process that has trapped him in his own country or the efforts by the Bush administration to prevent another major terrorist attack. But he insists that his deepest anger is reserved for Mr. bin Laden. Asked what he would say to him now, Mr. Kadi takes his time before responding.“I would say, ‘Wash your hands of the blood of innocent people,’ ” Mr. Kadi said, using the Arabic word “fitna” to describe the devastation that Mr. bin Laden’s actions have brought upon him and the Islamic world. “Islam is innocent of all this. This was a big mistake. Now, everyone is suspicious.”'"
"'08-12-13,'0','It is a common saying that you are not really Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe. Octavio Paz, the Mexican poet awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1990, wrote that “after two centuries of experiment and failure, the Mexican people only believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe and the National Lottery.”According to Mexican lore, the Virgin appeared in December 1531 before an indigenous farmer and laborer named Juan Diego Cuautlatoatzin. The brown-skinned apparition told Juan Diego that she was the mother of Jesus and that she wanted a church on the Tepeyac Hill, the site of a former Aztec temple dedicated to the goddess Tonantzin.Both Juan Diego and the Virgin of Guadalupe are passionately revered as holy incarnations of Mexican identity. Recognizing their evangelical significance, Pope John Paul II, who canonized Juan Diego in 2002, declared the Virgin of Guadalupe “Queen of the Americas.”The portrait that arrived at St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Friday morning is a replica of the revered image kept at the Mexico City basilica. The portrait, about 5 feet tall and 4 feet wide, left Mexico City two months ago, and was brought by vehicle across the border, across the country and into New York, followed by pilgrims on foot and in cars.During the Mass on Friday morning, the image was placed to the right of the altar. On the left was an image of Juan Diego.Hundreds of Mexican families brought their young children in simple, traditional clothing for a special blessing toward the end of the Mass. The boys were dressed to look like Juan Diego, with a tilma, or cloak, bearing the image of the Virgin. In the story, that image was proof of her appearance on Tepeyac Hill.“If there are any Juan Dieguitos, you can come up,” Msgr. Robert T. Ritchie said in Spanish. “We welcome all the children for this special blessing.”Boys, from infants to toddlers, their upper lips sporting mustaches drawn with makeup or face paint, were brought up to the altar, some of them crying. Within seconds, the monsignor disappeared amid dozens of Mexican families. Only the hand he used to bless the children could be seen rising from the crowd.Hipolito Garcia, a 35-year-old warehouse worker from Union City, N.J., brought his 5-month-old son, Rigo, and 3-year-old daughter, Roselyn, to the Mass for the blessing. Mr. Garcia is an illegal immigrant who is trying to gain legal residency through his wife, Teresa Calyeca, a United States citizen.Mr. Garcia, who came to the New York City area from the Mexican state of Tlaxcala in 1991, said his prayers on Friday were for the legalization of the millions of Mexican immigrants “sin papeles,” or without papers.“We also pray for a better economy,” Mr. Garcia said. “I have a job now, thank God. But we pray for things to improve all over. This economic crisis is worldwide.”The portrait that made the trip from Mexico is owned by the Asociación Tepeyac de New York, an education and advocacy group that organized the procession, said a Mexico City government official who was at the Mass.'"

On Thursday a lightsaber wielded by Mark Hamill in the “Star Wars” sequel “The Empire Strikes Back” sold for $240,000, and the helmet of the android C-3PO, worn by Anthony Daniels in “Return of the Jedi,” sold for $120,000. They were among the prizes in an auction of Hollywood memorabilia held by Profiles in History, an auction house based in Calabasas, Calif.

"'08-12-13,'0','The demonstrations were set off by the death last Saturday night of Alexandros Grigoropoulos, 15, who was killed by a police officer’s bullet in the Exarchia neighborhood of central Athens. Many demonstrations turned violent, guided by a relatively small group of self-styled anarchists.Although the government said it would not tolerate violence, it ordered the police not to use force to avoid further bloodshed. In the unrest, hundreds of businesses were destroyed nationwide, resulting in an estimated $1.3 billion in damage.On Friday, youths smashed windows around a central square in downtown Athens and clashed with police officers who fired tear gas. Since last weekend, the police have made 176 arrests, the majority of them for looting, the authorities said.Despite widespread criticism of Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis’s handling of the riots, he dismissed the idea of early elections at a news conference on Friday in Brussels. The prime minister had traveled for a European Union summit meeting as part of his strategy to diminish the riots by not straying from his normal routine. His party controls a one-seat majority in Parliament.“Our government is strong,” he said. “Strength isn’t measured just by a parliamentary majority, which is slim, but by the resolve of a government to press ahead with its work and policies, and that’s what I’m doing.”Mr. Karamanlis said there would be a “sober assessment” of how the authorities handled the protests. He added, “We should not confuse the actions of groups destroying public property with the right that people, students and workers have to protest.”That even peaceful demonstrations became so fierce spoke to the deep well of discontent in Greece today. Conversations with Athenians revealed great anxiety over the economy and a widespread feeling that they had been neglected — and, this week, abandoned — by a government they saw as corrupt.“The government just shows that it’s uninterested,” said Paraskevas Tilipakis, manager of a shoe store at the mall. “We’ve lost our team spirit. That’s why we’re where we are today.”It was not supposed to be this way. In 2004, Mr. Karamanlis and his center-right New Democracy Party were elected on promises of much-needed reform after decades of Socialist governments.They helped bolster national pride by pulling off the Olympics, reducing the fiscal deficit and increasing employment.But problems soon arose in a culture torn between a deep need for structural reform and a profound resistance to change.Mr. Karamanlis’s efforts to reform the education system were met with such fierce resistance that state high schools and universities were closed for most of the 2006-07 school year. Wildcat strikes and other demonstrations followed another effort to reform Greece’s generous and deficit-ridden pension system.His government narrowly won re-election in 2007 and has since been plagued by multiple corruption scandals involving pension funds and land swaps. It was also criticized for its handling of the forest fires that burned out of control, killing 80 in the summer of 2007.Across Southern Europe, young people are in a crisis, faced with less-than-ideal educational opportunities, few job prospects and the corrosive lack of autonomy that comes from living at home into their 30s because of high housing costs.In Greece, the minimum wage is $880 a month, and one in five people live below the poverty line. Many Greeks work a second or third job to make ends meet. All this has helped bring Mr. Karamanlis’s already shaky government to its weakest point yet. The left-wing opposition has used this week’s riots — and what many say is Mr. Karamanlis’s weak response — to gain political ground.“Greeks don’t feel safe and secure,” said Flora Vamvokou, 32, sitting with her housewares store colleagues at Starbucks. “They don’t trust that the police will protect them.”She added, “The president hasn’t even come out to address the Greeks and assure them and try to instill some sense of calm.”Then there are the economic anxieties. “This coffee cost 5 euros,” said Nicole Tsoukalis, 33, pointing to her Starbucks drink. “If I make 700 euros a month, how can I afford that?”The conditions were ripe for protests to continue, she said.“This isn’t going to end here,” Ms. Tsoukalis said. “It’s a revolution we’re living, an uprising.”But in the Exarchia neighborhood surrounding Athens Polytechnic University, an anarchist stronghold, some said the situation was not so much a social uprising as a security situation that had spiraled out of control.After the teenager’s death last Saturday, the violent protests began. “The first night there was a reaction met with no response by the government,” said Dimitris, a clerk in the Stournari bookstore near the university who only gave his first name for fear of reprisals. “That gave them further impetus, that’s why the riots spread.”Memories of the military junta of the late ’60s and ’70s and the student uprisings of the ’70s still loom large in the public imagination. And one small left-wing party, Syriza, has been gaining ground among young people for its support of this and other demonstrations.But it has also taken criticism for doing so, and few Athenians believe that better governance would come along with a return of the left to power. At the moment, Greeks do not see another hope like the Olympics.“This must be the reality we like because we don’t seem to be doing anything to change it,” said Mr. Golfis at the mall. “This is what we like. This is who we are.”More protests are planned for next week.'"

Rangel, an opening reception for a school named in his honor has been postponed.The decision to delay the reception for the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at City College of New York was made “by mutual agreement between the congressman’s office and the college,” said Mary Lou Edmondson, the college’s vice president of communications, in an interview Friday.The reception, scheduled for Tuesday evening, would have come a week after a House ethics committee voted to examine the congressman’s role in preserving a tax loophole for an oil drilling company whose chief executive pledged $1 million to the Rangel Center project.The New York Times reported in November that Mr. Rangel had been involved in fighting efforts to close a tax shelter for Nabors Industries and three other companies during the same month that the chief executive of Nabors made a $100,000 donation to the Rangel center.Mr. Rangel has faced a number of ethical questions in the last year.

"'08-12-13,'0','Over the past few years Dan Deacon has made his name on the indie-rock circuit as a party starter. With his microphone and electronics set up amid the audience, he dispenses pumping, throbbing beats and shepherds his dancing fans into exercise groups and conga lines.But Mr. Deacon holds a master’s degree in electro-acoustic composition, and it’s clear even on his crowd-pleasing albums, like the 2007 “Spiderman of the Rings” (Carpark), that he connects the loops and repetition of dance music to the patterns of 20th-century classical Minimalism.Now that Mr. Deacon has listeners, he has decided to reclaim his artier side — occasionally slowing or abandoning the beat — by performing with Dan Deacon and Ensemble, the 15-member group that made its debut at the Brooklyn Masonic Temple on Thursday night. Half of the set, he announced, would come from his iPod, the other from “actual living humans.” It wasn’t exactly what the crowd wanted.The show was a pointedly chosen triple bill, with the contemporary classical percussion quartet So Percussion (which reappeared as part of Mr. Deacon’s ensemble) and Dirty Projectors, a Brooklyn art-rock band. Their songs are mercurial, exhilarating structures with angular, leaping vocal lines from David Longstreth, cooing female vocal harmonies and pointillistic guitar patterns that do with Congolese soukous what Steve Reich did with Ghanaian drumming: analyze, formalize and layer on new, dizzying convolutions.Mr. Reich was a presiding spirit for the concert, which began with So Percussion performing Part 1 of Mr. Reich’s “Drumming,” with two pairs of deadpan musicians facing each other over sets of bongo drums, tapping out evolving, polyrhythmic patterns. During Dirty Projectors’ set, Mr. Longstreth and Amber Coffman faced each other to pick equally intricate guitar parts.Much of Mr. Deacon’s set paid direct homage to Mr. Reich: the opening piece layered a recorded voice repeatedly on itself out of phase (as in Mr. Reich’s “Come Out”); later in the set a piece used steady maracas and keyboard chords, as in Mr. Reich’s “Four Organs.”'"
"'08-12-13,'0','“Chair,” a play by Edward Bond at the Duke on 42nd Street, takes place in the year 2077. Need I add that it is not a frothy comedy of manners?Serious fiction set in the future does not generally bring good news of the shining upward path humanity is embarked upon. In pop science fiction of old, our tomorrows may be full of fun gadgets, but the innovations in dystopian visions of worlds to come are things like enforced childlessness, casual brutality and mind-control experiments.“Chair,” originally a radio play broadcast on the BBC in 2000, falls firmly within this dark category. In the first scene a middle-aged woman, Alice (Stephanie Roth Haberle), huddles nervously at the window of a blank shoebox of a room, anxiously peering through a slit in the curtains at the street below. Her companion is Billy (Will Rogers), drawing pictures at a table. His intellectual age appears to be in the toddler range — he rambles on about his new drawing and peppers Alice with questions about what she sees — but Billy is eventually revealed to be in his mid-20s.The sight that has transfixed and unsettled Alice is an armed soldier standing for hours at a bus stop with a prisoner, a beaten, bedraggled old woman referred to in official parlance as “an escortee.” In his bratty stream of chatter Billy eventually makes an idle suggestion that takes root in Alice’s mind. “You could take a chair down,” he says.Although references to men who might take Billy away if he is discovered make clear that they live in a world controlled by a government of strict rules and sinister motivations, Alice nevertheless feels compelled to perform this minor act of humanity. As “Chair” unfolds at a self-importantly glacial pace, we see how this small good deed is severely punished.'"
"'08-12-13,'0','Mali, a landlocked former French colony that is nearly twice the size of Texas with roughly half the population, has a relatively stable, though still fragile, democracy. But it borders Algeria, whose well-equipped military has chased Qaeda militants into northern Mali, where they have adopted a nomadic lifestyle, making them even more difficult to track.With only 10,000 people in its military and other security forces, and just two working helicopters and a few airplanes, Mali acknowledges how daunting a task it is to try to drive out the militants.The biggest potential threat comes from as many as 200 fighters from an offshoot of Al Qaeda called Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which uses the northern Malian desert as a staging area and support base, American and Malian officials say.About three months ago, the Qaeda affiliate threatened to attack American forces that operated north of Timbuktu (or Tombouctou) in Mali’s desert, three Defense Department officials said. One military official said the threat contributed to a decision to shift part of the recent training exercise out of that area.The government of neighboring Mauritania said 12 of its soldiers were killed in an attack there by militants in September. By some accounts, the soldiers were beheaded and their bodies were booby-trapped with explosives.Two Defense Department officials expressed fear that a main leader of the Qaeda affiliate in Mali, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, was under growing pressure to carry out a large-scale attack, possibly in Algeria or Mauritania, to establish his leadership credentials within the organization.Members of the Qaeda affiliate have not attacked Malian forces, and American and Malian officials privately acknowledge that military officials here have adopted a live-and-let-live approach to the Qaeda threat, focusing instead on rebellious Tuareg tribesmen, who also live in the sparsely populated north.To finance their operations, the militants exact tolls from smugglers whose routes traverse the Qaeda sanctuary, and collect ransoms in kidnappings. In late October, two Austrians were released after a ransom of more than $2 million was reportedly paid. They had been held in northern Mali after being seized in southern Tunisia in February.Because of the militants’ activities, American officials eye the largely ungoverned spaces of Mali’s northern desert with concern.This year, the United States Agency for International Development is spending about $9 million on counterterrorism measures here. Some of the money will expand an existing job training program for women to provide young Malian men in the north with the basic skills to set up businesses like tiny flour mills or cattle enterprises. Some aid will train teachers in Muslim parochial schools in an effort to prevent them from becoming incubators of anti-American vitriol.The agency is also building 12 FM radio stations in the north to link far-flung villages to an early-warning network that sends bulletins on bandits and other threats. Financing from the Pentagon will produce, in four national languages, radio soap operas promoting peace and tolerance.“Young men in the north are looking for jobs or something to do with their lives,” said Alexander D. Newton, the director of A.I.D.’s mission in Mali. “These are the same people who could be susceptible to other messages of economic security.”Concern about Mali’s vulnerability also brought a dozen Army Green Berets from the 10th Special Forces Group in Germany, as well as several Dutch and German military instructors, to Mali for the two-week training exercise that ended last month.Just before noon on a recent sunny, breezy day, Malian troops swept onto a training range here on the savannah north of Bamako, the capital, aboard two CV-22 Ospreys, rotor-blade transport aircraft flown by Air Force Special Operations crews from Hurlburt Field, Fla.As the dull-gray aircraft landed in a swirling cloud of dust, rotors whomp-whomping, the Malians disembarked single file from the rear ramp in dark-green camouflage uniforms and helmets, M-4 assault rifles at the ready. (The Malians normally use AK-47s, but used American-issue M-4’s for this exercise.)After a mile-long march through savannah grass, the troops walked down a hill into a small valley. Their target — the mock hide-out of the insurgents — was in sight. But what the Malians did not know was that their American instructors were lying in wait, and suddenly attacked the troops with a sharp staccato of small-arms fire (plastic paint bullets), with red flares soaring high overhead.The make-believe skirmish lasted just a few minutes. The Malians, shouting to one another and firing at their attackers, retreated from the ambush rather than try to fight through it.“We’re still learning,” said Capt. Yossouf Traore, a 28-year-old commander, speaking in English that he learned in Texas and at Fort Benning, Ga., as a visiting officer. “We’re getting a lot of experience in leadership skills and making decisions on the spot.”Even more significant, Captain Traore said, was that the exercise gave his troops an unusual opportunity to train with soldiers from neighboring Senegal. Soon after the Ospreys returned to whisk the Malian soldiers from the training range, two planeloads of Senegalese troops arrived to carry out the same maneuvers.Still, worrisome indicators are giving some Malian government and religious leaders, as well as American officials, pause about the country’s ability to deal with security risks.Mali is the world’s fifth-poorest country and, according to some statistics from the United Nations and the State Department, is getting poorer. One in five Malian children dies before age 5. The average Malian does not live to celebrate a 50th birthday. The country’s population, now at 12 million, is doubling nearly every 20 years. Literacy rates hover around 30 percent and are much lower in rural areas.There are also small signs that radical clerics are beginning to make inroads into the tolerant form of Islam practiced here for centuries by Sunni Muslims. The number of Malian women wearing all-enveloping burqas is still small, but the increase in the past few years is noticeable, religious leaders say.New mosques are springing up, financed by conservative religious organizations in Saudi Arabia, Libya and Iran, and scholarships offered to young Malian men to study in those countries are on the rise, Malian officials say.In Imam Mahamadou Diallo’s neighborhood in Bamako, a congested, fume-choked city on the Niger River, a simmering debate is under way. Imam Diallo, 48, said that two new mosques had been built in his area with financing from Wahhabi extremist groups in Saudi Arabia, and that they were drawing away some members of his mosque.“Many people here are poor and don’t have work,” Imam Diallo said through an interpreter in Bambara, one of the local languages. “They’re potentially vulnerable to these Wahhabi people coming in with money.”Just down a bumpy, reddish dirt road, however, the leader of one of these newer mosques, Al Nour, quarreled with Imam Diallo’s characterization. Ali Abdourohmome Cisse, the imam since Al Nour opened in 2002, said he did not know who had financed its construction. He added that no one on his staff, including an Egyptian assistant who helps conduct Friday Prayer in Arabic, advocated any form of extremism.At El Mouhamadiya, an Islamic school in the neighborhood, more than 700 students, ages 4 to 25, take classes including math, physics and Arabic. “But we don’t train them in terrorism,” said Broulaye Sylla, 25, an administrator. “We don’t talk about jihad.”Mahmoud Dicko, president of the High Council of Islam in Bamako, acknowledged over soft drinks in his second-story office that the influence of conservative Sunni and even Shiite groups had become more visible, but he said they did not pose a serious threat to Malian society.“Their influence has limits because of the importance of cultural ties here in Mali,” he said. “We have a tolerant Islam here, a pacifist Islam.”American and African diplomats here said Mali was one of the few countries in the region that had good relations with most neighbors, making it a likely catalyst for the broader regional security cooperation the United States is trying to foster. American commanders expressed confidence that by training together, the African forces might work together against transnational threats like Al Qaeda. While Mali has no effective helicopter fleet, for instance, it could team up its soldiers with better-equipped neighboring armies, like Algeria’s, to combat a common threat.“If we don’t help these countries work together, it becomes a much more difficult problem,” said Lt. Col. Jay Connors, the senior American Special Forces officer on the ground here during the exercise.American and Malian officials acknowledged that there were other hurdles to overcome. The Pentagon needs to better explain the role of its new Africa Command, created in October to oversee military activities on the continent, and to dispel fears that the United States is militarizing its foreign policy, Malian officials said.American officials say their strategy is to contain the Qaeda threat and train the African armies, a process that will take years. The nonmilitary counterterrorism programs are just starting, and it is too early to gauge results.“This is a long-term effort,” said Colonel Connors, 45, an Africa specialist from Burlington, Vt., who speaks French and Portuguese. “This is crawl, walk, run, and right now, we’re still in the crawl phase.”'"
"'08-12-13,'0','TOKYO — Japan’s prime minister announced an emergency stimulus package on Friday, hoping to bolster the world’s second-largest economy by spending billions to create jobs, increase business loans and help laid-off workers.In a nationally televised speech, the prime minister, Taro Aso, announced the sweeping package that he valued at 23 trillion yen (about $250 billion). It was unclear how much of that figure was new spending and how much was included in earlier stimulus packages, like the $50 billion proposal announced in October.“This is said to be a global recession, a great global recession, that comes once in 100 years,” Mr. Aso said in the broadcast. “Japan is not outside the path of this big tsunami, nor can it escape.”With Friday’s package, Japan joins the United States and European Union in proposing sizable spending packages to combat the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. The American president-elect, Barack Obama, has pledged to save or create 2.5 million jobs with new spending estimated at $400 billion to $500 billion, and European nations have announced stimulus measures worth some $260 billion.Japan’s stimulus package is also aimed at critics who have said that Tokyo has not done enough to stimulate its recession-bound $5 trillion economy, the world’s second-largest after the United States. Increasingly grim economic data has helped drive Tokyo’s stock markets to nearly 26-year lows, while Japan’s currency, the yen, hit a 13-year high of 88.16 yen to the dollar on Friday as Japanese investors continued to recall their overseas loans.'"
"'08-12-13,'0','Electricity companies, which can charge customers for permits the companies receive for free, could earn windfall profits worth tens of billions of dollars over the next decade.“There is the possibility of windfall profits,” he said Friday, adding that was “one of the reasons the commission doesn’t like the extension of free allowances.”“But sometimes, to get a consensus, we need to make concessions,” Mr. Barroso said.Under the draft plan, some of the dirtiest companies in Europe, like the utilities that operate coal-fired power stations in Eastern European countries including Poland and Hungary, will no longer have to buy all of their pollution allowances starting in 2013 — as the commission had proposed in January under a draft plan. Instead, those Eastern European utilities will buy just 30 percent of their permits starting in 2013, rising, in principle, to 100 percent in 2020, if the draft is approved.Eastern European countries would also receive money from a so-called solidarity fund paid for by Western European industries.Hungary had even raised the prospect during negotiations late Thursday of ditching fundamental parts of the proposal.“It does not seem very appropriate at this stage to raise this,” Mr. Barroso said curtly on Friday, referring to the Hungarian stance.Even so — given the financial assistance offered by the European Union to the government in Budapest — the likelihood that it will seek to block the package is low.It is not just relatively poor Eastern European countries that have pressured for a retreat.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has said changes are necessary to ensure job protection at a time when recession looms large over European industry. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy has threatened to veto any deal that was not in the interest of Italy’s paper, glass, iron and ceramics sectors.A lobby group for chemicals sector, Cefic, which includes powerhouses like BASF of Germany, led a particularly forceful campaign for the rules to be relaxed.Along with companies that run factories in heavy industry sectors — like operators of steel plants and chemical factories in Germany — the chemicals sector has won guarantees of special treatment. Those sectors would receive free emissions permits if they can show their costs are increasing and that they are significantly exposed to international competition.Parts of manufacturing industry that are not exposed to international competition will have to pay for 20 percent of their permits beginning in 2013. And rather than paying for 100 percent of their permits by 2020, they would pay for only 70 percent under the draft.'"
"'08-12-13,'0','Representatives for the union, which had already accepted a series of cuts in its current contract, sought instead to push any more concessions back to 2011, when the U.A.W.’s contract with Detroit auto companies expires.In a statement Thursday night, the union said it was “prepared to agree that any restructuring plan should ensure that the wages and benefits of workers at the domestic automakers should be competitive with those paid by the foreign transplants. But we also recognized that this would take time to work out and implement” using programs like buyouts and early retirement offers to bring in new workers at lower rates.“Unfortunately, Senate Republicans insisted that this had to be accomplished by an arbitrary deadline,” the statement said. “This arbitrary requirement was not imposed on any other stakeholder groups. Thus, the U.A.W. believed this was a blatant attempt to make workers shoulder the lion’s share of the costs of any restructuring plan.”In an interview Friday morning on CNBC, Mr. Corker suggested the union, not Republicans, bore the burden for the measure’s failure.“I offered them a solution,” he said of discussions with union representatives. “Our caucus was 100 percent behind it. Do we own it, or does the U.A.W. own it?”Mr. Corker said he spoke with Mr. Gettelfinger on Thursday morning and suggested he participate in the discussions. “I asked him to come to the table, not assign somebody to come back and forth. It didn’t work out,” Mr. Corker said.Mr. Gettelfinger, at a news conference Friday, said he was wary of Mr. Corker’s offer to join the talks.“We wondered if we were just being set up,” Mr. Gettelfinger said. “We did not know who Senator Corker was representing on the Republican side, and if he could deliver votes.”He said Mr. Corker admitted to the union’s representatives that discussions over wages were “largely about politics in the G.O.P. caucus.”Mr. Corker said he proposed that wages and benefits of U.A.W. members be competitive with lower rates at American plants run by foreign rivals — Toyota, Honda, Nissan and B.M.W. — during 2009, and offered the union the opportunity to pick the date next year when the changes, which would be certified by the Labor Department, could be put in place.Without that agreement, Mr. Corker said he could not sell a compromise to other Republicans.“We just could not get a date,” Mr. Corker said of his discussions with the union. “It was an amazing thing to me.”Mr. Gettelfinger said Friday that there was no way to tell what Mr. Corker meant by competitive wage and benefit rates, which differ depending on the company and the location of the automakers’ plants. He went on, “The G.O.P. caucus was insisting the restructuring had to be done on the backs of workers and retirees rather than have all stakeholders come to the table.”“We could not accept the effort by the Senate G.O.P. caucus to single out workers and retirees for different treatment,” he said.Union members said Friday that they supported Mr. Gettelfinger for standing up to Mr. Corker.“It’s not an attack on the U.A.W., it’s an attack on the labor movement and the whole working class,” said Martha Grevatt, who has worked at Chrysler’s stamping plant in Twinsburg, Ohio, for 21 years.“Politicians don’t dictate union wages, and I would have felt the same way, even if I was working,” said Marty Shawl, of Bay City, Mich., who retired from a G.M. plant in May.In 2007, the U.A.W. agreed to sharply lower starting wages and benefits for newly hired autoworkers at the Detroit companies, as well as for workers in jobs away from the assembly line, like janitors and maintenance personnel.But the cuts did not affect most long-time union members, whose hourly pay and compensation is about $55 an hour. The figure ranges above $70 an hour when the automakers’ costs for health care for retired workers and retirement benefits is factored in.By contrast, workers in plants run by foreign companies in the United States earn about $45 an hour, and the nonunion companies do not have the hefty burdens for future “legacy costs” that are faced by the Detroit companies.Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan expressed anger Friday morning at the failure of the Senate to act on the bailout package. “It’s such an unbelievable stab at workers across the country,” she said in an interview on WJR-AM in Detroit.Washington gave a bailout to the financial institutions, and did not ask a single question, the governor said, “then lay the blame for the auto industry, which is a victim of this financial meltdown, on the backs of the people who are working on the line.”'"
"'08-12-13,'0','The Vatican document reiterates that the church is opposed to research on stem cells derived from embryos. But it does not oppose research on stem cells derived from adults; blood from umbilical cords; or fetuses “who have died of natural causes.”The document does not prohibit the use of vaccines developed using “cell lines of illicit origin” if children’s health is at stake. But it says that “everyone has the duty” to inform health care providers of personal objections to such vaccines.The church also objects to freezing embryos, arguing that doing so exposes them to potential damage and manipulation, and that it raises the problem of what to do with frozen embryos that are not implanted. There are at least 400,000 of these in the alone.“Our advice is that freezing should not take place,” said Bishop Elio Sgreccia, president emeritus of the Pontifical Academy for Life. “Because once it is done, you’re in a situation where to correct the error implies a further offense. Once you have them, what do you do with them?”The Vatican’s intended audience is not only individual Roman Catholics, but also non-Catholic doctors, scientists, medical researchers and legislators who might consider regulating stem cell research and other recent developments in biomedical technology.In the United States, President-elect has said he will end the restrictions on federal financing of embryonic stem cell research that were instituted by President Bush.Among the new developments discussed in the document are the attempts by scientists to find alternative techniques of producing embryonic-like stem cells that could ultimately be used in medical treatments, without involving human embryos, said the Rev. Thomas Berg, executive director of the Institute for Ethics and the Human Person, a Catholic ethics institute in New York. He said such techniques could “allow us to get past this cultural divide on stem cell research.”Father Berg said he was pleased to see that the Vatican document did not prohibit such techniques, although it cautioned that there must be absolute assurance that human embryos were not destroyed in the process.The document does little to clarify the Vatican’s position on whether couples can “adopt” surplus embryos that have been frozen and abandoned. Such “prenatal adoption,” although rare, has been promoted by some Catholics and evangelical Christians. The document says that while “prenatal adoption” is “praiseworthy,” it presents ethical problems similar to certain types of in vitro fertilization — in particular, surrogate motherhood, which the church prohibits.Experts said that there was little new in this document, but that it might still come as a surprise to many Catholics who were unaware of the church’s ban on in vitro fertilization.Kathleen M. Raviele, an obstetrician and gynecologist in who is president of the Catholic Medical Association, said she tells her patients: “God creates through an act of love, and that’s not what’s happening in the laboratory. It’s the technician who’s creating. What in vitro does, is it separates the creation of a child from the marital act.”But the Vatican’s opposition to in vitro fertilization seemed neither moral nor intuitive to Josephine Johnston, a research scholar at the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institute in , N.Y.“For a married couple who go to get in vitro fertilization, the Vatican’s idea that it’s not done with a serious amount of love and commitment is very bizarre to me, because it’s such a deliberate act, done in the cold light of day, with enormous amounts of thought and intention attached to it,” she said. “The idea that it’s not done within the spirit of marital love, I find very strange.”Archbishop Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer, a Jesuit who is secretary of the doctrinal office, said at a news conference in Rome that the document would probably “be accused of containing too many bans.” Nonetheless, he said that the church felt a duty “to give voice to those who have no voice.”'"
"'08-12-13,'0','TOKYO — Japan’s governing party pushed through a law on Friday to extend a refueling mission by its navy in the Indian Ocean, allowing Tokyo to keep its small but symbolic presence in the American-led military action in Afghanistan.Prime Minister Taro Aso’s Liberal Democratic Party used its majority in Parliament’s more powerful lower house to override an earlier rejection of the bill by the upper house, which the opposition controls. It was the second time this year that the governing party rammed through an extension of the refueling operation, a tactic that risks alienating Japan’s public, which generally has a pacifist bent.Mr. Aso had sought quick passage so he could turn his attention to the global financial crisis, amid rising calls at home and abroad for Tokyo to take more action to stimulate its economy. Hours after the refueling extension passed, he appeared on television to announce billions of dollars worth of new spending and loans to create jobs and help companies short of cash.Mr. Aso is struggling to overcome growing doubts about his leadership, which have driven his public approval ratings below 30 percent with his party facing national elections by September.The law that was passed Friday allows a Japanese Navy tanker and escorting destroyer to continue operating for another year in waters off Pakistan, where they provide fuel and water for American and other warships supporting operations in Afghanistan. While the mission has limited military value, it has significance as a test of Japan’s alliance with the United States.'"

They dropped more than 20 percent in premarket trading, then briefly turned higher before closing down 4.4 percent at $3.94 a share. Ford Motor’s shares gained 4.8 percent to finish the week at $3.04 a share. Chrysler is not publicly traded.The declines were more pronounced in Europe and Asia, where benchmark bourses fell sharply. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 share average ended 5.6 percent lower, with the bulk of the selling occurring after it became clear that the bailout negotiations in the Senate had failed. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slumped 5.5 percent.European stocks ended lower as well, with the major indexes in London, Paris and Frankfurt all down more than 2 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London fell 2.5 percent; the German DAX-20 was off 2.2 percent; and the CAC 40 in Paris slid 2.8 percent.Oil prices slipped $1.70 to $46.28 a barrel in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Energy prices moved higher this week as investors bet that new public works spending in the United States would raise demand.Investors also had to grapple with a pair of downcast economic reports on Friday. Producer prices fell more than expected in November. The 2.2 percent drop was led by a sharp decline in gasoline prices, which should offer some relief to businesses. But economists are concerned about the prospect of deflation, a period of sustained price drops that can hurt the economy.A separate report said that retail sales in November fell 1.8 percent, less than expected.Stocks are up 9 percent since Nov. 20. Some analysts call the winning streak a bear market rally — a temporary reprieve amid a broader downturn — although a brave few have proffered predictions that the bottom of the market crash had already been reached.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year bill rose 9/32, to 110 8/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.57 percent, down from 2.60 percent late Thursday.A major test could come on Tuesday, when policy makers at the Federal Reserve meet. Investors expect the central bankers to lower their benchmark interest rate. On Dec. 23, the Commerce Department will release its first estimate of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter. Many economists are bracing for a contraction of as much as 5 percent, which could be the worst quarter since 1982.Shares in European automakers plunged, after similar declines in Asia. In Europe, shares in the French auto giant Renault were down 7.2 percent while Volkswagen, the German carmaker, was down 0.7 percent.Shares in Toyota Motor and Nissan fell more than 10 percent and Honda plunged 13.4 percent, while Hyundai in South Korea was 7.7 percent lower.'"

She was sitting on the podium and she had this huge sign that said: Super Cooper M.V.P. I was like — look at my mom — she’s a groupie.“And it was just a special moment for me. Because I no longer have her, I hang on to those moments very, very tight.”Cooper-Dyke said the league would hold all the memorabilia for the next owner if the franchise resurfaces.DUKE DAYS California Coach Joanne Boyle was eager to catch up with her old Duke comrade, the first-year Stanford men’s coach Johnny Dawkins.Boyle made sure to pay a visit to Dawkins in his new second-floor corner office when she was on the archrival’s campus recently for a Bay Area women’s basketball media day.It has been more than two decades since they both played at Duke and became friends.Boyle turned down the Duke job before the 2007-8 season to stay in Berkeley, and Dawkins left the Blue Devils’ program this past spring to become a head coach after serving as Mike Krzyzewski’s top assistant.“We were classmates,” Boyle said. “He’s a great friend. He was a year behind me. The thing that I really remember about Johnny was his freshman year — you know how skinny he is. Well, think of him half that size as a freshman. He was a toothpick. He came in, and we all had to run the mile. He ran the mile, and the last lap he ran backward, and he was four minutes and something — he ran the last lap backward. He was ridiculous. He was a gym rat and such a great leader. He really embodies Coach K. He’s going to do really good things in the league.”When asked about his mile run, Dawkins modestly shrugged it off.“I think it was a half-lap,” he said with a smile.TRIPLE DOUBLE Angel McCoughtry recorded the second triple-double of her career and the fifth in Louisville history on Wednesday when she had 21 points, 10 steals and 11 rebounds against Hartford.She reached the mark when she had four straight steals during a three-minute stretch in the second half.Louisville Coach Jeff Walz said afterward that it would take a small miracle for his sometimes trigger-happy forward to get a triple-double with points, rebounds and assists. He is working with her on trying to share the ball more, but says there are bigger things to worry about.“Hey, if you can get a triple-double with 18, 10 and 10, keep shooting,” he said.McCoughtry achieved her other triple-double on Dec. 9, 2007.

"'08-12-14,'0','I agree with Douglas R. Burgess Jr. that we should treat pirates as “a species of terrorist” (“Piracy Is Terrorism,” Op-Ed, Dec. 5).More important, we can learn much about how to deal with terrorism by looking to the law of piracy.After Sept. 11, it was commonplace for people to say that “this is a new kind of war.” We have said such things before, however, usually, as in our wars against Native Americans and in Vietnam, as a justification for savage warfare and a disregard for the rule of law.Much of what occurred on Sept. 11 was not in fact new. Terrorism is an ancient tactic, and the criminal behavior of organized nonstate actors is precisely the problem posed by piracy.Rather than a blank check for torture and the detention without end of persons designated unlawful enemy combatants, we should draw on the rules of law, many of them developed to deal with pirates.The writer is a professor of law and director of the Institute for Global Security Law and Policy at Case Western University School of Law.'"
"'08-12-14,'0','François-Xavier Lalanne, whose menagerie of surrealistic animal sculptures included a cast-iron baboon with a fireplace in its belly, giant turtledoves that doubled as armchairs and a herd of topiary dinosaurs, died on Dec. 7 at his home in the village of Ury, south of Paris. He was 81.The family declined to state the cause of his death, which was confirmed by his wife, Claude.A painter by training, Mr. Lalanne created his own brand of surrealism when, in 1964, he unveiled “Rhinocrétaire,” a life-size Annam rhinoceros, whose side folded out into a writing desk. Endlessly inventive, he generated a zoo’s worth of animals in the decades that followed: a “landscape fish,” designed for the outdoors, with a rectangular hole in the middle that framed the natural scene like a painting; a giant fly, executed in brass, steel and porcelain, which did double duty as a toilet; and, most famous of all, 24 sheep covered in genuine sheepskin; some had faces, others were shaggy bolsters that stood on sheep legs.He wanted, he once said, to bring the notion of usefulness to sculpture and to demystify art, which he regarded as a funhouse rather than a cathedral. Hence the sheep. “Just the fact that you can squat on it reduces the risk of this inappropriate devotion,” he once said.Mr. Lalanne was born in Agen, in southwestern France, and received a Jesuit education. At 18 he moved to Paris and enrolled in the Académie Julian, where he studied drawing, painting and sculpture. After completing his mandatory military service he rented a studio in Montparnasse, next to that of Constantin Brancusi, who was a decisive influence on his work.Through Brancusi, Mr. Lalanne met artists like Max Ernst, Jean Tinguely, Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp. Just as influential on his art was his brief stint as an attendant at the Louvre, where he worked in the galleries of ancient Egyptian and Assyrian art, surrounded by animal sculptures staring at him impassively from time’s abyss.'"
"'08-12-14,'0','“It is extremely difficult because there’s an inherent culture in this school to embrace diversity,” Mr. Peters said. “But the trustees have to look to the long-term sustainability of the school, and if the school is to grow and thrive, it sometimes is confronted by challenging decisions.”In New York City, 27,047 preschool children receive free special education services, a number that has increased by nearly 2,000 a year recently, according to state education statistics. The city and state finance 152 programs operated in both public- and private-school settings.The Little Room is one of the most popular and best regarded, not just for those enrolled but for dozens of other families who receive evaluations and support services at the school.Patricia Shubert, the state’s coordinator for special education in the city, said that the Little Room would have to give 90 days’ notice before closing, and that the state would help place children elsewhere. “We don’t get too many closings,” she said. “They are few and far between.”Brooklyn Heights Montessori is known for its progressive, nurturing approach to education; teachers go by their first names and students do not receive grades. There are 257 students from preschool through eighth grade, and tuition ranges from $22,900 to $27,200; last year, 140 2-year-olds applied for 20 spots.Mr. Peters said the school receives $1.2 million annually in state aid for the Little Room, which has a staff of about 25. But he said the school, which has an endowment of $1.8 million, typically spends $100,000 per year from Montessori tuition revenue to restrict class size to nine — under the state limit of 12 — and to pay Little Room teachers salaries comparable to those of other faculty, among other expenses.State education officials said the school already received additional money for smaller class sizes, but could appeal for a higher rate of reimbursement than the current $128 per child per day, something Mr. Peters said the school was considering. Little Room parents have also offered to help raise money.The board of trustees began discussing the future of the Little Room last year as part of the school’s strategic plan, forming an eight-member task force in August. A copy of the plan mailed to families this summer included a reference to the school’s evaluation of the Little Room.But some Little Room parents say that they were never directly informed that their children’s program was in jeopardy, and discovered it only last week after meeting with the program’s director, Sonia Nachuk, who left Friday to take another job.“Before this all happened, this felt like a safe and comfortable place, but now it just doesn’t feel great anymore for me,” said Matilda Garrido, an administrative assistant whose son, Ander, 4, is in the program. “They’re a private school, they can do what they want, but the way they are going about it means the program will be destroyed.”Todd Drezner, a video producer whose 4-year-old son, Sam, has autism, said he felt that parents had been excluded from the decision-making, which suggested the school was not interested in continuing the program.“I think everybody recognizes there are challenges, but if their preschool was having similar problems, they wouldn’t close their preschool,” he said. “What they haven’t said is that as difficult as it may be to run this program, it’s worth the effort, and that’s very upsetting.”Mr. Peters said the school had planned to involve parents in the decision, but sped up the process after Ms. Nachuk’s resignation.Helene Banks, a corporate lawyer who is president of the board, said the trustees have been listening to parents, faculty and other educators and would consider their views. “I do think that the board will act in the best interests of the school; I am certain of that,” she said.'"
"'08-12-14,'0','Second, the C.I.A. has a terrible problem with quality control. When I was still there, for example, C.I.A. spies reported on several occasions that Al Qaeda had plans to attack American military bases overseas — in countries that a quick Web search would have shown had no such bases. Quantity outweighed quality as folks in the spy business focused not on accuracy or impact, but on increasing amounts of product.And that brings us to perhaps the most numbing factor, the lack of performance accountability. In my years in the agency, I cannot recall a single case where anyone was fired for failing to perform. I cannot even remember anyone being demoted. There is simply no job-threatening penalty for mediocrity. Think of this on Jan. 20, when we’re likely to see Osama bin Laden sending an inauguration greeting to the new president.So let me float a proposal borrowed from the business world. If you want to find answers to the hardest questions, why not reach broadly into the expertise of the country and assemble the best spy team possible?On Shangri-La’s nuclear ambitions, it would probably mean including a few engineers who build our own bombs. They could make sure you understand the missing parts of the puzzle and how those parts may be hidden. You’d also want successful entrepreneurs — both American and allied — who know how to make deals in Shangri-La and can point you to others who deal there more often.It goes further. Good freelance reporters know how to find sources to fill in a hard story. The expertise of academia, where decades of insight often go untouched, could be balanced with a seasoned detective or tough prosecutor adept at turning a crook. The more military the topic, the more military folks you would want on its pursuit. The spy business simply isn’t that difficult, and the sleight-of-hand techniques of the trade, some reaching back to Joshua’s spies at Jericho, can be fairly quickly learned. It is creativity, judgment and the ability to reach a goal on time that are hard to teach.The agency would not lure these outside experts with a career or give them ranks or titles. That only breeds the ladder-climbing trap that sees newly minted C.I.A. managers, six months into their assignments, planning how they might climb that next rung. Rather, the agency could compile teams of accomplished Americans for a fixed period of service and then let them return to their respective fields. (Much of the work could be done over the Internet, allowing some of them to keep their day jobs.) Their incentive would be the chance to make a real difference, with maybe a decent payment at the end if the project is a success.Yes, there are some obstacles here. Using “normal” citizens in a covert role could require giving them legal protections that may not exist right now. Getting consensus among policymakers and Congress, and isolating the hard questions from the headlines of the day, will be a difficult challenge. And, more insidiously, wounded institutional pride at the C.I.A. could generate bureaucratic knife-fighting by employees who would rather see the quest fail than give credit to “amateur” operators. The safe bet is that none of this will ever happen.But is it not worth trying? It would certainly be worth breaking some existing rules if we could really assemble a better spying apparatus from the best parts America has to offer. When it comes to the hard stuff, we couldn’t do much worse.'"
"'08-12-14,'0','Neither were the banks required, as Detroit would have been, to get rid of their private jets or supply Treasury with in-depth restructuring plans in exchange for bailout funds.This is not to argue that handing money over to troubled carmakers is a good idea or without peril. (On Friday, Treasury said it would move to prevent carmaker failures until Congress reconvenes and deals with the mess.)Rather it is to remind everyone the degree to which the banks have been blessed with a no-questions-asked bailout that will almost certainly generate tremendous taxpayer losses down the road.YES, of course, banks are different from you and me and Chrysler and G.M. Because lending makes the world go ’round, banks need to be healthy and well-capitalized.But the Troubled Asset Relief Program is open to banks that are both well and sickly. And nobody overseeing the program seems eager to ensure that its funds go only to those institutions that will survive and be able to pay back the taxpayer.“Why is it that each of the carmakers needed a specific plan in hand to share in $14 billion while most of the banks only needed a large hat in hand to share $700 billion?” asked Brian Foley, a compensation consultant in White Plains. “I don’t have a sense of transparency, that there are visible accountability criteria being applied to TARP. If banks want to tidy up their balance sheets, they can go right ahead.”As of Dec. 5, Treasury had allocated a total of $335 billion to TARP and disbursed $195 billion to institutions under its various parts.Testifying before Congress last Wednesday, Neel Kashkari, the youthful former Goldman Sachs executive whom the Treasury Department has charged with overseeing “financial stability,” defended the $700 billion federal triage package intended to get our banks lending again.The plan’s achievements so far, according to Mr. Kashkari: “First, we did not allow the financial system to collapse. That is the most direct important information. Second, the system is fundamentally more stable than it was.”Maybe so. But an audit of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, released last week by the Government Accountability Office, suggests that the program’s holes are many.For example, the G.A.O. said, Treasury has no way to determine if the program is achieving its goals of increased lending by banks. There also seems to be no monitoring of the banks’ compliance with TARP limits on executive compensation, the G.A.O. added.Treasury should take nine actions to ensure the integrity of the TARP, according to the G.A.O. Many relate to keeping its operations transparent, managing conflicts of interest and hiring enough staff members to ensure that the program’s goals are met.While these recommendations all have merit, there is one important item missing from the TARP to-do list: Hire tough-minded bank analysts to help determine which institutions are best positioned to use TARP funds in a way that will benefit their shareholders and the taxpayers at the same time.Such a team could help prevent Treasury from throwing good money after bad.According to the G.A.O., as of Nov. 21, about 48 employees were assigned to TARP. Only five are permanent staffers; the rest come from other Treasury offices, federal agencies, and organizations providing temporary help.What is needed is a small army of TARP analysts — a lot of former bankers are out of work, by the way — to conduct a worst-case analysis of the banks’ assets and capital cushion. In private equity circles, this is called a “burndown analysis.”Such an assessment typically involves extremely harsh loss estimates for every loan category in Year 1 and higher-than-average loss estimates for loans in Years 2 and 3, the elimination of dividend payments, and a valuation of the bank’s prospects based primarily on its deposits — not its loan portfolio.The essential questions are these: What are the bank’s assets really worth, how much can it earn and how much capital would the bank need to operate profitably?Bankers will object, of course. They want to keep their rosy scenarios intact for as long as they can. But such a see-no-evil approach has been central to the slow-motion nature of this train wreck. Now that the government is dispensing dollars, it is time for misplaced optimism over asset values to disappear.Private investors looking to put money into beleaguered banks are running precisely these types of analyses.

Pachuca will play the South American champion LDU Quito of Ecuador in the semifinals Wednesday.“We didn’t deserve to be two goals behind,” Pachuca Coach Enrique Meza said. “We were better than Al Ahly in the first half and controlled the entire game. We kept attacking. It’s the only way we know how to play. The better team won. It’s a very simple logic. Bring on LDU. They are a great team, but we don’t fear anyone.”Ahly took the lead on Fausto Pinto’s own goal in the 28th minute. The Angolan striker Flavio doubled the lead as time ran out in the first half.The substitute Luis Montes scored for Pachuca two minutes after the break before Giménez curled in a free kick from 25 yards to tie the score in the 73rd minute.'"

"'08-12-14,'0','PROVIDENCE, R.I. — In February, some patrons at Patrick’s Pub, which sees as many politicians as any government building, cobbled together a band. Their gig was unmemorable — until it sparked a lawsuit that could shut the bar down.The bar’s owner, Patrick Griffin, is being sued by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, or Ascap. The organization says the bar violated federal copyright law during the show and is seeking up to $120,000 in damages.The lawsuit is hanging over this bar, which serves as a virtual annex to the nearby State House. Patrons, who are just about everyone who is anyone in Providence, are flocking to the defense of Mr. Griffin, a native of Ireland who opened the bar in 1992. He works at City Hall, approving all paychecks, and organizes the city’s St. Patrick’s Day parade.“He came from Ireland, and the first thing he did as a good Irish immigrant, and he’s a friend of mine, was get a city job and open a pub,” said Vincent A. Cianci, the former mayor of Providence who spent five years in prison for corruption. Mr. Cianci, who is known as Buddy and now is the host of a radio show, invited Mr. Griffin and an Ascap lawyer onto his program two weeks ago to “bring them together,” he said.Mr. Cianci is a fixture at the bar’s St. Patrick’s Day celebrations, where the beer flows freely and chivalry abounds — both bathrooms are reserved for women that day, while men are relegated to a portable toilet out back.

"'08-12-14,'0','In September, Ecuador vaulted to the forefront of international eco-politics when it became the first country to extend constitutional rights to nature. Approved by nearly 70 percent of voters, the Andean republic’s new Constitution grants nature “the right to the maintenance and regeneration of its vital cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes.” The precise scope of nature’s rights is unclear. Referring to Pachamama, an indigenous deity whose name roughly translates as “Mother Universe,” the text puts less emphasis on defending specific species than on the rights of ecosystems writ large. And it is uncertain how, exactly, a country as poor as Ecuador can protect those rights — though observers expect to see a raft of new lawsuits against oil and gas companies.Even so, it is a milestone for environmental organizations that seek to rewrite our treatment of nature. In fact, one such group, the Pennsylvania-based Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, helped draft the new protections in the Ecuadorean Constitution. The C.E.L.D.F. posits that most laws define nature as someone’s property, forcing environmentalists to prove extensive damage before regulations can be put in place. A rights-based approach, it argues, reverses that burden, putting the health of ecosystems first.Ecuador isn’t alone in elevating the sanctity of nature: this year, the Spanish Parliament granted the right to be spared “abuse, torture and death” to great apes, and an ethics panel appointed by the Swiss Parliament called for protecting plants’ “reproductive ability.” As a consequence, Swiss researchers must now apply for approval before conducting scientific research on even the smallest of flora. Ecuador’s new Constitution may go much further, arguably granting broad protections to simple life forms like algae and even bacteria. After all, who knows what they might evolve into?'"
"'08-12-14,'0','Walking down a city street at night, you can already use your smartphone to check out reviews of the restaurant you’re considering. Should you also be able to check whether any of those teenagers a block away and closing have criminal records?Yes, suggests Lior Strahilevitz, a professor at the University of Chicago. In fact, your phone might even automatically download that information from the teenagers’ phones.An invasion of privacy? By many standards, yes, but consider current practice, Strahilevitz argued in a pair of articles this year in the law reviews of Northwestern University and the University of Chicago. Most people encountering teenagers size them up by judging their clothing, demeanor and ethnicity — they “profile.” Give people more information, and they can make better, more individualized judgments.In some circumstances, Strahilevitz admitted — like blind auditions for orchestras — stripping away personal information can reduce discrimination. But in many others, privacy advocates get the link between discrimination and the availability of personal information precisely backward. Take laws that prevent employers from learning about applicants’ criminal records. Because African-Americans are disproportionately imprisoned, such laws are often viewed as blows against discrimination. But Strahilevitz cited research that found that, in the absence of such laws, companies that did background checks on applicants hired 8 percent more African-Americans than those that didn’t do the checks. The latter employers seemed to be discriminating “statistically” — lacking hard data about penal histories, they made more decisions based on skin color. As an alternative, Strahilevitz would subsidize the hiring of actual ex-cons, rather than trying to hide their status.Less contentiously, Strahilevitz would also expand the “How’s My Driving?” programs used by trucking firms to cover everyone with a driver’s license. Insurance companies currently use broad demographic categories to set rates — the cautious teenage boy is out of luck. If you could phone in reports of bad driving, he’d get a break and the reckless middle-aged would pay their fair share. At last.'"
"'08-12-14,'0','Want to prevent bouts of speculative mania like those that sparked the current financial crisis? Here’s a simple but effective cure: impose a small tax on the sale or transfer of stocks, bonds, derivatives and other securities, thereby encouraging people to “buy and hold” rather than to engage in the frenetic transactions typical of a speculative bubble.In the past year, the economist Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, has emerged as the most vocal proponent of the tax. “We want a financial system that allocates money to people wanting to save or invest,” he says. “There’s no reason for it to be a casino.” He estimates that a small tax of up to one quarter of 1 percent imposed on the sale of a wide range of securities would do more than curb speculation; it would also yield $100 billion to $150 billion — money that could go toward paying for aid to Wall Street. Better still, Baker contends, most of the revenue would end up coming from Wall Street, not ordinary investors.The basic idea of a stock transfer tax is an old one, and economists who have voiced support for variations of it in the past include Lawrence Summers and Joseph Stiglitz. But Baker also sees new uses for a transfer tax, noting that it would have an especially powerful effect on financiers who traffic in the sort of esoteric securities that are at the heart of the current mess. “If you had a complex derivative instrument based on slicing and dicing securities,” Baker says, “you would end up having to pay tax several different times.” To those who complain that the tax would make the creation of these instruments prohibitively expensive, Baker is blunt: “That’s the idea.”'"
"'08-12-14,'0','About three years ago, the mayor of Petah Tikva, a city near Tel Aviv, called the veterinarian Tika Bar-On and said, “I can fix almost everything in this city, but I don’t know how to fight dog poop.” He asked Bar-On, the city’s director of veterinary services, if it was possible to use DNA fingerprinting to identify which dogs pooped on his city streets and — most important — which owners didn’t pick up after them. As a result, this year, Bar-On introduced the first-ever forensic dog-poop DNA unit.Naturally, the project faced several hurdles. For one thing, it requires a searchable database of DNA fingerprints from local dogs. But why would owners voluntarily donate the DNA samples that could be used to penalize them for not scooping? Bar-On’s answer: Positive reinforcement. Instead of penalizing those who don’t scoop, she plans to reward those who do. As a pilot project, the city has placed special trash cans and bag dispensers throughout one particularly poop-filled neighborhood. Officials will regularly test samples from those cans; when a specimen matches a dog in the city’s DNA bank, the dog’s owner gets a reward — a colorful poop-bag carrier, perhaps, or a bag of dog food.Bar-On also recruited a small army of 12-year-olds from a local grade school and taught them about the project. The students then went door to door, persuading dog owners to donate samples and explaining the drawbacks of poop (worms, bacteria, general grossness). Bar-On began collecting samples as part of annual pet exams and organized a DNA-donating festival featuring music, performing dogs and a booth for saliva collection.To date, the Israeli dog DNA bank contains more than 100 samples. According to Bar-On, about 90 percent of owners agree to donate samples when asked. But if the pilot proves successful, Bar-On says she hopes to make DNA banking mandatory for all dog owners (something the Freakonomics guys called for three years ago). At that point, instead of a practice of positive reinforcement, she imagines a system involving sidewalk poop patrols and penalties for nonscoopers.For Bar-On, this is about more than waste elimination: “We can use this DNA database for important things like genetic research on dog diseases,” she says. “We could also use DNA to identify strays and return them to their parents.” But until then, she’s focusing on feces because, as she says, “when you go to the park with your kids and they meet dog poop, it’s not very pleasant.”'"

"'08-12-14,'0','Mussels marinière were cooked in white wine, as is traditional, with garlic and shallot; in France, however, I never tasted the dish garnished with grated lemon zest as it was here, and the sharp citrus taste was wonderfully vibrant, perking up both broth and seafood. (Such a tasty broth demands a spoon, however, and better bread — State Street’s loaf is rather anemic.)Some of the appetizers just miss excellence. Escargots, served in a warm pastry case with a Pernod butter, were exceptionally tender; unfortunately they were neither garlicky enough nor hot enough to be really excellent. The pâté, served with a large salad and a mustard sauce, was bland tasting. The house-cured salmon, however, a generous layer of delicious, slightly sticky, mild-flavored, thin-sliced salmon, was perhaps the best dish on the menu (although the garnish of capers, red onion and sieved egg threatened to overwhelm the silky fish).State Street serves a fine rendition of steak au poivre, with an arugula salad that was an appropriate foil to the creamy, well-balanced pepper sauce. The choucroute garni, a favorite of mine, was disappointing — the sauerkraut lacked salt and acidity, and while the cured meats were delicious, the chunks of fresh pork had toughened in the cooking. (Seasoning was generally uneven — the escargots also yearned for salt, while the ratatouille garnish on the lamb chops was over-salted.)Desserts were a mixed bag too. The chocolate mousse cake and cheesecake were rather dry, and the apples in my tarte Tatin had cooked to applesauce, but the white chocolate crème brûlée was divine.Sometimes State Street mixes the two cultures: an American-style crab cake, dense with seafood, was served atop a mound of that French standard, celery rémoulade (the latter lacked a bit of mustard). The duck à l’orange — a hefty portion of roasted breast and leg — was sauced with a sprightly orange sauce, and accompanied by wild rice.And there are innovations: I couldn’t quite reconcile the taste of the Caesar salad with its generous shiitake mushroom garnish, but the dressing was so tasty, and the mushrooms so beautifully cooked, I enjoyed it anyway.An American offering, the Bistro Salad, a large plate of greens with candied walnuts, dried cranberries and crumbled fresh goat cheese — a standard on Connecticut menus — was head and shoulders above its local competition; the greens were very fresh, and neither walnuts nor balsamic dressing were overly sweet.Portions at State Street are substantial, and the food is appealingly priced. But if you need more encouragement for a midweek trip into town, the restaurant is handing out coupons for $10 off your table.THE SPACE White-tablecloth restaurant in sumptuous, high-ceilinged space done up in French farmhouse décor, walls hung with cooking paraphernalia.

"'08-12-14,'0','“We’re dependent on builders and architects and new construction, which is, I wouldn’t say screeching to a halt, but it’s not moving,” Mr. Passero said.If he needs any more convincing of how much of a business eccentric he is, a recent survey by the Business Council of Westchester of its 1,200 members showed that two-thirds of them project that their revenue will either decline or fall flat in the next year. Nevertheless, entrepreneurs open businesses all the time — almost 800 business certificates were filed with the county clerk’s office between Sept. 1 and Nov. 20, in the teeth of the current crisis.Mr. Passero describes himself as more of a risk taker than others in his family, and he is a great believer that in calamity there is opportunity. The business was started in 1921 as a wholesale plumbing supplier by his grandparents, Joe and Mary Klaff, and withstood the Great Depression. When World War II came along and cast iron was hard to obtain, the Klaffs went into decorative hardware and electrical supplies. After the war, when veterans were eager to start families, the business moved into lumber and kit houses.Thus was born an all-purpose home design business that today has 220 employees and had sales last year of more than $56 million, according to financial reports, in lighting fixtures, lamps, tiles, kitchen cabinets, decorative handles and even towels.“Some of the most successful businesses that have ever been started were started during times like these,” Mr. Passero said. “You have to keep moving forward. If not, you’re moving backward. You can’t stand still in business.”Mr. Passero has barely stood still since he was 8 or 9, when he started loading delivery trucks for the family business as a stock boy. That experience cultivated an interest in architecture and design, and when he started managing the business, he moved the company into new frontiers like high-end cabinetry and tile and stone.With the older generation getting on in years — his mother, Mollie Klaff Passero, is president, and an aunt and two sisters are also active — he is looking for opportunities to expand the company so some of the children, nephews and nieces can have the same adventures he had.Mr. Passero conceived of a Westchester branch two years ago, and in March signed a 15-year lease for a shuttered Treasure Island outdoor furniture store. It was on Westchester’s main shopping drag and close enough to the Klaff’s distribution warehouse that, he said, it was “geographically sensible.”He welcomes the challenge of turning the property into a bustling enterprise and expects that by the time the store opens, the nation’s economy should have picked up. He takes comfort in glimmers of hopeful, if peripheral, change, like Barack Obama’s election and the fact that the stock market’s November tailspin could have been worse.“They said stocks are as low as they’ve been since 2003. They didn’t say since 1929,” he said.“People are being conservative in spending, and that can only last so long,” he added. “I believe there are tremendous real estate values out there, and if people buy homes, they need to fix them up, and that’s the business we’re in.”The interview with Mr. Passero took place on a late afternoon in his Norwalk office, on a day after the stock market tumbled more than 800 points over two days and an icon of American banking, Citigroup, lost half its value. But just as the interview was concluding, he switched on his computer screen and a Web site flashed the news that the stock market had rallied almost 500 points. Mr. Passero heaved a big sigh of relief.'"
"'08-12-14,'0','GO to Pollo Rico Latin Bistro on a Saturday night when roving guitarists harmonize on romantic love songs like “Bésame Mucho” and “Cielito Lindo.” At this Centereach restaurant, a couple can have a three-course meal with wine for around $65. Add the music and the love of your life sitting across the table from you, and the experience is priceless.The Thursday evening “Salsa and Salsa” every other week is another treat. For $24.95 patrons receive a three-course meal (with a choice of five appetizers, six entrees and one dessert), sangria and a free dance lesson. (The next two salsa evenings are scheduled for Jan. 8 and 22.) We opted for the regular menu and wine list but were invited to join the dancers. We decided to sit back and enjoy the show put on by our fellow diners strutting their stuff.Pollo Rico is defined by shiny, pale wood floors; equally shiny laminated tables sporting the Pollo Rico logo (a chicken in a cowboy hat); a mural of a patio complete with fountain; white walls interspersed with brick ones; and a fireplace crowned with candles.Be guided by the restaurant’s logo and order the grilled, marinated chicken ($14.95 for a whole, $10.95 for a half). It was garlicky, juicy and by far the best entree on the menu. Other good choices were a combination plate pairing a flavorful eight-ounce shell steak (grilled to order) with three jumbo grilled shrimp ($20.95) and a thin, pounded steak smothered in sautéed onions ($12.95). We were less impressed with the tasty but dry marinated grilled pork loin and the chewy braised beef brisket in a chunky tomato sauce.Take a pass on the whole fish described on the menu only as a one-pound red snapper. It was breaded, fried and overcooked.'"

"'08-12-15,'0','But Mr. Nayak, who became wealthy running pharmacies and then surgical centers in Illinois and Indiana, has lavished most of his giving on Mr. Blagojevich and other Illinois political leaders, including Mr. Jackson and some rivals of the governor who are now pressing him to resign. In all, Mr. Nayak has given more than $200,000 to the governor’s campaigns and at least $22,000 to those of Mr. Jackson.Mr. Blagojevich was arrested last week, accused of seeking to profit from the awarding of state contracts and the appointment of a replacement for Mr. Obama in the Senate. Among the activities federal investigators have said they are looking into is whether Mr. Nayak sought to raise $1 million for Mr. Blagojevich in exchange for the governor’s appointing Mr. Jackson to the Senate seat.Mr. Nayak has not returned telephone calls seeking comment; Mr. Jackson has said he never authorized anyone to try to strike a deal with Mr. Blagojevich over the seat. A lawyer for the governor has said he committed no wrongdoing.Friends describe Mr. Nayak, 54, as a fairly unassuming man who wanted to help the Indian-American community gain more influence and say he is distraught by the latest turn of events.His surgical centers are meant to offer a cheaper alternative to hospital procedures, and critics have suggested he might have used his political connections in securing locations for some of them. State records show he also once owned part of a drug-testing laboratory that had millions of dollars in state public aid contracts.Cindi Canary, the director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform, a nonprofit group, said that to some degree Mr. Nayak provided an example of how many politicians had pursued the growing ranks of immigrant businessmen as a source of campaign cash.“You see this where you have some segments of the immigrant population that have had some success,” Ms. Canary said. “As they get more assimilated, they try to figure out how to get their concerns heard. But there’s also a certain amount of opportunism by the political establishment to bring their wallets to the table.”Mr. Nayak’s name first surfaced in the Blagojevich investigation last week, when The Chicago Tribune reported that the governor appeared at an Oct. 31 luncheon at which Mr. Nayak and another Indian-American leader told those in attendance that they needed to raise $1 million to support Mr. Jackson’s bid for the Senate.Mr. Nayak then helped to hold a fund-raising event for Mr. Blagojevich on Dec. 6, and both the governor and Mr. Jackson’s brother, Jonathan, were there.The disclosures closely paralleled a sequence of events laid out in the criminal complaint against Mr. Blagojevich, which quoted him as saying in wire-tapped conversations that he was giving greater consideration to a Senate candidate — since identified as Mr. Jackson — whose supporters had offered to raise substantial campaign financing for the governor.While Mr. Blagojevich and Mr. Jackson are not personally close, Mr. Nayak is one of the few people who have been a major fund-raiser for both.Mr. Nayak has also been a supporter of Operation PUSH, the community group run by Mr. Jackson’s father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Nayak accompanied the elder Mr. Jackson on a trip to India this year.Mr. Nayak has also made political donations to Pat Quinn, the Illinois lieutenant governor, who would become governor if Mr. Blagojevich resigns, and the state’s attorney general, Lisa Madigan, who is leading the fight to oust Mr. Blagojevich.Mr. Nayak’s surgical company also gave $12,000 to Mr. Giannoulias’s campaign for state treasurer. Mr. Giannoulias and Mr. Obama play basketball together, and a spokesman for Mr. Obama confirmed Sunday that Mr. Giannoulias had shown Mr. Nayak’s son, who was a high school volunteer for Mr. Obama during the presidential race, around New Hampshire in January.By then, others say, Mr. Nayak and other Indian-American leaders were vacillating between whether they wanted Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton to win the Democratic nomination. And in the general election, Mr. Nayak and his wife hedged their bets with their donations to Mr. McCain.'"
"'08-12-15,'0','The new service would be free for six months, and the partners could charge for the Reuters content after that.But until then, Politico would offer Reuters a foot in the door at a large number of United States news operations, said Christoph A. Pleitgen, the managing director of the Reuters News Agency, which is based in London.He said his service had just 15 newspaper clients in this country, compared with more than 1,400 for The Associated Press. The Politico Network, introduced in September, already has more than 60 newspapers and more than 40 broadcasters as clients.“If we can, through this, engage with potential clients we don’t have a relationship with, that’s fantastic,” he said. “There absolutely is an untapped market.”Politico, created less than two years ago, hired a staff that included well-known newspaper and magazine journalists, and quickly grew into one of the nation’s most popular sources of news on Washington and the political campaigns, with more than three million unique visitors each month.A mostly online operation that also has a small-circulation newspaper, Politico is owned by the Allbritton Communications Company, which has a chain of television stations.Like The Associated Press, Reuters is a global news service, founded in the mid-19th century, with thousands of journalists, but it differs to an extent that Reuters cannot be seen as a serious competitor for United States clients. Reuters is especially strong in business and international coverage, but it has a fraction of The A.P.’s resources in this country and it does not cover local news, an A.P. staple.Politico’s informed political coverage, sometimes spiced with attitude from its writers, complements Reuters’ sober style and Washington coverage that often reads as if written for an overseas audience. And as other news organizations shrink or abandon their Washington bureaus, Politico is expanding from a staff of about 85 people before the election to an expected 105 to 110 in the next few months.Politico is pitching its network to newspapers as an important new revenue stream, but it remains to be seen how well it can deliver on that promise. A paper can agree to use up to five Politico articles a week, and receive 50 percent of the ad revenue that Politico sells on those Web pages; or up to 10 articles a week, and receive 40 percent; or up to 15 articles, and receive 30 percent.Newspapers fare best when they can sell their online ad space themselves, but they typically sell less than half that space. They turn the rest over to ad networks, which pay the papers a small fraction — often less than 5 percent — of what papers earn on their own.Roy L. Schwartz, Politico’s vice president for business development and marketing, said it could get much higher rates than the networks by offering a specific, generally upscale audience, rather than the scattershot approach of the networks. Where a large paper might get $20 for every thousand readers for an ad, he said, “we’re targeting $10,” he said, with up to half that amount going to the paper. By comparison, the same paper might get $1 or less from an ad network.While the Politico Network is three months old, it has barely begun selling ads on newspaper sites. And with the economy in recession, the ad market is contracting, even online.'"

Will they have to wait while someone else’s toilet is unclogged before theirs is?Some see holiday tipping as little more than blackmail, but they pay anyway because they do not want hostility on the home front, or worse.Some people say that holiday tipping is a lackluster substitute for a fairer system of wages — one that does better at recognizing each contribution to each resident’s well-being. But some tippers complain that it is the tipping that is unfair. All that cash is tax-free, unless building employees are singularly honest and report it as income, while the learns about everybody else’s bonuses from their employers. Rick Lamonte, an executive director for an investment banking firm who lives in Battery Park City, said he was tipping this year the same as last year — “unhappily,” he added.“Everyone’s salaries are getting cut,” he said. “Bonuses are down. I have a lot less money this year to give to charities and for Christmas gifts.”So why not scale back on the money for the doormen? “I feel bad for them because they work so hard, and they live off of their tips,” he said. “It’s a big part of their income for the year.”Doormen know that residents are doing uncomfortable calculations this year. Martin Hidalgo, a doorman at a condominium building on Queens Boulevard in Forest Hills, said some residents have hinted that they will not be as generous as in past years.“They say, ‘Maybe this year you’re going to get less than last year,’ ” Mr. Hidalgo said. “They say it’s because of the stock market.”He has done some uncomfortable calculations himself. He said he is expecting less — about $3,500, or roughly half of what his Christmas tips usually total.“If $20 comes my way, that’s fine,” he said. “The main thing is my salary and benefits.”Some tippers say they will stick with their old, convoluted formulas for how much to give each person on their lists. “These are the things you can’t scrimp on,” said Carol Peligian, an artist who lives in a loft building in Lower . “Their services are no less. I’m not saying we can all give increased tips, but to not acknowledge services that are generously rendered all year is Scrooge-like, and I don’t think that’s where we want to go as a city.”That sounds so generous. So polite. So well mannered. In fact, Miss Manners herself could not have said it any better.“That’s the last place that you should cut,” said Judith Martin, who writes the Miss Manners column and dispenses advice on challenges like this one, “because what you’re doing is cutting the income of someone who is much more on the edge than you are. I think the whole tipping system is rotten — the money ought to be built into people’s wages so they can count on it — but given that it is the custom, these are the last people you should stiff.”And no shortcuts, either, she said. “A plate of is no substitute” for a tip, she said. “You depend on them, and they depend on you.”But what if you do not tip? Is retaliation permissible? After all, they not only know where you live, they probably have the master key.“That’s a very ugly idea,” she said. “That’s one of the reasons I hate the tipping system — the idea that people only do their jobs well because they get a bonus.”But what if you have lost your job and are living on savings or, worse, credit cards? “Maybe you have to cut everything,” she said. “I’m saying it should not be considered one of the optional items. There are people who are utterly wiped out, but I’m not talking about them. For people who are trying to hold out, but they’re not reduced to utter poverty, I’m saying that in that case, they can probably find other ways to economize.”Ezequiel Pellot, who has been a doorman for nine years at a nine-story building in Forest Hills, said he had heard people joke that they would cut the holiday tips this year. But maybe they were not joking. “I wouldn’t be surprised” if this year’s tips add up to less than last year’s, he said. “It’s a tough economy.”He said the low end of the tipping scale at the building, the Park Briar on Queens Boulevard, is about $10 per person. “I’m not insulted by it,” he said. “This is something they don’t have to give at all.”'"
"'08-12-15,'0','“Panic” is packaged to look like Michael Lewis’s own 21-year chronicle of financial hysteria, beginning with the crash of October 1987. This book does cover that terrain. But it is an anthology of work by Mr. Lewis and many others rather than a single narrative, and in some ways that structure is liberating. By drawing on pre-existing journalism, Mr. Lewis, a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine, need not feign naïveté to capture the conditions leading up to this and each successive money meltdown. Nor need he pretend to be surprised at the paucity of useful lessons that these crises have brought.Though he only edited “Panic” (a book whose full proceeds will go to the nonprofit teaching and publishing organization 826 National and to the Greater New Orleans Foundation), Mr. Lewis has thoroughly invested himself in presenting its stories. Some of his own work is excerpted here. And he has written illuminating introductions to the book’s separate sections. Each section traces the arc of a single panic, with some (the collapse of the Thai baht in 1997) less fathomable than others (the late 1990s boom and bust of the Internet, culminating in the dot-com cataclysms of 2000).In shaping each story Mr. Lewis starts with an excerpt illustrating unreasonable optimism, then others that capture the first hints of mounting worry. Then he moves to the full-throttle panic phase, and he cools down with assessments of how these crises have changed investor attitude and fiscal policy. “Panic” carries the cautionary message that the wisdom brought by a financial collapse is wisdom that rarely sticks.The range of “Panic” incorporates both fatuous, blue-sky feature writing (“If you do this carefully, it’s like picking money off trees,” says a screenwriter turned investor, in the summer of 1987) and densely theoretical analysis. This book includes a glossary of finance-related alphabet soup (M-LEC, LIBOR, CDO, SIV) and terms like tranche, quant and the Phillips curve. It would also have been helped, though perhaps dated, by a where-are-they-now index about the high rollers who turn up in these stories.Most of the book is quick, simple and straightforward. If “Panic” does not offer much in the way of long-range wisdom or prevention strategies, it’s loaded with spooky nostalgia and mordant humor. It harks back to the days when the Dow Jones industrial average’s surge past the 2,500 mark was “now so high that investors sometimes get a kind of queasy altitude sickness,” as Stephen Koepp put it in Time magazine. It quotes quaint talk of “the rush to commercialize the global computing web known as the Internet” (Laurence Zuckerman in The Times). It nods to the grandstanding righteousness of Eliot Spitzer when he was attorney general of New York State and the flashy excesses of James Cayne, the soon-to-be-Ozymandian chief executive of now-devastated Bear Stearns.'"
"'08-12-15,'0','Other Iraqi journalists in the front row apologized to Mr. Bush, who was uninjured and tried to brush off the incident by making a joke. “All I can report is it is a size 10,” he said, continuing to take questions and noting the apologies. He also called the incident a sign of democracy, saying, “That’s what people do in a free society, draw attention to themselves,” as the man’s screaming could be heard outside.But the moment clearly unnerved Mr. Maliki’s aides and some of the Americans in Mr. Bush’s entourage, partly because it was televised and may have revealed a security lapse in the so-called Green Zone, the most heavily secured part of Baghdad.In the chaos, Dana M. Perino, the White House press secretary, who was visibly distraught, was struck in the eye by a microphone stand.Mr. Bush visited Iraq as part of an unannounced trip that later took him to Afghanistan, where he was meeting on Monday with American troops and President Hamid Karzai.The shoe-throwing incident in Baghdad punctuated Mr. Bush’s visit here — his fourth — in a deeply symbolic way, reflecting the conflicted views in Iraq of a man who toppled Saddam Hussein, ordered the occupation of the country and brought it freedoms unthinkable under Mr. Hussein’s rule but at enormous costs.Hitting someone with a shoe is considered the supreme insult in Iraq. It means that the target is even lower than the shoe, which is always on the ground and dirty. Crowds hurled their shoes at the giant statue of Mr. Hussein that stood in Baghdad’s Firdos Square before helping American marines pull it down on April 9, 2003, the day the capital fell. More recently in the same square, a far bigger crowd composed of Iraqis who had opposed the security agreement flung their shoes at an effigy of Mr. Bush before burning it.Friends described Mr. Zaidi as a devoted journalist. “He was committed to his job and after training in Lebanon became chief of correspondents about a month ago,” said Haider Nassar, who worked with him at Baghdadia.“He had bad feelings about the coalition forces,” said Mr. Nassar, referring to the American-led foreign forces in Iraq. Mr. Nassar also said Mr. Zaidi had asked to cover the news conference. Another friend said Mr. Zaidi often ended his reports by saying, “Reporting from occupied Baghdad, this is Muntader al-Zaidi.”Like many Iraqi reporters at the news conference, Mr. Nassar said he did not think this was an effective way for Mr. Zaidi to make his points. “This is so silly; it’s just the behavior of an individual,” Mr. Nassar said. “He destroyed his future.”The television channel broadcast a request for Mr. Zaidi’s release in the name of democracy and freedom of speech. “Any procedure against Muntader will remind us of the behavior of the dictatorship and their violent actions, random detentions and mass graves,” the channel said. “Baghdadia TV channel also demands that the international and Iraqi television organizations cooperate in seeking the release of Muntader Zaidi.”Shortly before 10 p.m., Mr. Bush headed from the Green Zone by helicopter to Camp Victory, where he was greeted with cheers and whoops from hundreds of soldiers inside the enormous rotunda of Al Faw palace. Speaking at a lectern beneath an enormous American flag that nearly reached the domed ceiling, he praised the soldiers and reflected on the sacrifices of those who had died.He called the increased deployment of American troops in Iraq last year, a strategy known as the surge, which is credited with helping reduce violence here, “one of the greatest successes in the history of the United States military.”Mr. Bush’s arrival in Iraq during daylight hours was one measure of progress; his first visit on Thanksgiving Day 2003 took place entirely at night.As with previous visits, preparations were secretive and carried out with ruse. The White House schedule for Sunday had Mr. Bush attending the “Christmas in Washington” performance at the National Building Museum in downtown Washington. Instead, he left the White House by car on Saturday night, arriving at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland at 9 p.m. to board Air Force One. A dozen journalists accompanying him were told of the trip only on Friday and allowed to tell only a superior and a spouse — and only in person.At his news conference with Mr. Maliki, Mr. Bush described the security agreement as a landmark, signaling a new era in the war he began in the spring of 2003. “There is still more work to be done,” the president said about the war, but with the security agreement and “the courage of the Iraqi people, and the Iraqi troops and the American troops and civilian personnel, it is decisively on its way to be won.”Mr. Maliki’s partnership with Mr. Bush and his backing of the security deal are unlikely to help him much once Mr. Bush leaves office.Although a majority in the Iraqi Parliament approved the agreement, on the street, Iraqis have mixed views. Many distrust any pact made with an occupying power, and while Mr. Bush is appreciated for having overthrown Mr. Hussein, he is widely blamed for the violence that raged in the years after the war, which prompted more than a million Iraqis to flee and killed tens of thousands of civilians.Still, Mr. Bush’s stalwart support for Mr. Maliki — after an initial period when the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, expressed doubts about him — has been a bulwark against domestic political forces who sought to topple him.With the American president’s term ending, Iraqi politicians from parties other than Mr. Maliki’s have been discussing whether to force the prime minister out with a no-confidence vote. This is not the first time his ouster has been discussed, but with American power in Iraq on the wane and troop numbers beginning to decline in earnest, it seems a more serious threat.Weighing against it happening, however, is that there is no agreement on Mr. Maliki’s successor or on how to divide cabinet posts. The posts are split among the political blocs that control Parliament and they would be loath to give up anything they had unless they were assured that they would get another position at least as good.'"
"'08-12-15,'0','Lawrence Fane, a sculptor known for using steel, bronze, concrete, wood and other materials to create Expressionistic forms, died on Nov. 28 at his Manhattan home. He was 75.The cause was prostate cancer, his wife, Diana, said.Mr. Fane was noted in particular for his work modeled on the drawings of the Italian Renaissance artist and engineer Taccola. Mariano di Jacopo detto il Taccola, who lived and worked in the 14th and 15th centuries, was known for two notebooks of drawings of inventions, including a suction pump and a paddleboat. Mr. Fane admired the drawings’ “animated theatricality” and used them as inspiration to make surreal, nonobjective, organic sculpture.Those works “look like things with which we are not familiar, yet they seem real,” Art in America said in 1995. One series of sculptures combines dowels, large drip shapes and cranklike sticks into unified form.Lawrence Smith Fane was born on Sept. 10, 1933, in Kansas City, Mo., and threw himself into painting as a youth. He continued his hobby during pre-med studies at Harvard, from which he graduated in 1955. He abandoned medicine to follow his passion for art, and studied at the Boston Museum School and as an apprentice to George Demetrios, a classical sculptor. His assignments included working at a foundry in Florence, Italy, on the enlargement and casting of one of Mr. Demetrios’s large sculptures.Mr. Fane was awarded a Rome Prize, which allowed him to work at the American Academy in Rome for three years. He taught briefly at the Rhode Island School of Design before moving to New York in 1966, where he was on the art faculty of Queens College for many years.Under disparate influences like ancient sculpture, Picasso and David Smith, Mr. Fane began making semi-abstract figurative sculpture in bronze and a combination of steel and black marble concrete. In a 1976 review in The New York Times, Hilton Kramer noted “the personal poetry” of his small reliefs in plaster and metal.'"

"'08-12-16,'1','Exchange-traded funds, also known as E.T.F.’s, have surged in popularity in recent years, and the number and types of products have proliferated.Most E.T.F.’s are simply mutual funds pegged to financial indexes, but with an added benefit: They can be traded throughout the day just like a stock, whereas traditional mutual funds are priced only once a day, at the end of trading.Many people like exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.’s, for the same reasons they like index funds: they provide easy access to broad spheres of the market, while keeping costs and taxes low. In some cases E.T.F.’s are cheaper than their index-fund counterparts, but that’s not always the case.In fact, you need to factor in what can amount to another significant cost. Since E.T.F.’s trade like stocks, you need to pay a commission each time you buy or sell shares. Commissions can range anywhere from just a few dollars per transaction to more than $50, depending on the brokerage you use and whether you trade online or pay for assistance. If you are making regular contributions over time — say, investing a certain dollar amount each week or month — buying an index fund is more cost-effective. If you are rolling over a lump sum, however, you might choose an E.T.F.E.T.F.’s might also provide an easy for smaller investors to get started since some index funds have high investment minimums. With an E.T.F., you can buy a single share. Purchasing a broadly diversified fund with rock-bottom costs like the Vanguard Total Stock Market E.T.F. and its Total Bond Market E.T.F. is a prudent way to wade into the investing waters, especially when purchased through a discount online brokerage with low commissions.Evaluating E.T.F.’s has gotten more complicated as the number of products continues to increase dramatically. The first exchange-traded fund began trading in the United States in 1993, but smaller investors began to take notice of them more recently. As a result, many financial companies have tried to capitalize on their popularity, launching E.T.F.’s that track narrower and more esoteric slices of the market, from single countries like Malaysia and Italy, to E.T.F.’s that track companies that research skin disorders.'"
"'08-12-16,'1','But how a fund manager chooses what to buy is what differentiates one fund from another. Some funds are actively managed, which means that a portfolio manager looks for stocks, bonds or other investments that will fit the fund’s overall objective. The goal for all active managers is to outperform certain benchmarks, like the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, which tracks 500 large domestic companies. As part of the stock-picking process, fund managers often travel to meet individual companies and essentially kick the tires: they visit factories, talk with customers, meet with management, and analyze financial statements. All of that costs money, of course, which is one of the main reasons actively managed funds are more expensive then the alternative: index funds.Index funds simply replicate the performance of various indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500. Meanwhile, because indexes do not change their underlying components very often, they do not need to make a lot of trades, which also increases costs. A lot of trading may also give rise to taxable capital gains, which must be distributed to fund shareholders along with the tax liability.For all of these reasons, index funds cost only a fraction of actively managed funds. And lower costs are why index funds tend to outperform their actively managed counterparts over the long term. To beat index-tracking funds, fund managers have to add more to returns than the cost of running the fund. It is hard to do.First, you need to figure out what type — or style — of fund you need, which is based on your investment goals, time horizon, tolerance for risk, among other factors. After deciding what types of funds you need — like an international stock fund or a fund of small companies — you will want to evaluate the funds in each category using the following criteria:COSTS: First, find out if there are any suitable index funds — they have the lowest costs and typically beat their actively managed counterparts over time. The average active mutual fund charges about 1.4 percent of your investment each year — this charge is known as a fund’s expense ratio — while the average index fund costs 0.80 percent. Many funds are available for much less. The Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund, for instance, provides exposure to the entire market for only 0.07 percent.Pay close attention to other fees. You want to avoid funds that charge loads, which are sales charges levied when you buy or sell a fund. The charge is paid to the financial broker selling the fund. Load funds are sold in different share classes, which each have a unique fee structure. You can avoid loads altogether by buying directly from fund companies like Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity and others.COMPANY: Do business with companies that have long track records. The same goes for portfolio managers. Find out how long they have been running the fund, and what they have done in the past. Web sites like Morningstar.com track this type of information.PERFORMANCE: Don’t put too much weight on fund performance. Often, this year’s star funds are next year’s worst performers. Check the fund’s performance over three-, five- and 10-year periods. If the fund is actively managed, compare how the fund has performed versus its benchmark, especially during market downturns. Be sure to stack it alongside its peers, or funds of the same style, too. Choose a fund with relatively consistent returns.PORTFOLIO TURNOVER: This is a measure of how often a fund manager buys and sells the securities it holds. If a fund has a portfolio turnover of 100%, that means it has bought and sold its entire portfolio within the last year. The higher the turnover, the higher the trading costs -- and the more likely the fund will generate capital gains. Lower turnover means the portfolio manager is adhering to a longer-term buy-and-hold strategy, which should translate to higher returns. Index funds have a very low turnover ratio. For funds held in taxable accounts, it is best to choose a fund with turnover of less than 25 percent.For 401(k) plans, you can choose investment options from a list of funds provided by your employer. Not all company-sponsored plans are created equally, so be sure to carefully vet all funds on the plan menu.If you’re looking to purchase funds outside your employer’s plan, you have several options. You can purchase funds directly from the fund companies themselves, like Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and Vanguard, and avoid extra fees. But if you decide to use funds from multiple providers, you won’t have the ease of viewing all of your money on one statement.Many online brokerage firms and fund companies also offer products through a fund ""supermarket,"" which provides the convenience of one-stop shopping and one account statement. Just as with your local supermarket, these stock products from different fund companies and often provide their own brand, which is usually cheaper. Supermarkets’ costs and offerings vary, so it is important to research them thoroughly before choosing one.Start by evaluating their list of “no-transaction fee” funds, which can be purchased without paying an additional transaction fee (around $35) every time you make a purchase. If you are making regular investments into a fund, make sure the funds you’re most interested in are on this list. Paying a transaction fee every time you make a deposit will quickly eat into your returns.Still, there are situations where a transaction fund might make sense. For instance, if you find an attractive low-cost fund on that list, and you do not plan on making a lot of small investments, it might pay to choose the fund with a transaction fee. Finally, be sure to investigate any other fees the supermarket may charge.If all of this seems too overwhelming, consider hiring a professional. Visit a certified financial planner that charges by the hour and ask them to unearth some no-load funds for you.'"

"'08-12-16,'1','On Monday, Mr. Obama went a step further, meeting for five and a half hours with his national security team. In addition to General Jones and Mr. McConnell, the assembly included Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, who is just back from a trip to Iraq; Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the choice for secretary of state; Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general-designate; and Susan Rice, Mr. Obama’s pick for ambassador to the United Nations.Perhaps surprisingly, Mr. Obama has also been seeking foreign policy guidance from some Republicans and conservatives. Besides reaching out to Mr. Scowcroft, Mr. Obama has also called former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, a Reagan administration official who is known in some foreign policy circles as the father of the Bush doctrine because of his advocacy of preventive war. It is unclear what the two men talked about.Mr. Obama has sought advice from Richard L. Armitage (Colin L. Powell’s deputy at the State Department, who advised Senator John McCain in the presidential campaign), Gen. Tommy Franks (commander of the Iraq invasion), and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the onetime Democrat and now independent who supported Mr. McCain in the election and is known for breaking with Democratic criticism of the Iraq war.But even as Mr. Obama moves to the center, some classic liberalism has also become a part of his study program. Mr. Obama, having finished Steve Coll’s “Ghost Wars,” is now reading “Common Wealth: Economics for a Crowded Planet,” by the economist Jeffrey D. Sachs. Mr. Sachs argues that big governments like the United States could successfully tackle global warming, environmental destruction and extreme poverty by refocusing just a small fraction of global income toward those issues.Mr. Obama has also been making use of a military that he is soon to inherit as commander in chief. Three weeks ago, he called Admiral Mullen to Chicago for a 45-minute private session.“It struck the chairman very much that the president-elect is working very hard to bring himself up to speed, that he’s willing to listen, and to learn as he moves his way through the education process,” said a senior military official familiar with the meeting.Like many presidents before him, Mr. Obama expects the early months of his term to be dominated by the economy, Democratic advisers said, and indeed, the proposed auto industry bailout and the recession have controlled how he has spent much of his time. But he has also quickly learned — as his predecessors did — that issues of national security do not sit back and wait for the president to finish dealing with domestic policy.“Mumbai was a little bit of a wake-up call,” one foreign policy adviser to Mr. Obama said.In the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama had spent far more time talking about Pakistan’s relationship with Afghanistan, particularly along the lawless border regions of the two countries, than Pakistan’s long-running dispute with India over Kashmir. The Mumbai attacks, which officials have attributed to the guerrilla group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been preoccupied with Kashmir, moved South Asia’s other simmering security crisis-in-waiting to the front burner.On the day of the Mumbai attacks, Mr. Obama was in Chicago, getting ready to host 60 guests at his Hyde Park home for Thanksgiving the next day. He did not cancel his Thanksgiving plans, but ended up spending part of the day in briefings with two Central Intelligence Agency officials on the response to Mumbai. He called Ms. Rice several times to get updates about the crisis and the American response. One Bush administration official with knowledge of the conversations characterized Mr. Obama’s questions as “gathering information.”“He wasn’t telling her how to run policy,” the official said.And that Friday, Mr. Obama placed a 10:30 p.m. phone call to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, ostensibly to offer condolences about the loss of life in Mumbai..Mr. Obama had already been accused in the Indian news media of giving India short shrift, by calling President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan before he connected with Mr. Singh, as he returned some of the hundreds of congratulatory phone calls from world leaders about his election.Mr. Obama began getting daily intelligence briefings two days after his election victory, and quickly demanded that he receive seven intelligence briefings a week instead of the six that Mr. Bush gets.“We go through a great deal of substance, on any topic you can imagine in the context of national security and potential threats to the United States,” Mr. McConnell told an audience at Harvard last week.But Mr. Obama may have already discovered that the daily briefing is not enough, said Robert Dallek, the presidential historian. “During the crisis in India, would the daily briefing suffice to tell Obama what was happening?” Mr. Dallek asked. “I don’t think so.”Mr. Dallek said that former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger once scoffed to him about the daily briefings. “He said, ‘If there was something vital or crucial or a crisis developing, these daily briefs end up being just pro forma business that didn’t bring you up to speed.’ ”Mr. Kissinger, Mr. Dallek said, “didn’t think they always gave you an up-to-the-minute picture of what’s going on.”'"

"'08-12-16,'1','People who are depressed are literally sick at heart: they have a significantly increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and no one knows exactly why. Now three new studies have tried to explain this, and they arrive at subtly different conclusions.The first, led by Dr. Mary A. Whooley of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco, studied 1,017 patients with coronary artery disease for an average of more than four years. Although the study found an association of depression with heart disease, when researchers statistically corrected for other medical conditions, disease severity and physical inactivity, the association disappeared.They concluded with a relatively straightforward explanation: depression leads to physical inactivity, and lack of exercise increases the risk for heart disease. The study appears in the Nov. 26 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.A second study, published Tuesday in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology, provides a different perspective. It included more than 6,500 healthy men and women with an average age of 51. Researchers tested them for depressive symptoms and followed them for an average of more than seven years.This study, too, found that behavioral issues like smoking and inactivity were the strongest factors in the increased risk for heart disease among people who are depressed or anxious, accounting for 65 percent of the difference in risk. But they also found that depressed people had higher rates of hypertension and higher levels of C-reactive protein, and that these two physiological factors together accounted for about 19 percent of the increased risk. Mark Hamer, a senior researcher at University College London, was the lead author.'"
"'08-12-16,'1','Bankruptcy filings are accelerating in the New York metropolitan area at a faster pace than in the rest of the nation, according to figures released on Monday by the federal bankruptcy courts.In the federal courts that serve the region, filings for bankruptcy protection — by individuals and businesses — were pouring in at the rate of about 175 per day in the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, the data showed. The filings in the city, New Jersey and Connecticut increased by more than 36 percent in the quarter, faster than the nationwide increase of 34 percent.The statistics show that the rising tide of American bankruptcies that had already reached the surrounding areas of New Jersey and Connecticut has now rolled into the city. As unemployment rises, more consumers are falling behind on their debts and creditors have been increasing pressure on them to repay, bankruptcy lawyers said.“We are seeing debt-collection efforts really being ratcheted up over the last couple of months,” said Jay S. Fleischman, a bankruptcy lawyer in Park Slope, Brooklyn. “What we’re seeing is the debts being sued upon far earlier in the process. That leaves consumers with the feeling that they don’t have the options they once did.”Rather than seeking to work out repayment terms with the lenders or through credit counselors, more borrowers are filing for court protection from their creditors, Mr. Fleischman said. “Our clients now tend to be people who had better-paying jobs. More of the middle class and upper-middle class is being forced to consider this option as a result of job losses and the erosion of home values.”'"
"'08-12-16,'1','As familiar as the pattern may be, the changes this time are taking place at record speed. In June, some analysts were forecasting oil at $200 a barrel and companies were scouring the earth for new places to drill; now, no one knows how low prices may fall.“It’s a classic — if extraordinarily dramatic — cycle,” said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and author of “The Prize,” a history of the oil business. “Prices have come down so far and so fast, it’s become a shock to the supply system.”The list of projects delayed is growing by the week. Wells are being shut down across the United States; new refineries have been postponed in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and India; and ambitious plans for drilling off the coast of Africa are being reconsidered.Investment in alternative energy sources like biofuels that had flourished in recent years could dry up if prices stay low for the next few years, analysts said. Banks have become reluctant lenders, especially to renewable energy projects that may prove unprofitable in an era of low oil and gas prices.These delays could curb future global fuel supplies by the equivalent of four million barrels a day within the next five years, according to Peter Jackson, an energy analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. That is equal to 5 percent of current oil supplies.One reason projects are being shut down so fast is that costs throughout the industry, which had surged in recent years, are still elevated despite the drop in oil prices. Many companies are waiting for those costs to come down before deciding whether to go forward with new projects.“The global market has been turned upside down since the summer,” the International Energy Agency, a leading energy forecaster, said in a recent report.In today’s uncertain environment, a slowdown in spending is inevitable, according to energy executives who are devising their budgets for next year. Last year, spending on exploration and production amounted to $329 billion, according to PFC Energy, a consulting firm. That figure is certain to fall.“We’re in remission right now,” said Marvin E. Odum, the vice president for exploration and production for Royal Dutch Shell in the Americas. But once the economy picks up, he said, “the energy challenge will come back with a vengeance.”Oil demand growth has weakened throughout the industrial world. The International Energy Agency projects that worldwide demand will actually fall this year, for the first time since 1983.So much surplus oil is sloshing around the world right now that some companies, including Shell, are using oil tankers for storage.Oil prices have declined by more than $100 a barrel since July, returning to levels last seen more than four years ago. They settled at $44.51 a barrel, down $1.77, on Monday in New York, as concerns about the economy outweighed efforts by oil producers to stem the slide in prices.Prices could drop below $30 a barrel, according to Merrill Lynch and other forecasters, if the Chinese economy slows drastically next year, which looks increasingly likely.Different companies have different price thresholds for going forward with drilling projects. But across the industry, a price drop this big has “a dampening effect,” according to Mr. Odum of Shell. “The big uncertainty is how long this economic environment is going to last.”The biggest cutbacks so far have been in heavy oil projects in Canada, where some of the world’s highest-cost production is concentrated. Some operators there need oil prices above $90 a barrel to turn a profit.StatoilHydro, a large Norwegian company, recently pulled out of a $12 billion project in Canada because of falling prices. Similarly, Shell, Nexen and Petro-Canada have all canceled or postponed new ventures in the province of Alberta in recent weeks.Producers are bracing for a painful contraction, and the drop in prices could crimp investments even in places where production costs are low. The Saudi monarch, King Abdullah, recently said he considered $75 a barrel to be a “fair price.”The kingdom, which has invested tens of billions of dollars in recent years to increase production, recently announced that two new refineries, with ConocoPhillips and Total of France, were being frozen until costs go down. In neighboring Kuwait, the government recently shelved a $15 billion project to build the country’s fourth refinery because of concerns about slowing growth in oil demand.The list goes on: South Africa’s national oil company, PetroSA, on Thursday dropped plans to build a plant that would have converted coal to liquid fuel. The British-Russian giant TNK-BP slashed its capital expenditure budget for next year by $1 billion, for a 25 percent reduction from this year.In North Dakota, oil drillers are scaling back exploration of the Bakken Shale, a geological formation recently seen as promising, where production is more expensive than in conventional fields.“People are dropping rigs up there in a pretty significant way already,” Mark G. Papa, the chief executive of EOG Resources, a small natural gas producer, recently told an energy conference.Another domestic producer, Callon Petroleum, suspended a major deepwater project in the Gulf of Mexico, called Entrada, weeks before completion because of what it described as a “serious decline in project economics.”According to research analysts at the brokerage firm Raymond James, domestic drilling could drop by 41 percent next year as companies scale back.“We expect operators to significantly cut their activity in the coming weeks due to the holiday season, and many of these rigs will not come back to work,” the report said.As scores of small wells are shut down, analysts at Bernstein Research have calculated that oil production in North America could decline by 1.3 million barrels a day through 2010, or 17 percent, to 6.14 million barrels a day. This decline, rather than cuts by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, “will be the catalyst needed for oil prices to rebound,” Neil McMahon, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said in a conference call this month. The United States remains the world’s largest oil consumer.The drop in energy consumption could afford some breathing room for producers, which had been straining in recent years to match fast-rising demand. But analysts warn the world can ill afford a lengthy drop in investment in energy supplies. To meet the growth in global population and the rising affluence expected in the future, the world will need to invest $12 trillion in order to increase its oil and natural gas supplies, according to the International Energy Agency.“If we cut back dramatically on investments, we could end up in a situation where supply growth goes flat when the economy starts to recover,” said Mr. Jackson, the analyst. “The steeper the decline, the steeper the response.”'"
"'08-12-16,'1','Dr. Ransohoff and other screening experts say patients should continue to have the test, because it is still highly effective. But they also recommend that patients seek the best colonoscopists by, for example, asking pointed questions about how many polyps they find and remove. They also say patients should be scrupulous in the unpleasant bowel cleansing that precedes the test, and promptly report symptoms like bleeding even if they occur soon after a colonoscopy.The American Cancer Society says that even if the test is less effective than many had believed, it has no plans to change its recommended intervals between screenings — the test still prevents most cancers, but the expense and risk of the test argue against doing it more often.The cancer society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also are focusing on developing measurements of quality so that doctors who do colonoscopies can assess themselves and improve.But gastroenterologists say that, if nothing else, the study points up the paucity of evidence for the common suggestion that anyone who had a clean bill of health from a colonoscopy is almost totally protected for at least a decade.“We have to not overpromise,” said Dr. Ransohoff, who wrote an editorial accompanying the colonoscopy paper. “We need to look at the evidence, and we shouldn’t go beyond it.”The new study matched each of 10,292 people who died of colon cancer to five people who lived in the same area and were of the same age, sex and socioeconomic status. The researchers asked how many patients and control subjects had had colonoscopies and whether the doctors had removed polyps. Then the researchers compared the groups and asked how much the colon cancer death rate had declined in people who had had the screening test.The results were “a shock,” said Dr. Nancy N. Baxter, the lead author of the paper and a colorectal surgeon at the University of Toronto. When she saw them, she said, “I asked my analyst to rerun the data.”Now, researchers say, the challenge is to find out why the test missed so many cancers, in particular, those on the right side of the colon, and whether the problem can be fixed.About 148,000 people will learn they have colon cancer this year, the American Cancer Society reports, and nearly 50,000 will die of it.It might be that Canadian doctors were not sufficiently skilled. About a third of the colonoscopies were done by general internists and family practitioners who might not have had the experience to do the test well.But, said Dr. Douglas K. Rex, director of endoscopy and professor of medicine at Indiana University, that cannot be the entire explanation because at least one study, as yet unpublished, involving California Medi-Cal patients also found the test missed many cancers on the right side of the colon.That leaves several other possibilities.Perhaps patients did not sufficiently cleanse their bowels of fecal material, a particular problem for the right side of the colon.“After the prep has been completed, mucus and intestinal secretions start rolling out of the small intestine and colon,” Dr. Rex explained. The secretions, he added, pour from the base of the appendix into the right side of the colon and are “very sticky” and can obscure polyps.One solution, supported by six studies, is to be sure there is just a short time between when patients finish taking the strong laxative that cleanses their bowel and the colonoscopy, Dr. Rex said. That usually means taking half of the laxative the night before the screening test and the rest in the morning, something that often is not done, he added, but that he and others recommend.Cancer may also be different in the right colon, researchers said.Flat and indented polyps tend to cluster in the right colon. And so do another kind, serrated lesions, which, some studies indicate, might turn into cancer much more quickly than typical polyps.“It’s possible that we will never get as good a result” in the right colon, said Robert Smith, director of screening for the American Cancer Society.Still, he said, that does not mean that patients should have more frequent colonoscopies. The tests are “hugely expensive,” he said, and insurers may not pay for more frequent colonoscopies. The test also carries a small risk of perforating the bowel. Even if colonoscopies miss some cancers, colon cancer remains a rare disease and, after a colonoscopy, “the likelihood that you have cancer is very, very low,” Dr. Smith said.Dr. Harold C. Sox, editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine, is choosing another option. He is having a stool test, the fecal occult blood test, between colonoscopies. It looks for blood in the stool, which can arise from colon cancer.Dr. Smith does not advocate that strategy, saying that the stool test can have false positives from things like red meat or broccoli that have nothing to do with colon cancer. He worries that frequent stool tests will lead to frequent false alarms and frequent colonoscopies without making much of a dent in the colon cancer death rate.CT colonoscopies, so-called virtual colonoscopies, are not a solution, some screening experts said.“The issues are prep quality, flat lesions, serrated lesions and people not being careful enough in the inspection process,” Dr. Rex said. There is no evidence, he added, that a virtual colonoscopy will help with the inspection process. And, he said, “it almost certainly is not as effective a technology as colonoscopy for flat and serrated lesions.”Instead, patients should be compulsive about their bowel prep and be sure the test is done by one of the best colonoscopists in their area, gastroenterologists said. Doctors should find polyps in at least 25 percent of men and 15 percent of women. They should take at least eight minutes to withdraw an endoscope from the colon. And they should do a high volume of screening. Dr. Smith said a high volume was at least three or four colonoscopies a day.After the test, patients can ask whether the doctor got to the right side of the colon and how that was documented.Colon cancer experts said people should realize that even if colonoscopies prevent just 60 percent of colon cancer deaths, that still is a lot. Mammograms, for example, prevent 25 percent of breast cancer deaths, and the PSA test for men has not been shown to prevent prostate cancer deaths.“If I was to provide one main message, it would be that colonoscopies are the way that colon cancer mortality gets reduced,” Dr. Ransohoff said. “Colonoscopy is a good test, but it isn’t completely effective. And you know what? We ought to be happy with that.”'"
"'08-12-16,'1','The Toyota Motor Corporation is delaying the start of production at its plant in Blue Springs, Miss., indefinitely as it copes with the downturn in the auto industry.The plant was scheduled to begin production in 2010 and make the Prius hybrid.Mike Goss, a spokesman for Toyota’s United States arm, said Monday that the plant’s construction was about 90 percent complete and that Toyota would finish the building. Installation of the factory’s equipment and machinery, however, is being postponed indefinitely.About 100 people hired to oversee construction and install human resources plans at the plant will not lose their jobs but will be assigned other duties, Mr. Goss said.Although Toyota’s sales in the United States have held up better than those of its Detroit-based counterparts, sales have declined steeply throughout the industry, which Mr. Goss said forced Toyota to delay the plant’s opening.'"
"'08-12-16,'1','“We tend, in the West, to view family relations and social support as being protective of health,” said Dr. Ichiro Kawachi, an epidemiologist at the school and one of the study’s authors. “This is the first epidemiological study to show that these traditional living arrangements in Japan are rather harmful for women.”He added, “If you’re balancing a spouse and children, it’s also a problem.”Remarkably, however, the living arrangements do not affect men’s health.“One of the overwhelming things that stands out is that it doesn’t matter for Japanese men what the living arrangements are,” Dr. Kawachi said. “They’re immune from the stresses in the home.” Young Japanese women are “voting with their feet” by postponing marriage and having fewer children, he added.The researchers followed 91,000 Japanese men and women living in different household arrangements for more than 10 years. The participants ranged in age from 40 to 69 and had not been diagnosed at the start of the study with any serious illnesses, including heart disease, stroke or cancer.By the end of the study, 671 participants had been diagnosed with coronary artery disease, 339 had died of heart disease, and 6,255 had died of other causes.Women who lived with their spouses and parents, usually in-laws, were less likely to smoke or drink heavily, but were three times more likely to have had a heart attack, the researchers found.They were not more likely to die of a heart attack than the women who lived alone with their spouses. Dr. Kawachi speculated that once the women fall ill, they begin to receive the support they need, in which case “having parents around is probably helpful.”The results were adjusted to control for age, smoking and other factors.“This is yet another study that shows a link between stress and increased rates of cardiovascular disease, although we don’t have the definitive study that proves it,” said Dr. Nieca Goldberg, a cardiologist specializing in women and author of the book “The Women’s Healthy Heart Program.”An earlier study from Sweden found that marital stress increased the risk of heart disease for women, she noted. But emotional stress may be a marker for other risk factors and not necessarily a risk in itself, Dr. Goldberg added.Dr. Kawachi said that the risk for heart attacks may not be quite as high among Japanese women who live with both parents and children, compared to those living just with parents, because parents may be helping with child care and other responsibilities, offsetting other stresses.'"
"'08-12-16,'1','When his appointment was announced by the Human Rights Council last spring, the Israeli representative said it was “impossible to believe that out of a list of 184 potential candidates,” the members had made “the best possible choice for the post.”The American and Canadian representatives also expressed concerns about Mr. Falk’s possible bias. The Palestinian representative said it was curious that Israel was “campaigning against a Jewish professor” and called the nomination “a victory for good sense and human rights.” Israel objects to the mandate of the special rapporteur on grounds that it ignores all human rights violations by Palestinians, either against Israelis or against other Palestinians. More specifically, it objects to Mr. Falk.A statement issued on Monday by the Foreign Ministry noted that in the past three years, Israel welcomed visits by seven special rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council and two other senior United Nations representatives.In Mr. Falk’s case, it continued, his “vehement publications” made it “hard to square his appointment” with the council’s own requirements, which call for envoys to be impartial and objective. The council’s own procedures require its envoys to operate with the consent of the state concerned.A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yigal Palmor, said that Mr. Falk had come to Israel in June for what was supposed to be a personal visit, but had instead carried out work as a rapporteur. “He lied,” Mr. Palmor said.Regardless of Mr. Falk’s views, some Israelis questioned the wisdom of banning him, noting that it would hardly make his reports more sympathetic.Jessica Montell, the executive director of B’Tselem, an Israeli group that monitors human rights in the occupied territories, said that even if Israel had “legitimate concerns about Professor Falk’s mandate,” barring his entry was “an act unbefitting of democracy.”Also on Monday, Israel released 224 Palestinian security prisoners from its jails as a gesture to the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas.Most of those released were serving sentences of five years or less. None had been convicted of deadly attacks on Israelis, and none were from Islamic groups hostile to the Palestinian Authority, like Hamas.Israel has released almost 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in the past 18 months in an effort to strengthen the Western-backed administration of Mr. Abbas. At least 9,000 remain in Israeli jails.Editors’ Note: December 30, 2008  An article on Dec. 16 about Richard Falk, a Princeton University emeritus professor of international law who has also been an investigator of Palestinian human rights for the United Nations, reported that Israeli authorities had refused entry to him two days earlier when he tried to fly in from Geneva. They said he was unwelcome because of what they called his hostile position toward Israel and put him on a flight back to Geneva the next day. Mr. Falk could not be reached before publication to defend himself. Given Professor Falk’s initial unavailability, The Times tried unsuccessfully to get comment from United Nations officials in Jerusalem and Geneva before the article was printed, but did not try as it should have done to reach United Nations officials in New York. A spokesman for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville, had said in a press release that Mr. Falk “should have been allowed to transit Israel to the Palestinian territories to do his job.” Professor Falk said last week that he was not hostile to Israel, but critical of its occupation policy.'"
"'08-12-16,'1','A study of children involved in car accidents has revealed a surprising pattern of injuries: while heavier children are no more likely than others to be injured, they are much more likely to hurt their arms and legs.The report, published in the December issue of Injury Prevention, reviewed records of 3,232 children ages 9 to 15 injured in car crashes. The risk of sustaining a serious injury to the extremities was more than two and a half times as great for children who were overweight or obese. The association persisted even after statistically adjusting for other risks, like sitting in front, failing to wear seat belts and riding in an older car. (The study involved cars as far back as model year 1990.)“Being obese doesn’t mean you’re more likely to be injured,” said Keshia M. Pollack, the lead author and an assistant professor of health policy management at Johns Hopkins University. “But the pattern of injury varies by B.M.I. The important question is what this means for prevention.”The researchers were unsure of the reason for the finding, but they suspect that obese children may be more susceptible to bone fractures under any circumstances. It may also be that the increased mass of an overweight child results in increased force of impact on the arms and legs.The researchers acknowledge that some information depends on accounts provided by passengers, which may not always be reliable.'"
"'08-12-16,'1','Critics say Mr. Abhisit is handsome, articulate and well mannered but lacks the hearty touch of successful Thai politicians. They joke that he would need a visa to travel to the rural heartland of the north and the northeast.These are the areas that Mr. Thaksin made his base and that still hold the decisive votes in elections. The Democrat Party, by contrast, enjoys support from the middle class, the urban elite and the business sector.“I don’t even want to talk about their ability to heal that division — rich-poor, rural-urban and old establishment and Thaksin,” said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a visiting research fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.Mr. Abhisit tried on Monday to address those concerns. “I can only give assurances that if I receive the majority vote, I will work for people across the country,” he said.His election followed six months of protests against pro-Thaksin parties that culminated in a weeklong blockade of Bangkok’s two airports that ended Dec. 3. A day earlier, a court disbanded the governing People Power Party for fraud in the election a year ago, opening the way for Monday’s vote. Mr. Abhisit received 235 votes, compared with 198 for the former national police chief, Pracha Promnok.Outside Parliament on Monday, about 200 Thaksin loyalists shouted and threw bricks, raising the possibility that demonstrations might now begin from the other side of the political divide.No elected Thai government, apart from Mr. Thaksin’s first administration, has served out its full term, and some political analysts said Mr. Abhisit’s was too precarious to last long.“If they stay more than three months, I salute them,” Mr. Pavin said. “Sorry to be so pessimistic.”Though Mr. Abhisit has presented himself as a reformer who rejects the corruption that characterizes Thai politics, he came to power through the kind of hard bargaining typical of old-style Thai politics.As leader of the opposition party, he offered only mild criticism of the coup that ousted Mr. Thaksin. He also benefited from the long-running demonstrations by opponents of the government, refraining from condemning them even when they occupied Bangkok’s two airports, at a serious cost to the economy.His rise to power is also tainted by a perception that it was engineered by the politically powerful military, which critics say pressed small parties to join the Democrat-led coalition.Mr. Abhisit has yet to be tested as a leader or as a political infighter, and he will face some of Thailand’s toughest and most experienced politicians both within and outside the slim coalition government he has put together.One of these hard-nosed allies, a newly emerged defector from the Thaksin camp named Newin Chidchob, urged Mr. Abhisit to continue the populist policies with which Mr. Thaksin wooed the rural poor.But his cultural divide from the heartland may be difficult to breach. Asked last year about his likes and dislikes, he said that his favorite book was “The Myth of Sisyphus” by Camus and that he was a devotee of the singer Barry Manilow, whose voice is rarely heard in rural Thailand.'"
"'08-12-16,'1','Russia, which is not part of OPEC, is also sending a large delegation to Algeria and could join the oil cartel in reducing its production. Some OPEC officials hint they would also like to see Russia formally join the group.“We have to act — we see a very sizable reduction,” OPEC’s secretary general, Abdalla Salem el-Badri, told reporters on his arrival on Monday in Oran.The problem is that OPEC’s actions so far have had little impact on the market. OPEC members have already met three times since September, and agreed to trim their output by two million barrels a day.But the price of oil has dropped by 30 percent since October, the last time OPEC promised to cut production. With demand falling rapidly, there are few reasons to expect the drop in prices to slow down.Concerns about the economy pushed oil futures down $1.77, to $44.51 a barrel on Monday. Earlier this month, they touched a low of $40 a barrel, down from July’s record, when the price was above $145 a barrel.With stagnating growth next year, global consumption could fall by 1.3 million barrels a day, or 1.5 percent, in 2009, according to Deutsche Bank. Many analysts, including specialists at Goldman Sachs who predicted $200-a-barrel oil this summer, now say oil prices may fall below $30 next year if the slowdown spreads to China.The meeting in Algeria this week will also feature Russia’s proposal to reduce its own output. Russian officials have been cozying up to the oil cartel in recent months as the drop in prices has stung the country’s petroleum-dependent economy.Last week, President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia signaled that his country wanted closer cooperation with OPEC, and did not rule out joining the group. The 20-member Russian delegation to Algeria will be headed by Igor Setchin, Russia’s deputy prime minister for energy, and will include the top managers of the country’s five biggest oil companies.“We expect concrete support from them,” said Mr. Khelil, the OPEC president. “We always wanted them to join OPEC.”But Russia’s proposal is unlikely to have a big effect on the market. Some analysts see the move as simply window-dressing — Russian production will drop anyway this year, they say, because of the government’s own restrictive policies, inadequate investments and hefty export taxes.Part of the problem for OPEC is that producers simply cannot reduce their production fast enough to match the drop in consumption.OPEC has found it much easier to remain united within its ranks when prices rise than when they fall. To prevent their revenue from falling too quickly, some producers have failed to trim their production as much as they promised.Estimates of how much OPEC is pumping currently vary; the cartel does not disclose production numbers. The consulting firm Petrologistics, which tracks the movement of oil tankers, believes producers reduced their output by about one million barrels a day in November.Platts, an authoritative energy publication, estimated that OPEC’s production dropped by 880,000 barrels a day in November, or half what the cartel last pledged.There is also some uncertainty about how much oil is being produced by Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer. The kingdom reduced its output by 500,000 barrels a day, to 8.9 million barrels, according to the survey by Platts. That would mean Saudi Arabia is pumping 400,000 barrels a day more than its official quota.But while the market doubts OPEC’s determination, the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, indicated last week that the kingdom was pumping 8.5 million barrels a day in November, a drop of 1.2 million barrels a day from its August peak production level. The disclosure helped oil prices rise slightly last week.According to the Middle East Economic Survey, most producers have drawn budgets for 2009 that assume prices will be above $50 a barrel. Even Saudi Arabia has recently said that it considered $75 a barrel to be a “fair price.”Members of the cartel know they cannot get there anytime soon. The best the group can do is set the stage for a recovery in prices when the global economy eventually improves.“There is going to be a lot of pressure on the OPEC minister to defend prices,” said Geoff Porter, an analyst at the Eurasia Group in New York.“OPEC has to strike the balance between an aggressive cut, which will slow down the price fall,” he said, “but it can’t be so aggressive that it erodes their credibility if the members do not comply. They can’t push too hard and have their members not respond.”'"
"'08-12-16,'1','Manufacturers are ending a bruising year with a new round of bad news and grim outlooks for 2009.Industrial production fell 0.6 percent in November as the country’s output of cars, automotive goods, home electronics, appliances and furniture tumbled in the face of declining orders, the Federal Reserve reported on Monday. Consumers and commercial buyers reduced their spending in the face of the worst economic slowdown in two decades. Industrial production rose 1.5 percent in October, revised up from an initial increase of 1.3 percent.The Fed’s manufacturing report did list some bright spots. The output of mines and electric and natural gas utilities increased despite slumping energy prices as drilling and extraction recovered from shutdowns after Hurricanes Gustav and Ike raked the Gulf Coast. And the output of transit equipment surged 40 percent in November after Boeing restarted factories that had been idle during a monthlong machinists’ strike.The disturbing message behind the data was that even a rebound from rare events like hurricanes and labor strikes could not buoy the country’s overall industrial output for November, said Stephen Stanley, chief United States economist at RBS Greenwich.“I think it’s an indication of extreme contraction in the manufacturing sector,” he said. “Right now, I think people are sitting on their hands.”Capacity utilization, the percentage of plants in use, fell to 75.4 percent, from 76 percent in October.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey, a gauge of production in New York State, slid to a record low in December as sales deteriorated, new orders and shipments continued to slump and the number of unfilled orders dropped to record lows.'"
"'08-12-16,'1','On Saturday, more than 40,000 supporters gathered in downtown Bangkok to hear a video address by Mr. Thaksin, taped in Bali, Indonesia, in which he implicitly condemned what he called military interference in the vote.The military, which ousted him in a coup in 2006, has in recent months refused orders by the pro-Thaksin government to crack down on anti-Thaksin demonstrators.The election of a new prime minister is a low point for Mr. Thaksin, who fled abroad in October to avoid sentencing on a conflict of interest conviction. He was denied a visa to remain in Britain, where he had been living, and now travels between Hong Kong, Dubai and Indonesia.Although the vote offered the possibility of a respite from political tensions that have all but paralyzed the government in Thailand, intense social and political divides remain unresolved.The Democrat Party enjoys strong support from the middle class, the urban elite and many in the business sector, but a majority of voters among the rural poor still overwhelmingly support Mr. Thaksin.“I don’t even want to talk about their ability to heal that division — rich-poor, rural-urban and old establishment and Thaksin,” said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a visiting research fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.“Just to bring back economic confidence, especially after the airport closings, that will be a major challenge,” he said of the new prime minister. “And of course the most important thing is how to stamp his authority on the fragile coalition. Nothing is permanent in Thai politics.”No elected Thai government, apart from Mr. Thaksin’s, has ever served out its full term, and some political analysts said Mr. Abhisit’s was too precarious to last long.“If they stay more than three months, I salute them,” Mr. Pavin said. “Sorry to be so pessimistic.”By-elections are due next month to fill 29 seats that were previously held by pro-Thaksin legislators, and the result could tip the balance against Mr. Abhisit.Mr. Thaksin, a billionaire telecommunications tycoon, took power in 2001, and his government was the first in Thai electoral history to enjoy an outright majority in Parliament.He created a huge electoral base among the rural poor but was accused of corruption and abuse of power and was ousted in a nonviolent coup in 2006 while he was in New York at a session of the United Nations.When a parliamentary election was held a year ago, Mr. Thaksin’s supporters won again. But the new prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, was forced to resign when a court ruled that he had accepted money for appearing on a cooking show.His successor, Somchai Wongsawat, who is Mr. Thaksin’s brother-in-law, was forced to step down when the People Power Party was dissolved last month.Though Mr. Abhisit has styled himself a reformer, he took power through backroom deals of the sort that have characterized Thai politics.A turning point was the defection of a faction controlled by a close Thaksin lieutenant, Newin Chidchob.

"'08-12-16,'1','With coral reefs as their tea leaves, scientists are forecasting that in the next several decades there will be another major earthquake along the Sunda fault off Sumatra like the one that spawned the catastrophic tsunami of Dec. 26, 2004.Kerry Sieh, formerly of the California Institute of Technology and now at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, and colleagues write in the journal Science that a 2007 quake along a more southerly stretch of the fault represented only a first, partial rupture of that 400-mile section, which had been quiet for nearly two centuries. The researchers say this part of the fault, called the Mentawai section, is likely to be the site of at least one more major rupture.As evidence, they point to the growth patterns of coral reefs in the region over the last 700 years. When a quake occurs, the seafloor rises up, effectively lowering the sea level so that shallow coral reefs are now above the surface. The reefs cannot grow upward, but their still-submerged portions grow outward.The researchers found signs of this growth pattern roughly every 200 years going back to the 14th century, suggesting cycles of earthquake activity. But each cycle consisted of several major events over three or more decades. So the 2007 quake, they say, is just the first of a new cycle.'"

"'08-12-17,'0','Representative David Ralston, a Blue Ridge Republican who is chairman of the House Non-Civil Judiciary Committee, said, “The Nichols case, because it’s so recent and so high profile and the guilt of the defendant is so clear, has provided a great deal of momentum to the supporters of a change.”Legislators have not decided who will introduce the proposal to end unanimity or how many jurors’ votes it will require for a death sentence, Mr. Ralston said. But if the proposal passes, Georgia will become the only state to allow non-unanimous juries to sentence defendants to death.The federal government also requires a jury to be unanimous to impose death. (In Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Montana and Nebraska, judges can impose death sentences after a jury issues its recommendation.)It is not clear, however, that a Georgia proposal can withstand a constitutional challenge. Carol Steiker, a death penalty expert at Harvard Law School, said it could violate the 14th Amendment guarantee of due process and the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Although the Supreme Court allows non-unanimous juries in many cases, Ms. Steiker said, death sentences require the highest standards.“As the Supreme Court tends to say, ‘Death is different,’ ” she said. “It’s different in severity and it’s different in finality. This case really illustrates one of the problems with states trying to maintain thoughtful and circumscribed death penalty rules. There’s incredible pressure on these legislatures to change the laws at critical moments after high-profile cases.”Even critics of the death penalty worried about the message sent by Mr. Nichols’s sentence.“This case shows how arbitrary and irrational the death penalty can be,” said Richard C. Dieter, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “People shake their heads when they hear that someone got the death penalty for robbing a 7-Eleven, and Brian Nichols got life in prison for his heinous crimes.”There may be another opportunity for prosecutors to sentence Mr. Nichols to death. District Attorney Howard has suggested that federal prosecutors could try him for one of the killings because a victim, David Wilhelm, was a United States customs agent. The Justice Department will review the evidence before making any decisions, said Patrick Crosby, a spokesman for the department.Ever since Mr. Nichols shot four people and led the police on a daylong chase across Atlanta on March 11, 2005, his case has generated tremendous attention, for both the brutality of his crimes and the exhaustiveness of his trial.The county spent more than $3 million on a 54-count trial featuring 144 witnesses and 1,200 pieces of evidence, and much of that money could have been saved had the prosecution accepted Mr. Nichols’s offer to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life without parole. Mr. Howard scored a victory by convicting Mr. Nichols on all counts, but his primary goal was always a death sentence.For years, the case’s length and cost have fueled criticisms of Georgia’s public defender system. State Senator Preston W. Smith, a Rome Republican, accused defense lawyers of spending like “drunken sailors on shore leave” to provide an “O. J. Simpson-style defense, all on the taxpayer’s dime.”And frustration over the trial’s handling intensified after the sentencing.Mr. Dieter, of the Death Penalty Information Center, said the case’s outcome demonstrated the growing difficulty of achieving a death sentence, even in the South. Across the country, death sentences have declined steadily over the past decade, to 115 in 2007 from 306 in 1998.This downward trend reflects the public’s distrust of the death penalty and the increased reliance on the life-without-parole sentencing option, said Stephen B. Bright, a lecturer at Yale Law School and director of the Southern Center for Human Rights, who opposes the death penalty.“To get 12 people to decide to kill somebody is a difficult undertaking,” Mr. Bright said. “People are overwhelmingly in favor of the death penalty when the Gallup poll calls. But when you ask them in a courtroom to actually impose the death penalty, a lot of people feel very uncomfortable.”'"

He did not give details of either proposal.A Nasdaq spokeswoman declined to say whether the exchange had made such an offer, saying that to do so would violate a policy against disclosing advertising spending.'"
"'08-12-17,'0','In mechanical terms, the Fed’s rate cut is actually a decision to pump more money into the economy (which will cause short-term interest rates to fall). Starting next year, the Obama administration is planning to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on public works and other programs.All else being equal, more money sloshing around an economy causes prices to rise. In this case, it will probably keep them from falling as much as they otherwise would have.So amid all the legitimate worries about deflation, it’s worth considering what may be the one silver lining in the incredibly bad run of recent economic news: The cost of living is falling.Jobs are disappearing, bonuses are shrinking and raises will be hard to come by. But the drop in prices, which isn’t over yet, will make life easier on millions of people. It’s possible, in fact, that the current recession will do less harm to the typical family’s income than it does to many other parts of the economy.The reason is something called the sticky-wage theory. Economists have long been puzzled by the fact that most businesses simply will not cut their workers’ pay, even in a downturn. Businesses routinely lay off 10 percent of their workers to cut costs. They almost never cut pay by 10 percent across the board.Traditional economic theory doesn’t do a good job of explaining this. During a recession, the price of hamburgers, shirts, cars and airline tickets falls. But the price of labor does not. It’s sticky.In the 1990s, a Yale economist named Truman Bewley set out to solve this riddle by interviewing hundreds of executives, union officials and consultants. He emerged believing there was only one good explanation.“Reducing the pay of existing employees was nearly unthinkable because of the impact of worker attitudes,” he wrote in his book “Why Wages Don’t Fall During a Recession,” summarizing the view of a typical executive he interviewed. “The advantage of layoffs over pay reduction was that they ‘get the misery out the door.’ ”Companies resort to cutting jobs and giving only meager pay increases, increases that are even smaller than the low rate of inflation that’s typical during a recession. This recession may well be the worst in a generation — but thanks to the stickiness of wages, the pay drop for most families may not be much worse than that of a typical recession.The forecasting firm IHS Global Insight predicts that prices will fall by an additional 1 percent in 2009. That would bring the total drop, from the summer of 2008 to the end of 2009, to roughly 4 percent. But you can be sure that most executives will not force their workers to take a 4 percent cut in their paychecks. The fears about morale will be too great.Strange as it sounds, the drop in prices will keep real incomes — inflation-adjusted incomes — from dropping too much.I don’t mean to make things sound better than they are. The economy is bad and getting worse. A deflationary spiral remains a real threat, even if it’s not the most likely result. No matter what, unemployment is headed much higher.People who keep their jobs, meanwhile, will suffer through some stealth pay cuts — higher premiums, for instance. Raises will also remain meager in 2010, even if prices start rising again. Like every other recent recession, this one will force families to take an effective pay cut, and a significant one.But the drop in prices will still soften the blow. And at this point, American families can use any bit of economic help that they can get.'"
"'08-12-17,'0','UNITED NATIONS — After overcoming serious misgivings among Security Council members about taking the fight against Somali pirates ashore, the United States won a unanimous 15-to-0 endorsement on Tuesday for such aggressive measures.Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also announced that the United States expected to persuade the Security Council to authorize a United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia before the end of the month.“History has demonstrated again and again that maritime operations alone are insufficient to combating piracy,” Ms. Rice said at a meeting of the Council that was attended by several foreign ministers.She and others noted that piracy was just one symptom of an 18-year absence of a functioning government in Somalia and the need for peacekeepers.“While the conditions may not be auspicious for peacekeeping, they will be less auspicious if chaos reigns in Somalia, and we have to turn at some point to peacemaking,” Ms. Rice said.'"
"'08-12-17,'0','Jeers about Mrs. Merkel’s economic strategies have become de rigueur, rankling the corps of German politicians who worked feverishly to pass a $700 billion banking bailout package within a single week in October and have, after all, promised a good chunk of change already.“What was urgently necessary for the banks was done, as well as in any country,” said Kurt J. Lauk, head of a business group closely affiliated with Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democrats. “And there was a first stimulus package. So we don’t need to hide from France or Britain.”Still, the stimulus packages offered so far pale in comparison to plans floated in the United States by the transition team of President-elect Barack Obama for a program of $700 billion to $1 trillion.Mr. Lauk says Mrs. Merkel will not be a new Herbert Hoover, who seemed to do his best to drain the United States economy of its remaining lifeblood even as it tumbled into the Great Depression.But her reluctance to follow other Western countries’ lead has puzzled many allies and struck some of Germany’s critics as oddly ascetic.Peer Steinbrück, the German finance minister, has indicated concern over budget deficits and has characterized the British effort to kick-start its moribund economy as “crass Keynesianism.” In his view, European pressure for greater spending masked a desire to exploit the German taxpayer for the benefit of the country’s neighbors.To the question of why Germany did not simply spend its way out of recessions, as Keynes, the great British economist, suggested, Mr. Steinbrück shot back, “Just because the lemmings chose the same way does not make it the right one.”Berlin appears to have other grudges against its European neighbors, often tinged with a measure of contempt for what it sees as their failings.In its view, other countries scream for more German spending — some of which would go to Italian shoes, for example, or French wine — because they refused to make the hard choices in recent years that reinvigorated the German economy.A series of labor reforms underpinned the German renaissance and have helped its unemployment rate fall despite the crisis, German officials say. But the measures were initially deeply unpopular and claimed political casualties.One of those was Mr. Steinbrück, who lost his job as the powerful governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state. He seems disinclined to let European colleagues off the hook now.Fulminating against debt-fueled spending also resonates deeply with the German public. It may be true that only the oldest Germans have any personal recollection of the great inflation of the 1920s.But most people are aware of the history, and the social chaos that ensued. The recent labor market reforms have also heightened fears for financial security.Whatever the reason, Germans are the antithesis of the stereotype of the profligate Americans — at least the profligate Americans of recent decades — preferring to save as a hedge against what they often view as an uncertain future.Peter Bofinger, a professor of economics at the University of Würzburg and a rare admirer of Keynes among German economists, said this strain in the country’s political culture can be misunderstood as a self-lacerating streak. Efforts to ease human suffering, after all, provided Keynes with his ethical impulse in the first place.“During every lecture I give, someone always comes up with the question, ‘How are we going to handle our debt,’ ” Mr. Bofinger said. “You see this in personal conduct, and it is manifesting itself politically now as well.”Indeed, Mrs. Merkel’s poll numbers point toward a victory for her Christian Democrats in elections that will come late next year.A certain level of perfectionism also pervades German thinking about how money should be spent. In a recession, many economists would call this virtue a vice, but that has not stopped German officials from working through the details.Mrs. Merkel is herself planning to huddle with state premiers in coming weeks to hammer out what additional public works projects could be financed.“If we could simply start building bridges overnight as Obama wants to do, then great,” said Klaus F. Zimmermann, president of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. “But some investments take years. I don’t understand why the world doesn’t comprehend this.”But as they watch their economies nosedive, what many European Union countries cannot comprehend is why the German government is so averse to temporarily running large deficits, and as the pressures rise they are growing less shy about airing their grievances.Speaking of the relations among European countries, John C. Kornblum, United States ambassador to Germany in the Clinton administration, said, “You are having an air-clearing experience — confrontation, you might call it.”'"
"'08-12-17,'0','Despite an intriguingly familiar title and a story that hinges on a journalist at a powerful newspaper who is jailed for refusing to name her source, “Nothing but the Truth” has nothing to do with you know what or who. To be honest, I was looking forward to watching a movie about Judith Miller, the former reporter from The New York Times who in 2005 was jailed for contempt of court after she refused to cooperate with a grand jury investigating the outing of Valerie Wilson (a k a Plame) as an operative for the Central Intelligence Agency. I mean, that’s all terribly interesting and whatnot, but I really, really wanted to watch Kate Beckinsale, best known for wearing fangs and tight leather pants in the “Underworld” vampire franchise, interpret Ms. Miller.As Rachel Armstrong, an up-and-coming reporter for The Capital Sun-Times, a fictitious Washington paper, Ms. Beckinsale keeps her fangs retracted and her hair generally tied in a pert little ponytail. The hair comes down once she’s locked tight inside the big bird cage, where the inmates, who are apparently forbidden luxuries like hair ties, shout a lot and sometimes smash one another’s heads on the floor with bloody gusto. But that’s getting far ahead of Rod Lurie’s confusing film, which mixes familiar plot points — including a C.I.A. agent, here called Erica Van Doren and played by Vera Farmiga — with some grievous nonsense, most of which involves the two women’s irritatingly distracting home lives.It is evidently impossible to make a movie about two adversarial women without dragging in their families, because without needy children and angry, fed-up husbands — David Schwimmer plays Rachel’s mewling husband, while a barely present Jamey Sheridan plays Erica’s — these two female characters and their desires, successes and rages apparently wouldn’t rate screen time. That’s too bad for all sorts of reasons, including this one: when not cooing inanities at pipsqueaks, the actresses are pretty good, both together and individually. There’s pleasure in watching them go Manolo a Manolo against each other, particularly Ms. Farmiga, who fills out her size 0 with macho swagger. Despite a shaky start, Ms. Beckinsale does eventually look the part of the harassed and haggard heroine, if largely by not wearing any eye makeup.I’m not really sure what Mr. Lurie, whose previous films include “The Contender,” an exploration of female political power and its threat, believed he was saying in this new film. “Nothing but the Truth” has nothing much at all to do with the historical record, which wouldn’t be bad if it offered something persuasive and worthwhile in return, like a reckoning of journalism and its abuses. It shows Mr. Lurie ambitiously trying out some bold compositions, notably two-shots in which one character’s head looms in the foreground while the second person blurs into the background, and a commensurate level of narrative ambition that goes awry in the execution. Truly, the greater problem is not the facts but the delivery.“Nothing but the Truth” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Tough language and a brutal prison catfight.NOTHING BUT THE TRUTHOpens on Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles.Written and directed by Rod Lurie; director of photography, Alik Sakharov; edited by Sarah Boyd; music by Larry Groupé; production designer, Eloise Stammerjohn; produced by Bob Yari, Marc Frydman and Mr. Lurie; released by Yari Film Group.

"'08-12-17,'0','Jim Neu, a veteran of experimental theater and a standby at La MaMa, has struck again with “Gang of Seven,” a brief but engaging torrent of intriguing ideas and dizzying wordplay. Largely a conversation among seven archetypes seated onstage, the play raises a heady froth of provocation within its hourlong running time.The assembled are members of a focus group — Raymond, an aging wag in a bow tie (Byron Thomas); the refined Dawn (Mary Shultz), who fears the group is losing its “veil of anonymity”; the corporate curmudgeon Steve (Mr. Neu); the free-spirited Sh’rell (Chris Maresca); the entrepreneurial hustler Michael (John Costelloe); the naïve teenager Sandy (Kristine Lee); and Frank, a working-class stiff (Tony Nunziata). They congratulate themselves on their authority to confer status on things never made entirely clear: products, say, or political candidates. Together, they delight in the fabrication of reality, the manufacture of perception, and employ a baffling marketing-speak (“veneer management,” “facade-ism” and “rumorizing”).Their smug solidarity is tested by flare-ups of independence and spontaneity, embodied at one point by a mild flirtation between Ms. Maresca and Mr. Costelloe, but things eventually right themselves, if these electronic-media-addled consumers can ever be well adjusted.“Uncommitted is the new black, and I’ve learned to be proud,” Ms. Lee says. Utterly compliant, they have been hidden from their own feelings: “I can barely remember the last time I felt so close to myself!” Mr. Nunziata says tearfully. Ultimately, the play turns to theatrical convention but invests it with new meaning.“Gang of Seven” rewards repeat viewing — once is not enough to savor the abundant verbal pirouettes. The actors are appealing, well served by Mr. Neu’s frequent director, Keith McDermott, and conveying a palpable rapport. Some are familiar hands on Neu productions, and others are new, but discerning the veterans from the rookies isn’t easy. (Ms. Shultz and Mr. Neu are especially good.) By the end you may not have retained all of the play’s notions, but your brain will be abuzz with them.'"

"'08-12-17,'0','For the last 10 years, attending Steven P. Jobs’s annual keynote address at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco has been a sacred pilgrimage for Apple enthusiasts. That ritual has now ended.Apple announced on Tuesday that Mr. Jobs would not appear at the Macworld conference in January and that the company’s presentation would instead be delivered by Philip W.

Apple also said it would withdraw from the conference after this year’s event.The news unleashed a wave of speculation among Apple fans about what this portends for the computer maker’s lineup of products — and for Mr. Jobs’s health, which has been subjected to intense scrutiny in the last few years.In a statement, Apple strove to undercut any downbeat interpretation of the news.The company said that it was abandoning Macworld because it was able to unveil new products at its own events, like its Worldwide Developers Conference, held in June in San Francisco, and what has become an annual event each September at its campus in Cupertino, Calif., devoted to the iPod.The company is also now in a position to broadcast those events online and in its growing network of 250 well-trafficked stores around the world, reaching a broader audience than it could inside any single convention hall.'"
"'08-12-17,'0','Tommy Vietor, an Obama transition spokesman, declined to comment on any of these positions.The most difficult of the transitions will be at the F.D.A.Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a pediatrician and health commissioner of Baltimore, is leading the Obama transition team for the agency and is widely considered a top contender for the commissioner’s job. Dr. Sharfstein, 39, made national headlines last year when he petitioned the agency to ban some pediatric over-the-counter cough and cold medicines.He was a staff member for Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, the incoming chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. Dr. Sharfstein declined to comment Tuesday.Also on the short list for F.D.A. commissioner, according to people with knowledge of the situation, is Dr. Steven E. Nissen, 60, chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic who has gained fame in recent years as a fierce critic of the safety of several big-selling medications.“This is a failed agency,” Dr. Nissen said in a recent interview, “and it has lost the public’s confidence.” He advocated greater transparency for the results of industry drug trials and said the process for approving medical devices needs an overhaul.Dr. Robert M. Califf, a Duke University cardiologist and vice chancellor, and Dr. Alan Garber, director of the Center for Health Policy at Stanford University, are also being considered, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Neither could be reached.If Dr. Sharfstein or Dr. Nissen is chosen, the selection is likely to signal the end of an era at the agency in which the speed of the drug approval process often took priority over the certainty of a drug’s safety.Drug makers and drug-safety advocates — normally fierce opponents — agree, along with powerful members of Congress, that the agency needs an overhaul.“You really need some revolutionary changes at the F.D.A.,” said Billy Tauzin, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women and Families, said, “The F.D.A. has increasingly lost its emphasis on public health, and all of us have been harmed as a result.”In a farewell note to his staff, Dr. von Eschenbach wrote that he would return to his family in Texas.“I have said it is hard to fall in love with the F.D.A. from outside the agency because so few can fully appreciate who you are and what you mean to this country, but it is impossible not to fall in love with the agency and its mission once you are inside,” he wrote.The Obama transition team for the National Institutes of Health includes Dr. Harold Varmus, a former director, and Dr. Francis Collins, former director of the genome institute at the agency. Dr. Varmus declined to comment, and Dr. Collins did not return phone messages.Several people with knowledge of the situation said top candidates for the director of the health institutes include Dr. Collins as well as directors of other institutes, including Dr. Elizabeth G. Nabel of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; and Dr. Griffin P. Rogers of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.Dr. Fauci has twice declined the job of director of the health institutes and is said by those close to him to be unlikely to change his mind.At the disease centers, Dr. Gerberding is said to be interested in keeping her job.But Dr. Jeffrey P.

So on Tuesday, Mr. Yusuf announced that he had unilaterally selected another prime minister, who would be in charge of forming a new government, which Mr. Yusuf would swear in.“I congratulate you,” Mr. Yusuf told a group of politicians who were supporting him and had hastily gathered at his palace in Baidoa in central Somalia.Across town, the current prime minister, Nur Hassan Hussein, met with other Somali officials who assert that they are the country’s rightful leaders.The situation leaves Somalia with a huge crack in its beleaguered government, insurgents in control of much of the country, rising prospects of famine — and two prime ministers.Somalia’s transitional government has never been unified, powerful, popular or effective. But the United Nations and foreign countries have supported it with millions of dollars because it has been seen as the least bad option in a war-torn country that has not had a functioning central government for nearly 18 years.'"
"'08-12-17,'0','“If one assumes that the charge-offs will dissipate and the company’s fortunes will improve given the stimulus being provided to the economy, Goldman’s outlook is much better than its fourth fiscal quarter results would imply,” Richard X. Bove, analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, wrote in a note to clients.Even after the rally on Tuesday, Goldman shares were down 64.66 percent for the year.Goldman sidestepped earlier losses in the financial crisis by staying out of the high-risk subprime mortgage market and taking an early bet against the United States housing industry. But the bank has been unable to avoid taking big markdowns after nearly 30 percent declines across global equity markets in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on Nov. 28.Goldman’s quarterly loss, which amounted to $4.97 a share, begins a run of what is expected to be poor banking results. Morgan Stanley will report its earnings on Wednesday, and is expected to announce a loss of around $400 million.In the fourth quarter of last year, Goldman earned $845 million, or $1.81 a share. For the year, Goldman earned $2.32 billion, or $4.47 a share, an 80 percent drop from $11.6 billion, or $24.73 a share, last year.The bank stayed profitable in a year that brought the emergency sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and government rescues for the insurer American International Group and for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nation’s largest mortgage finance companies.“Our results for the fourth quarter reflect extraordinarily difficult operating conditions, including a sharp decline in values across virtually every asset class,” Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, said in a statement. “While our quarterly performance obviously didn’t meet our expectations, Goldman Sachs remained profitable during one of the most challenging years in our industry’s history.”Revenue in Goldman’s big trading and principal investment business was negative $4.36 billion, in contrast to $6.93 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.Goldman slashed compensation and expenses and benefits by 46 percent in 2008, to $10.93 billion, reflecting a lower reserve for bonus payments because of the bank’s poor performance, including a decline of $490 million in the fourth quarter.None of Goldman’s top seven executives will take a bonus for this year. Morgan Stanley has made a similar decision.Employment at the firm, which had been 32,569 at the end of the third quarter, decreased 8 percent in the fourth quarter. Goldman has said it would reduce head count by a total of 10 percent, but some analysts say they believe that it will need to make deeper cuts to reflect declining revenue and a slowing global economy.Goldman also benefited from a lower tax rate in 2008. The bank said it had an effective tax rate of 1 percent for the year and paid $14 million in taxes, down from 34.1 percent in 2007, when it paid $6 billion. Goldman said the decrease was “primarily due to an increase in permanent benefits as a percentage of lower earnings and changes in geographic earnings mix.”After the announcement, Moody’s Investors Service, the debt rating agency, downgraded the long-term senior debt ratings of Goldman Sachs to A1, from Aa3. Other ratings were affirmed but the outlook on them remains negative.David A. Viniar, Goldman’s chief financial officer, said it an interview that about $1 billion in losses came in real estate investments while $600 million came in its stake in the shares of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.“Over time, a lot of those are great investments,” he said, reiterating the belief within Goldman that these were largely unavoidable losses that will be reversed as market conditions improve. The same cannot be said for banks with huge holdings in subprime mortgages and related securities that may never recover much of their value, according to Goldman executives.Mr. Viniar said it was too soon to say when markets might recover but that huge efforts by governments in the United States and around the world should begin having positive effects.Mr. Viniar, reflecting a view privately expressed by Goldman officials, said he did not believe that the bank needed to make an acquisition to help its balance sheet.Speculation has centered on Goldman’s buying a retail bank or a trust bank that manages money for large institutions and wealthy individuals.'"

Food and beverage prices crept up 0.2 percent in November, their slowest rate of growth all year, while clothing prices were up 0.3 percent.The unadjusted year-over-year inflation rate was 1.1 percent, the government reported.“I’ve never seen the economy slam on the brakes as much as it has in the last three months,” said Bill Hampel, chief economist at the Credit Union National Association.Meanwhile, new data showed the nation’s housing market continuing to lag. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted 625,000 in November, far below Wall Street’s expectations.'"

He was flying in low visibility, said the United States Coast Guard.Mr. Jiménez was stripped of his Dominican pilot’s license two years ago because he had been caught flying multiengine planes when he was authorized to fly only helicopters, said Pedro Domínguez, president of the Dominican Pilots Association.The Coast Guard suspended its search Wednesday without turning up any sign of the plane or its passengers, a spokesman said.'"
"'08-12-18,'0','Steven P. Jobs has turned Apple into a technology powerhouse — twice. But how much is he worth to the company? If one compares the value of Apple’s revenue streams to the company’s market capitalization, nearly $20 billion.That makes Mr. Jobs’s absence from a coming trade show where he’s historically the keynote speaker worrisome, especially given speculation surrounding his thin appearance this summer. The premium that Apple fetches above the fair valuations of its businesses is a measure of investor faith in his ability to stitch Apple together. That’s why questions about Mr. Jobs’s health matter.Apple’s core is its Macintosh computer, whose sales have grown at a 40 percent clip this year. But Mac sales fell 1 percent in November while Windows-based sales grew 2 percent, so its high price may be a liability. Still, Apple’s margins are fat and should grow when the economy recovers. Assuming a multiple of 1.3 times revenue, or twice the industry average, the Mac business is worth about $19 billion.Then take the profitable, but nearly mature, business of making digital music players. Analysts think Apple’s margins on the iPod are about 30 percent. Using a lowish multiple of five times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, the iPod is worth some $14 billion. The iTunes digital music business has razor thin margins, estimated to be around 5 percent, but business is booming. At six times cash flow, it’s worth $1 billion.Apple’s biggest variable is the iPhone. The company may sell as many as 45 million of them next year, according to Piper Jaffray. Take out the cut it pays to partner AT&T, and Apple could make $1.5 billion in earnings. At a 30 percent premium to slower-growing rival Research in Motion, the business may be worth $17 billion.'"
"'08-12-18,'0','“What you need is a kind of process that assures four things,” he said. Those criteria are “adequate scientific background” to suggest that the procedure has a good chance of success; a medical team with the skill and experience to pull it off; a medical institution motivated not by the desire for publicity but by a perceived medical need, and the “open display, public evaluation and professional discussion” of the proposed surgery well before it is performed.That said, Dr. Siegler added, “the face is a little different from internal organs because so much emotion and expression is in the face.” For that reason, he believes that many families will be reluctant to allow a deceased loved one to become a face donor.Dr. Finder said a broader “social justice” cost-benefit analysis should also be done, perhaps especially in the current climate.“This is very resource-intensive, and we are at a time when economically our nation is seriously shaken,” he said, adding that some people would ask: “Is this the best way that our health resources ought to be used? This helps one person. How many children could have received basic health care and for how long?”The other side of that argument, he said, is that medical innovations often have wider benefits that cannot be predicted. “With face transplant, we know that we will learn something about something, but we can’t say what that is. We know that it will help many people beyond those getting the surgery. Some people will say you take the risk now with the expectation of a payoff later. Others will say, ‘No, we have a problem now.’ ”Professor Finder recommended that for now, surgeons hold off on further face transplants.“We’ve done this, so we now know it’s technically possible,” he said. “We probably shouldn’t be going wholeheartedly, guns blasting away, down the road to do this. Now we need to pause and say, ‘Is this the right thing to do?’ ”'"
"'08-12-18,'0','The City Council is prepared to approve on Thursday Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s proposal to raise property taxes by 7 percent, and to increase a tax on hotel rooms, to help plug an estimated $4 billion budget shortfall over the next 18 months, according to people briefed on the negotiations.“The votes are there,” said one council member who, like half a dozen other council members and aides interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to antagonize either end of City Hall. If approved, the property tax increase would take effect in January and add $600 million to the city’s coffers through the end of the fiscal year in June, and $1.2 billion for an entire fiscal year. The move would put an early end to a property tax cut that had been set to expire in June.The hotel tax, which could be temporary, would climb to 5.875 percent from 5 percent per room. That would mean an increase of $2.62 for the average hotel room rate of $300 a night, and raise $100 million from March 2009 to the end of the next fiscal year in June 2010.But in a concession to the Council, Mr. Bloomberg is ready to mail out $400 property tax rebate checks to homeowners within the next few weeks, the council members and aides said. Mr. Bloomberg had initially resisted continuing the popular rebate this year, saying that the city could not afford the $256 million expense. Then, after the City Council discovered that the city was legally obligated to send out the checks in the current fiscal year, Mr. Bloomberg suggested that the city hold on to the money until June.Mr. Bloomberg has also agreed, according to city officials, to refrain from cutting approximately $20 million from the budget, including programs for the City University of New York. As a result, he does not plan to cancel the next training class for more than 1,100 police cadets; instead, there will be two smaller classes of 250 cadets apiece in January and June.'"
"'08-12-18,'0','Mr. Hoff did not respond to phone or e-mail messages requesting comment. Ms. Daniele said in an interview Wednesday that she had originally seen Joey Evans dancing like a Gene Kelly, but that she had been “very happy” with Mr. Hoff’s work.Mr. Haimes declined to respond directly about whether he had been concerned about Mr. Hoff’s dancing.“You know what, I don’t think any of this is anyone’s business,” Mr. Haimes said. “The entire world economy is falling apart, and many nonprofit theaters are facing grave financial issues. My feeling is Christian Hoff is an absolutely lovely man, and discussing this only hurts Christian.”Key members of the production said Mr. Haimes and the show’s director, Joe Mantello, had originally wanted a major, bankable musical star — Harry Connick Jr. in particular, or Hugh Jackman — in the role of Joey. (Mr. Connick participated in a reading of “Pal Joey” several years ago.) Mr. Haimes declined to comment; Mr. Mantello rarely agrees to be interviewed, a publicist for the production said, and would not comment.In an interview in November Mr. Haimes said that it had been Mr. Mantello who “had settled on Christian in the role of Joey early on,” adding that he also wanted Stockard Channing as Vera, who gives Joey money for his nightclub. Mr. Hoff, in a separate interview last month, said Mr. Mantello had come to see Mr. Hoff in “Jersey Boys” and had given him very positive feedback.Theodore S. Chapin, president of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization (Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart wrote the music and lyrics for “Pal Joey”), said in an interview that he also had concerns early on about the production, but that he now believed “it has come a long, long way.”“After I first saw it, I thought things were a little rocky — in particular, they needed to do more to make the part of Joey as charming as possible, given the things that this rake of a character does to other people,” Mr. Chapin said.The show’s rehearsal process, which began in late September, had its share of challenges. Mr. Hoff began rehearsals shortly before he finished his nearly three-year run in “Jersey Boys,” and others associated with the production said he had seemed tired at times. And the chemistry between Mr. Hoff and Ms. Channing was not sizzling, members of the production said.Ms. Channing, for her part, said in an interview last month that she had moments of self-doubt about her singing abilities, especially given that her big number, “Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,” is one of the show’s most famous songs.“I am working very hard on the songs, in rehearsals and privately, but this show is not the easiest one,” Ms. Channing said. “It’s important to me to get it right.”For some key members of the production, the age of the actor playing Joey has also been an issue. Mr. Hoff is 40; Mr. Risch turned 27 in August. While the character of Joey does not have a specific age, he is a relatively young up-and-comer who is angling for his first big break. Members of the production said in interviews that they had been concerned that Mr. Hoff was too old for the part, and that Mr. Risch was too young and might make Ms. Channing (who is 64) look like a cradle robber. (Mr. Risch declined an interview request.)Still, Kelly was 28 when he played Joey on Broadway. Frank Sinatra was 42 when he played Joey in the 1957 film version; the “older woman” in the role of Vera Simpson was Rita Hayworth, who was three years younger than Sinatra at the time. If the 37-year age difference between Mr. Risch and Ms. Channing is the only aspect that history records as unusual about this “Pal Joey,” the producers will be very pleased indeed.'"
"'08-12-18,'0','The experience inspired him to think beyond just one group of students and one project. “It was apparent that there was a need for a larger organized effort, a community of developers and disabled persons to conceptualize projects that can help people,” Mr. Leung said. “So I gathered colleagues into a room at J.P.L., pitched the idea and asked for their help. Several of them and dozens of others since then have taken on the challenge and brought Project:Possibility to where it is today.”The effort is centered at the University of Southern California and led by volunteers, including Ely Lerner, an information systems developer at Amgen Inc.; Elias Sayfi, a senior software engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and Stanley Lam, an undergraduate business student at the university.In 2007, they organized a competition called “Code for a Cause” in which 25 students in five teams engaged in a weekend of intense computer code-writing. The event attracted assistance from executives at Google, Amgen and the propulsion laboratory. This year, in October, the competition expanded to 50 students in eight teams with mentors from Google, Amgen and the laboratory, as well as judges from Lockheed Martin and Amgen and encouraging words from a Microsoft executive.The competition was won by Bar Code Reader, the program to help the visually impaired read information on grocery items. Second place went to Mind Control, which allows the physically disabled to guide a computer mouse by neural impulses. All the code, written in 12-hour sessions on a single weekend, made progress, but also left room for further development.The Bar Code Reader team “didn’t hook up a cellphone, so we used a Motorola simulator,” said Michael Crowley, an associate professor of engineering practice who was the mentor for the team.James Han, founder of ProsForPros, an Internet hosting and consulting firm for small businesses, was the mentor of the Mind Control team. “We were able to leverage open-source codes for mouse control and link to the neural actuator in the first 12 hours,” Mr. Han said. “In the second 12, we created the user interface. I believe implementation of the program is currently in development with similar devices.”Project:Possibility directors have plans for more ambitious projects. First, there will be a competition in February with teams of computer science students at the University of California, Los Angeles, in hopes of multiplying the number of programs to help the disabled. The project also plans to create a worldwide open-source Web site on which disabled persons and software developers can collaborate on new ideas and add to existing programs.“Imagine a specialist Facebook or MySpace-type social network in which users would be involved in designing the tools they want and need,” said Stephen A. Lee, a British software developer who operates Fullmeasure.co.UK and is a director of Project:Possibility. “Students would talk to users and work on projects that meet needs as well as be exciting.”He estimated that “an active online community may well take six or more months to organize, as there is inertia and shyness to overcome.” There will also be costs to create such an online community, he said, “for Web hosting, associated technology costs and set-up labor.”To date, Project:Possibility has operated without revenue and without pay for participants. Its programs belong to the nonprofit project and to the University of Southern California. Its sole source of financing was a $15,000 grant in early 2008 from the Mozilla Foundation, an organization that promotes the concept of the Internet as a public resource open to everyone.Nor does Project:Possibility intend to be a commercial venture, Mr. Leung said. “We do not plan to earn revenue through a spread of our programs. In fact,” he said, “we plan to be completely open-source — our programs can be downloaded, modified and used by anyone at no cost — in hopes that similar programs will spread to other universities and around the world with or without our involvement.”But, at a project meeting early this month, the directors decided to establish a paid position. “We are looking to grow and that will require people to dedicate even more of their time to this project,” Mr. Leung said. So it will be necessary to “compensate for our core positions and perhaps one day to have a full-time staff.”Mr. Leung lives and works these days in Beijing. “I’m a Chinese-American who grew up in Northern California and never spoke Chinese,” he said. “So I’m learning Chinese and working here, but keeping in touch online with Project:Possibility.”To pay for staff, the project will continue to depend on grants from companies and charitable groups. At some point, it hopes to establish regular fund-raising efforts for its nonprofit operations.“What’s great is that companies like Google and Mozilla support our projects,” Mr. Leung said. The companies gain by getting ideas on technological breakthroughs and seeing ways to adapt them to everyday products. One Project:Possibility program, for example, called Community Captioner, integrates subtitles with YouTube “so the hearing-impaired can have sound with their videos.”'"
"'08-12-18,'0','BEAVERTON, Ore. — The shoe and apparel company Nike said its profit grew 9 percent in the second quarter as strong sales overseas offset weak domestic sales.The company said Wednesday that its net income rose to $391 million, or 80 cents a share, compared with net income of $359.4 million, or 71 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier.The company said its revenue grew 6 percent, to $4.6 billion from $4.3 billion. Changes in currency exchange rates increased revenue by 1 percentage point for the quarter.Nike’s chief executive, Mark Parker, said the results demonstrate the strength of the brand. He said the current state of the industry and the world offer opportunities for Nike to become a stronger leader.The company had strong sales growth in Asia and other foreign markets. Revenue in Asia jumped 22 percent for the quarter. But domestic sales were weak. Total revenue in the United States decreased 1 percent, with significant drops in equipment sales.The company’s future orders, which are product scheduled to be delivered between December and April, fell 1 percent lower than such orders reported for the same period last year. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, reported orders grew 6 percent.'"
"'08-12-18,'0','This is Italy, after all. Everyone here believes change is necessary. But then sighs, because it’s impossible too. Wholesale change anyway. It’s Raphael or bust.A half-dozen structural revamps of the culture ministry during the last decade haven’t really done much except to shuffle around the burden of a creaky and defensive bureaucracy. The country is paralyzed by contradictions. Italians say they identify deeply with their cultural patrimony, but they actually don’t visit their museums much. They talk about collective Italian artistic heritage but remain, at heart, profoundly divided by ancient regional differences never quite bridged by unification a century and a half ago, differences that fracture cultural policies.And so the Berlusconi administration’s proposal for a supermanager was ostensibly to cut through decades of red tape, inject an outsider’s fresh views and, in straitened times, find new ways to earn more revenue from the country’s unparalleled bounty of art and antiquities, especially considering that the ministry’s budget is about to be slashed by more than 30 percent over the next three years.But opponents, not altogether irrationally, stressed that culture demands expertise, not somebody who sold hamburgers, never mind if Mr. Resca is admired and successful. The ridiculous choice that presented itself between maintaining the status quo or enlisting the guy who ran McDonald’s was somehow typically Italian. In a country where every bid for change is believed to hide some ulterior political motive, detractors suspected the supermanager idea was in fact merely a ploy to ransack national storerooms and grease the path for the prime minister’s rich friends who want to hawk precious Italian art abroad.To Americanize the system, in other words. And perhaps in part it was. But Italians, whose cultural heritage policies have roots in the 1500s, still maintain a very different philosophy toward their belongings. They declare not just precious Roman artifacts and Caravaggios to be national patrimony but also every single Italian building, artwork and piece of furniture more than 50 years old.That’s right. Everything over 50 (with art, the artists at least have to be dead) is regulated by patrimony laws requiring Italians to declare what they own if they wish to export it. This means many people prefer to remain secretive about what they have, and if it’s art, it therefore doesn’t circulate. Whatever’s buried in the ground automatically belongs to the state, even if the ground happens to be your backyard.In practice, in a country where uncollected taxes are now estimated to top 280 billion euros (about $401 billion) — a reflection, among other things, of Italian doubts about, and lack of identification with, a centralized government — the system relies upon an increasingly aging and perennially underpaid ministry. It is practically unmanageable. It encourages dishonesty and illicit trade; it discourages innovation and outreach. It also stresses conservation — sometimes to a fault.Only 15 years ago Italian museums agreed to keep their doors open past 2 p.m. A Roman friend was shocked last week to receive a flyer from the Palazzo Massimo, part of the National Museum of Rome, inviting her to “Discover the Massimo.” American museums send out these sorts of promotions all the time. Not Italian ones.In France or Britain, where people feel just as strongly about their cultural heritage, there are incentives for openly declaring one’s art and property, including the right to sell outside the country, with the state preserving an option to buy what it deems national patrimony by matching the price at fair market value. At the same time the Louvre will soon start renting parts of its collection to Abu Dhabi, as the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, has done to Japan. This is a dubious business that can easily lead to conflict, and has in the case of Boston, but also, if properly managed, a way to earn money and share a country’s cultural riches. In turn it can be a boon to tourism and a diplomatic tool.In America tax breaks encourage private contributions to public institutions. Italy is only just beginning to set up a limited system for tax breaks but under complicated circumstances that most Italians don’t know about or find mysterious. Smuggling art and antiquities out of the country is a constant problem.Italians seem almost to relish their own intransigence. Salvatore Settis heads the top advisory board at the culture ministry. “We walk on the streets of cities like Rome, and we may live and work in a palace with historical importance, so we interact with our cultural heritage all the time and therefore we may go into a museum or we may not,” he said by way of explaining how it is that Italians prize their cultural past but don’t bother to go to their museums to see it. “But another explanation,” he added, “is that Italian museums are not attractive.”That’s not altogether true. Some are glorious of course. But among the Top 10 most visited in the world, Italy has only the Vatican Museums, and the Vatican isn’t even technically part of Italy. As Marisa Dalai Emiliani put it, “We don’t think in those terms,” meaning in terms of promotion and accessibility. She is president of the Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli Association, a cultural research institution.“When Clement XII opened the Capitoline Museum in 1734, he had two aims,” she said the other evening. “The goal was to teach scholars and artists on the one hand, and public enjoyment on the other. Over time even with all the changes we’ve had in recent years, there has been less of a sense of our museums as places for public enjoyment.”Michele Trimarchi, an economist here, shook his head in disgust. “We have a small but noisy cultural establishment, and there is a kind of religion of self-protection on its part,” he said. “The large majority of Italians don’t actually care about culture. Absolutely not.“In the United States you have museums and opera companies that arrange for young people to come for free to encourage new audiences. Here that sort of promotion is blasphemous. Italian museums have no incentive to promote themselves. They are not centers of financial autonomy, because everything they make goes to the central government, so whatever they make will not be reflected in their own financial fortunes.”This is not altogether true either. But it is part of the problem. “And yes,” Mr. Trimarchi added “we fail to realize that conservation and promotion are two sides of the same coin.”Which they are. In the end it’s an odd failure in a country so dependent on culture for tourist dollars and, in commercial areas like design and fashion, so cutting-edge and adroit at salesmanship.Back at the Vatican, Mr. Paolucci shrugged: “Culture is like our family. Every once in a while a politician comes along and suggests selling off what’s in our storage rooms. But it’s against our DNA to manage cultural patrimony from an economic perspective. Yes, Italy looks after its patrimony badly because we don’t have the resources. So we wait for better times.”When asked whether he had any idea when they might come, he glanced at St. Peter’s again and laughed. “I’m optimistic,” he said. “Being here, it’s my duty to be.”'"
"'08-12-18,'0','OTTAWA - In an event that brought aggravation, and perhaps in some cases relief, to investors on Wednesday, a computer glitch shut down the Toronto Stock Exchange.Canada’s largest exchange, and one of the world’s leading mining exchanges, shut down 18 minutes after opening when it become apparent that only some customers were receiving data about trading. Both the main exchange and the venture exchange for junior listings were closed.While the effective loss of an entire trading session was extraordinary, it is one of series of technical problems that have plagued the exchange, which converted to all-electronic trading 11 years ago. Several analysts believe that the problems may benefit several alternative exchanges that have appeared over the last year to challenge the 147-year-old Toronto exchange.Late in the afternoon, the exchange, which is owned by the TMX Group, abandoned all hope of reopening. Later it issued a statement promising that the exchange would open on Thursday morning for regular trading.The exchange did not identify the cause of the problem, at least publicly. But in a series of brief statements, it made it clear that the computers that actually handle trading were not involved.'"
"'08-12-18,'0','“We want non-OPEC countries to contribute, and not just benefit from the impact of our cuts,” Chakib Khelil, OPEC’s current president, said after the meeting, which was held under tight security in the coastal Algerian town of Oran. “It’s in their own interest as well as in ours.”Mr. Khelil said the group wanted to “eliminate” an overhang of commercial oil inventories, which now stand at 57 days of supplies, down to 52 days, and aimed to push prices up to $70 to $80 a barrel.“We have five days of excessive stocks that could really lead to a collapse in prices,” Mr. Khelil said during a chaotic and confused news conference after the meeting.Russia, which is not part of OPEC, sent a large delegation to Algeria but analysts saw this as a gesture of political support that carried little more than symbolic value. Russian oil production is going to decline this year anyway because of government policies that have discouraged investments and harmed domestic producers.The oil collapse has brought down gasoline prices for consumers, but it is devastating to producers, who have based their budgets for next year assuming prices well above $50 a barrel.The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, set the tone on Tuesday as he arrived in Algeria, when he proposed a large cut to balance the market and trim commercial oil inventories that have been swelling well above their historic levels. Other representatives quickly backed the proposal.The Saudis had until now been wary of acting too aggressively lest they derail any economic recovery. In June, as prices were still rising, they pledged to flood the market to prevent prices from spiking. But that did not prevent oil from rising above $145 a barrel the following month.Now, with the economy seizing up, the Saudis seem to have become much more concerned with the drop in prices, and their ability to prevent a complete collapse. Oil has fallen by $100 a barrel, or 70 percent, since peaking five months ago. King Abdullah recently said he would like to see prices at $75 a barrel, more than 50 percent above their current levels.The cartel has not faced such a challenging environment since the early 1980s. Oil consumption is set to decline for the first time in 25 years because of the economic crisis.The new target sets OPEC’s production at 24.85 million barrels a day, starting Jan. 1.'"
"'08-12-18,'0','The newspaper said this month that Maj. Gen. Jin Yinan, a military planner at the National Defense University, had conceived the Gulf of Aden plan. The paper quoted him as saying, “The Chinese Navy should send naval vessels to the Gulf of Aden to carry out antipiracy duties.”“If one day the Chinese Navy sends ships to deal with pirates,” General Jin said, “nobody should be shocked.”On Wednesday, an international antipiracy force rescued a Chinese cargo ship that had been taken over by pirates, The Associated Press reported. After the crew sent a distress signal, the International Maritime Bureau’s piracy reporting center sent two helicopters that fired on the pirates, causing them to flee, the news agency reported.Traditionally concerned with coastal defense, the Chinese Navy has been undergoing a wide and rapid modernization, especially in the bolstering of its submarine fleet. A long-range goal of the Chinese expansion has been the development of a navy capable of extended tours far from home.About 60 percent of China’s imported oil comes from the Middle East, and much of that passes through the Gulf of Aden, along with huge shipments of raw materials from Africa. Last month, two Chinese ships were hijacked there: a fishing trawler and a cargo ship flying the Hong Kong flag and carrying wheat.While China has been “quite wary of putting maritime assets in the region and wary of doing anything out in the open,” Chinese diplomats have been active in antipiracy efforts, according to Arthur Bowring, managing director of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association.“The Chinese have been working diplomatically with the Yemeni government and coast guard, and their ambassador in Nairobi is very heavily involved,” Mr. Bowring said. “They may not seem out in front, but they work extremely hard in the back seat.”To help combat the sharp rise of increasingly brazen pirate attacks in the gulf, the European Union deployed its first-ever naval mission this month, a six-ship flotilla. The union’s operation, code-named Atalanta, joined other navies already patrolling there, including those from the United States, Russia and India.“China is usually quite conservative about playing with the big guys or saying they’re going to match up with them,” said Jane Chan, an associate research fellow in the maritime security program at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.She also said, “I would think they would go to protect their own interests — just for escorting purposes and not for policing.”Also this month, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution allowing navies to breach Somalia’s 12-mile territorial limit while pursuing suspected pirates. And on Tuesday, the Council voted unanimously to permit attacks on pirate bases on the ground.Although pirates use oceangoing “mother ships” to attack merchant vessels deep in international waters, they are resupplied and find havens in towns along the lawless coast of Somalia. Many antipiracy experts have pressed for international strikes against the pirate bases on land.“Piracy is a symptom of the state of anarchy which has persisted in that country for over 17 years,” said the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. “This lawlessness constitutes a serious threat to regional stability and to international peace and security.”More than 100 vessels have been attacked by pirates in the gulf this year, and 42 have been hijacked. Sixteen are being held for ransom, including a fully loaded Saudi supertanker, the Sirius Star, and a Ukrainian ship, the Faina, carrying 32 battle tanks and other heavy weapons. About 250 crew members are being held on the various hijacked ships.'"

"'08-12-19,'0','once noted that “you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.” The collapse of what prosecutors say was the biggest in history, orchestrated by the New York money manager Bernard Madoff, has left a large number of powerful and smart people shivering on that beach.Mr. Madoff’s suspected multibillion-dollar fraud, discovered as falling markets exposed the fiction of its 10 percent annual profits, provided a stark reminder of how greed impairs judgment, duping some of the world’s supposedly savviest investors for decades. It raises once more a fundamental question of these times: Where were the regulators when all of this was happening?, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, acknowledged this week that the agency had received “credible and specific” allegations about the scheme at least a decade ago. He promised an internal inquiry to figure out why the agency did not thoroughly investigate. Two years ago, the commission’s enforcement arm in New York opened an investigation into whether Mr. Madoff’s business was a Ponzi scheme but closed it after finding only mild violations that “were not so serious as to warrant an enforcement action.”The S.E.C.’s failings go much further than missing this one outrageous scheme. The agency urgently needs new leadership, more resources and high-level political backing to recover its role as Wall Street’s top cop.Though many details remain unknown, Mr. Madoff’s activities should have set off plenty of alarms. His firm posted improbably constant returns, regardless of market volatility. It claimed to employ strategies that at such a large scale should have produced highly visible movements in options markets, yet passed undetected. Its auditor was a tiny, unknown outfit.While it is particularly embarrassing to have overlooked what appears to be a low-tech fraud invented 100 years ago, the S.E.C.’s failure to pursue the case aggressively exemplifies its lackadaisical approach to enforcing the law on Wall Street. That has gotten much worse during the Bush administration.'"

"'08-12-19,'0','One investigator said the motive for the officer’s slaying came down to Mr. Cacace’s image.“From an organized crime perspective, this was insulting to Joel that she had married a cop,” the investigator said, adding, “and because he had a high-ranking position in the Colombo family, it looked bad for him.”An earlier husband of Ms. Kennaugh’s, a Colombo hit man, also was murdered, in 1987. A woman answering the door of Ms. Kennaugh’s home in Staten Island, heavily festooned with Christmas decorations, said, “No, no,” and shut the door on a reporter inquiring about the case on Thursday.The indictment, which is largely based on evidence provided by a new cooperating witness from the Colombo family, law enforcement officials said, also charges Mr. Calabro and Mr. Saracino with the 1999 murder of William Cutolo Sr. Mr. Cutolo was a Colombo family acting underboss and union official whose body was finally found on Long Island this year after an informant tipped off the authorities.The fourth defendant, Thomas Gioeli, 56, who was an acting boss in the family and is known as Tommy Shots, is also charged in the killing of Mr. Cutolo.Mr. Cardona said the murders led to promotions in the crime family.“That’s why mobsters commit murder,” he said. “Our intelligence revealed that Calabro became a made member of the Colombo family after the murder of Ralph Dols, and he became a capo after the Cutolo murder. Saracino was inducted into the family because of his participation in both murders.”Officer Dols had driven home after finishing his shift at a Coney Island housing project and was parking his car at 11:38 p.m. when three men drove up in a dark Chevrolet Caprice and opened fire. He was wounded three times in the abdomen and twice in the arm before he could step from behind the wheel or pull his gun. He died in surgery at Coney Island Hospital the next morning. He had been on the force for four and a half years.He and Ms. Kennaugh, who was 38 at the time of the slaying, had been married for two years and had had a daughter three months earlier. Ms. Kennaugh’s brother, August, was convicted in the 1981 murder of a Queens restaurant owner and had also been identified as a Colombo soldier.The shooting rattled the already embattled Police Department, which was facing accusations in the brutality case of Abner Louima, who was sodomized with a broomstick in the restroom of the 70th Precinct station house earlier that month, on Aug. 9, 1997. As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani eulogized Officer Dols at the crowded funeral Mass, thousands of demonstrators gathered at Grand Army Plaza for a march to City Hall to protest the Louima case.Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly called for capital punishment. “The murder of a police officer is an attack on society at large and merits the death penalty,” he said in a statement.The indictment also charges Mr. Calabro with the 1994 murder of Carmine Gargano and charges Mr. Gioeli, Mr. Calabro and Mr. Saracino with the 1995 murder of Richard Greaves. The bodies have not been found.'"
"'08-12-19,'0','BOSTON — A New Hampshire jury on Thursday issued the state’s first death sentence in nearly a half-century.The jury decided that Michael Addison, 28, who was convicted of capital murder last month in the 2006 shooting of a police officer, should die by lethal injection. Defense lawyers said they would appeal the verdict, which will automatically be reviewed by the State Supreme Court.The police officer, Michael Briggs, 35, was on a bicycle patrol in Manchester, N.H., when he and his partner encountered Mr. Addison and an accomplice, who were wanted for a series of crimes. Mr. Addison shot Officer Briggs once in the head at close range to avoid arrest, prosecutors said.Mr. Addison was arrested hours later at his grandmother’s house in Boston.His lawyers admitted that he shot Officer Briggs but argued that the crime was not premeditated. They also said their client should be spared the death penalty because he had a traumatic childhood.But the New Hampshire attorney general, Kelly A. Ayotte, who argued the case, said Mr. Addison was a hardened criminal intent on killing Officer Briggs, a five-year veteran of the Manchester Police Department and the father of two.“A life sentence doesn’t do justice in this case,” Ms. Ayotte said during closing statements.A New Hampshire inmate has not been executed since 1939. The last time a New Hampshire court issued a death sentence was in 1959, for two convicts, but a 1972 ruling by the United States Supreme Court spared their lives.'"
"'08-12-19,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Bureau of Investigation paid $7.8 million in improper wages for agents temporarily posted in Iraq from 2003 through 2007, a Justice Department audit has concluded.The report, issued Thursday by the department’s inspector general, Glenn A. Fine, attributed the problem to a faulty F.B.I. policy that allowed agents to claim the extra time and money, in some cases for hours when they were watching movies, exercising and attending parties.The report concluded, “We found that, on the whole, few if any employees worked exactly 16 hours a day, every day, for 90 days straight, within the meaning of the term ‘work’ as it is used in applicable regulations and policies.”In a statement, John Miller, the F.B.I.’s assistant director, said the policy, which is no longer in force, was supposed to be a short-time pay solution in the early days of the war to help recruit volunteers for a dangerous assignment. He said managers at F.B.I. headquarters “allowed a flawed system to develop and remain in place too long.”'"
"'08-12-19,'0','Although laws against homosexuality are concentrated in the Middle East, Asia and Africa, more than one speaker addressing a separate conference on the declaration noted that the laws stemmed as much from the British colonial past as from religion or tradition.Navanethem Pillay, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, speaking by video telephone, said that just like apartheid laws that criminalized sexual relations between different races, laws against homosexuality “are increasingly becoming recognized as anachronistic and as inconsistent both with international law and with traditional values of dignity, inclusion and respect for all.”The opposing statement read in the General Assembly, supported by nearly 60 nations, rejected the idea that sexual orientation was a matter of genetic coding. The statement, led by the Organization of the Islamic Conference, said the effort threatened to undermine the international framework of human rights by trying to normalize pedophilia, among other acts.The Organization of the Islamic Conference also failed in a last-minute attempt to alter a formal resolution that Sweden sponsored condemning summary executions. It sought to have the words “sexual orientation” deleted as one of the central reasons for such killings.Ms. Yade and the Dutch foreign minister, Maxime Verhagen, said at a news conference that they were “disappointed” that the United States failed to support the declaration. Human rights activists went further. “The Bush administration is trying to come up with Christmas presents for the religious right so it will be remembered,” said Scott Long, a director at Human Rights Watch.The official American position was based on highly technical legal grounds. The text, by using terminology like “without distinction of any kind,” was too broad because it might be interpreted as an attempt by the federal government to override states’ rights on issues like gay marriage, American diplomats and legal experts said.“We are opposed to any discrimination, legally or politically, but the nature of our federal system prevents us from undertaking commitments and engagements where federal authorities don’t have jurisdiction,” said Alejandro D. Wolff, the deputy permanent representative.Gay-rights advocates brought to the conference from around the world by France said just having the taboo broken on discussing the topic at the United Nations would aid their battles at home. “People in Africa can have hope that someone is speaking for them,” said the Rev. Jide Macaulay of Nigeria.'"
"'08-12-19,'0','The property tax increase comes as Gov. David A. Paterson is pushing more than 100 new taxes and fees on items from downloaded music to nondiet sodas, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is moving to impose fare and toll increases.Manhattan homeowners who live in the most expensive co-ops will see their taxes go up by anywhere from $854 to $1,307, according to the city’s Independent Budget Office. People who own single-family homes valued between $1 million and $1.5 million, outside of Manhattan, can expect to pay an extra $464 per year. Taxes on more modest homes, such as a condominium in Queens in the $300,000 to $400,000 range, would rise by $111.To help ease the pain, Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn announced that Mr. Bloomberg had agreed to send homeowners the much-prized $400 rebate checks by the end of the calendar year.The mayor had tried to eliminate the checks this year, then delay their distribution, but council members animatedly objected.In addition, the Council approved an increase in the hotel tax from 5 percent to 5.875 percent per room, or about $3 a night. That change is expected to generate perhaps $80 million between March and the end of the next fiscal year, in June 2010.Still, no one was under any illusions that the increased taxes would be the last financially difficult decision in the foreseeable future.Mr. Bloomberg, who in September ordered all city agencies to cut spending by 5 percent, asked that they come up with an additional 7 percent in cuts by Dec. 22. And even with those cuts, and the extra revenue from higher taxes, the city is still facing a budget deficit of more than $1 billion in the next fiscal year.The vote on Thursday — a close one by City Hall standards — was the latest political victory for Mr. Bloomberg.He had unveiled his budget proposals just two weeks after the most bruising political battle in recent memory: the Council’s approval of his bid to rewrite the city’s term limits law, allowing him to seek a third term.And his attempt to withhold the property tax rebate checks met with fierce condemnation from council members who portrayed Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire many times over, as out of touch with the voters’ financial situation.In recent days, though, with the help of Ms. Quinn, the Bloomberg administration began changing the minds of council members. It certainly did not hurt that the thrust of Mr. Bloomberg’s arguments was echoed when Governor Paterson presented his own bleak budget, filled with projected budget cuts in city funds. Nor did it hurt that the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., a Democrat who is running for mayor, issued his own economic forecast this week.Technically, Thursday’s vote repeals a tax cut of 7 percent that had been set to expire in June.In a statement after Thursday’s vote, Mr. Bloomberg said: “It’s never popular to phase out a tax cut or reduce agency spending, but they are the right choices to avoid far greater and longer-lasting pain. We will not repeat the mistakes of the 1970s, which crippled city finances and nearly destroyed our quality of life.”Councilman David I. Weprin of Queens said there were no plans, for now, to raise property taxes again in the next fiscal year.“There is an unofficial agreement with the administration that they will not be coming back to us in June for an additional property tax increase,” he said. “Obviously, things could always change, but that was the general agreement as of now, by taking this tough vote midyear that we will not be asked to take another larger increase.”The familiar dance between Mr. Bloomberg and the Council over the budget requires him to support some spending sought by the Council to win members’ backing. In this case, Ms. Quinn said that the Council was able to persuade Mr. Bloomberg to refrain from cutting approximately $20 million from a variety of programs, in exchange for adopting the Council’s recommendations for $20 million worth of other cuts.As a result, Mr. Bloomberg does not plan to cancel the next training class for more than 1,100 police cadets; instead, there will be two smaller classes of 250 cadets apiece in January and June.In addition, the deal means that the mayor will not cut $2.5 million from City University of New York and community colleges for student services and research. Nor will he slice $3.7 million from the Administration for Children’s Services, which would have eliminated 127 caseworkers. Instead, Ms. Quinn said, the city will save $13 million by relying on in-house staff members and not consultants to do work on capital projects, as well as $3 million through a drop in fuel expenses.There were also a few examples of city officials trying to make the additional taxes a little less onerous. Under a Bloomberg proposal, people who own properties valued at $250,000 or less can pay quarterly rather than semi-annually. Those people will also be given a 15-day grace period for payments due in January.'"
"'08-12-19,'0','Many retailers have a simple policy regarding merchandise: you break it, you buy it. Credit Suisse is adopting a similar idea by paying its top bankers with the equivalent of broken inventory — those dodgy, illiquid assets that the Swiss bank accumulated on its balance sheet during the credit boom. That is a bonus for shareholders.But why would the bank’s senior staff be willing to accept this? After all, you can’t make the Maserati payments next year with units in Credit Suisse’s new Partner Asset Facility. Managing directors and directors will receive as much as 80 percent of their deferred compensation in this form.The answer is simple: They stand to make a healthy return a few years down the road. How healthy? Do the arithmetic. The assets have already been written down to about 65 cents on the dollar. The bet is that these loans will be worth far more than that over the lifetime of the facility, expected to be about eight years. To juice up the returns, Credit Suisse will provide leverage of as much as seven times equity.For the first five years of the facility, the asset carries a nominal coupon of about 4 percent a year. Again, that won’t pay the country club fees. But say a banker receives units worth $500,000 today. If the assets are eventually sold or are paid back to the tune of 80 cents on the dollar, the securities would be worth $1.4 million, according to calculations by breakingviews.com. If they are dollar good, meaning they pay back the full face value of the securities, then the units would be worth $2.7 million.Shareholders, having already taken their lumps for writing down the securities in the facility, might be furious if they see employees profiting too handsomely. So the bank is seeking to offer them a chance to purchase the units as well.Zero is a hard number to understand. In multiplication, it turns other values to nothing. In division, it turns them to infinity. In finance, it turns the world upside down. No wonder investors are dizzy.'"
"'08-12-19,'0','In 2007, the people who ran Wall Street, and the ones who regulated it, did not understand how serious the financial crisis was becoming. They saw the primary problem as one of a housing slowdown caused by a subprime mortgage crisis, and assumed the securitization machine — which had come to finance everything from corporate loans to credit cards to student loans — would keep on ticking even if its mortgage factory could keep operating only with the government guaranteeing almost everything.In 2008, the government effectively nationalized Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the American International Group, and it bailed out those who had lent to Bear Stearns. It let Lehman Brothers fail, briefly reassuring market ideologues but terrifying many market participants, and the rout was on.The securitization machine ground to a halt, and the banking industry was in no position to assume its historical role as a lender that patiently waited for loans to be repaid. To the contrary, banks trusted neither their own balance sheets nor those of other banks. For a significant part of the economy, the government became the lender of first and only resort.For most of 2008, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury failed to realize that the banking system faced a solvency crisis rather than a liquidity crisis. Liquidity-providing moves proved ineffectual because no one had confidence in the values of enormous amounts of derivatives and securitizations that the banks owned.“No financial market can function normally when basic information about the solvency of market participants is lacking,” wrote Michael D. Bordo, a Rutgers economist.A year ago, China and India were supposed to be the engines that kept the world economy moving forward even if the United States was applying the brakes. Now people worry that rising unemployment could lead to political instability in the Asian giants.A year ago, most economists — including the people setting Fed policy — thought the American economy could avoid a recession. Now they have concluded that one was already starting as 2007 ended, and the optimists think it will last for six more months.With commodity prices collapsing, and consumers feeling poor and expecting jobs to vanish, the inflation rate went from alarming to negative and the Fed cut the short-term rate it controls almost to zero.The rate on 10-year Treasuries fell to a little over 2 percent, something not seen since Eisenhower was in the White House. But an index of junk-bond yields soared to more than 17 percent, just a little below the record level set during 1990, the last time the banking system appeared to be ready to collapse. Money is cheap for the government and unavailable to those who need it most.The multiple ways being used by the Fed and the Treasury to push out cash mean the government will end up with a lot of assets of questionable value. That amounts to printing money, and economists worry that if the Fed is unwilling or unable to tighten when things turn up, that could lead to rampant inflation.There could be a significant political constituency for inflation by then. If the problem is that your house is not worth what you owe on it, a good dose of inflation could produce a solution by raising the nominal value while not changing the amount you owe.In normal times, after a recession ends and inflationary pressures build, the Fed tightens by selling Treasury bills for cash, a move that sucks cash out of the economy.After this recession, its balance sheet may be heavy with mortgage securities and perhaps even corporate debt, and the Fed may have to sell them, rather than nice safe T-bills, to tighten credit. That could work out nicely if economic recovery has by then made those mortgage securities appear to be safe and reliable. That is one bet the Fed is making by taking on assets it never would have considered in the past.It is in booms that the seeds of busts are created, and the heroes of one era can be the villains of the next. The securitization machine that is so vilified today played a major role in greasing the boom that preceded it.That can even be true of people. One reason for the development of the great bull markets of the 1980s and 1990s was the freeing of investors from high fixed trading costs. To many — including some regulators — much of the credit for that went to a feisty trader who found ways to maneuver around the system and let investors and speculators trade for less. His name was Bernard L. Madoff.Four decades after he started that fight, which made him rich as his firm became the largest player in the Nasdaq stock market, Mr. Madoff admitted that his later success as a money manager was all a fraud. He estimated the losses in his Ponzi scheme at $50 billion.The disclosure of that fraud came on the heels of the arrest of Marc S. Dreier, a well-known New York corporate lawyer who had gotten hedge funds to lend many millions to real companies they believed to be Mr. Dreier’s clients. The cash actually went to him.The falls of both men may be due in part to the sudden need for hedge funds to come up with cash to pay nervous investors. It is during bear markets that the follies of the previous bull markets become starkly apparent.This is my last column of 2008, as I head off to vacation. Given how badly the forecasts for 2008 worked out, it would seem foolhardy to offer any for 2009. But one seems clear to me: One of the most important tasks for the new administration’s economic team is to put together a financial system that will be able to grant credit and pay for investments when the recession nears an end.If they fail to accomplish that, and are unable to couple it with a regulatory system that will neither smother innovation nor let it run wild, then the commentaries a year from now will be even more downcast than those appearing as this year draws to its sad conclusion.'"
"'08-12-19,'0','A civil rights legal advocacy group, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, filed an unusual international petition Thursday accusing the United States of failing to adequately protect Latinos living within its borders, regardless of citizenship.The claim was filed with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an organ of the Organization of American States, of which the United States is a founding member. It charges that the United States is failing to live up to the group’s declaration on human rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man.It cites violence against Latinos, including the murders over the past five months of three immigrants: José Sucuzhañay in Brooklyn last week, Marcelo Lucero in the Long Island town of Patchogue on Nov. 8, and Luis Ramirez in Shenandoah, Pa., on July 14. In all three cases, prosecutors say the assailants used anti-Latino slurs. Hate-crime attacks on Latinos rose 40 percent between 2003 and 2007, the petition says, citing the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The complaint also cites the rising use of agreements that allow local communities to deputize their police forces to carry out immigration law. They were created after Sept. 11, 2001, to increase cooperation between local police departments and federal immigration authorities.The group argues that deputization leads the police to treat all Latinos as suspects of immigration violations, engenders mistrust of the police among Latinos, divides communities and promotes a belief that Latinos can be attacked with impunity. The complaint notes that such an ordinance was adopted in Shenandoah and was under consideration in Suffolk County, where Patchogue is situated.The United States has not recognized the commission’s decisions as binding, but has sometimes responded to them in the diplomatic arena, lawyers at LatinoJustice say. In order for the petition to go forward, the commission must determine that the plaintiffs have exhausted all domestic legal remedies.'"
"'08-12-19,'0','WASHINGTON — The Bush administration, as expected, announced new protections on Thursday for health care providers who oppose abortion and other medical procedures on religious or moral grounds.“Doctors and other health care providers should not be forced to choose between good professional standing and violating their conscience,” Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of Health and Human Services, said in a statement on his department’s Web site.The rule prohibits recipients of federal money from discriminating against doctors, nurses and health care aides who refuse to take part in procedures because of their convictions, and it bars hospitals, clinics, doctors’ office and pharmacies from forcing their employees to assist in programs and activities financed by the department.“This rule protects the right of medical providers to care for their patients in accord with their conscience,” Mr. Leavitt said.The Bush administration had signaled its intention to issue the measures, which are part of a flurry of regulations it is announcing before President-elect Barack Obama takes office. The new president will be able to undo the regulations, and is virtually certain to, given his previous comments on the issue. But undoing them will be a time-consuming process.'"
"'08-12-19,'0','These officials said the preferred solution would be to force a restructuring of the industry outside of bankruptcy court, extracting concessions that would make the companies more cost-competitive with foreign automakers.In return, the Treasury would tap the financial rescue fund, called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, to make loans to the companies.After a week of talks between the automakers and the Treasury Department over the terms of a possible bailout, Ms. Perino on Thursday said, “we’re very close.”President Bush, speaking on Thursday at the American Enterprise Institute, an organization dedicated to free market principles, said that he had determined that the economy was too fragile to allow G.M. and Chrysler to fail. The companies have warned that will happen if they do not receive financial aid soon.In his speech Thursday, Mr. Bush made clear that he wanted to avoid a “disorderly bankruptcy” because of “what it would do to the psychology of the markets.” But he also said he was “worried about putting good money after bad,” and suggested he would only approve a plan that allowed the auto companies to “become viable in the future.”Mr. Bush’s comments, a month before he leaves office, made clear that he was worried by the idea of returning to Texas amid more economic chaos and the surge in unemployment that a collapse of the companies could cause.“The autos obviously are very fragile,” he said. He added that he was concerned about what President-elect Barack Obama would face on Jan. 20. “I believe that good policy is not to dump him a major catastrophe in his first day of office,” he said.What the White House appears to be envisaging is a package deal of concessions — and an injection of money from the TARP, the $700 billion financial bailout fund — to keep credit flowing for G.M. and Chrysler.Taxpayer loans, the White House has said, would have first priority over all other debt. Ms. Perino said the goal was to “try to come up with something that would protect the taxpayers but not allow a collapse that would hurt everybody in America.”But for Mr. Bush, that could be difficult to negotiate. If the autoworkers’ unions conclude they are likely to get a better deal from Mr. Obama, they are likely to stall negotiations and settle for a shorter-term loan.After the White House raised the possibility of a bankruptcy, G.M.’s shares fell to $3.66.Investors may have also been reacting to a report in The Wall Street Journal that said G.M. had restarted merger discussions with Chrysler. But a G.M. spokesman, Tony Cervone, said the automaker had not held any talks with Chrysler since late October, when G.M. suspended discussions because of its bleak financial condition. “Nothing has changed,” he said.G.M. declined to comment on the Bush administration’s suggestion that an “orderly bankruptcy” was under consideration. But the company was surprised by the White House statements, according to G.M. officials who asked not to be identified because the discussions with the administration were not yet final.The automaker’s senior executives have said repeatedly that bankruptcy was not a viable solution because consumers would be reluctant to buy a vehicle from a bankrupt automaker.In July, CNW Marketing Research said a survey it conducted showed that 80 percent of prospective car buyers would not consider purchasing a vehicle from a bankrupt company. A more recent survey found that 51 percent of the people it interviewed said they would not buy a car from G.M. even if it received a government bailout.“G.M. cannot afford to lose half of its prospective customers,” said Art Spinella, CNW’s president.Spokesmen for Chrysler and Ford also declined to comment specifically on the inclusion of bankruptcy as an alternative.Chrysler’s chairman, Robert L. Nardelli, has said that getting financing to reorganize in bankruptcy would be difficult given tight credit conditions. Ford is not seeking immediate government help.There was no immediate comment from the United Automobile Workers union.In a traditional bankruptcy proceeding, the U.A.W.’s contracts could be voided and the union forced to renegotiate benefits like health care.The union’s president, Ron Gettelfinger, has said the U.A.W. is willing to make concessions if G.M. or Chrysler gets government loans that help them survive.But Mr. Gettelfinger has said he believes that bankruptcy would cripple either company’s ability to sell cars. “There’s no question in my mind that people would not buy their vehicles,” he said in an interview.Both companies are cutting production to stretch their available cash. On Friday, Chrysler will begin an unusual monthlong shutdown of all of its North American manufacturing plants in a bid to save money.Legal experts said Thursday that despite discussion of an out-of-court solution, a revamping of G.M. and Chrysler might be difficult to accomplish outside of bankruptcy court, given the significant steps an overhaul would require.“It’s not going to be easy, it’s not going to be pleasant, or palatable, but it’s the only solution that makes the least bit of sense,” said Hugh M. Ray, head of the bankruptcy practice at the Houston law firm Andrews Kurth, who has participated in major bankruptcy cases.If the companies were to file for bankruptcy, major banks would provide financing, with federal funds as security for the bank loans for the companies to operate.Some lawyers have suggested that the two companies could receive $25 billion, using $5 billion in federal funds to guarantee the banks’ loans, although auto industry analysts said the companies might need more.G.M. has retained Harvey R. Miller, a longtime bankruptcy lawyer, as its adviser. It is also being advised by William Repko, an expert in restructuring with Evercore Partners who has worked with companies like United Airlines. G.M. is also working with Arthur B. Newman of the Blackstone Group.Chrysler has retained the law firm of Jones Day to provide revamping expertise.Mr. Ray said that a number of airlines went through bankruptcy protection earlier this decade, using federally backed loans awarded by the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which was set up to aid the industry after the September 2001 attacks.The board turned down United’s request, however, and the airline subsequently restructured under bankruptcy protection without federal money.“United is still flying, and G.M. is not doing very well,” Mr. Ray said. “Their chickens have come home to roost, and now it’s inevitable” that G.M. seek bankruptcy protection, he added.'"

"'08-12-20,'0','Ms. Alexander, 46, is the incoming chairwoman of the African-American studies department at Yale and the mother of two sons, 9 and 10. She writes often of race, gender and class, in both poetry and prose, nurtures young black poets through Cave Canem, a poetry workshop, and has been a friend of Mr. Obama for more than a decade.Asked if she thought that the friendship played a role in her being picked for the inauguration, she said no. The Obamas have many friends and know other poets, she said.“One of the things we’ve seen with every choice he’s made is that it’s based on what he perceives as excellence,” Ms. Alexander said. “I don’t think you would let friendship determine who you chose to do something like this. You can do lots of things to be nice to your friends — you can invite them to an inaugural ball. But I don’t think friends have to do each other this kind of favor.”Ms. Alexander was born in Harlem, where her father’s family was rooted, but grew up in Washington, where she attended Georgetown Day School and Sidwell Friends, then Yale. Politics, she said, was “in the drinking water in my house.” Her father, Clifford, was a civil rights adviser to President Lyndon B. Johnson and was instrumental in the passage of the Voting Rights Act. He was the first black to be named secretary of the Army and chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.Her mother, Adele, teaches African-American women’s history at George Washington University. Her brother, Mark, teaches at Seton Hall Law School and served as policy director to Bill Bradley’s presidential campaign in 2000. An expert in campaign finance, he was a senior adviser to Mr. Obama’s campaign and is a member of his transition team.Ms. Alexander has been on the faculty of several universities, including the University of Chicago, where she taught creative writing and African-American literature and won the Quantrell Award for excellence in undergraduate teaching. It is there in the 1990s that she met Barack and Michelle Obama.“We’re of the exact same generation,” she said. “They are people with whom I have a lot in common.”There was some question about whether Mr. Obama would include a poet at all in his inaugural program. There have been only three: Robert Frost in 1961, Maya Angelou in 1993 and Miller Williams in 1997.Mr. Obama has not said publicly why he wanted a poet or why he chose Ms. Alexander. But Emmett Beliveau, the executive director of Mr. Obama’s inaugural committee, said that having a poet shows “the important role that the arts and literature can play in helping to bring our country together” and that Ms. Alexander “is an incredibly accomplished author and academic.”Paul Muldoon, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet who teaches at Princeton and is poetry editor of The New Yorker, said he guessed that Ms. Alexander was chosen on “literary merit.” He said her work “addresses a wide range of issues with terrific complexity.”And Ms. Angelou said that when she heard of Ms. Alexander’s selection, she smiled. “She seems much like Walt Whitman,” she said. “She sings the American song.”Ms. Alexander said she believes her poetry “attends to history,” including “sometimes thorny and difficult American history,” even as it speaks in contemporary moments and landscapes.And she said Mr. Obama is attuned to the value of poetry. “He has said the precise and distilled and mindful language of poetry is perhaps something that can create a moment of meditation for us,” she said.After examining previous inaugural poems, she has decided that hers will be brief. “This is one small piece of many pieces and we know what the centerpiece is,” she said, referring to Mr. Obama’s inaugural address.“President-elect Obama is extremely efficient with language,” she added. “It is tremendously rich and tremendously precise but also never excessive. I really, really admire that. That’s a poet’s sensibility. I’m going to follow his lead.”'"

"'08-12-20,'0','Our system of commerce and government is flawed, perhaps fatally. Chief executives have been hiring their friends to be on their boards of directors. And, as we know, friends take care of friends.What has happened over many decades is that the rich and powerful have become richer and more powerful by peddling their influence to our lawmakers.How do we fix it? I haven’t got a clue, but neither does anyone else. The difference is, those in charge won’t admit it!I didn’t think it was possible for anyone, with the current state of the economy, to still extol the ostensible virtues of laissez-faire economics. But Roger Cohen has proved me wrong.Don’t rescue the auto companies, says Mr. Cohen, lest we drain the vitality out of American capitalism.Excuse me? What vitality? Has he not noticed that we are entering a deflationary spiral? The loss of hundreds of thousands more jobs would drive aggregate demand down even further, creating yet more job losses, feeding the vicious circle yet further until we land right in the middle of another Great Depression.It’s ironic in current debates about the economic crisis that those most wedded to the utopian view of laissez-faire capitalism are those who would nearly ensure — however unwittingly — its destruction.Roger Cohen, in questioning the wisdom of saving our car companies, is still thinking in the old laissez-faire paradigm. That dog don’t hunt anymore!“What I predict is the imminent disintegration of the global capitalist system,” George Soros warned 10 years ago in “The Crisis of Global Capitalism.” Even though Mr. Soros took back his forecast later on, what he predicted is happening now: the market system has failed, and the dominoes are falling.Germany, following the old thinking, is blocking the fire engines trying to save Europe’s economy. Paul Krugman has explained the worldwide consequences of that folly, along with the similar stakes if we let our automakers fail.'"
"'08-12-20,'0','With all the children, grandchildren, spouses, siblings and even cousins serving in Congress, it can sometime seem that politics is just another family business, and a House or Senate seat just another heirloom to pass on.“It might be good to put Roman numerals after their names like English royalty to distinguish them from their forebearers,” said Ross K. Baker, a Congressional expert at . “American politics is much more based on lineage than one would expect in a Democratic government.”Mr. Begich, whose father was killed in a plane crash while campaigning in 1972, said that during an appearance this year with Representative , a newly elected senator from , they realized their fathers had served in the House together. Mr. Udall’s father was Representative Morris K. Udall, the lawmaker and wit from .Mark Udall has other family links as well. His first cousin is , a newly elected senator from whose own father, Stewart Udall, joined the House before his brother, Morris.The advantages of being from a successful political family are obvious. Name identification is one of the most valuable commodities in politics, and there is often a solid network already in place. It is good to run as a Kennedy, for instance, even though discovered via the 2002 race for governor that it is no guarantee of victory.In Caroline Kennedy’s case, the desire to hold a Kennedy place in the Senate could be a consideration. Since the election of her father in 1952, there has been at least one Kennedy in the upper chamber for nearly all of the ensuing 56 years. With the health of Ms. Kennedy’s uncle, Senator of , uncertain due to brain , the Kennedy streak could be at risk.Other factors certainly drive a family inclination toward politics, not the least of which is a desire for public service. And there is the natural tendency to emulate a parent, or a parental bent to engineer a political career for a child.Mr. Begich pointed out that even though he was currently the only family member elected to public office (his mother lost two House races), other siblings were active in education and other public-interest fields. “It is that whole community service thing that is instilled in you by your parents,” he said.In addition, widows of members of Congress are often looked to as likely successors. Hence the cases of Jo Ann Emerson of , and Lois Capps and Doris Matsui, both of — three current examples of spouses who were elected to succeed their husbands. And Niki Tsongas last year was elected to the Massachusetts House seat that her husband, former Senator , who died in 1997, held earlier in his career.Relatives of politicians are often steeped in politics themselves, managing campaigns, doing legwork and seeing the political world from the inside. It naturally gives them a leg up and can fuel their own ambition. That may have been a factor in stoking the political fires of Senator-elect of , who helped in the campaigns of her uncle, , a former Florida senator and governor.“I would imagine a kid growing up in a political household is going to know a lot about politics,” said Mr. Baker, the Rutgers political scientist.Indeed, Ms. Murkowski was in the eighth grade when her father, who later became a senator and governor (and appointed her to the Senate in 2002), lost to the father of Senator-elect Begich. She remembers that she and her siblings ran the campaign’s mail operation out of the family’s unfinished basement.Ms. Murkowski said she was not a believer in a “political gene” that contributed to a family interest in politics. She takes the view that being the offspring or relative of a politician can demystify what can be an impenetrable, intimidating business to an outsider. Like many American children, she figured, how hard can it be if your parent can do it?“When you are around politics, you realize there is nothing that special about being a politician or a policy maker,” Ms. Murkowski said. “When you are in that environment, when you are younger and exposed to it, you look at it and say, ‘I could do that.’ ”'"
"'08-12-20,'0','The longest tether goes to N.F.L. coaches, who have occupied their offices for an average of 4.34 seasons. Two coaches — Jeff Fisher of Tennessee (since 1994) and Mike Shanahan of Denver (since 1995) — skew the average, but the median (2.88) is still higher than in the other sports.Major League Baseball waddles in the middle of this pack. Its managers have an average tenure of 3.78 seasons, a relatively cushy number skewed by Bobby Cox’s nearly 19-year run in Atlanta. The median checks in at exactly two seasons.Baseball was relatively quiet with in-season firings, except for one bloody week in June when the Mets’ Willie Randolph, the Mariners’ John McLaren and the Blue Jays’ John Gibbons were fired. Then in the middle of September, with his team clinging to a playoff position, Ned Yost was dismissed by the Brewers.The numbers are not a completely scientific look at the issue. They are more a snapshot of the current situation, in which the N.B.A. has earned its reputation with a rash of dismissals. Not only have Sacramento’s Theus, Washington’s Eddie Jordan, Minnesota’s Randy Wittman, Philadelphia’s Maurice Cheeks, Toronto’s Sam Mitchell and Oklahoma City’s P. J. Carlesimo already taken a fall, but there was also turnover in eight jobs last off-season. The six coaches had a combined 578-801 record in the jobs from which they were fired.In contrast, the N.F.L. had just four coaching changes between the 2007 and 2008 seasons, and three coaches were fired midseason.The revolving door in Oakland continued to spin: Lane Kiffin became the latest object of Al Davis’s ire. Across the bay, Mike Nolan was fired as coach of the San Francisco 49ers, and in St. Louis, the Rams fired Scott Linehan after four consecutive losses to begin the season. That number is actually high for the N.F.L., where the fewer number of games relative to the other sports as well as the complexity of the coaching make in-season moves rare.“Football is the most complicated of the sports, with the most complicated systems,” said Charley Casserly, the former general manager of two N.F.L. teams. “In football the system is dictated by the head coach. If you make a change, it takes a long time to develop a new system. So when it’s not working, you ask, do we give it more time? The nature of the game dictates that coaches coach longer.”Gil Brandt, a former Cowboys talent scout, said current coaches, though, might be in for a tougher road. The four teams that changed coaches in the off-season have boosted their total number of victories to 34 this season from 19 last season.“Owners, when they see success, they want to emulate it,” Brandt said. “So new coaches may be facing higher expectations.”In the N.B.A. and the N.H.L, the seasons are much longer and so many teams make the playoffs — 8 of 15 in each conference — even small improvements can push a struggling team into playoff contention, so the temptation to change coaches is strong. The idea is that a new voice, a change in personality, can be enough to solve some of a team’s problems.“There is going to be conflict,” Tortorella said. “I don’t think it is a bad thing. You work through the bumps and become a tighter team. But some owners are not willing to go through that, and the coach is out the door.”The N.H.L. has motored along with a steady clip of coaching casualties. Tampa Bay hired and fired Barry Melrose before most people realized he was no longer an ESPN analyst. Chicago gave Denis Savard all of four games this season before sending him to the curb. Carolina raised some eyebrows with the dismissal of Peter Laviolette, who led them to a Stanley Cup in 2006.The lesson is, if you coach a professional hockey or basketball team, do not get too comfortable.Unless you are Jerry Sloan.'"

"'08-12-20,'0','“We have a strong relationship with the U.A.W.,” said Mark Truby, the Ford spokesman. “We’re going to continue to work to completely close the competitive gap with foreign transplants.”By eschewing any federal assistance, Ford runs the risk of falling behind G.M. and Chrysler if those two companies can wrest concessions from the union and Ford cannot.But it’s a risk that Ford and its chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, are willing and able to take.Ford has its share of problems. It lost more than $8 billion this year, and its United States sales have fallen by 19 percent through November. The total industry, by comparison, is down 16 percent.Even so, Ford has more cash on hand than its larger rival G.M. — $18.9 billion at the end of the third quarter, compared with $16.2 billion for G.M. And Ford has a backstop of a $10.8 billion line of credit with banks that it negotiated in 2006.At the time, industry analysts saw Ford’s mortgaging of its assets to get the line of credit as a sign of desperation.Now it appears to be a smart move that separates Ford from its Detroit rivals, which have been shut out of the tight credit market and forced to borrow from the government.“Whether it was lucky or planned, the decision to borrow the money has turned out to be a huge positive for Ford,” said John Casesa, principal in the auto consulting firm Casesa Shapiro Group.Although it did not ask for emergency aid from Washington, Ford’s executives breathed a sigh of relief Friday that G.M. and Chrysler were given loans to survive into next year.A bankruptcy by either G.M. or Chrysler could have started a domino effect of financial failures at parts manufacturers that supply Ford as well.“All of us at Ford appreciate the prudent step the administration has taken to address the near-term liquidity issues of G.M. and Chrysler,” Mr. Mulally said in a statement.Ford has said it hopes that if another round of industry loans is approved next year by the Obama administration, it could get a $9 billion line of credit as a safeguard against a further deterioration of the economy.By not taking government loans now, Ford can legitimately portray itself as the healthiest of Detroit’s automakers, and could possibly capitalize on that status in the marketplace.One study showed that Ford benefited during October and November from G.M.’s financial plight.“Ford definitely gained some sales during that time because of its financial situation,” said Art Spinella, president of the firm CNW Research.The automaker’s chairman, William C. Ford Jr., has said that Ford is now in a position to lead the industry in its transition to more fuel-efficient cars.Mr. Ford said in an interview last month that Ford hoped to be the model for Detroit’s recovery and to work closely on strategic initiatives favored by President-elect Barack Obama.“I do feel we have a great plan that is completely in sync with where the country and the new administration would like us to go,” Mr. Ford said.The company has several important vehicle introductions planned next year, including a redesigned version of the Taurus sedan.Once a strong competitor to the top-selling Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, the Taurus became an also-ran in the midsize car segment when Ford devoted most of its energies to pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.Ford has also accelerated plans to bring many of its small passenger cars from Europe for sale in the United States market.'"
"'08-12-20,'0','WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department said on Friday that it had used up the first $350 billion that Congress approved for its financial bailout program. But it made no move to ask Congress for the next round of money.Instead, administration officials signaled that they were unlikely to ask for the money until at least January, when Congress returns with stronger Democratic majorities in both chambers. They may well punt on the issue and leave it for President-elect Barack Obama, who will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20.House and Senate Democrats said they did not expect the administration to ask for additional money until early January, and administration officials reinforced that impression by saying they were not in any rush.“We have no time frame,” said Michele A. Davis, a spokeswoman for the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr. “Because some of the allocated funds from the first $350 billion won’t go out the door for a few weeks, we feel that right now we have the resources we need.”For at least the last month, Mr. Paulson has been dancing around the issue of asking Congress for the rest of the money for the bailout program, which is officially known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Among other ideas that he has been studying is a plan to buy up billions of dollars in federally guaranteed mortgages to bring mortgage rates down to 4.5 percent.'"

Nor did she vote in the general election of 1994, when Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose Senate seat Ms. Kennedy now aspires to fill, was elected to his fourth and last term.But Ms. Kennedy did vote in the city’s general elections in 1997 and 2005.

The measure failed overwhelmingly.Details of Ms. Kennedy’s voting records were reported Thursday in The Daily News and The New York Post.“Caroline Kennedy recognizes just how important it is to vote and has a very strong record of going to the polls,” said a spokesman for Ms. Kennedy, Stefan Friedman. “She has not voted on a handful of occasions over the last two decades.”'"
"'08-12-20,'0','It did not help. Harris and Vince Carter, who had 34 points and 10 rebounds, alternated scoring throughout the night.“There was a little something extra in the tank tonight,” Harris said. “But I think anybody would be lying if they said they didn’t want to play well against their old team.”Harris also had 13 assists and made five 3-pointers.It was anyone’s guess to how the crowd would receive Kidd, 35, in his return.The debate ended when Kidd was warmly greeted. Some fans stood. Nearly all clapped. The announced crowd of 9,889 was a result of the sleet and snow and general lack of interest. Kidd waved and made a motion for the introductions to continue.“The first time I was in New Jersey, that’s what the crowd looked like,” Kidd said of the attendance figure. He later added, “I did everything I could here, so if they wanted to boo me, they had the right to boo me, and if they wanted to cheer me, then they had the right to cheer me.”The Kidd trade yielded Harris, role players, draft picks and a hint at a period of rebuilding that the Nets have so far staved off by staying competitive most evenings.“At the time, it was an emotional, tough thing,” Rod Thorn, the Nets’ president, said. “But after it happened, you move on and I think he did the same.”In nearly seven seasons here, Kidd played as if the ball were on a string, guiding the Nets to two finals appearances.The transformation is not lost on Carlisle, who served as an assistant to the Nets before Kidd’s arrival here.“This has been a tough place to get over the hump and I know because I worked here for five years,” he said, adding, “There were a lot of people who said it couldn’t be done in New Jersey, that you couldn’t ever get to the very top of the N.B.A. and be in a position to get into the finals and there’s one reason that they were and that’s Jason Kidd.”Time has helped heal this wound, as well as an increasingly improving Harris. And besides, Nets Coach Lawrence Frank can watch Kidd on television whenever he wants.“It’s not like we’re in different countries,” Frank said. “I see him every night on the League Pass.”On Friday, he saw him in person, equally eager to see him and greet him with a loss.The prospects seemed promising early when Harris and Carter hit consecutive 3-pointers, giving the Nets a 60-48 lead with 2 minutes 5 seconds remaining in the first half. It marked a large but early lead, similar to the 22-point advantage that they squandered Wednesday to the Utah Jazz.This time, the Nets clutched it safely, departing with hugs, a win and chants of “Thank you, Cuban,” from the crowd, referring to the Mavericks’ owner, Mark Cuban, who was at the game and engineered the trade.“I guess if you don’t care about your own team, you talk about somebody else on the other team,” Cuban said. “I guess that’s what Nets fans are all about. What do you want me to say? It’s pretty funny.”Jarvis Hayes returned after missing four games with a strained left hamstring and scored 14 points. ... Yi Jianlian had 16 points and 10 rebounds. ... Dirk Nowitzki led Dallas with 24 points and Jason Terry added 23.'"
"'08-12-20,'0','A federal district judge sentenced a man from Washington, Mo., to five years in prison on 23 counts involving the impersonation of a federal officer and posing as a contracting agent. As part of a deal with prosecutors, the man, William A.

Mr. Jakob, who last spring wielded a shotgun and fake badge as he led police officers from the small town of Gerald on a series of illegal drug raids, was also ordered to pay $30,000 in restitution to a former employer he defrauded. His deception came to an end in May when a newspaper reporter grew suspicious and alerted the authorities.'"
"'08-12-20,'0','THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) — In an elite field at the Chevron World Challenge that is loaded with players from the top 50 in the world ranking, Fred Couples can claim he belongs because of his age.He is still only 49.The oldest player at Sherwood Country Club, whose world ranking has fallen to No. 175, the ageless Couples continues to hang around some players half his age. Even with a mud-ball bogey on the final hole Friday, he had a three-under 69 to finish three shots behind Jim Furyk and stay in the mix.“I can hang around anybody,” Couples said. “Playing well is a shock.”Some might consider Furyk’s play to be surprising, given his lack of competition. Taking a break from his four-month vacation, Furyk was not nearly as crisp but he did not make any mistakes until the final hole on his way to a 71.Furyk was at five-under 139, two shots clear of Anthony Kim (70), Camilo Villegas (67) and K. J. Choi (71). Couples and Steve Stricker (71) were another shot behind.Couples was No. 1 in the world until his career was slowed considerably by back problems. It got so bad last year that he played only three times. Through it all, his raw talent has kept him in the picture. In playing only 18 times this year, he made nearly $1 million and easily kept his card.'"
"'08-12-20,'0','But for a few monastic New Yorkers — for whom asceticism is a virtue and courtside seats at a Knicks basketball game taboo (yes, the tickets would also be taxed) — life might go on more or less as usual.“If we want exercise, we walk, to meditate,” said Changwu Shi, 49, a Chinese Buddhist nun who lives at the Ch’an Meditation Center in Elmhurst, Queens. “But we don’t watch sports for entertainment.”Nor do they watch TV, which would help Ms. Shi save in the event that cable service is taxed, also part of the plan.Her shaved head obviates the need for any beauty-salon coiffures, another target for a state tax, on top of the one New York City already imposes.And though the sales-tax exemption on clothes that cost less than $110 could vanish, Ms. Shi isn’t concerned; her billowy gray-cotton robes are custom made in Taiwan and donated.But other, taxable versions could soon appear in couture shops.“I was walking in Manhattan and somebody in the fashion industry asked me if he could borrow it to study it, to make some of his own,” she said. (She agreed to lend him a robe.)All of Ms. Shi’s meals are vegetarian, in accordance with Chinese Buddhism. Vegetables for these meals are usually donated from members’ gardens, though Ms. Shi acknowledges an occasional supermarket visit.The Rev. Richard Roemer, 39, the director of the Roman Catholic Franciscan Friars of the Renewal in the Melrose section of the Bronx, on the other hand, never spends a penny on food.All of what he eats is donated to the group, which tries to emulate the poverty experienced by Jesus Christ. That means no movies, no video games and no gym memberships, which could translate into big savings, relatively speaking, if the Legislature approves the budget.“We might shop sometimes for the poor but never for us,” said Mr. Roemer, who also does not drink or smoke.And the taxi tax shouldn’t present too many problems; if he needs to go to Manhattan, Mr. Roemer will hop on a subway. (Unfortunately, while the governor will not tax mass transit, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a fare increase this week.)There is the issue of the friars’ donated car (a Toyota Tercel from sometime in the 1990s), which he occasionally drives. The fee to renew Mr. Roemer’s license could jump 25 percent. Gasoline taxes could rise, too.“It makes me feel sorry for people who have a lot of luxuries,” he said. “These kinds of issues remind me how grateful I am to live a simple and poor life.”What’s unclear, though, is how some of the proposed taxes might trickle down.Consumers could take a hit for regulatory fees imposed on the state’s utilities. In that case, Mr. Britten could see his Con Edison bill rise, say, for the two high-pressure sodium lamps that regularly illuminate the lotus-position resin likeness of Srila Prabhupada, the founder of the Hare Krishna movement, in his temple’s main room.Then again, the lamps don’t generate a lot of heat, so air conditioning, which can suck a lot of electricity, is not required.And what about increasing seed-dealer licensing fees? Will they translate into higher prices for the garlands of red and yellow roses that every day are placed around the statue’s neck?“The more you don’t have to deal with anything imposed upon us by material engagement,” he said, while standing by the statue, his hands clasped behind his back, “the more you can relieve yourself of stress.”'"
"'08-12-20,'0','John Schuerholz has vowed never again to do business with shortstop Rafael Furcal’s agents, whom Schuerholz accused in a newspaper interview of conducting “despicable” dealings with the team.Schuerholz, the president of the Atlanta Braves, and General Manager Frank Wren were quoted as saying the Wasserman Media Group negotiated dishonestly by taking the team’s signed terms of agreement sheet for Furcal to the Los Angeles Dodgers, who then reached a preliminary agreement Wednesday to re-sign Furcal.Wren has said he believed the request by the agent Paul Kinzer for a term sheet signed by the Braves meant an agreement had been reached.Schuerholz said he would never make an offer for any other player represented by the agency, which includes Kinzer and the agents Arn Tellem, Adam Katz and Joel Wolfe. Tellem heads the baseball practice.“Having been in this business for 40-some years, I’ve never seen anybody treated like that,” Schuerholz was quoted as saying in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Friday.'"
"'08-12-20,'0','Following is a statement issued Friday by Robert L. Nardelli, chief executive of Chrysler, on the White House announcement of federal aid for his company and General Motors:To Chrysler employees and other stakeholders:We have received news that U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson will provide $4 billion of initial funding to Chrysler LLC from the TARP (Troubled Assets Relief Program) as a loan to help bridge the current financial crisis. We appreciate the Administration’s confidence in Chrysler.As outlined in our submission to Congress, we intend to be accountable for this loan, including meeting the specific requirements set forth by the government, and will continue to implement our plan for long-term viability. The receipt of this loan means Chrysler can continue to pursue its vision to build the fuel-efficient, high-quality cars and trucks people want to buy, will enjoy driving and will want to buy again.For Chrysler to succeed in its mission to return to profitability, we need the continued support of our many business partners. Terms associated with the bridge loan include Chrysler’s commitment to work with key constituents  including our owners, lenders, suppliers, dealers, management and employees  to identify and achieve the cost-savings concessions we need to build a long-term viable enterprise. These concessions discussions will happen quickly, as a full governmental review and approval of our plan is expected by March 31, 2009.We are meeting with our suppliers, mindful that they are going through a difficult period as well. But we must cooperatively find ways to further reduce our costs while maintaining normal operations. We will ask our suppliers to maintain their commitment to reasonable trade terms and normal fulfillment of orders for as long as the federal loan is outstanding. This will assure that neither Chrysler, nor our suppliers would suffer the substantial losses caused by the plant/production shutdowns that result from stop shipments or other disruptions.We will seek continued dealer cooperation to improve our cash position and consolidate our U.S. network. Project Genesis is on the path to aligning our product portfolio with a smaller, healthier tri-branded dealer network based on the realities of our business environment. Because strong, healthy dealers are essential to our success, we are also working with our dealers to keep dealer inventories in line with the marketplace, focusing on how they can support their business despite the falloff in sales through sales of used vehicles, service and parts.'"
"'08-12-20,'0','A two-month rally in the price of government debt, which drove yields to record lows, abated slightly on Friday as credit markets continued to show signs of healing. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 14/32, to 114 14/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 2.12 percent, up from 2.08 percent late Thursday.Crude oil prices fell for another day on Friday amid signs that stockpiles were increasing while global consumption slipped as people drove less and construction projects halted. Oil futures settled at 33.87 a barrel, down more than 75 percent from their peak of $145 a barrel in July. The energy sector was the worst performer on Friday, and oil companies like Exxon, Chevron and BP all closed lower on falling oil prices.Shares of G.M., which have plunged by more than 80 percent this year as sales screeched to a halt and huge operating costs and legacy obligations drained cash, rebounded by 23 percent on news of the auto bailout. The Ford Motor Company gained 4 percent, although Ford said it was not taking the emergency government loans. Chrysler is not publicly traded.In a statement before the markets opened, Mr. Bush said the government would be providing $13.4 billion in emergency loans to G.M. and Chrysler, with the possibility of another $4 billion in February. He said that an “orderly bankruptcy” — an idea floated by the White House on Thursday — was not possible, but said the automakers needed to undergo a major overhaul to become viable.This fall, chief executives of Ford, Chrysler and G.M. made two trips to Congress to plead for a government rescue using money from the $700 billion bailout for financial companies. After the Senate refused to act on a plan, the White House stepped in.While the government loan will probably keep the lights on at Chrysler and G.M. and prevent an imminent bankruptcy, analysts said it was too soon to say whether the companies would be able to become self-sustaining, or whether they would need to petition the Obama administration for more assistance if the economy languishes in a recession throughout 2009.“Wouldn’t it be wonderful if it turned out to be enough,” said Dana Johnson, chief economist at Comerica Bank, who follows the auto industry. “But you have to think that that’s not the likeliest scenario.”Standard & Poor’s cut its credit ratings on 11 American and European financial institutions on Friday, reflecting concerns about their balance sheets and their future prospects amid stormy credit markets. Despite the downgrade, shares of the companies, which include JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, ended mixed.Citigroup fell farther than most banks, by 5 percent, after its banking subsidiary, Citibank, received rate cuts from both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Moody’s also cut Citigroup’s credit by two notches.“The agencies appear to have zapped away at least some of the holiday spirit that is already rather subdued,” the research firm CreditSights wrote in a note.'"
"'08-12-20,'0','TOKYO — The Japanese government has acknowledged for the first time that Allied prisoners during World War II were made to work at a coal mine owned by the family of Prime Minister Taro Aso, contradicting his longstanding denials.The admission came after the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, under prodding from an opposition lawmaker, released documents showing that 300 Australian, British and Dutch prisoners of war worked at a mine owned by Aso Mining during the last four months of the war.At a parliamentary session on Thursday, Foreign Ministry and health officials acknowledged the validity of the documents, about 43 pages retrieved from the basement of the Health Ministry building.The acknowledgment was another embarrassment for Mr. Aso, whose popularity has plummeted since he took office three months ago. His erratic stewardship over an increasingly shaky economy and insulting remarks about groups including the elderly have lowered his approval ratings to about 20 percent and drawn public attacks from his own Liberal Democratic Party.One of Japan’s wealthiest politicians, Mr. Aso, 67, has long denied what historians and survivors of his family’s coal mine have consistently said: that the mine, like many others, had used prisoners of war and forced laborers from Asia. In the 1970s, Mr. Aso was president of the family company, which is now called the Aso Group and is still run by his family.'"

The severe knee injury. And then there was the situation he and his team faced Saturday against Gonzaga: down by 3 points, then an offensive rebound, the ball finding his hands and leaving them and falling in the hoop with 8.2 seconds left.The basket forced overtime, leading the Huskies to an 88-83 victory over the Bulldogs in a game called the Battle in Seattle.“It couldn’t have come at a better time for me,” Price said. “I needed a breakout game.”Price’s career at Connecticut reads like a soap opera script. Before his freshman season, or at least what would have been his freshman season, he had a brain hemorrhage and missed a year.The university also suspended him one season for his involvement in stealing four computers, prompting Bulldogs fans to chant, “Where’s my laptop?” on Saturday. After emerging as an all-American candidate last season, Price tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in March.'"
"'08-12-21,'0','Not everyone is cut out for Foreign Service work, which can be stressful and highly demanding. About two-thirds of a diplomat’s career is spent overseas; officers usually move every two to four years and can be exposed to dangers like disease and war. The State Department offers a suitability quiz for prospective applicants on its Web site.Yet career diplomats like Ronald E. Neumann, a former ambassador to Afghanistan who now heads the American Academy of Diplomacy, called it the best job in the world. “I enjoy what I’m doing now but it’s nothing like working on foreign policy,” he said. “In my 37 years of service I may have gone home tired or frustrated with how a decision came out, but I never went home and asked myself if what I was working on was worthwhile.”Applying for a job with the State Department involves written and oral examinations. Those who pass the oral exam become conditional officers and receive a ranking score based on oral-exam performance and language skills. The higher the rank, the sooner they will be assigned.Of the 12,000 to 15,000 people who register annually for the written exam, about 450 officers are hired, said Frank J. Coulter, management officer with the Foreign Service and a member of the State Department’s board of examiners.The first time he took the written exam, Mr. Salazar failed, after running out of time during the essay portion. He was so determined to pass that he spent the next year writing an essay in 30 minutes every day. “When I took it the second time and got my results, it actually sent chills down my spine,” he said.New Foreign Service officers at the State Department choose one of five career tracks: consular affairs, economic affairs, management affairs, political affairs or public diplomacy. No matter the track, all entry-level officers spend their first several years working in a consulate, interviewing applicants for United States visas and working with American citizens who need their help.The State Department also hires Foreign Service specialists, who provide technical, security and administrative support overseas or in Washington. Specialists must pass an oral assessment but not a written exam, and start in a specialty like medicine, information technology or law enforcement, Mr. Coulter said. All newly hired officers and specialists are trained at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington.Each of the first two postings overseas last two years; after that, it is generally a three-year posting in each country. One-year hardship postings — in a region too dangerous to allow an officer’s spouse and children to accompany him or her — are required at least twice in the course of a career. After two assignments, Foreign Service personnel can bid on postings — requesting particular countries or Washington — but everyone is expected to serve in a variety of assignments, Mr. Arreaga said.Usaid’s entry-level Foreign Service officers must have a master’s degree in an appropriate technical area, like economics, agriculture, public health or education. The average Usaid entry-level officer has four years of relevant experience; many come from the Peace Corps, but others have worked for nongovernmental organizations, in private industry or the military.Thousands apply to Usaid each year and about 1 in 20 will be called for an interview, said Susan Riley, Usaid’s chief of Foreign Service personnel.Foreign Service officers with Usaid work on a range of projects, like assisting farmers in developing countries or working in programs to reduce the prevalence of diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.Last year, the agency kicked off its Development Leadership Initiative, a recruitment effort to hire more than 1,000 Foreign Service officers in the next two years. “This is the most that we’ve planned to hire above attrition in 15 years,” Ms. Riley said.THE base salary for entry-level Foreign Service officers ranges from about $40,000 to $72,000 annually, but compensation can increase depending on the danger level of the posting and on a region’s cost of living.For Foreign Service specialists, the salary range is anywhere from about $26,500 to more than $100,000; for civil service employees at Usaid, the salary ranges from $16,500 to over $100,000. Overseas benefits include housing and private school for dependent children.Many of those choosing Foreign Service work do so out of a dedication to public service and see it as not just a career, but also a way of life.Salman Khalil, hired in May, took a 50 percent cut in take-home pay to join the Foreign Service after a decade in the I.T. industry. Any day now he will leave for his first assignment, in India. “In my I.T. profession I was helping big companies make more money and it wasn’t satisfying for me,” he said. “What I wanted to do was serve in a capacity where I could directly help people.”'"
"'08-12-21,'0','Lehman had been bankrolling a number of hotel projects, including two in New York: the Nobu Hotel, partly owned by the actor Robert De Niro and set to rise in Lower Manhattan; and a Shangri-La hotel planned for Midtown. Work on both projects has halted. At Molasses Reef, Logwood had already spent about $200 million of Lehman’s money, Mr. Siegel said, and construction was about 75 percent complete.Bjorn Hanson, an associate professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, said he believed that of the hotel projects that stopped this year because of the credit crisis, fewer than 10 percent had already broken ground. But, he added, such projects have the potential to create countless disputes — with contractors over unpaid bills, with governments over taxes, with franchisors over fees, and even with neighbors concerned about the dangers posed by unsecured construction sites. (He said he was not familiar with the particular problems at Molasses Reef.)A newsletter published by the Molasses Reef developer before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy showed a pair of 52-foot yachts that would shuttle guests to and from the Turks and Caicos island of Providenciales. (Other guests would arrive by private plane or helicopter.) Room rates were expected to start at about $600 a night, and Gray Kunz, a celebrated New York chef, was slated to open three restaurants at the resort.Indeed, the hotel was going to be called a Ritz-Carlton Reserve. Simon F. Cooper, the president and chief operating officer of Ritz-Carlton, a division of Marriott International, described that title as denoting “signature, one-of-a-kind boutique resorts located in choice settings, each with a distinctive personality and sense of place.”The resort was to include the hotel and 75 Ritz-Carlton-brand villas, with prices starting at $2.6 million. Lehman was both a part-owner of the project and its main lender, according to Mr. Siegel and Karim Alibhai, the founder and principal of the Gencom Group. Gencom, based in Miami, is the controlling partner of Logwood.Mr. Alibhai said Gencom had weathered crises before, but that this was a “very unfortunate situation that no textbook could have prepared us for.” He added, a bit ruefully, that “the only lender that ended up going bankrupt, out of all the lenders, is Lehman Brothers.”Lehman had already disbursed about $200 million for construction of the hotel, Mr. Siegel said.“But you don’t get all the money at once,” he explained. “Each month, you’d put in a draw request for the next $22 million or $18 million or $20 million, and then you’d pay that month’s bills.”He said that there were no warning signs before the process came to an abrupt halt three months ago. “The people we were dealing with at Lehman were as surprised as we were,” he added. The project quickly went into what he called suspension mode.Mr. Siegel, who divides his time between New York and Turks and Caicos, now has to ensure that the buildings are secured before construction can begin again. “Right now we’ve got to batten down the hatches,” he said. He said he hopes construction will resume in 90 to 180 days, but “that’s just an optimistic guy talking.”“Right now,” he added, “we have no financing.”Mr. Siegel said he was working to determine the fate of the Lehman Brothers loans. “We don’t have a ‘get out of jail free’ card, to pretend we don’t owe the money,” Mr. Siegel said. “Before you can find new money, you have to deal with the bankrupt entity.”Mr. Alibhai says he is searching for another bank — possibly one outside the United States — to provide $250 million in replacement funding. That would be used to complete Molasses Reef as well as two other Gencom hotel projects that Lehman was financing: a Ritz-Carlton in Rancho Mirage, Calif., which is about 70 percent complete, and a Ritz-Carlton in the Bahamas, which had not yet broken ground. According to Mr. Siegel, at least $100 million more is required to complete Molasses Reef.One thing that’s clear is that money to salvage the hotel won’t come from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, which is based in Chevy Chase, Md. “We are a management company and cannot provide the needed funding to complete the project,” said Vivian A. Deuschl, a company spokeswoman, when asked about Molasses Reef.Still, Mr. Siegel said — a bit of optimism in his voice — that Ritz-Carlton could introduce to him a potential investor.“It’s not their role to fix our problems,” he said of Ritz-Carlton, “but they have a vested interest in seeing our problems fixed.”'"
"'08-12-21,'0','Ms. Lorusso and the four girls were learning that fulfilling the wishes of needy children who penned letters to the fun fat fellow through the United States Postal Service’s Operation Santa Claus was not as simple as it used to be.The Postal Service abruptly shut down the national program last week because of a privacy breach and reopened it Saturday in New York with a few policy changes that made the process a bit more complicated and for some a little less warm and fuzzy.For nearly 100 years, people would pick out letters at a post office and send gifts directly to children using the address listed on the letters.But the program was shut down after postal workers recognized a registered sex offender as one of the people taking a letter at a facility outside of New York. The man told postal officials that he meant no harm, but officials notified the family of the child, and the program was stopped.Operation Santa resumed with a few tweaks, including the redaction of last names and addresses with heavy black ink. And instead of sending gifts directly to children, secret Santas must take wrapped presents to the post office and provide the recipient control number that corresponds with their letter. The post office will then deliver the gifts.At the James A. Farley Post Office on Eighth Avenue, Ms. Lorusso scanned the copy of the redacted letter to Santa she was given when she had walked into the post office a couple hours earlier. She searched the child’s letter line by squiggly line, through and around blacked-out sections that looked more like a classified F.B.I. document than the wish list of a 7-year-old girl and her 2-year-old sister. But finally she found what she needed.“It bothers me a little bit,” Ms. Lorusso, 61, said of the new restrictions. “We would have liked to stay in touch with the girls or write them a letter.” Though the process was a little more cumbersome than they had expected, nothing could shake the feeling of their good deed, the family said. Ms. Lorusso said they had driven in from Saddle Brook, N.J., and had been the first in line. The girls hope to make Operation Santa a family tradition.George B. Flood, a spokesman for the Postal Service, said about 3,000 letters a day were adopted by people wishing to provide, with some people taking as many as 10 letters.The Farley Post Office has about 15 workers redacting and copying letters. “Obviously the operation has become a little more labor intensive,” Mr. Flood said. “But it’s a labor of love.”Andrea Stella, 22, sat at a small table where Operation Santa Claus was in high gear. With tears in her eyes she read through a little boy’s Christmas wish list. She sniffled a bit and smiled as she flipped through the pages.“I’ve been angry the past few Christmases because my parents have not been able afford to get me anything,” she read aloud. Another boy just asked Santa for twin sheets. Others wanted clothes, a home for their family or something warm to wear. Others asked for happiness in families whose parents had been laid off or evicted.Letter by letter, page by page, Ms. Stella read more of the same.“Am I upset with the changes?” she asked. “Are you kidding? It’s still very real.” Ms. Stella said that she was surprised that the policy changes had not been made earlier.“In today’s day you can’t be too safe,” said Mike Catsam, 24, Ms. Stella’s boyfriend.Across the room, Dawn Schober and Deborah Waring, who both live in Amityville, on Long Island, sat close together reading through letters. They had participated in the program together for about 12 years.But the newly instituted anonymity of the program has dampened their spirits a bit.“Yes, you got to protect the kids, but unfortunately it doesn’t take a whole lot for somebody that wants to do something wrong,” Ms. Waring said. “They don’t have to do this to go find kids.”“This is our fun. This was always our Christmas,” Ms. Schober said. “But this is a little frustrating.”Nonetheless, Ms. Schober and Ms. Waring said they would do what they do every Christmas: send their gift boxes stuffed with Christmas candy and goodies.'"
"'08-12-21,'0','The Canadian auto industry, which exports about 90 percent of its production, accounts for a greater percentage of Canada’s manufacturing economy than its parent companies contribute to that of the United States.Many American and Japanese automakers operate factories in Ontario, and so do parts makers that feed plants throughout North America.A loss of the American manufacturers would be a particularly severe blow to Ontario, the most populous province and the home to all of Canada’s auto assembly plants. About 400,000 people in Ontario work in the industry, Mr. McGuinty said.In addition to the loans, Mr. Harper announced that the government would extend additional insurance to auto parts makers for money owed to them by automakers, and develop a program to finance consumer loans for new car purchases.The prime minister suggested that the consumer loan program would also apply to buyers of cars made by Honda and Toyota, companies with extensive operations in Ontario.“We don’t want a package that simply helps the Detroit Three,” Mr. Harper said.Unlike the $17.4 billion package announced by President Bush, the Canadian plan, roughly $3.3 billion, is remarkably short on detail, at least publicly. An official who spoke on the condition he not be identified, following Canadian custom, said many of the terms were still being negotiated with the automakers.Perhaps the biggest uncertainty hangs over the status of labor agreements between the car companies and the Canadian Auto Workers Union. While Mr. Harper spoke broadly about the need for workers “to be part of the solution,” his plan makes no specific demands on the unions.During the last round of contract talks, the Canadian union rejected a wage system adopted by the United Auto Workers that places new workers on a lower wage scale.Some industry analysts argue that unionized Canadian workers are now significantly more expensive to employ than their American counterparts. But the government official said that several factors, including public health care, differences in pension systems and currency exchange rates, made it difficult to draw that conclusion.After the announcement, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers, Ken Lewenza, again rejected suggestions that wages and benefits needed to be reduced.“This has nothing to do with auto workers’ wages in the United States and Canada,” Mr. Lewenza said during a conference call with reporters. He added that concessions made by the union during the last round of contract talks had left the Canadian industry in a competitive position.But Mark Meldrum, a business professor at the University of Windsor, based in a city in Ontario that is particularly dependent on auto jobs, said the Canadian union would probably match any concessions offered by the U.A.W. in the United States.“That will be held up as the yardstick,” he said. “There has to be wage concessions.”Both the prime minister and the premier said a central condition for Canadian assistance would be commitments from the automakers to maintain Canada’s 20 percent share of continental production.Because the governments’ only method of enforcement will be refusing to roll over the loans, Professor Meldrum was skeptical about Canada’s ability to police that, or any other, condition.“Canada cannot save the industry,” he said. “Canada can only help save the industry.”In a brief statement, Chrysler Canada, which is based in Windsor, Ontario, welcomed the government’s offer.John Gray, the mayor of Oshawa, Ontario, which is the hometown of General Motors of Canada, was more effusive in his praise. “Hallelujah!” he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation minutes after the announcement. “It’s lifted that cloud which has been hanging over our head.”The decision to provide aid is the latest step in a long change by Mr. Harper’s Conservative government. Until this fall, it had regularly dismissed suggestions that the federal government had any role to play in assisting the auto industry. But before October’s election, it broke with that by promising to help finance the reopening of a Ford engine plant in Windsor, Ontario.Under the Canadian plan, General Motors will receive 3 billion Canadian dollars with the balance going to Chrysler. Ford has asked Canada only for a line of credit and is not participating.'"
"'08-12-21,'0','Instead, taxpayer money has been used mainly to recapitalize ailing banks. To be sure, this use of the TARP is perfectly legal. The legislation gives the secretary broad authority to buy “any other financial instrument” that he deems “necessary to promote financial market stability.” That certainly includes buying bank stock.The question is not one of legality, but of judgment. Old-fashioned believers in democracy may recall that a reluctant Congress was sold on the idea of buying troubled assets, not on injecting capital into banks. No wonder members are crying foul.In fairness, Mr. Paulson was not alone in advocating capital injections. Many economists and financial experts agreed. But I doubt that many of them intended for the government to buy preferred stock with no control rights, at above-market prices and with no public-purpose strings attached. The automakers are not being treated this way in their $13.4 billion loan.Because about half of the $700 billion remains uncommitted, let’s review the arguments supporting the three main uses of the TARP:MORTGAGES The financial crisis began with falling home prices and fears of rampant mortgage defaults — fears that are now coming true. Those fears depressed the values of securities based on mortgages, making them “troubled.” Foreclosures are painful and costly events that destroy real estate values and force fire sales of homes — which depress prices further. It is hard to see a way out of this mess without seriously reducing foreclosures. Understanding that, Congress directed the Treasury secretary to use the TARP to get mortgages refinanced. But he has not.MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES There were several rationales for buying troubled mortgage-backed securities. First, panic had virtually shut down the markets for these securities — markets that must be restarted to restore our system of mortgage finance. Second, one source of that panic was that nobody knew what the securities were worth. A functioning market would establish objective valuations. Third, many mortgages are buried in complex securities. Buying the securities would let government refinance the underlying mortgages.Mr. Paulson says he changed his mind about buying troubled assets because the facts changed. I’m sure that many facts changed. But what new facts invalidate the rationales above?Furthermore, there are clear synergies among the main uses: Buying mortgage-backed securities helps the government acquire mortgages to refinance, refinancing mortgages to avert foreclosures enhances the values of these securities, and both policies support the one position that Mr. Paulson has embraced wholeheartedly, bolstering the finances of banks.RECAPITALIZING BANKS Granting the secretary catch-all authority to buy “any other financial instrument” was a sensible addendum to the law. It offered much-needed flexibility to respond to unforeseen circumstances — an auto bailout, for example. But whoever imagined that the addendum would consume nearly all the TARP money, leaving nothing for its two stated purposes?But suppose you believe (though I don’t) that recapitalizing banks was the best use of all the money. Even then, the secretary’s execution leaves much to be desired. Never mind the lack of transparency and the management issues recently cited by the Government Accountability Office. Think about this:Treasury has bought preferred stock with no control rights. The 5 percent dividend rate that taxpayers will generally receive is half what Warren Buffett got from Goldman Sachs. Banks receiving capital injections through the front door are generally allowed to pay dividends out the back door. And there are no public-purpose quid pro quos, such as a minimal lending requirement. So banks can just sit on the capital, which is what most of them have done, or use it to make acquisitions, as a few have.Clearly, Mr. Paulson bent over backward to make the terms attractive to banks. He contended that wide participation was essential in order to avoid stigma. To that end, he even forced money on several bankers who didn’t want it. Naturally, the strong banks that didn’t want the money made that fact known to the markets immediately. Throwing taxpayer money where it was not needed wasted a precious resource.So here we are, looking at an all-too-familiar story. The administration that brought you the Iraq war and the Katrina response is locking in another disaster before it leaves town. What to do?Fortunately, the TARP legislation authorized a first tranche of $350 billion but wisely gave Congress a mechanism for blocking release of the second $350 billion. With the first tranche now committed, Mr. Paulson said he would soon request release of the second. Based on his performance to date, Congress should reject that request unless he agrees to spend most of the next installment on TARP’s two stated purposes.Failing that, we can wait a month for the new Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner.'"
"'08-12-21,'0','The agency since its founding has been in control of the foreign stations. Mr. Hayden has argued that the C.I.A.’s responsibilities for gathering intelligence using undercover officers makes it the agency best suited to run the overseas posts and work with foreign spy services.Obama aides said the official announcement of Mr. Blair’s selection as intelligence director, a post created in 2005 as part of intelligence reforms in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, was not expected until next month, after the president-elect returns from a vacation in Hawaii. They said that Mr. Obama would most likely reveal his C.I.A. choice at the same time.Mr. Blair has a reputation for quickly digesting complex and often conflicting information, although his Navy background raised concerns from some members of Congress about the “militarization” of intelligence at a time when the Pentagon still controls a significant part of the intelligence budget.Mr. McConnell is also a retired admiral. Mr. Hayden is a retired Air Force general.A native of Maine descended from generations of Navy veterans, Mr. Blair graduated from Annapolis in the same year as Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia; and Oliver L. North, a former Marine colonel who became embroiled in the Iran-contra scandal.Mr. Blair earned a master’s degree at Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes scholar, and speaks Russian.While at the helm of the United States Pacific Command from 1999 to 2002, he won praise for counterterrorism operations he ran against the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines, where Navy Seals and C.I.A. operatives worked with the Philippine army to capture or kill the members of the network in remote parts of the country.But he also clashed with lawmakers and State Department officials over his efforts to strengthen ties to Indonesia’s military, which he saw as an important moderating force in the Muslim nation. Some officials in Washington objected to the Pentagon’s dealing with a military with a long track record of human rights abuses.In 2001, Mr. Blair was one of the brightest stars in the military firmament: an admiral with a platinum résumé whom many considered a lock to become the next Joint Chiefs chairman.But the new defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, considered him to be too outspoken and independent, and thought that he was out of step with parts of President Bush’s foreign policy agenda, particularly about the military threat posed by China. Moreover, he was a longtime friend of the Clintons, having studied at Oxford with former President Bill Clinton.Mr. Blair was passed over for the job, and eventually retired.In civilian life, Mr. Blair ran the Institute for Defense Analyses, a nonprofit group in Northern Virginia that does extensive work for the Pentagon.But he had to step down from the post in 2006 amid concerns that his positions on the boards of several defense contractors constituted a conflict of interest.The Pentagon’s inspector general later concluded that Mr. Blair had violated the institute’s standards by serving on the board of a contractor working on the Air Force F-22 jet at the same time that the institute was evaluating the program for the Pentagon. But the inspector general also concluded that Mr. Blair had not influenced the group’s conclusions about the jet program.'"
"'08-12-21,'0','Recruiters say they have seen little falloff in demand for jobs on even the most dangerous routes, and a private agency that counsels sailors concurred.Salvador Santos, assistant general manager of that agency, the Luneta Seafarers’ Center, said that economic considerations almost always trumped concerns for personal safety among the sailors.Mr. Arguelles, 28, who was scanning the job notices, was looking for work as a ship’s cook. Many of the recruiting agencies were offering $1,000 to $2,000 a month for the position.But he said he needed more than that to help care for his mother, who suffers from hypertension, and to pay for the education of his three younger siblings.So he perked up when he heard that one recruiter was looking for crewmen for an oil tanker that would pass through the Gulf of Aden.“I know it’s dangerous, but the agency is offering twice the salary,” Mr. Arguelles said. “Besides, think about it: the pirates haven’t killed any crew members so far, so it could be harmless.”Indeed, some news reports have contributed to the cavalier attitude. After the all-Filipino crew of the Greek-owned tanker Centauri was released last month, the sailors told news agencies that the pirates had treated them well, even playing cards with them and sharing meals during the two months that the crew was held.In late November, of the approximately 300 sailors being held captive by Somali pirates, 134 were Filipinos, according to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs.Twenty-six of them were from the Centauri; the other 108, who manned seven ships, were still in the hands of the pirates.While some legislators and government officials in the Philippines have called for restrictions on the maritime recruiting market, the idea has received little support.With about 10 percent of the population of the Philippines working abroad, and with many families here relying on remittances that émigrés send home, there has been no public outcry about the sailors.Mr. Santos of the seafarers’ center — which dispenses advice about the various recruitment agencies from a two-story building beside the row of booths in the recruitment market — said he did not think the men were being exploited.“It’s up to the sailor whether to accept the offer,” he said. “The important thing is he knows what he’s getting into.”A sailor who boards a ship bound for Somali waters often gets double the usual wage, plus hazard pay, Mr. Santos said.That could mean more than $3,000 a month for a cook, more than a minimum wage-earner in the Philippines would make in a year.Mr. Arguelles, the would-be sailor, said he had always wanted to be a teacher, but teaching is one of the lowest-paid jobs in the Philippines.The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration says that about 270,000 Filipinos are merchant sailors. The country’s population is about 96 million.The Department of Foreign Affairs said that it was trying to help those who fall prey to pirates.“The Philippine government is doing its best to protect its sailors, whom we consider heroes,” said Crescente Relacion, executive director of the department’s Office of Migrant Workers Affairs. “We are in constant communication with the shipowners, with foreign authorities and with the families of the sailors who remain in captivity.”Mr. Santos said that it would be hard for the government, or anyone, to try to keep Filipinos from heading to Africa’s troubled waters.And the sailors’ bravery in the face of the well-armed pirates is becoming legendary at home.In one recent episode, according to several security contractors, Filipino crew members pelted pirates with tomatoes in an attempt to stop them from scaling the hull of their ship. The sailors’ efforts failed.'"
"'08-12-21,'0','THE economic crisis has made it painfully obvious that the United States economy has become very vulnerable to broken gears in the global financial system. But this is not simply a financial or economic problem — it is a grave national security risk, and our government must treat it as such.Historically, Washington’s national security and financial apparatuses have operated independently. Intelligence analysts have focused on explicit threats posed by weapons and conflicts. Those parts of the government charged with ensuring economic health have a different mind-set, monitoring capital markets where they assume threats are not malicious, but competitive in nature. This needs to change.For a model, consider the evolution that took place in the 1990s with respect to cyber-threats. While this was initially the preserve of information technology experts and companies, government officials came to recognize the enormous potential threats to the power grid, the Internet and government computer systems.In terms of economic security, however, a complicating factor is that financial experts and national security officials view risk in very different ways. The meltdown on Wall Street is largely a result of an overriding incentive to see risks as low. The group dynamic among financial houses was to lend more under more precarious conditions — if you didn’t, a competitor would, and he would generate greater near-term returns, lure more investors and get a higher bonus.Conversely, the national security community, tends to maximize risk assessments. Aerospace companies sell more weapons if the threat is judged to be increasing. National security analysts don’t get jobs if they say there is no danger. It’s all about playing up risk — sometimes too far, as the miscalculation over Iraqi weapons of mass destruction threat showed.Despite these divergent views of risk, the talents of professionals in the capital markets and national security experts must be combined if America is to identify and respond to financial threats.'"

Armed policemen stood watch among sandbag bunkers outside the entrance to the hotel’s Trident portion, where the owners said 100 rooms would reopen Sunday.Inside, private security officers guarded the lobby entrances, passing bags through metal detectors and X-ray scanners, a far cry from the relaxed atmosphere at the luxury hotel before the attacks.Ten militants from the banned Pakistan-based group Lashkar-e-Taiba are accused of staging the attacks that paralyzed India’s financial capital for three days last month. Two of the most high-profile targets were the sleek, sea-front Oberoi and another luxury hotel, the majestic, 105-year-old historic Taj Mahal Palace & Tower.With Christmas approaching, both hotels have rushed to reopen sections to guests with tighter security.

"'08-12-21,'0','Nature, for a start, is all for it. In evolutionary biology, nepotism is simply a way to pass along your genes. Take, for example, the Belding’s ground squirrel. As Paul Sherman, an evolutionary biologist at Cornell University, has shown, these squirrels can tell the difference between a half sibling and a full sibling, and when a predator is in the neighborhood they will call out warnings preferentially to closer kin. “The cost of the warning call is that the predator might eat you,” says Frank J. Sulloway, a visiting scholar in the Institute of Personality and Social Research at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of “Born to Rebel: Birth Order, Family Dynamics and Creative Lives.” But “close relatives who aren’t eaten get your genes into the next generation.”By this measure, the case of Ms. Kennedy is not really one of nepotism, Dr. Sulloway says, but of its evolutionary cousin, reciprocal altruism — good will without kinship. Altruism toward non-kin occurs in evolution because there’s a net benefit to all. The cleaner fish, for example, can swim into the mouth of a bigger fish and gobble up all the parasites there. The unrelated bigger fish kindly doesn’t swallow, because it’s getting free oral hygiene, and it even warns the cleaner fish to skedaddle if it has to flee a predator itself.“Human behavior involves very high levels of reciprocal altruism,” Dr. Sulloway says.So nature wants Governor Paterson to appoint Caroline Kennedy senator?Not precisely. Nature also has something to say about qualifications. Specifically, whether they are passed from one generation to the next. It might be reasonable to assume that if you come from a family of successful politicians that a combination of aptitude and exposure would put you in a good position to succeed too. Perhaps even to exceed the accomplishments of the previous generation. But nature throws a curve.“You almost always get a regression in the next generation in the mixing of genes,” Dr. Sulloway says. It’s like getting the same seven-digit phone number as your parents, but not in the same sequence. “The child of an unusually successful scientist probably isn’t going to be as successful,” he says.Exceptions abound. The Curies produced mother-daughter and father-daughter Nobel scientists. Johann Sebastian Bach was a greater musician than his renowned father, Johann Ambrosius. Artemisia Gentileschi was as accomplished an Italian Baroque painter as her father, Orazio, despite the high hurdles for her sex. Baseball has many instances of sons who achieve greater success than their fathers.But whether or not Caroline Kennedy has nature’s vote, humans are ever willing to battle biology, and nepotism is one of those things that just sticks in the American craw. Adam Bellow, author of “In Praise of Nepotism: A History of Family Enterprise From King David to George W. Bush” (and yes, a son of Saul Bellow), is struck by the hypocrisy. He cites the Kennedy case as “an interesting episode because it throws into relief the ideological tensions in the American creed; we want nepotism for ourselves but not for other people.”“We have an idealistic gloss.” he says. “We think we are and ought to be unlike other countries.” Capitalism, Mr. Bellow says, “in essence is family enterprise. Most businesses were and still are started by family members.”That’s true of geniuses, too. Take the Bachs. They were “a mafia,” Mr. Bellow says. “Being a professional musician in 17th-century Germany was a license to print money,” and the Bachs were those printers. “These were tough people, not some namby-pamby string pluckers. So Johann arises out of this.”Americans reflexively sniff at the idea that a name can be a qualification, but “it implies a certain dynastic education,” Mr. Bellow says. “This is the case in many other professions; why it’s so common, whether the father or mother is a doctor, lawyer, tugboat captain or fireworks manufacturer.”The Supreme Court found merit in this notion in a case involving a riverboat pilots union on the lower Mississippi. The federal government was trying to open the trade to outsiders, but the court found that growing up on the river and learning from fathers and uncles every shoal and current was a skill that couldn’t be acquired easily without that background.Nepotism can go wrong even for defenders like Mr. Bellow. What begins with helping your kid get a job with your company leads to the development of family tradition, which leads to social interaction with other families in the same sphere, which leads to intermarriage among children (see Kennedys and Cuomos). This leads further to a multigenerational tradition and, Mr. Bellow says, “at the end of the rainbow, a closed caste, like a medieval guild, and nobody wants to see that happen.”Nepotism’s detractors should take heart in the fact that all dynasties decline, mostly in three generations, Mr. Bellow says. “If you’re upset that you’re not a Kennedy or a Clinton, start your own dynasty.”Ms. Kennedy, Mr. Bellow says, fits the pattern of the late-blooming dynastic successor. Like Michael Corleone, she exhibited no interest in the family business, even worked hard to lower expectations. Who knows, she could become a Prince Hal figure and wildly exceed others’ expectations.There is none of this squeamishness about kinship in tribal societies, for whom kinship is everything, protection against strangers and neighbors both.In his forthcoming book, “Civilization and the Savage Mind,” Robin Fox, an anthropologist at Rutgers, describes a journey by the anthropologist Philip Salzman to Baluchistan in southern Iran in 1968 to study the pastoral tribes there. He quotes Mr. Salzman: “One of the first questions asked of me by the Baluch was how big my lineage was.” Didn’t have one, Mr. Salzman replied. “The Baluch were incredulous. What did we do, they asked, when we were threatened, when we needed support? Why, we went to the police, I said. They laughed; they roared. Then they looked at me pityingly. Oh, no, no, no, they said; only your lineage mates will help you.”'"
"'08-12-21,'0','It has been a long off-season for the agent Paul Kinzer.First, the negotiations for the closer Francisco Rodríguez surprised him. Most years, a pitcher like Rodríguez — who set the season record for saves in 2008 with 62 — would elicit at least one offer to make him the highest-paid player at his position. But not this off-season. The Mets were the only big-market franchise interested in Rodríguez, and that suppressed the offer. The Mets signed him to a three-year, $37 million contract last week.More teams have been interested in Kinzer’s other top free agent, shortstop Rafael Furcal, but those negotiations were just as frustrating. On Tuesday, it was reported that Furcal had agreed to a three-year, $30 million contract with Atlanta. But Kinzer said he never agreed to a deal.Kinzer said he and Furcal were “close” to agreeing to a new contract with the Braves on Monday night but decided to sleep on it. Kinzer said he was deluged with calls Tuesday morning because it was being reported that Furcal had signed with Atlanta.“They know we did not even had a verbal agreement,” Kinzer said while attending a news conference in Long Island City on Wednesday, when the Mets introduced Rodríguez.Furcal finally accepted a three-year contract worth at least $30 million on Wednesday, and the Braves accused him of reneging on a deal.'"

So that’s why I’m trying to get in the best shape possible, so I can go longer.”Millsap has seemed to impress Sloan with the effort he provides when he is on the floor, and that has been much longer since Boozer went out with a leg injury.Playing 35 minutes a night, about 9 more than when he was a reserve, Millsap averaged 17.9 points and 11.1 rebounds in his first 14 games as a starter after coming off the bench for 13.“He’s had a chance to play and get more comfortable,” Sloan said. “I think that’s key with a lot of young guys if they keep working. He’s a tremendous worker and usually guys who work hard and bust their butt every day and don’t have any agenda anywhere, they usually get better.”Millsap, a second-round pick from Louisiana Tech in 2006, said he had benefited from practicing against Boozer, a two-time Olympian. His scoring was not needed his first two seasons, but the Jazz have relied on their reserves much more so far because of injuries to Deron Williams, then Boozer.“I try to take advantage of the minutes that I’m going to play right now because all good things come to an end,” Millsap said. “Booz is going to come back and then I’m back to where I’m at.”THREE TEAMS STAND OUT With more than one-quarter of the season complete, it is becoming harder to find more than three legitimate contenders for the N.B.A. title.Boston, the Lakers and Cleveland have been so much better than anyone else that it seems they are headed to the conference finals.

"'08-12-21,'0','Some couples are slashing guest lists to include just immediate family and very dear friends, leaving aunts, cousins and the friends of friends out entirely, and bridal consultants say that they are seeing more couples postponing their events until they can be more certain they will have the money to pay for the wedding they want. Others are ratcheting up plans for quick, simple weddings that allow them to more readily take advantage of a safety net woven from the government and corporate benefits available to married couples.Still other couples, armed with the skills they learned in a go-go economy, are trying to forcefully renegotiate with vendors to keep some semblance of their ideal wedding.One bride had put down a deposit and locked into a contract with a site in a town south of Philadelphia, where she and her fiancé live. Given the amount of debt piling up from their graduate school studies, she suddenly thought that the $30,000 to $40,000 she had planned to spend on her wedding seemed ridiculous.Furthermore, the downturn in the economy left the bridegroom’s parents unable to provide as much financial support as the couple had hoped for. And although the wedding venue has been accommodating, it is not willing to make a refund. The bride is now aiming for something in the under-$20,000 range. To get there she has cut the number of people she has invited from 200 to 115, and made her wedding dinner a less costly luncheon, hoping to save another $30 to $40 a person.“You can negotiate prices with any wedding vendor,” said Kristal Joiner, the wedding coordinator at Event Source Northwest in Kirkland, Wash., a company that has seen plenty of clients seek to do just that recently. But businesses like Ms. Joiner’s, which specialize in supplying disc jockeys and masters of ceremonies, are also caught in an economic squeeze.“We understand that people don’t have as much money these days,” Ms. Joiner said. “We can cut back on hours, or we can do a couple less speakers, or we’ll throw in an extra hour.” However, she added, “We have to charge what we’re worth and make money, so it’s a little difficult.”The same economic forces that are encouraging couples to trim their expectations may actually be encouraging more of them to marry sooner, if less expensively. Some who earn their livelihoods in the wedding business report that they are seeing more couples opt for hurry-up weddings that will allow them to claim married-filing-jointly status on their income taxes for 2008.“Whereas last year I did 197 weddings, this year I’m up to 299 weddings,” said the Rev. Marie April Gismondi, a nondenominational minister with the Church of Ancient Ways in Babylon, N.Y. “I’d say a lot more of them are those quick-I-want-to-get-married-this-week weddings.""To be sure, a certain number of couples each year schedule their unions to take advantage of the tax break. “December is a kind of funny month,” said Sari Venegas-Skalnik, a bridal consultant in Guaynabo, P.R., who recently has had three couples come to her with plans for weddings on short notice. “We get a lot of last-minute pop-ups. People who say, ‘I’m already going on vacation, what do I have to do to get married?’ ”But Ms. Gismondi, who is also the vice president of the American Association of Wedding Officiants, said she’s seeing an unusual spike for some simple economic reasons. One bride, she said, “who was paying $400 and change a month on her health insurance,” told her that by marrying she would save nearly $5,000 a year in premium payments.Getting out of town can have its advantages, too. Susan Alexander Shapiro, the owner of BravoBride (bravobride.com), a Web site for the purchase and sale of new and used wedding items, said that some couples who had planned large formal weddings “now are doing destination weddings because it’s cheaper.”“Typically there are fewer guests,” she said, and “some places will even offer a ‘free wedding’ if you stay at their resort, which means they will throw in the cake, Champagne, bridal bouquets and more.” But even those who have not yet felt the sharp bite of the economy’s incisors have been chastened.“They don’t want to look ostentatious,” said JoAnn Gregoli, a wedding planner who is also the New York metropolitan coordinator for the Association of Bridal Consultants. “They say, ‘Make it simple.’ You don’t want to be there promoting your wealth to people who don’t have it.”She pointed out that the industry’s woes have created opportunities, too.“It’s a buyer’s market if you’re still getting married and you have the money,” she said.Andi Vance, a 31-year-old bride-to-be from Chicago, has used the recession to put her priorities in order. She began planning for her September 2009 wedding with a budget in the $15,000 to $25,000 range, but when the economy began to falter, she decided a down payment on a house was more important to her than a dream wedding.So instead of the $5,000 venue, she booked a cabin for $150 at Malabar Farm, a state park in Lucas, Ohio. She also decided to use flowers from her mother’s garden and intends to have a hometown friend take pictures.She is now searching for a secondhand dress. And in a perfect marriage of technology and parsimony, in lieu of a band she is going to hook up an iPod to a speaker system.“We’ll be able to do it for under $10,000,” she said of her event. “Right now, we just need to save money. The wedding is one day. The house is going to last a lot longer than that.”'"

I look at the pain people are in; it’s not as if people in a community like ours aren’t feeling it.”Ms. Chatzky, the mother of a 14-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl, began meeting with community leaders convened by Westchester Jewish Community Services last month to help steer people toward finding whatever financial help they need, whether it is counseling or directions to the local food bank.“It’s a way to help people who’ve taken on more than they can handle,” she said.In March, she will publish a new book, “The Difference” (Crown). “It’s based on a survey of 5,000 people to look at why it is some people have an easy time getting from paycheck to paycheck into financial security and others get stuck,” Ms. Chatzky said. “It was fascinating for me.”Among her findings: gratitude counts. “It doesn’t seem to matter if you write a check or get involved; if you’re cognizant of what you’ve been given, if you don’t necessarily take it for granted, that humility rather than hubris tends to go a long way,” Ms. Chatzky said.Not that anyone’s money is apt to go a long way in the immediate future, she said. Which is why Ms. Chatzky outlined three pieces of advice she hoped her Westchester neighbors would follow, at least for the short term.No. 1, she said, is do not pull money out of a 401(k). No. 2 is to track spending. And No. 3 sparked Ms. Chatzky’s most impassioned plea: “If you’re in a precarious financial place, don’t try to hide it from your kids,” she said. “I know there are a lot of parents saying, ‘We’ll have Christmas, but we’re not going to have the same kind of Christmas.’ Let’s explain it more than that, so our kids understand they don’t have to be scared we’re not going to put food on the table, but that maybe we’re not going to get a new game system this year.“There are a lot of kids out there, even kids in Westchester, who are not going to have a holiday at all,” she continued. “Wouldn’t it be better if we take some money and go buy something for them?”'"
"'08-12-21,'0','One of the things you immediately notice about Andrew Stevovich’s paintings is the old-fashioned subject matter. The scenes of couples playing cards, dancing in formal dress at a ball, or smoking and drinking in a nightclub while watching a cabaret show suggest an artist whose world view is firmly rooted in the past.Here and there in the more than 75 paintings and drawings assembled for his first museum retrospective at the Hudson River Museum, Mr. Stevovich, who lives in Northborough, Mass., offers hints of the contemporary world around him. In one painting a cellphone rests on a table in a cafe next to an ashtray, while in another work, also a cafe scene, a woman works on a laptop computer. But over all these pictures ooze nostalgia.The hair and clothing of the figures in his paintings recall the styles of the 1950s. Men are dressed in suits, often pinstriped and with short, narrow ties, while the women wear 1950s pencil or swing skirts, often accessorized with pearls, hats and high heels. Pastels predominate, in the color of the clothing and the décor of the interiors.Writing in the catalog, Bartholomew F. Bland, the curator of the exhibition, outlines how the artist’s background informs his work. Born in 1948 in Austria and raised in Washington, Mr. Stevovich grew up visiting the National Gallery of Art, where, it helps to know, he developed very early an appreciation for the works of Italian Renaissance painters, in particular their use of well-defined colors and full, stylized figures. His own figures are similarly colorful and stylized, so much so that individual faces and figures seem to repeat from one picture to the next.Or maybe it is just that his faces have a very specific look. They have almond-shaped eyes, akin to the eyes on the faces of the figures in the paintings of Pablo Picasso, another important and obvious influence on the artist. Then there are the sensuous lips, full and colored light red, along with a particular and unusual kind of nose that in profile resembles the shape of a ski jump. It is especially noticeable on the women.Technically, Mr. Stevovich looks to the Renaissance artists, for their precise and delicate finishing. Each of his paintings is rendered with great care, the artist lavishing effort and concern on every line and detail, no matter how seemingly small and insignificant.'"
"'08-12-21,'0','Jane Latus said her daughter, now a freshman in college, was pulled out of class on that June morning and escorted to her locker to watch as it was surrounded by three or four police officers. “One officer kept his hand on his gun the whole time, which scared her,” Mrs. Latus said outside a school board meeting earlier this month. The search did not turn up drugs in her locker, her mother and school officials said.State school officials knew of no other schools that were exercising their right to use dogs to sniff out drugs in Connecticut.Vincent Mustaro, senior policy adviser at the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education, said he did not routinely send the policy that allows such searches to school boards because few have ever requested it. “It’s a minority of school boards, definitely not a majority,” Mr. Mustaro said in a phone interview last week. “They’re more interested in video surveillance than dogs.”In Canton, the sweep may have been well-intentioned, but “it was carried out so ineptly,” Mrs. Latus said.Elisa Villa, a criminal defense lawyer and mother of three students at the schools, said in a phone interview earlier this month that the board’s policy provides for searches when necessary. She said the policy’s restrictive language “when necessary” is intended to “prevent such capricious conduct on the part of Canton’s superintendent of schools.”“All you can do as educators and parents is let your kids know about the health and legal risks associated with drug use,” Mrs. Villa said. “Arresting kids for drugs doesn’t prevent them from doing drugs. They should deal with it as a health issue, not a criminal issue.”The A.C.L.U. of Connecticut also said that the way the practice is carried out — with only lockers and parking lots subject to searches — students with drugs can still go undetected.“This means that students wishing to bring drugs to school can easily avoid these sweeps by storing drugs on their persons,” Mr. Matthews said.Susan Crowe, the Canton school board member in charge of the policy committee, said the committee is drafting a policy that “respects students’ individual rights, while keeping the general student body safe.” While there were committee members willing to consider rescinding the policy, “we thought it was better to work with the policy,” she said.Kevin Witkos, a state representative and Canton police officer involved in the June drug sweep, said he thought the policy was “effective in that the student body knows it could happen again.” He said schools have to use every tool they can to deter drug use and keep drugs off school grounds.Kevin D. Case, the schools superintendent, said the drug sweeps “are just one piece of the puzzle as we work to keep the middle school and high schools a safe, drug-free zone.”'"
"'08-12-21,'0','While national chains and department stores are offering deep discounts, little downtown businesses are employing other more creative ways to attract customers.“It’s a challenge,” Ms. Adam said. “We independents cannot compete with the malls. We’ve chosen to take a quality, owner-on-the-premises route. An owner who knows your husband and your kids, greets you by name and knows what you like. That’s what will keep us here.”On Sundays this month, many Greenwich stores are honoring $25 gift cards from a local newspaper ad with purchases of $100 or more. “Discounting doesn’t sound as nice as ‘We’re going to give you a gift,’ ” said Mary Ann Morrison, president and chief executive of the Greenwich Chamber of Commerce. On Greenwich Avenue, where the rents average $125 a square foot, a half-dozen failed businesses look like missing gemstones in a jeweled necklace, visual cues that retail sales nationwide are the weakest in 35 years.Cities that successfully reinvented themselves in recent years, like New Haven and Stamford, face new challenges now. Late-night Thursdays are a holiday staple in New Haven, but new this season are horse-drawn carriage rides and performances by regional school choirs meant to draw more foot traffic to its restaurants and shops.A further inducement: Twenty restaurants and three theaters are promoting $29 three-course dinners before 6 or after 9 o’clock. Reservations doubled the week of Nov. 9, when the prix fixe menus were tried out, and 70 percent of diners surveyed said they were either sampling the city’s night life for the first time or returning after a long while. “This is the first time in the history of New Haven that the restaurants have all come together,” said Anne Worcester, chief marketing officer of Market New Haven.“Everybody has the same common goal: As goes New Haven, there goes their business,” she said. “The collaboration is probably what sets New Haven apart from other small cities I know about.”In Stamford, at A Step Ahead, which has outfitted girls for bat mitzvahs and proms for 23 years, the family owners are attempting to organize citywide events à la First Night that would target a different community each month and benefit a charity.“We are in trouble,” said Monica Needle, daughter of the owners. Sales in November were off 25 percent from last November, and December looks far worse, she said. At that rate, the store cannot last more than a month or two, Ms. Needle said.“Our friends are all in the same position,” she said. “If we make ourselves stronger, we can accomplish something for the area.”Working with her is Lynn McGee, owner of the Bridal Suite, whose business on Bedford Street has gone from boom to bust in the past year. “All the girls want now are samples,” Ms. McGee said, and they want to negotiate the marked prices. “They come in asking, ‘What can I get this for?’ ” That sort of haggling never happened before, she said, noting that she was selling $2,000 try-on gowns for $400.Bedford Street, once a premier shopping area, has long been in the shadow of the local mall. “We are all struggling so bad,” Ms. McGee said. Her husband’s pizzeria down the street is getting by because of its affordable lunch menu, but many other places to eat are hurting, she said.To boost dining downtown, a Stamford restaurant guide was delivered in October to every office complex in the city, said Sandy Goldstein, president of the Downtown Special Services District, which is Stamford’s business improvement association. “So many of our restaurants are mom-and-pops, and there’s not much margin for error,” Ms. Goldstein said.The city’s new blue holiday lights — inspired by bulbs on the Champs-Élysées in Paris — are another attempt to draw traffic downtown. “I don’t know if people love them or hate them, I just want them to come and stay for dinner,” Ms. Goldstein said.At the state level, declining sales mean less revenue from sales tax receipts. For municipalities, the bottom line is lower property taxes: As Ms. Goldstein put it, healthy businesses bring in higher rents, boosting real estate values, which then translate to higher taxes. The opposite occurs in a downturn.In smaller towns, retailers and marketers are thinking outside the gift box, too.In Darien, on the day after Thanksgiving, characters from the Cirque du Soleil bebopped around the town’s shopping districts dressed as snowballs. Two days later, at the town’s holiday tree lighting, Chamber of Commerce volunteers handed out merchant goody bags that included discount coupons, said Carol Wilder-Tamme, president and chief executive of the chamber.The verdict after that weekend: “People were out, but they were very careful about what they were buying,” Ms. Wilder-Tamme said. To help spotlight its merchants, the chamber is taking out full-page newspaper ads, which it buys at a discount that it passes on to the retailers. The chamber has also created a new slogan: Darien, a Destination of Distinction.On Saturday, two free films were to be shown in the hope that moviegoers would stay in town, have lunch at local restaurants and shop locally rather than at the malls.In New Canaan, with 11 vacant storefronts in its town center, landlords were asked to dress up the bare shop windows. Empty stores convey a message of hard times and reduce spillover traffic between stores, said Pamela Ogilvie, executive director of the New Canaan Chamber of Commerce. “It’s a small town, and we have to work our way out of this together.”While some business owners seek strength in numbers, others are spending money to make money. Aitoro Appliance and Electronics in Norwalk recently erected a $100,000 electronic billboard outside the store to announce daily specials, thank local organizations and promote its half-price “dent and scratch” sale.“For us, to move merchandise that we own is important. We have to turn some dollars,” said Tony Aitoro, a partner in the 60-year-old family business. Aitoro’s has increased advertising and in-store events like charity functions, which are especially good for business, he said. “The next time they need a refrigerator, they’ll think, ‘Aitoro’s — I’ve been there and they’re very community-minded,’ ” he said.The Aitoros have survived other downturns. “It’s a cycle,” Mr. Aitoro said. “It’ll come around. We just have to be good businessmen and be prepared for the next wave of buying.”'"
"'08-12-21,'0','Business owners, meanwhile, were bending over backward to cater to customers. “I see them providing extra wrapping or putting out coffee and cookies in their stores,” Ms. Prunty said. “They’re in overdrive.”Those who have been in business a long time seem most likely to be taking the downturn in stride.On West Main Street in Somerville, Mary Pekun, the owner of the Crystal Palace, a collectibles store, said 23 years in retailing had taught her that people buy even in lean times, provided a store has “the right merchandise, at the right price.”“I’m just hoping things will fall in place,” she said one afternoon this month, before rushing off to take care of the store’s lone customer, an older man in search of a figurine. “Besides, I think people are tired of malls. They want the individuality and the attentiveness that comes with a small store, and the nostalgia. For many people that’s comforting.”Few New Jersey towns mounted a more vigorous campaign for a merry shopping season than Somerville, the county seat of Somerset County. The borough has only 12,500 residents, but nearly 70 shops. The Bridgewater Commons mall, which opened one mile away in Bridgewater in 1989, “did sap businesses away from the downtown, but new businesses evolved in their place,” said Bill Lawton, a former chairman of the District Management Corporation of Somerville, a quasi-governmental entity that fosters economic growth. Today the town has a lively downtown and a growing reputation as a restaurant destination and antiques center.In September, as Wall Street churned and consumers cut back spending, Cynthia Hollod, executive director of Somerville’s District Management Corporation, looked for ways to counteract the souring economy. She knew that many shops, like the Crystal Palace or the Hungry Hound, the dog bakery and pet boutique across the street, rang up a third of their annual sales from Thanksgiving to Christmas. She started marketing early and hard.At Halloween, Somerville handed out candy canes with stickers heralding Santa’s arrival downtown, instead of the usual candy. Free parking on lots commenced Nov. 1, one month early. More money was spent on radio advertising, and more discount coupon books were printed. At the holiday kickoff celebration, shoppers were encouraged to bid on four ice sculptures — a bear, an angel, a Christmas tree and a reindeer — made at an ice-carving demonstration. Proceeds from the auction went to the local high school’s cheerleaders, who came downtown for the occasion, trailing family and friends.“We knew having an auction for a local cause would draw even more people,” Ms. Hollod said. “Every little thing helps. We can’t compete with national retailers. But we want people to see the uniqueness of our stores.”In Summit and Red Bank, businesses invested in regional advertising, hoping to attract out-of-towners.MAPLEWOOD introduced a new festival for this weekend “Las Posadas on the Avenue,” patterned after a Spanish tradition. There will be treats for children at participating stores, and other entertainment for the family including the band Bones Unlimited, flamenco dancing and mariachi music.Morristown staged a scavenger hunt, sponsored by the New York Jets; set up more holiday decorations than usual on the Green; and created a Web page where shoppers could download coupons from local businesses.Westfield worked out a series of new promotions, starting with a sidewalk sale in April. It invented “customer appreciation days,” and dreamed up a contest where the winner gets $500 in gift cards from downtown businesses. For the first time in memory, it also made parking lots free during the last half of December.“We’ve been very busy working on new promotions because of the economy,” said Sherry Cronin, executive director of the Downtown Westfield Corporation. “October was horrible, in November things picked up, and we are crossing our fingers this month.” Half the retailers in Westfield’s downtown are national brands, including Banana Republic, Coach and Talbots.“But even in the nationals, there are store owners who know you by name,” Mrs. Cronin said. “They don’t have the turnover that the stores in the mall may have. One day I saw someone familiar on line in town. I said, ‘Don’t I know you?’ and she said, ‘I work for Ann Taylor, and I sold you your last suit.’ ”In Montclair, one business owner joined with other stores in a campaign urging residents to shop local. The group’s Web site, www.shoplocalmontclair.com, directs customers to weekly holiday deals offered at more than 50 participating stores.“Since no government bailout is coming our way, we have joined our efforts to let you know that shopping locally this holiday season is one of the most energy-efficient, heart-warming, self-sustaining contributions you can make to your community,” the site says.Kelly DelRosso, who owns Semplice, a home furnishings and gift store on Bloomfield Avenue in Montclair, said she decided to set her competitive instincts aside and collaborate with other stores in town after the malls began advertising discounts of 60 or 70 per cent.“I was planning a promotion in my own store,” she said. “Then I realized that one sale in one town would not be enough to compete with the barrage of advertising saying everything at the mall was on sale. I thought, if 10 of us had a sale, we could have an impact.“December is the month that you go into the black and make your profit for the year,” Miss DelRosso said. “Will we all get through a tough December? Probably.”The campaign made sense to Kathy Clark and her husband, Dan Rich, who live in New York City and were in Montclair one day recently to visit a friend. They spent a few minutes inside Terra, a tearoom and fair trade retail shop on Church Street.“I would always much prefer to go to a local store,” Ms. Clark said.Many New Jersey downtowns have accepted the view that the pain will not end any time soon.Nancy Adams, executive director of RiverCenter, Red Bank’s business improvement district, scheduled an economic summit for local businesses on Jan. 27.“The forecasts for January and February are very grim,” she said. “A recession like this can be tough on individual business owners, for sure. But it can also bring opportunities. We need to find them.”'"

"'08-12-21,'0','As recently as the last decade, Tangier was still considered a down-on-its-luck town riddled with drugs and hustlers. But while sleazy dives, decayed buildings and dark alleys can still be found, a stylish new Tangier has emerged, fueled by royal investments and a thriving arts community. There are now renovated architecture gems like the ’40s Cinémathèque de Tanger, quirky boutiques loaded with one-of-a-kind objects, and cafes that draw a sophisticated but idiosyncratic crowd.That crowd today includes the supermodel Jacquetta Wheeler, Bruno Frisoni, the designer for Roger Vivier, and the French writer Bernard-Henri Lévy, who recently bought a starkly modern house next door to the Café Hafa.Much of Tangier’s renaissance can be traced back to Morocco’s young king, the 45-year-old Mohammed VI. Unlike his father — the late King Hassan II who ruled Morocco for 38 years and was said to have despised Tangier — the new king is an enthusiastic champion.Instead of an urban wasteland, he sees Tangier as a cultural and commercial gateway between Africa and Europe. The young king installed Mohamed Hassad, a forward-thinking politician known for turning around Marrakesh, as the governor of the Tangier region. The king was also the driving force behind Tanger Med, a giant new cargo port whose administrative center was designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel. Also in the works is a high-speed train network that would cut the travel time between Tangier and Marrakesh to less than three hours.Despite the changes, the surreal jumble of Escheresque alleyways, crooked white facades and shady courtyards that make up Tangier’s historic heart hasn’t changed since Bowles wrote “Without Stopping,” his 1972 autobiography that recounts his itinerant love affair with North Africa.In it, Bowles described Tangier as “rich in prototypal dream scenes: covered streets like corridors with doors opening into rooms on each side, hidden terraces high above the sea, streets consisting only of steps, dark impasses, small squares built on sloping terrain so that they looked like ballet sets designed in false perspective, with alleys leading off in several directions; as well as the classical dream equipment of tunnels, ramparts, ruins, dungeons and cliffs.”And the slightly sinister and exotic underbelly that inspired Burroughs’s “Naked Lunch” is still found at places like Café Hafa and Café Central, a faded coffeehouse in the seedy but always buzzing Petit Socco square, where everyone seems to have something to hustle among the fin-de-siècle facades.But there is also a glamorous new side to Tangier, where socialites air kiss by the palm-lined swimming pool at La Villa Josephine, a lavish hillside retreat. Or where coiffed ladies nibble on prawn cocktails at the restaurant of the Le Mirage resort, built on a cliff overlooking an expanse of caramel-colored sand.On a breezy Friday afternoon last summer, Le Mirage was filled with wealthy Moroccans, bronzed European families and ladies dressed in Palm Beach whites and peacock-colored caftans. They sat on a portico-shaded terrace, exchanging gossip about other expats and recent trips to Marbella, Spain. Burroughs wouldn’t have lasted two minutes in this crowd.“There’s a wonderful term in ornithology that is perfect for the kind of people that end up here,” said Elena Prentice, an American painter and philanthropist who lives in Tangier. “They are called accidentals, birds that end up in an area they don’t really belong. Everyone in Tangier is some form of accidental.”Royal Air Maroc, Delta and Iberia Airlines fly from New York City to Tangier, but require a stopover, usually in Casablanca, Madrid or Barcelona. Round-trip fares for travel next month start at around $950, according to a recent Web search. Tangier’s historic center is easily explored on foot.The two-year old Hôtel Nord-Pinus Tanger (11 Rue du Riad Sultan; 212-61-228-140; www.nord-pinus-tanger.com) is arguably the most luxurious riad in the Casbah.

Rates start at 280 euros (about $360 at $1.29 to the euro), and include airport transfer, and either breakfast and dinner or breakfast and lunch.Next door is La Tangerina (19 Rue du Riad Sultan, Casbah; 212-39-947-731; www.latangerina.com), a 10-room riad hotel with a small hammam run by a friendly and English-speaking couple. It might not have the glamour of the Nord-Pinus, but the rooms start at 500 dirhams (around $60 at 8.8 dirhams to the dollar).The Alhambra meets the Hilton at the faded but still prestigious Hotel El Minzah (Rue de la Liberté 85; 212-39-333-444; www.elminzah.com).

The menu, which usually includes a soup, salad and a Moroccan dish like chicken tagine, is a bargain at 35 dirhams.The rustic but friendly Restaurant Populaire Saveur (Escalier Waller 2; 212-39-336-326) is a happy and reliable place for generous plates of Moroccan seafood, including a tasty fish soup and seafood tagines. About 150 dirhams a person.Laure Welfling (3 Place de la Casbah; 212-39-932-083), a boho-chic shop overlooking the Place de la Casbah, is owned by an interior designer who lives in Paris and Tangier.

"'08-12-21,'0','It was 1843 when Cole had an artist whip up something he could send to all his friends, thereby cutting down on the need for individual letters at the end of the year. (No Fun Walls in those days, or printouts of the family bulletin filled with tantalizing news about cheerleading camp, Fluffy the poodle or Junior’s triumph on the SATs.) Even in Victorian London, it cannot have been cheap to buy heavy card stock, hire an engraver and send out what amounted to a mass mailing. It is certainly no bargain in the Manhattan of today.That I have no intention of relinquishing this seasonal extravagance, even in Times Like These, has something to do with both guilt and the aforementioned pleasures. If it is true that a good engraved card in a lined envelope can cost about as much as a 20-minute foot massage in Chinatown, that is partly because the laborers that produce all those gorgeous letterpress cards on the market seem to be Wall Street refugees with Wharton M.B.A.’s.Multiply one such card by the number of names on one’s list, then add postage, and you will soon find yourself questioning whether the federal government should add a snail mail bailout to its festival of holiday handouts and economic triage.It may be worth mentioning here that the cost of sending holiday cards is not just of concern to those of us clinging to the middle rungs of the income ladder. Or so I concluded on a visit to the annual holiday fair at Brick Church on the Upper East Side. I had gone there to visit the engravers Bill and Mary Miller of the Printery in Oyster Bay, N.Y., whose cards are favorites of stationery fiends because they are neither schoolgirl twee nor so pompous as to resemble a summons to a papal installation.We have all seen the cards I mean. Some of us have sent or received them. If I now question the holiday cards I once bought from the stationer Mrs. John L. Strong that depicted a jaunty biplane engraved in gold and trailing a sky-written message of Merry Christmas in silver smoke, it is with a thought for my now-pathetic 401(k) and not because they were aesthetically overblown.CHRISTMAS, let’s face it, is not really the time for restraint or quiet taste. This reality even some of the folks on line at Brick Church seemed to understand. A well-known socialite confided to me that day that while her checkbook might be on lockdown, and her annual holiday party and skiing vacation to Gstaad mothballed, economizing on Christmas cards is a cost-saving measure that never entered her mind.Now more than ever, as Mr. Miller explained it, the card as a form of friendly greeting has taken on extra meaning as a gesture of bravado. With little prospect of raises or bonuses, of Christmas turkeys from the boss or, in many cases, even a job, it remains an important matter of pride, as Mr. Miller explained, “to let friends know that everything is still cool, everything is O.K.”And so the Printery has booked 3,000 orders this year, among them mine. And, while I did not spring for anything as opulent as the gilded Bernard Maisner cards sold at Bergdorf Goodman, which can run to $25 apiece and are roughly the size of a movie poster, I confirmed my status as a Manhattan spendthrift by buying cards that each cost almost as much as a six pack of Budweiser and that bear scant resemblance to the 2.1 billion others likely to cram American mailboxes this year.It is not that I am too snobbish to send something from among the 2,700 holiday designs offered by Hallmark. I considered, for instance, impersonating John Waters by sending out Hallmark’s Candy Greetings, which come with a chunk of something inside termed reindeer corn.Instead I settled on a classic Christmas tree from the Printery as my way of staying connected with what Mr. Miller calls the “great chain of being” — or, anyway, of alerting friends from around the corner and also those who are far-flung and long-lost, that this particular spirit is still hanging around.'"

"'08-12-22,'0','For all the talk of change in Barack Obama’s Washington, it is cynical business as usual for the ever-feckless Federal Election Commission. As a senator, Mr. Obama’s signal reform achievement was a new law designed to crack down on lobbyist “bundlers” who package money from fat-cat donors seeking political favors. The F.E.C. — the bipartisan watchdog that loves to play dead — has now issued regulations for the law that poke it full of loopholes.The regulations are an open insult to the explicit intent of Mr. Obama and his co-sponsor, Senator Russ Feingold, that “the broadest possible disclosure” of bundlers be made by federal candidates. Instead, one loophole circumvents the law’s $15,000 reporting threshold for fund-raising events by allowing multiple bundlers to divide the final swag’s accounting. Four bundlers greasing a candidate with a $50,000 take would fall below the disclosure limit, averaging $12,500 a head.Even more egregious, the agency would allow candidates to avoid disclosure even if they knew as a plain fact that their friendly bundlers orchestrated hundreds of thousands of dollars in separate donations. The gimmick is that personal knowledge of the gift isn’t enough if there’s no written record to back it. This enshrines the nods and winks of quid-pro-quo shopping at a new level.We have had little enthusiasm for the F.E.C. But the future only looks grimmer now that Donald McGahn has taken over as chairman. He is a party wheelhorse who was formerly the ethics lawyer for Tom DeLay, the ethically impaired ex-majority leader who quit under a cloud of money-raising scandals.As president, Mr. Obama will have the power to confront the F.E.C.’s machinations. Three of the six commissioners are due to be replaced. Instead of rubber-stamping nominees suggested by Congressional leaders, he should broaden the process — with a blue-ribbon search panel, perhaps. It would be a real change to have an election watchdog with integrity and bite.'"
"'08-12-22,'0','She had landed facedown, her arms outstretched to break her fall.No one stopped to help, she said, but someone called a police officer or transit worker, who called an ambulance. She had torn the ligaments in her left shoulder, pulled a muscle in her chest, and eventually developed hernias in her neck and lower back, she said. She went on disability for six months, but the doctor did not clear her to go back to work, so she had to leave her job.“That’s when the problems started,” Ms. Berroa said.She applied for welfare for herself and her daughters — Eliana Lozada, 18, a junior at Mott Haven Village Preparatory High School, and Natalia Berroa, 12, a sixth grader at the Academy of Public Relations, both in the Bronx.But when she applied for disability assistance, Ms. Berroa found out that as a legal immigrant who was not yet a citizen, she had not paid federal taxes long enough to qualify.“It was a disaster,” Ms. Berroa said. “I couldn’t pay the bills. I couldn’t buy clothes for my children. I couldn’t afford anything.”She covered most of her rent with a federal housing subsidy. But when the rent went up and her share increased, she realized that she could not pay the rent anymore.One day, an eviction notice arrived at her door.Early this year, she was at a thrift store run by Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York and told a clerk of her predicament. By then, she owed about $1,000 in back rent and she did not know how much longer she and her daughters would be allowed to stay in the apartment. The clerk advised her to seek help at the organization’s office.In February, Ms. Berroa received $678 from Catholic Charities, which is supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. (The rest of the money came from the city’s Family Eviction Prevention Supplement, which helps cover rent costs for families on public assistance.)“If that hadn’t happened,” she said, “we would be on the streets right now.”Ms. Berroa no longer hopes to return to teaching and is unsure when, or even if, she will be able to return to work. Her focus is on helping her daughters succeed in America. She hopes to find a new place to live, in a building that has an elevator so she will not have to climb five flights of stairs to get home, as she has to do now.“We’re still happy in this country, our country,” Ms. Berroa said. “All we need is a stable life.”How to HelpChecks payable to The NewYork Times Neediest CasesFund may be sent to:All gifts are acknowledged;special lettersare not possible.

"'08-12-22,'0','TEHRAN — An Iranian official said Russia had started delivering an advanced air-defense system to Iran, despite earlier denials by Russia that a deal had been reached, the official IRNA news agency reported Sunday.The official, Esmail Kosari, the deputy head of Parliament’s Commission for Foreign Affairs and National Security, was quoted by IRNA as saying, “After a few years of talks with Russia, now the S-300 system is being delivered.”The S-300, called the SA-20 in the West, is a surface-to-air missile system that can track aircraft and fire at them from more than 100 miles away.In September, amid reports that a deal was near, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Andrei Nesterenko, denied that Russia would sell the missile system to Iran. “We do not intend to supply those types of armaments to countries in the region,” he was quoted as saying in the semiofficial Fars news agency of Iran.The Interfax news agency reported that the Russian Foreign Ministry had said it was “investigating” the Iranian reports.Israeli officials have long lobbied to prevent Russia from selling the system to Iran. On Sunday, Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, said a senior Russian official had told Israel that the new report about delivery of the S-300 was false.

"'08-12-22,'0','Hedge funds have suffered a shakeout in 2008. The average hedge fund fell almost 20 percent, according to Hedge Fund Research. No fund has yet required a bailout. But many won’t be around in the new year, and those that have survived are battered and bruised. Hedge fund managers must accept that the industry won’t be quite the same again. Here are six changes they need to prepare for:Liquidity is the new watchword. Like investment banks, hedge funds didn’t think much about the structure of their financing during the boom times. But a flood of redemption requests in late 2008, just as they were struggling with illiquid markets and scarce credit, caught them out. Many hedge funds annoyed their investors by blocking withdrawals. In the future, funds that invest in illiquid assets will need to lock in their investors for longer. And those wishing to give investors regular access to their money will have to focus on liquid markets.Fees will face greater scrutiny. The archetypal hedge fund charges 2 percent of assets and skims off 20 percent of investment gains, the longstanding “2-and-20” structure. But some funds have had to offer breaks on fees lately to persuade investors not to take their money out. Investors will be more selective and are likely to put downward pressure on fees. All the same, it is probably too soon to sound a Last Post bugle call for 2 and 20.High water marks will blur. If hedge managers lose money, they normally have to get the fund back up to its previous high for each investor, the so-called high water mark, before the investor has to pay any more performance fees. Broadly speaking, a fund that is down 20 percent from its peak and has a standard high water mark mechanism would need to deliver returns of 25 percent before getting back to its high water mark and earning performance fees again on further gains.That prospect is daunting. It can leave hedge funds short of cash and their employees wondering where their bonuses will come from. Some managers will throw in the towel. This is why some already use a modified mechanism allowing them to earn reduced performance fees on gains even before they have recouped earlier losses in full. Expect more funds to adopt similar policies.Regulation will intensify. Many hedge funds, including big names like the Citadel Investment Group, have had a dismal 2008. But unlike the banking sector, they haven’t needed bailouts. That doesn’t, however, mean hedge funds will escape tighter regulation. Big losses, excess leverage, unexpected curbs on investor withdrawals, and the impact of short-selling on fragile markets make hedge funds easy targets for a crackdown.Regulators also missed warning signs surrounding Bernard Madoff, who is accused of running a Ponzi scheme that cost investors as much as $50 billion. His investment operation appeared like a hedge fund in that it was private and he purportedly traded options as well as stocks. Watchdogs and investors will, therefore, share a desire for greater disclosure, so long as it is meaningful. The challenge will be in writing sensible regulations that can be applied across a diverse industry.'"

Unlike old-fashioned stockbrokers, financial planners can offer advice on everything from investing to mortgages to basic budgeting.What follows is advice on how to pick the best financial planner. First things first: Anyone can use the title financial planner. It’s not quite like being lawyer, where state bar associations decide who gets to practice law. As a result, all sorts of accountants and insurance agents refer to themselves as financial planners.That said, there is a subset of financial professionals who are “certified” financial planners, or C.F.P.’s. To become a C.F.P., you need to meet certain educational and experience requirements and pass a difficult exam that covers an array of financial topics. If you’re looking for a complete, wide-ranging analysis of your financial standing, a C.F.P. is the person to see.But first you have to find one. As with any professional service, you’ll want to start by asking people whose judgment you trust for help. Ask acquaintances who have needs similar to yours, since a planner focused on the needs of young families may not be a good choice for recent retirees.You can also search on the Web. The C.F.P. standards board maintains a database of people who have passed its test, as does the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (Napfa) and the Garrett Planning Network.'"

"'08-12-23,'0','For years, the gun lobby has defeated new gun control laws partly by arguing that stronger laws do not deter crime. A study prepared by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a bipartisan group headed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York and Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston, should finally put that myth to rest.The study analyzed trace data for guns used in connection with crimes during 2007. The data reveal a strong correlation between weak state gun laws and higher rates of in-state murders, police slayings and sales of guns used in crimes in other states.Many states have enacted strong gun laws to supplement inadequate federal ones, including mandatory background checks on gun show sales. States requiring the same background checks at gun shows as those required for store purchases show an export rate for guns used in crimes that’s nearly half the national average. This argues for Congressional action to end the gun-show loophole nationally. States with weak gun laws produce different outcomes. More than half the guns recovered in out-of-state crimes last year were supplied by Georgia, Florida, Texas, Virginia and six other states where weak laws make it easy for gun traffickers and other criminals to obtain weapons.Weak gun laws also put a state’s own citizens at risk. There were nearly 60 percent more gun murders in the 10 states where exports were highest than in the states with low export rates — and nearly three times as many fatal shootings of law enforcement officers.The study by the mayors’ group isn’t the first to document the link between weak gun laws and gun violence or the “iron pipeline” by which guns flow from states with weak gun laws into states with strong ones. Still, the numbers are startling. They explain why the gun lobby resisted their release, and they provide a powerful retort to those who claim tougher gun laws don’t work.'"
"'08-12-23,'0','Last year, 42 million households gave handmade gifts, according to the Craft & Hobby Association, a trade group, and that number is expected to increase greatly this year, its spokesman, Victor Domine, said.“Across the country, people are crafting more,” he said. “With the recession, people are looking for ways to save money, and doctors are recommending it as a major form of stress relief.”Elizabeth Ludington, a 25-year-old paralegal in , N.Y., is one of those who chose a do-it-yourself Christmas. She works for a nonprofit legal aid group that she fears could suffer from a downturn in grants. “I looked at my bank account and budget and realized I didn’t have a lot of cash,” she said.She usually spends about $20 on each of 10 friends and relatives for stationery, bath products or gift certificates. This year, she is stitching cable-knit coffee sleeves to use instead of the cardboard ones at coffee shops. They will cost her $1 each to make and an hour of her time after work while she watches TV at night.“I wanted something that was affordable but still meaningful and kind of fun,” she said.Michaels Stores, the chain of craft retailers owned by the and Bain Capital, hopes that a holiday spike in sales will make up for weak results earlier in the year. For the quarter that ended Nov. 1, the company reported a net loss of $20 million and a decrease of 6.5 percent in same-store sales. But in November and December, Michaels’ 1,014 stores have had sharp increases in traffic and transactions for small-ticket craft supplies, said Brian C. Cornell, the company’s chief executive.Michaels does not release monthly sales data, and Mr. Cornell declined to discuss specific numbers. However, he said that premade holiday and home decorations, which tend to be more expensive, are not selling well. Less expensive craft supplies, which generally account for 41 percent of revenue, are moving briskly, and sales have been particularly strong for supplies used to make jewelry, baked goods, scrapbooks and decorated clothing.Michaels has shifted its marketing strategy to take advantage of the trend. The company created an advertising campaign called “Endless Creativity, Endless Savings” to market craft supplies for handmade gifts. It started a Web site, Where Creativity Happens, with videos on how to make gifts like picture frames and candles, and it held free weekly in-store workshops.“We’re certainly seeing much better results than we would have anticipated,” Mr. Cornell said. “There’s a much greater interest right now in how you decorate your home and create your own gifts yourself.”, the craft supply leader with a 19 percent market share, has had a similar pattern. Though same-store sales fell 1.5 percent in the quarter ending Nov. 1, sales of sewing and craft supplies, which account for half of revenue, were stable that quarter and have climbed this quarter, said Lisa Greb, a Jo-Ann spokeswoman.The cost savings for handmade gifts can be significant. At Jo-Ann, the supplies to make a child’s apron and chef hat cost $7.90 for fabric designed with gingerbread men, iron-on letters to spell “chef” and elastic. Making a hand-knit throw costs $40 for nine skeins of yarn and $6 for knitting needles; a similar-looking item at Pottery Barn costs $129.Jeanne Nevin, the owner of Stampingly Yours, a scrapbooking store in Clifton, N.J., said the last few months have brought her many new customers buying scrapbooks, paper, decorations, inks and rubber stamps.“It’s because nobody has money,” she said. Making a scrapbook is an inexpensive alternative to buying a gift. “It’s not like they give a gift, use it up and get rid of it. It’s stuff they can keep forever.”Even people who do not have the time or inclination to create their own gifts are shunning big-box stores to buy handmade gifts directly from artists, in part to save on the margin in retail stores.On , people bought 13,137 handmade crafts over the last 60 days for an average price of $8.21, and sales of handmade crafts climbed 34 percent, the company said.On Sept. 29, a day the stock market plunged sharply, Etsy, the leading Web marketplace for handmade goods, had record sales. In November and December, the site has continued to break records. Last month, artists sold $10.8 million of goods on Etsy, up from $4.2 million in November 2007. Some 135,000 people signed up for Etsy memberships and sellers listed 1.1 million new items, both figures more than double the same month last year.Some Etsy merchants have had such unexpectedly high sales this season that they are shutting down early because they do not have time to make any more gifts.Dennis Anderson of Citrus Heights, Calif., was prepared for a 50 percent increase in sales of his soaps, which are handmade from ingredients like olive oil, pomegranate and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Instead, orders climbed 300 percent. He said he has sold 6,000 items in the last three months, and he has been working 15 hours a day, seven days a week, to meet the demand.“I wasn’t expecting this much with the economy the way it is, but I realized it’s probably one of the factors in the increase,” he said. Customers “can knock out 12 people by getting 12 bars of soap for $60 instead of spending $30 a person.”Apart from the lower cost, handmade gifts have a nonfinancial value that appeals to many buyers.“I just like the fact that I’m supporting someone who’s trying to make their way in the world by using their talents, and my money is going directly to a person instead of a chain of middlemen,” said Christy Petterson, a jeweler in who co-edits and has bought handmade gifts this season. “For the same amount of money, the specialness factor is way higher. It’s more heartfelt than if you bought something from a big-box store.”'"
"'08-12-23,'0','The first part of his gift, preserved in a cassette tape bought by Hartman after the conference but forgotten in a box of memorabilia for many years, was Barber’s vivid recap of the first eight innings. “Suddenly, this thing became alive,” Barber said.Barber’s recapitulation of the game is a reminder that Vander Meer, no matter the sensation he caused with his first no-hitter, was an afterthought early on in the Brooklyn game. It was the first night game at Ebbets Field, and 38,748 fans, well beyond capacity, had jammed in. “They must have been in the aisles and hanging from the rafters,” Barber said.The second part, which lasts just over three minutes, is Barber live — yet 41 years late. He calls the bottom half of the ninth as if it were being played before him, with Vander Meer facing the bases full of Brooks with one out.“Now,” Barber said, “on the brink of greatness, unprecedented greatness, he’s gone wild.” With Reds Manager Bill McKechnie at the mound trying to calm Vander Meer, Barber said: “There’s no one warming up in the bullpen. It’s going to be Vander Meer going all the way. It has to be. He pitched a no-hitter four days ago at Cincinnati against Boston, and tonight is his night. His father and mother are here. The girl he’s going to marry. They’re all here. And this crowd is now for him. They’ve turned their backs on their ball club, the Dodgers. They want him to do it.”Barber, who died in 1992, was 71 at the time, 13 years past his firing by the Yankees. His lyrical voice rose excitedly during the half-inning and sometimes lowered as if he were telling Cub Scouts a ghost story. He spoke rapidly and clearly, describing the runners on base and the Reds’ defensive setup. And when he said Vander Meer’s name, the syllables were transformed by Barber’s Mississippi roots into the gentler-sounding “Van-da-me-ah.”“Ernie Lombardi, ‘Big Schnozz,’ sitting back of the plate, ready to give the sign,” he said. “Koy up. Vander Meer pitches. It’s a strike. No balls, one strike. The score is six to nothing in favor of the Reds. But the score is not the story. The story is Vander Meer!”Bob Edwards, a Sirius XM talk show host, talked to Barber every Friday for 12 years on National Public Radio’s “Morning Edition”; he remembered Monday that at a public radio conference in 1983, Barber surprised attendees by recreating the bottom of the ninth of Game 4 of the 1947 World Series. Brooklyn’s Cookie Lavagetto broke up a no-hitter by the Yankees’ Bill Bevens with a pinch-hit double and won the game for the Dodgers.“It was the only good thing that happened at that conference,” Edwards said, adding, “He was a showman. When he was a kid, he wanted to be in vaudeville.”With two outs and shortstop Leo Durocher facing Vander Meer, the tinkling glasses in the banquet room were muted. His audience of broadcasters was quiet.“Durocher swings, and it’s a hard line-drive going down the right field and it’s foul just by a couple of feet in the right-field corner,” he said and his audience exhaled loudly — “You had to catch your breath,” Hartman said — and applauded. (The New York Times article the next day said Durocher’s foul went into the right-field stands.)Then, the conclusion: “It’s no balls, two strikes, three on,” the old Redhead said. “It’s a high fly ball going to medium center field. Harry Craft comes under it, sets, and takes it, and it’s a double no-hitter for Vander Meer.” A brief pause, and, finally: “Thank you.”'"
"'08-12-23,'0','Mr. Ippolito said he was enchanted by the Virginia story when he saw it discussed on a television show about 10 years ago. That’s when he began leaving his Christmas greetings. The O’Hanlon house had been divided into rental apartments many years earlier. By the late 1990s, it had few tenants. What they might have done with his cards is anyone’s guess.“I’m probably the least religious man you’ll ever meet,” Mr. Ippolito said, “but I have more faith than anyone you’ll meet. I love this time of year.”“Frank Church,” he said, referring to the editorialist as if he were an old chum, “wrote the absolute truth when he wrote to that little girl.” And what might that truth be? “That the most real things in this life are the things we can’t see,” he said, echoing a line from the editorial.Mr. Ippolito stopped delivering his cards several years ago when Nos. 115 and 117 became construction sites. New quarters were being built for the Studio School, which has about 120 students, ages 2 to 14. It has moved several times since its start in 1971. By coincidence, 1971 was the year that Laura Virginia O’Hanlon Douglas, a retired school teacher, died just shy of 82.The school opened in its new space in September 2007. No. 117 is its official address. The number 115 remains where it always was on an exterior wall. But the old house is gone and no longer recognizable as a separate building.Mr. Ippolito said he resumed sending his greetings to Virginia last Christmas. People at the school do not recall that card. They were charmed, though, by this year’s.“It served as a reminder of how really important the Virginia O’Hanlon story is to us all,” said Marie Helene Lane, who teaches creative writing to children, ages 7 to 9. It also reinforced the school’s determination to follow through on a pledge made a few years ago to put up a plaque recognizing No. 115’s special niche in New York history.The durable Virginia story has outlasted The Sun. The newspaper, which first appeared in 1833, died in 1950. It was reborn in 2002, but couldn’t make it in the hostile financial climate that all newspapers face these days. The new Sun folded in September — but not before it had published the “Yes, Virginia” editorial once more, around last Christmas.“I think it was much appreciated,” said Seth Lipsky, the Sun’s editor. “I wouldn’t say there were crowds outside the office looking to purchase copies, but it was appreciated.”There was a grouchy reaction or two on the newspaper’s Web site. “Telling a child that there is a Santa Claus is treating the child as a plaything, a violation of the dignity of another human being,” one commenter grumped.That is hardly the view on 95th Street.Last year, Ms. Lane encouraged her students to emulate Virginia by writing to The Sun. They did, but unlike Virginia, they got no response. One girl wanted to know if Santa’s helpers were real. Another girl said she wanted to believe in Santa, but wasn’t sure. As for Virginia, “We think her spirit is in the bathroom,” she wrote.When it comes to Virginia’s legacy, Janet C. Rotter, the head of the school, is on Mr. Ippolito’s side. “The important thing is that the children fill this space with their imagination and their hope,” she said. “That, I think, is what Virginia’s letter did. And I’m afraid it’s what adults forget to do.”'"
"'08-12-23,'0','A judge issued the state’s first death sentence in nearly 50 years to a man who shot and killed a Manchester police officer in 2006. The death sentence for the man, Michael Addison, was mandatory under state law after being ordered last Thursday by a Hillsborough County Superior Court jury. The police had been looking for Mr. Addison, a former Boston gang member with a long criminal record, and another man in connection with a weeklong crime spree when Officer Michael Briggs, 35, and his bicycle partner came across the two men in an alley. They recognized the men as suspects and ordered them to stop. Mr. Addison turned and shot Officer Briggs in the head at close range, testimony showed. A State Supreme Court review of the murder conviction and sentence is automatic, and Mr. Addison’s lawyers said they would appeal on grounds that included the judge’s refusal to move the trial.

"'08-12-23,'0','The Atlanta Botanical Garden reopened three days after part of a soaring pedestrian walkway that was under construction collapsed, killing one worker and injuring 18 others. Concrete was being poured onto the walkway’s metal deck when it gave way Friday morning, said Bill Pinto, president of Hardin Construction, the contractor in charge of the project. The garden said all admission fees collected through the end of the year would go to the Jonquil Fund for victims and their families. Mr. Pinto said his company would donate to the fund and would seek contributions from throughout the construction industry. Angel Chupin, 66, was killed in the collapse. Ten workers remained hospitalized, including six in intensive care, said Denise Simpson, a spokeswoman for Grady Memorial Hospital. (AP)'"
"'08-12-23,'0','Mr. Paterson’s office said his choice for the Senate would undergo the same background check as any cabinet-level officer in Albany, including verification of employment and education, a review of tax returns, and a criminal background check by the State Police. The governor’s vetting process drew criticism this fall when it surfaced that his top aide at the time, Charles O’Byrne, had failed to pay income taxes for five years. The Paterson administration has since said it is requiring more extensive background checks.The Senate’s self-imposed ethics rules do not require any disclosure by potential appointees, although sitting senators are required to file financial disclosure statements by May 15 each year. (The latest filing by Ms. Kennedy’s uncle, Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, showed a net worth of at least $43.8 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which ranked him the seventh richest senator.)But several ethics experts, good-government advocates and scholars, who called Ms. Kennedy’s situation highly unusual — because of her overt pursuit of the job, her celebrity and her lack of previous political experience — urged her to reveal information on her finances now, if only for appearances’ sake.Ms. Kennedy made headlines around the world last week after alerting the governor that she wanted the job. She then began a public tour, meeting with political leaders around the state, and quickly cemented herself as the dominant contender for the seat.“Precisely because there is no campaign or election, she should be more willing to disclose and subject herself to a greater level of public scrutiny than is required,” said Dick Dadey, executive director of Citizens Union, a nonpartisan watchdog group. He noted that other major contenders for the Senate seat — officeholders like the attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, and Representative Kirsten Gillibrand — have mounted runs for office and filed public disclosures before.Others wonder if Ms. Kennedy’s unwillingness to disclose personal information suggests she lacks the stomach for the kind of intrusive questions that could come her way as a candidate in 2010.“If this were an open primary, and all the people seeking that position had to run, she’d have to make all those disclosures, so why not in the appointment process?” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a watchdog group that lobbies for tighter ethics rules. “She can’t simply ride in on her name recognition or place in history. The voters and people of New York deserve that full disclosure.”Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, another watchdog group, warned that requiring financial disclosure by “anyone who is speculated about” for such a vacancy could be untenable. “I would think it would be up to her,” he said. But he called Ms. Kennedy’s campaign for the appointment “kind of unique.”So far, on her tour, Ms. Kennedy has taken just 11 questions from reporters, has granted no interviews, and responded only in writing to inquiries about her positions on significant issues.“She needs to deepen the public’s idea of who she is,” said Paul Light, a professor at New York University’s Wagner School of Public Service. “To the extent she can be more transparent, she dispels the notion that it’s all about her name. We obviously know that she’s quite wealthy, but beyond that, we don’t know much about where she gets her income, how she’s invested, whether she has followed her own principles in her investing activities, and so forth. That would be very useful to know.”Ms. Kennedy also has not had to disclose the names and salaries of the people working for her in her bid for the appointment. Lawyers have assured her that federal campaign-finance rules do not apply in this situation, her aides have said.Ms. Kennedy also avoided disclosing any information about her finances while working as chief fund-raiser for the New York City Department of Education. She took the three-day-a-week job — director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships — in October 2002 at $1 a year, intending at the time to step up to a $90,000-a-year salary, but she later decided to forgo the salary. Taking it would have required her to file disclosures with the city’s Conflicts of Interests Board, officials said.Since then, Ms. Kennedy has been a vice chairwoman of the Fund for Public Schools, the nonprofit arm of the strategic partnerships office. A 2006 state law required that the board members of all nonprofits “affiliated, sponsored by or created by” a city government submit detailed disclosure forms. But on Dec. 10, the city told an Assembly committee that the Fund for Public Schools would be exempt from the law, reasoning that the Department of Education is, legally speaking, a school district, not a city agency — even though the mayor has control over the schools.The upshot: Ms. Kennedy, for now, is not subject to those disclosure rules, either.'"
"'08-12-23,'0','“Let’s allow that Ghana has achieved some things,” said Yao Graham, a writer and activist who leads the Third World Network, a research and advocacy institution with a regional office here. “But for this to be the yardstick of a continent is to set very low expectations for a billion people across Africa.”The transfer of power from one party to another is almost a humdrum affair here, having already happened once since the country made the transition from military rule to democracy in 1992. If everything goes without a hitch, two elected presidents will have left office peacefully and willingly after serving out their constitutionally allotted maximum terms.The first round of voting was largely free of violence, and there were only a handful of complaints of irregularities, according to international observers.The governing, center-right New Patriotic Party nominated Nana Akufo-Addo, the country’s former foreign minister, as its candidate. The opposition National Democratic Congress nominated John Atta Mills, a lawyer and professor who has twice run unsuccessfully for president.The opposition has already won a plurality of seats in the parliamentary election, which was held along with the first round of the presidential balloting, though several seats remain contested.If Mr. Akufo-Addo wins, he will seek to extend Ghana’s impressive economic growth and ensure that a greater number of people share in the country’s prosperity, said Jake Obetsebi-Lamptey, a senior official with the governing party.“We can take the progress we have made and turn it into real gains in the standard of living of all Ghanaians,” he said.The opposition said that the governing party’s record looked impressive on paper, but that in reality many Ghanaians found themselves worse off than before.“This has been a period of increasing corruption and a broadening gap between rich and poor,” said James Gbeho, a senior opposition official who has served in many top government posts over the years. “For most people, progress has been an illusion.”Ghana has long been a symbol of Africa’s vast promise, but also of the many pitfalls that have plagued the continent in the postcolonial era. After it won independence in 1957, the Pan-African ideas of Ghana’s founding leader, Kwame Nkrumah, helped inspire a generation of liberation struggles.But the dream soon soured. His ideas forged a strong national identity that helped Ghana escape the ethnic strife of many of its neighbors. Still, Mr. Nkrumah’s poorly planned efforts to quickly build an industrial economy drained the country’s treasury and hobbled its growth, historians say. Multiparty democracy gave way to single-party rule. The economy collapsed.Mr. Nkrumah, once seen as a hero for all of Africa, was overthrown by the military in 1966, and few here mourned his departure. He was exiled to Guinea, and in 1972 he died an angry, bitter man.Ghana’s slide was emblematic of the continent’s slumping fortunes, especially when compared to booming Asian nations. Ghana won its independence the same year as Malaysia, another former British colony. But 50 years later, Ghana remains among the poorest nations of the world, while Malaysia is far ahead of it in many measures of development, including per capita income, life expectancy, literacy and school enrollment. This African giant, it seemed, had feet of clay.Like many countries on the continent, Ghana stumbled through seasons of shaky civilian government and iron-fisted military rule, only to emerge in 1992 as a multiparty democracy once again.Jerry Rawlings, the dashing and sometimes ruthless air force flight lieutenant who had first seized power in a coup in 1979, voluntarily gave up his military uniform and ran in elections. He won two four-year terms and stepped aside in 2000 when constitutional term limits barred him from running again.Ghana again became a bellwether of African progress, helping usher in an era of hope for peace and prosperity across the continent. But lately there have been signs of trouble.The country has become a hub of the growing cocaine trade between Latin America and Europe, and there have been indications from investigators that some government officials may have been involved. Corruption is widely perceived to be on the rise. Despite the economic growth, many people here say the wealth is not shared.“This government has only been looking out for itself,” said Taikoo Aiyte, a 35-year-old fisherman at the edge of Jamestown, this city’s oldest quarter. “The government lets big foreign trawlers take all the fish, and we are left with almost nothing. They raise the price of fuel so we make less money. We need change.”Indeed, the success of the opposition in the parliamentary elections was a surprising blow to the governing party. Across Accra, the capital, taxi drivers, shopkeepers and laborers exchange a finger-rolling gesture that is the universally acknowledged shorthand for the opposition’s slogan: change.But in Accra’s sleek new shopping mall, where the country’s small but growing middle class can buy flat-screen TVs, brand-name sneakers and plush imported furniture to a jangling soundtrack of Christmas carols, voters were more optimistic about the country’s current state.“Ghana’s future is very bright,” said Larry Oppong-Attah, a 19-year-old student. As he tapped out text messages on a shiny Samsung cellphone, he said he hoped for a career in marketing. The current government, he said, was on the right track.“Things have been going well,” Mr. Oppong-Attah said. “Why change what is working?”Whoever wins, there are reasons to worry that Ghana’s star will dim even more. Both parties have promised a raft of public spending, paid for by recent offshore oil discoveries. But the low price of oil may scuttle plans to drill. Gold is also essential to the country’s economy, and as with all commodities, its price has experienced some steep drops in recent months.“If you look at democracy as what a country offers its people, there are many questions to be asked,” said Mr. Graham, the writer. “In Ghana we have growing inequality, an economy that is not creating jobs, and young people do not see a future here. By that standard, prospects for the future are not necessarily so bright.”'"
"'08-12-23,'0','On April 24, a day after our last British show, a British Airways ticket office in London was blown up; the British had allowed Mr. Reagan to stage the attack on Mr. Qaddafi from British air bases.That afternoon, I found myself boarding a British Airways flight from Birmingham in England to Amsterdam. I was sick as a dog, fighting a severe upper respiratory infection. I could barely make it to the plane.As our jet taxied down the runway for takeoff, we came to a sudden halt. The pilot announced that a last-minute baggage count did not coincide with the passenger manifest, giving them reason to believe there might be a bomb on board.We deplaned in the middle of the runway via a set of rollout stairs, and the baggage compartment was unloaded on the tarmac next to us. Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought out to canvas the entire plane and all luggage for explosives. I stood in the pouring rain with a British Air official holding an umbrella over my head.At that point, I was so sick I didn’t really care what happened to me and my thought patterns were a little erratic. I actually started to wonder: if bomb sniffing dogs have a cold, and can’t smell the C4 explosive, what good are they?After nearly two hours, the root of the baggage discrepancy was uncovered. It was just a mistake.Every passenger and every piece of luggage was allowed back on board.As I buckled myself in, the captain made an announcement I will never forget. Very calmly, he stated, “Ladies and gentlemen, we are so sorry for the inconvenience, but here at British Airways we have a motto: better late than dead on time.”Two days later, on April 26, as we drove to Paris for our final show of the tour, Chernobyl exploded.Check the dates. This is all true, and two decades later I still can freak myself out about it.As all of these events were transpiring and we’re going about our tour, the only thing I really wanted to do was to get home and get on my couch.Right before the tour started, I got a huge royalty check and I splurged about 10 grand on this huge, tricolor leather couch. It arrived the day we left for the show. I didn’t even get a chance to sit on it.I was thinking about it the whole time I was on tour. With the way the world was going, I figured something bad was going to happen to me while on this tour and I’d never get home to try out that couch.It was kind of a ridiculous thing to think about, but anyone who spends a lot of time on the road can tell you that you start to miss a lot of things that other people just take for granted.I loved that couch. And I did eventually get to spend some quality time on it. That is, until I got divorced, and my ex-wife took it with her.'"
"'08-12-23,'0','John P. Holdren has spent decades wrestling with ways to reduce planet-scale risks — notably the spread of nuclear weapons and the buildup of greenhouse gases.Now Dr. Holdren has been tapped to be the science adviser to President-elect Barack Obama, who pledged on Saturday to listen to such advice “especially when it’s inconvenient.”Many longtime friends, and some critics, of Dr. Holdren said his dogged nature and passion for the power of science would make it hard for the president to renege on that pledge.In an interview, Dr. Holdren, a 64-year-old physicist and environmental policy professor at Harvard, said he was confident he would not have to fight to be heard. He noted that the position was being restored to the level of assistant to the president, on a par with the national security adviser.“President-elect Obama has made it absolutely clear that he is making science and technology one of the centerpieces of this administration,” Dr. Holdren said.With Dr. Holdren, Dr. Steven Chu as energy secretary and Carol M. Browner as a White House coordinator for energy and climate, Mr. Obama has chosen advocates for strong action against greenhouse gases. Each has supported a mix of market mechanisms like a legislated cap on emissions and a push to improve nonpolluting energy technology.'"
"'08-12-23,'0','Tallying the results, the researchers found that the college students told an average of two lies a day, community members one a day, and that most of the lies fell into the minor fib category. “I told him I missed him and thought about him every day when I really don’t think about him at all,” wrote one participant. “Said I sent the check this morning,” wrote another.In a follow-up study, the researchers asked participants to describe the worst lies they’d ever told, and then out came confessions of adultery, of defrauding an employer, of lying on a witness stand to protect an employer. When asked how they felt about their lies, many described being haunted with guilt, but others confessed that once they realized they’d gotten away with a whopper, why, they did it again, and again.In truth, it’s all too easy to lie. In more than 100 studies, researchers have asked participants questions like, Is the person on the videotape lying or telling the truth? Subjects guess correctly about 54 percent of the time, which is barely better than they’d do by flipping a coin. Our lie suggests to some researchers a human desire to be deceived, a preference for the stylishly accoutred fable over the naked truth.“There’s a counterintuitive motivation not to detect lies, or we would have become much better at it,” said Angela Crossman, an assistant professor of psychology at the . “But you may not really want to know that the dinner you just cooked stinks, or even that your spouse is cheating on you.”The natural world is rife with humbug and fish tales, of things not being what they seem. Harmless viceroy butterflies mimic toxic monarch butterflies, parent draw predators away from the nest by feigning a broken wing, angler fish lure prey with appendages that wiggle like worms.Biologists distinguish between such cases of innate or automatic deception, however, and so-called tactical deception, the use of a normal behavior in a novel situation, with the express purpose of misleading an observer. Tactical deception requires considerable behavioral suppleness, which is why it’s most often observed in the brainiest animals.Great apes, for example, make great fakers. Frans B. M. de Waal, a professor at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center and , said chimpanzees or orangutans in captivity sometimes tried to lure human strangers over to their enclosure by holding out a piece of straw while putting on their friendliest face.“People think, Oh, he likes me, and they approach,” Dr. de Waal said. “And before you know it, the ape has grabbed their ankle and is closing in for the bite. It’s a very dangerous situation.”Apes wouldn’t try this on their own kind. “They know each other too well to get away with it,” Dr. de Waal said. “Holding out a straw with a sweet face is such a cheap trick, only a naïve human would fall for it.”Apes do try to deceive one another. Chimpanzees grin when they’re nervous, and when rival adult males approach each other, they sometimes take a moment to turn away and close their grins with their hands. Similarly, should a young male be courting a female and spot the alpha male nearby, the subordinate chimpanzee will instantly try to cloak his amorous intentions by dropping his hands over his erection.Rhesus monkeys are also artful dodgers. “There’s a long set of studies showing that the monkeys are very good at stealing from us,” said Laurie R. Santos, an associate professor of psychology at .Reporting recently in Animal Behavior, Dr. Santos and her colleagues also showed that, after watching food being placed in two different boxes, one with merrily jingling bells on the lid and the other with bells from which the clappers had been removed, rhesus monkeys preferentially stole from the box with the silenced bells. “We’ve been hard-pressed to come up with an explanation that’s not mentalistic,” Dr. Santos said. “The monkeys have to make a generalization — I can hear these things, so they, the humans, can, too.”One safe generalization seems to be that humans are real suckers. After dolphin trainers at the Institute for Marine Mammals Studies in had taught the dolphins to clean the pools of trash by rewarding the mammals with a fish for every haul they brought in, one female dolphin figured out how to hide trash under a rock at the bottom of the pool and bring it up to the trainers one small piece at a time.We’re desperate to believe that what our loved ones say is true. And now we find otherwise. Oh, Flipper, et tu?'"
"'08-12-23,'0','A tongue-in-cheek comment by a Broadway advertising executive that seemed to come at the expense of Cleveland is now paying dividends for theatergoers from that city. In a report in The New York Times last week Nancy Coyne, chairwoman of the theater advertising agency Serino Coyne, said the decline in Broadway musicals would lead in the spring to an increase in straight plays, adding: “I think New Yorkers will come out for them once the tourists go away. We’re horrible snobs. We hate tourists from Cleveland.” Though the remark elicited the anger of some Clevelanders, it has also earned them free theater tickets: the musical “Chicago” will give a free ticket to any Cleveland resident (with government-issued photo ID) for Monday, Tuesday or Thursday evening performances in January. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Ms. Coyne would appear on Cleveland radio in January and February to give away tickets to other Broadway shows.'"
"'08-12-23,'0','“He’s not exactly my type,” she tells a girlfriend. “I mean, what if I have to introduce him to the executive editor at a Times event? He mispronounces words and doesn’t keep up with the news.”Chekhov’s Olga gets her comeuppance, like a character in an O. Henry story: her obsession with the imagined talents of her fellow social climbers eclipses her recognition of her husband’s true brilliance. As Dr. Dymov dies of diphtheria contracted from a patient, attending doctors snarl at Olga: “What a loss for science! Compare him with all of us. He was a great man, an extraordinary man! ... Merciful God, ... we shall never look on his like again.”I wish Chekhov had pushed deeper to explain that Olga grieves not for her husband, but for the lost status his eminence would have given her.Like the fictional Dr. Dymov, the real-life Charles King is of quiet excellence. He is full of decency and honor. He is trusted and beloved by the men he leads, and to the last, he will never betray their trust. He offers Ms. Canedy respectful, full-hearted adoration. She accepts his courtship, but still frets that he is beneath her.“I wondered if Charles could truly be happy married to a willful woman who earned considerably more than he did,” she writes.There is subtle parsing here of crosscurrents of race and class: both Ms. Canedy and Sergeant King have climbed beyond the sphere of their parents’ achievements and of their modest neighborhoods, but Ms. Canedy has scaled higher. Dare she turn around now and reach back for this man? The writer is hard on herself, letting the best light fall on Sergeant King.But, unlike Olga’s tale, Ms. Canedy’s narrative becomes a love story. Sergeant King’s goodness wins her heart. “Even though I still found it irritating when he mispronounced a word, I had grown to love his mind.” Not all great love stories are ignited by the lightning bolt of love at first glance; this humbler I’m-going-to-talk-myself-into-this-good-man version is believable and real.They hope to marry, but now time is short. George W. Bush is elected; the twin towers fall; the White House purveys false assertions of weapons of mass destruction; Iraq is invaded; Sergeant King is called up. The two cling to each other whenever he can find time away from training his troops. The couple conceive a baby, then Sergeant King leaves for Iraq. In his duffel bag he carries one of Ms. Canedy’s last gifts to him, a new-father’s journal.Sergeant King will leave Iraq only once, for two weeks, to meet his 5-month-old son, Jordan. He does not speak of the war. Instead the new parents nestle with their jolly boy and try not to count off the days. Sergeant King writes in his journal every night, committing a lifetime of wisdom to its pages, in case he fails to return to raise Jordan. The father’s journal forms the backbone of this memoir. (It was also the subject of a Times article by Ms. Canedy in 2007, “From Father to Son, Last Words to Live By.”)On his last visit Sergeant King presents Ms. Canedy with a painting he has made: a self-portrait of a man with angel’s wings, kneeling before God. She shoves it back at him in a panic. They say goodbye, then each stands alone and sobs — Ms. Canedy in her apartment, Sergeant King (she learns later) in the lobby. On Oct. 14, 2006, Sgt. Charles King is killed when an improvised explosive device rips through his Humvee.There are no politics here, no accusations against the Bush White House. Ms. Canedy, having fallen in love with a career soldier, respects his sense of duty too much to rail against his orders. But “A Journal for Jordan” is impossible to read without a sense of bitter knowledge that this principled man fell at the behest of leaders less guided by honor. That is no trick O. Henry ending. It is a denouement full of suffering, worthy of Chekhov.'"
"'08-12-23,'0','“Bush v. Gore introduced an important idea,” Professor Issacharoff said. “It is that the political process has rules, the rules have to be fairly applied and that those rules need to be known up front.”Bush v. Gore was, for instance, unapologetically at the heart of a unanimous decision last month from the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in , allowing a comprehensive challenge to voting systems to move forward. The three-judge panel acknowledged the Supreme Court’s admonition about the limited precedential value of Bush v. Gore. Nonetheless, the panel said, “we find it relevant here.”What Bush v. Gore means, the panel said, quoting from the decision itself, is that once a state grants the right to vote on equal terms, it may not “by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person’s vote over that of another.” Forcing people in some parts of the state to wait many hours to vote as a consequence of the arbitrary allocation of voting machines, for instance, would violate the core principle in Bush v. Gore, the panel said.It is possible, of course, to read Bush v. Gore more narrowly than that. The case did, after all, emerge from authentically peculiar circumstances. It may be that the decision means only something like this: A court-supervised statewide recount violates equal protection guarantees when it treats similar ballots differently by instructing local officials to use new and insufficiently specified standards.But even versions of that narrower reading are turning out to have a practical impact.Bush v. Gore was front and center in the briefs and arguments last week in the Supreme Court’s consideration of the recount litigation in the Senate race between and . The candidates’ briefs cited the case some 20 times, arguing in earnest detail about how the Supreme Court’s understanding of the role of equal protection in election administration applied in Minnesota.“Bush v. Gore has a future,” said Edward B. Foley, an election-law specialist at . “We’re now starting to see it. There is a sense, eight years later, that some of the initial reaction was an overreaction.”In the early days, of course, the case was mocked as illegitimate in both its reasoning and its result. “That was so completely the prevailing wisdom” in the law schools, Professor Issacharoff said, “that there were even challenges as to whether Bush v. Gore could be taught as a serious case.”Many judges flatly refused to consider the decision as precedent for anything, relying on the Supreme Court’s admonition and a more general unease. No Supreme Court opinion, including concurrences and dissents, has ever cited Bush v. Gore.“It hasn’t been cited even in cases where it should have been cited,” said Richard L. Hasen, who teaches election law at Loyola Law School in and is the author of “The Untimely Death of Bush v. Gore,” published last year in The Stanford Law Review. “The case is radioactive. Anyone who touches it knows he’s playing with something very dangerous.”Indeed, when the Ninth Circuit cited the case in March 2001, it was to justify its own assertion that one of its rulings was “valid only in this case.”But the law is ordinarily understood as a system of neutral principles consistently applied. “To provide a reason for a decision,” Frederick Schauer wrote in The Stanford Law Review in 1995, “is to include that decision within a principle of greater generality than the decision itself.”To be sure, courts sometimes limit earlier decisions to their facts, which robs them of precedential force and essentially overrules them. But what the Supreme Court did in Bush v. Gore was “historically unique,” Chad Flanders wrote in The Yale Law Journal last year. “No other majority in the history of the court,” Mr. Flanders wrote, “has applied limiting language to the very case being decided.”Other scholars say the court’s admonition was a routine caution that the decision, issued very quickly, should be read narrowly, not that it should be ignored entirely.Until the recent Sixth Circuit decision, the most important invocation of Bush v. Gore by a federal appeals court probably came in a 2006 case decided by a different panel of the same court. The decision was later vacated as moot by the full court, but the testy interaction of the panel’s judges remains instructive.The dissenting judge on the three-judge panel criticized his colleagues for relying on “the Supreme Court’s murky decision in Bush v. Gore” in a case about the use of punch-card ballots in Ohio. The judge, Ronald Lee Gilman, pointed to the one-ride-only language and what he called the Supreme Court majority’s ideological inconsistency and lack of intellectual seriousness.The judges in the majority were having none of that. “Murky, transparent, illegitimate, right, wrong, big, tall, short or small,” they wrote, “regardless of the adjective one might use to describe the decision, the proper noun that precedes it — ‘Supreme Court’ — carries more weight with us.”“Whatever else Bush v. Gore may be,” Judge Boyce F. Martin Jr. wrote for the majority, “it is first and foremost a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States and we are bound to adhere to it.”'"
"'08-12-23,'0','The drugstore operator Walgreen said on Monday that its profit fell 10 percent in its first quarter, short of Wall Street expectations, because of the costs of opening more than 200 stores.The company said it planned to slow store opening to save $500 million in response to the recession.Walgreen said it earned $408 million, or 41 cents a share, in the three months ended Nov. 30. That fell short of analyst expectations, and compares with $456 million, or 46 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue grew 7 percent, to $14.95 billion.Analysts expected 46 cents a share and $15.08 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.Walgreen said its selling and general expenses grew 9 percent in the quarter as it opened 212 stores, and profit margins dipped because of greater expense provisions.Sales at its older stores grew 1.7 percent, with prescription revenue in older stores growing 2.6 percent. Front-end revenue, or sales of nonprescription products, was flat compared with last year, showing some resilience in a down economy.The company said prescriptions filled grew 3.7 percent in the quarter, while industry data has showed falling prescriptions for its rivals. In total, 66 percent of Walgreen’s revenue came from prescription sales.At stores open at least one year, prescriptions filled were roughly flat with last year. More customers filled 90-day prescriptions instead of 30-day orders, however, leading to adjusted growth of 1.5 percent.'"
"'08-12-23,'0','This directly contradicts statements by the interior minister, Jawad al-Bolani, who said that the inquiry was about a terrorist operation against the ministry as well as ties to Al Awda.Mr. Waili said the interior minister had been fully aware of all the charges throughout the investigation, but Mr. Bolani said in an interview on Friday that the most serious charges came as a surprise to him. Mr. Waili also said that government investigators had given Mr. Bolani the forged badges and identification cards for forensic analysis but that the minister had done nothing with them.The Interior Ministry has been a source of anxiety for the Maliki government for a number of reasons. It has a history of being associated with the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, a powerful Shiite party that is a rival to the Dawa party of the prime minister and that pushed for Mr. Bolani’s candidacy for interior minister in 2006. Mr. Bolani also created his own party, the secular Iraqi Constitutional Party, though he said he relinquished his leadership position when he became the interior minister.Also on Monday, a special session of Parliament was called to vote on the dismissal of the Parliament speaker, Mahmoud al-Mashhadani. After a rowdy session of Parliament last week at which he was accused of hurling serious insults, Mr. Mashhadani resigned but then later rescinded his resignation.While there appears to be significant support for his dismissal, the vote was postponed to give party leaders time to discuss their options, including who would replace him, said Ahmed Abdulsattar, a member of Tawafiq, Mr. Mashhadani’s own bloc.“As Tawafiq, we suggested him to be speaker, and we’ve supported him twice before in the same kind of crisis,” said Mr. Abdulsattar, who added that other lawmakers said they would boycott the Parliament if Mr. Mashhadani remained speaker. This time, he said, “we’ve reached a dead end.”Also in Parliament, a vote on a resolution that would allow British, Australian and other foreign troops to stay on Iraqi soil after the end of the year was postponed until the issue with the speaker is worked out.Meanwhile, the trial of Muntader al-Zaidi, the reporter who was arrested for throwing his shoes at President Bush last week, was scheduled to begin on Dec. 31 at the Central Criminal Court of Iraq, one of his brothers said. The Central Criminal Court is a special court set up to address serious criminal charges. The lawyers for Mr. Zaidi are trying to transfer the case to another court, said the brother, Maytham al-Zaidi.In a television interview on Sunday, another of the reporter’s brothers said Mr. Zaidi had been tortured while being held.But Abdulsattar al-Berikdar, the spokesman of the Supreme Judicial Council, said Mr. Zaidi “did not ask to be submitted to a medical committee and did not tell the judge that he was tortured or register a complaint against anyone.” The spokesman added, “If he had, then of course the court would take the suitable procedure.”'"

"'08-12-23,'0','With no economic data scheduled for Monday, and very little by way of corporate earnings expected this week, some analysts expect investors to wade back into the market in search of bargains as the year comes to a close.Light, sweet crude rose 34 cents to $42.70 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.In the markets, Toyota is perceived as one of the world’s best manufacturers — and if it is experiencing times as bad as it says, then others will likely fare even worse, the reasoning goes.Industrial orders data for the euro-zone earlier confirmed that manufacturing activity fell sharply in October and added to the evidence that the recession in the 15-nation single currency zone is deepening.Eurostat revealed that industrial orders plunged by a monthly 4.7 percent in October for a 15.1 percent year-on-year decline. Most countries posted declines including industrial heavyweights Germany and France.Earlier, Asian markets were mixed as Friday’s announcement from the outgoing Bush administration to extend General Motors and Chrysler $17.4 billion in loans brought a measure of relief to some investors.But early gains in Asia soon faded amid worries about the American and global outlook, as well as shrinking demand for Asian-made products like cars and electronics that keep the region’s economies growing, analysts said. In Japan, new figures showed a record 26.7 percent plunge in exports last month compared to a year ago.“The big question about what’s going to happen with the big U.S. automakers has been settled for now,” said D.

The Dow fell 25.88 points, or 0.30 percent, to 8,579.11, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 2.60 points, or 0.29 percent, to 887.88.'"
"'08-12-23,'0','MOSCOW — The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced Monday that it would end its 16-year mission in Georgia early next year because it had been unable to resolve a deadlock with Russia over whether to treat the separatist enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations.The mission has overseen negotiations between clashing sides in South Ossetia since 1992, and it now has a staff of 200, including 28 trained military monitors. The region is also currently patrolled by 200 unarmed civilian monitors from the European Union, whose work will continue.Russia is the only one of the organization’s 56 member states that has formally recognized the enclaves, but the organization works by consensus. At a meeting on Monday at O.S.C.E. headquarters in Vienna, Russia’s envoy to the organization refused to agree to extend the Georgia mission, which expires Dec. 31, unless the 55 other members agreed that South Ossetia and Abkhazia were independent countries.In an interview, the Russian ambassador to the organization, Anvar Azimov, called his counterparts “inflexible and unconstructive” for refusing to join Russia in recognizing the enclaves.“In my opinion, my colleagues do not want to recognize an evident fact,” he said. “Sooner or later, they will understand that this is the reality.

"'08-12-24,'1','On Tuesday, the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research group at George Washington University, published an online edition of transcripts of 15,000 Kissinger phone calls from 1969 to 1977, fully indexed and searchable for the first time. A selection was posted on the archive’s Web site, nsarchive.org, and the full collection is available to subscribers, which include many university libraries.Some Kissinger transcripts are posted on the State Department’s Web site, but for a comprehensive look at the collection, researchers have had to travel to the National Archives, in College Park, Md.“They were in 30 more-or-less chronological boxes,” said William Burr, who has overseen the publication for the National Security Archive. “It was pretty daunting.”Mr. Burr said the Kissinger calls “rank right up there with the Nixon tapes as the most candid, revealing and valuable trove of records on the exercise of executive power.”The indexing, the work of three researchers for more than two years, presented some puzzles. Names dropped casually in conversation — “Hal” or “Fred” — had to be identified. And what a government transcriber had heard as “Nelson’s tongue,” in a 1971 call, turned out to be “Mao Zedong.”The collection covers many serious policy matters, like Vietnam strategy, but includes a few calls memorable because they are so bizarre.In April 1971, Mr. Kissinger accepted a call from the beat poet Allen Ginsberg, who hoped to arrange a meeting between top Nixon administration officials and antiwar activists.“Perhaps you don’t know how to get out of the war,” Ginsberg ventured.Mr. Kissinger said he was open to a meeting. “I like to do this,” he said, “not just for the enlightenment of the people I talk to, but to at least give me a feel of what concerned people think.”Then Ginsberg upped the ante. “It would be even more useful if we could do it naked on television,” he said.In 1977, after completing his tenure as secretary of state at the end of the Ford administration, Mr. Kissinger left his telephone records to the Library of Congress as private papers, not to be opened until after his death.But after the National Security Archive threatened litigation to open them up, the National Archives and the State Department asked Mr. Kissinger for copies, which he turned over in 2002.The transcripts have gradually been declassified and released since then, although those of some 800 Kissinger calls from the Ford years are still being withheld by the State Department.The presidential historian Robert Dallek, who drew heavily on the Kissinger materials for his 2007 book, “Nixon and Kissinger: Partners in Power,” said the tapes made by Presidents John F. Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon had been an indispensable source for historians. He said there was nothing comparable from the presidencies of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Bill Clinton or, so far as he knows, George W. Bush.The earlier tapes scared off later presidents from risking the candor of recordings, Mr. Dallek said, but at a cost to history.“I worry that we’re going to see a somewhat impoverished record on Clinton and Bush,” he said. “There’s no substitute for having their exact words.”'"
"'08-12-24,'1','With assets of $125 billion and a client base of wealthy individuals, families and institutions that reach from Qatar to Uruguay to Russia and throughout Europe, it is one of Switzerland’s biggest pipelines for channeling client money into hedge funds worldwide.About six years ago, that business, known as a fund of funds, began to rake in larger fees when it decided to set up a vehicle called M-Invest Ltd to funnel cash to Mr. Madoff’s firm.Through this relationship, UBP claimed it was able to gain close insight into Mr. Madoff’s investment operations, through copies of trade tickets and an unusual degree of access granted by Mr. Madoff himself to UBP’s representatives, according to a confidential internal letter sent to investors on Dec. 17, obtained by The New York Times.The memorandum, while seeking to reassure investors, could raise questions about why UBP, unlike others who claimed to have seen red flags, did not use its access to delve more deeply into the unusually consistent annual returns that Mr. Madoff’s funds were reporting.According to the memo, “We have met with Bernard Madoff and various principals several times at Madoff’s office, twice within the last year, and have had numerous conversations in between.” The letter stated that several of UBP’s senior investment professionals met with Mr. Madoff in 2004 and 2007, and that UBP’s structured risk analysis unit “had a full review in 2006 and recently in 2008 with Madoff himself.”The UBP letter acknowledges some concerns over how Mr. Madoff’s firm combined investment management and brokerage services. But the Geneva bank said it “found comfort” in the fact that the firm was subject to “routine” audits by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Finra, another securities regulator, as well as “Madoff’s longstanding reputation in building Wall Street’s markets infrastructure.” M-Invest was regulated by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, where it was incorporated.UBP was also closely tied to Fairfield Greenwich Group, the New York investment company that was the single biggest gatherer of money for Mr. Madoff, sending $7.3 billion his way and collecting more than $500 million in fees as a result.Michael de Picciotto, a nephew of the founder and a top executive of UBP, is a close friend of Andrés Piedrahita, a son-in-law of Walter Noel, the founder of Fairfield Greenwich. Mr. Piedrahita played a key role in raising much of the money from Europe and South America that ended up with Mr. Madoff.UBP was the also main investment adviser, custodian and leverage provider to Fairfield’s huge fund of funds business and Mr. de Picciotto in turn was a key adviser to Fairfield, according to an internal document prepared by Fairfield last year for a potential buyer of the firm. In addition, UBP is listed as the sixth-largest investor in Fairfield’s funds, for which the bank provided “qualitative and quantitative research and operational due diligence,” according to the letter.At one point, the letter boasted that Mr. de Picciotto could provide insight into UBP’s investment and asset allocation strategy. Through these connections, UBP became entwined with Mr. Madoff’s investments even as competitors like Société Générale, which turned up a series of red flags during routine due diligence in 2003 at Mr. Madoff’s New York headquarters, steered clear.“Ultimately, these people were blind to what was going on,” said Michel Dominicé, a veteran Geneva hedge fund manager with $200 million under management.He said the links between UBP, Fairfield Greenwich and Mr. Madoff, as well as the hundreds of millions in fees the firms earned by steering money to Madoff investments, pointed to conflicts of interests that penalize investors.Mr. Dominicé was himself approached by a salesman for Madoff investments three years ago but declined to invest, saying he could not figure out how Mr. Madoff earned such steady returns, month after month. “It just didn’t make sense,” he said.As for the fees earned by UBP and Fairfield Greenwich, Mr. Dominicé said: “If you’re nasty, you call it corruption. If you want to be more polite, you can call it a lack of professional consciousness.”A spokesman for UBP declined to comment. But Christophe Bernard, a top executive responsible for asset management at UBP, told a Swiss newspaper last week: “We did what was necessary.”As recently as Nov. 25, representatives of UBP met with Mr. Madoff himself in New York according to the interview, which appeared in Le Temps, a Geneva newspaper. “So how can we be reproached?,” Mr. Bernard asked. “We are victims of a massive fraud, like several other banks and financial companies throughout the world.”He went on to defend the bank’s financial soundness and said UBP, which did not invest in Mr. Madoff’s fund on its own behalf, was “not affected and remains top class.”To be sure, $700 million in exposure cited by UBP is only a tiny fraction of the $125 billion under management by the bank. UBP also reported a $331 million gross profit in the first half of 2008, up 5.8 percent from a year ago.But for UBP, the headlines have cast a shadow on a reputation that seemed to soar as high as the nearby Alps.For all of its growth — UBP has roughly 1,300 employees worldwide — the bank remains a family affair. Edgar de Picciotto is the chairman and principal shareholder, although he has given day-to-day responsibilities to his son Guy de Picciotto, the chief executive, and several other family members.On Tuesday, as many Swiss bankers prepared to head for the slopes for vacation until after New Year’s, a Christmas tree glimmered beside the gold colored entrance to UBP, where visitors are greeted in a reception area of black marble, red leather benches and a large golden globe.In the tight-knit world of Swiss wealth management, experts acknowledged it was a public relations disaster for UBP, but defended the bank’s decision-making.“It’s not the kind of publicity you seek,” said Michel Derobert, secretary general of the Swiss Private Bankers Association. Because it is a private corporation rather than a partnership, Mr. Derobert’s association does not include UBP, but works with the bank from time to time.“It’s not nice,” he said. “But it would be surprising in a city like Geneva, where people take of care of clients who seek low risk and steady returns, not to be affected by this kind of case.”'"
"'08-12-24,'1','Re “Downturn Will Test Obama’s Vision for an Energy-Efficient Auto Industry” (news article, Dec. 21):There are two conceptually simple things that Barack Obama could do to force Detroit into making environmentally friendly cars. As many have said, a floor price for gasoline must be set, say between $3.50 and $4 per gallon.As politically impossible as this sounds, it’s absolutely necessary. If the history of gasoline prices has proved anything, it’s that high fuel costs will change the habits of people and governments.Also, the government should pledge to buy from Detroit, at a steep discount, a lot of its new fuel-efficient models. It’s time for the government to walk the efficiency walk, and one way to do this would be to replace its fleet by 2015 with American-made, fuel-efficient vehicles of every design, size and purpose.Together, these steps would help ensure that Detroit, once reorganized, has viable markets for its new-fangled products.

"'08-12-24,'1','Although the F.D.A. had reviewed other studies, only the two multigenerational ones met its guidelines for determining safety for human consumption, said Dr. Mitchell Cheeseman, deputy director of the agency’s Office of Food Additive Safety.“I don’t want to suggest that published studies are not valuable to F.D.A.’s safety assessment — they are,” Dr. Cheeseman said. “But they lacked details about how the study was done, they don’t include all the raw data, so independent auditing can’t be done by agency scientists, and they have a variety of protocol limitations.”The F.D.A.’s science board subcommittee on BPA, however, after receiving comments from an independent advisory panel, determined that the F.D.A. was wrong to disregard the large body of research showing health effects even at extremely low doses. The agency’s decision to reconsider was made public earlier this month.“This was the F.D.A. finally acknowledging that its assertion that BPA is safe may not be correct,” said Dr. Anila Jacob, a physician and senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, a Washington-based advocacy group. “Still, we don’t think it’s enough. With millions of babies being exposed to this chemical on a daily basis, every day we continue to delay removing this chemical from baby products is another day millions of infants continue to be exposed.”Makers of BPA say that the chemical poses no known risk to human health.Some manufacturers have begun introducing products for infants and children that are BPA-free, but BPA-containing polycarbonate bottles are still widely available. Shannon Jenest, a spokeswoman for the consumer lifestyle division of Philips, one of the world’s largest producers of reusable baby bottles (under the Avent brand name), said that the company would rather let consumers “decide what works for their family.” Philips manufacturers Avent products with, and without, the chemical.Although Philips has made no public announcement, the manufacturer recently notified retailers that it will no longer accept orders for polycarbonate baby bottles after Dec. 31. But the manufacturer has not pulled its polycarbonate bottles from store shelves. “If you’re not melting the bottle in the microwave,” Ms. Jenest said, “then we don’t believe there’s an issue with bottles that contain BPA.”More than 2 billion pounds of BPA are produced each year. According to the Can Manufacturers Institute, more than 22 billion cans to be used for food and more than 100 billion cans for beer and soft drinks were produced last year. John Rost, a chemist and chair of the North American Metal Packaging Alliance, says “the vast majority” of them are lined with a resin coating containing BPA.The Environmental Protection Agency has calculated that adults and infants can consume 50 micrograms of BPA per kilogram of body weight every day over a lifetime with little appreciable risk of harm. Yet more than 40 studies have found health effects in rodents fed as little as 0.2 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, according to Frederick S. vom Saal, a reproductive endocrinologist at the University of Missouri, Columbia, and a leading BPA researcher.Exposure to BPA is widespread. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found it in the urine of nearly 93 percent of a sample population.'"
"'08-12-24,'1','For weeks, the Red Sox were seen as the favorites to land Teixeira, a powerful 28-year-old switch-hitter who is also an excellent fielder. They had made him their prime target of the off-season and did not budge from their pursuit even as the Yankees closed in on two highly coveted starting pitchers, the left-handed Sabathia and the right-handed A. J. Burnett, signing them for a combined $243.5 million.Let the Yankees pay a fortune for pitching, the Red Sox seemed to reason. They would save their money for the safer bet, Teixeira, a player less likely than a pitcher to encounter a serious injury over the course of a long contract. Closing in on an apparent deal, John Henry, Boston’s owner, and Theo Epstein, the team’s general manager, traveled to Texas last Thursday to meet with Teixeira and his agent, Scott Boras.The Red Sox were believed to be offering a contract for perhaps eight years at a figure close to $170 million. Teixeira would become the big bat in the Boston lineup to replace the departed Manny Ramírez. But instead of an announcement that a deal had been reached, Henry sent an e-mail message to reporters in which he said the Red Sox were not going to be a factor in the bidding because of other, higher offers that Boras cited.Henry’s message was perceived as more of a ploy than anything else, an attempt to call Boras’s bluff that there were indeed better offers from one or more of Teixeira’s other major suitors — the Los Angeles Angels, the Washington Nationals and the Baltimore Orioles.Boras is the most prominent agent in baseball and often the most confounding for teams to deal with. He aims high, battles for every last dollar, takes his time reaching agreements and often cites offers for his players that rival teams question.In turn, the Red Sox, under Henry, Epstein and Larry Lucchino, the team president, have developed a reputation as a team that spends but also draws a line in contract negotiations, regardless of the player involved.That unsentimental, even stubborn, stance led to the departure in recent seasons of two fan favorites — Pedro Martínez and Johnny Damon — and nearly led to the loss of a third, Mike Lowell.In this instance, the Red Sox continued talking to Boras about Teixeira and, according to The Boston Herald, increased their bid slightly. But that was about all Boston would do, even though it knew the risk involved in challenging Boras.Boras, meanwhile, proceeded to do what he has done in other standoffs — he went to the Yankees, who until that point had not pursued Teixeira aggressively. As much as they appreciated his abilities, even they were leery of how much he would cost.But the Yankees are the Yankees, with resources others don’t have, and as they saw the opening left by the Red Sox they started doing the math. They were the team that snared Damon from Boston in December 2005 with a four-year arranged by Boras, and by early Tuesday morning they were the team back at it with Boras again, negotiating for a player who has few, if any, flaws.The person with knowledge of the talks between Boras and the Yankees’ general manger, Brian Cashman, said the deal was done by about 3 p.m., giving the Yankees a player who hit .308 last season with 33 home runs and 121 runs batted in while playing for the Atlanta Braves and the Angels. He will combine with Rodriguez to give the Yankees a revised, but still imposing, middle of the order.For Cashman, the deal represents a quick, and adept, shift in strategy. He had emphasized pitching in the current off-season even though the 2008 Yankee lineup scored nearly 200 fewer runs than the 2007 version and even though two key hitters — Jason Giambi and Bobby Abreu — were leaving via free agency. But the addition of Teixeira should address any offensive concerns.The Yankees will now have to brace for criticism from within baseball over their spending. “At the rate the Yankees are going, I’m not sure anyone can compete with them,” the Milwaukee Brewers’ owner, Mark Attanasio, said in an e-mail message to Bloomberg News. “Frankly, the sport might need a salary cap.”The Yankees are also likely to make roster moves in an attempt to absorb some of the cost of Teixeira’s contract and attempt to keep the 2009 payroll under $200 million. With nearly $90 million coming off the payroll with the departures of Giambi, Abreu, Mike Mussina and others, the Yankees felt that was a realistic goal, and it still may be.But to cut expenditures, the Yankees may have to consider trading Hideki Matsui, who is going into the final year of a four-year, $52 million deal, or the recently arrived Nick Swisher, who is due $21 million over the next three seasons.Another, more somber, option involves Andy Pettitte, to whom the Yankees have a standing 2009 contract offer of $10 million, a marked pay cut from the $16 million he made last season. It is possible the Yankees may withdraw that offer, say goodbye to Pettitte for the second time in the last five seasons and look for a cheaper option to fill out their rotation.Even the Yankees, standing apart from the rest of baseball with their spending, are not averse to bargains.'"
"'08-12-24,'1','To train aspiring competitors, Merchant set up a camp here on the Susitna Flats, about 28 miles southwest of Wasilla. At a cost of $750, he promised five days of survival training designed to toughen the qualified and to break the rest.Merchant, 55, has taken to calling his race an invitational so he can refuse entry to the unfit. The participants will pay $900 to compete. First prize is free entry the next year. There is no second prize. Along the way the racers can expect little more than three 10-pound food drops. They are required to haul their own survival gear.The invitational evolved from a collection of shorter skiing, hiking and biking contests promoted under names like the Iditasport and the Extreme. By eliminating overnight stops and tripling the distance, organizers of the invitational reimagined the race as a largely unattended free-for-all intended to restore a sense of adventure.“After I did it the first time it turned into almost an obsession, one of those things you think about year-round,” said Peter Basinger, 28, who won the Iditarod Trail Invitational last year with a time of 18 days 4 hours 33 minutes. Speaking by telephone from his home in Land O’ Lakes, Wis., Basinger added: “People need to come into it knowing that it’s unlike anything else, in that you really could get hurt out there. You really are on your own.”In nine years of racing, only 28 men and 2 women have completed the full route to Nome, including Tim Hewitt, a lawyer from Latrobe, Pa., who reached the finish on foot in 2001, 2004 and 2008. About 90 percent of the entrants have dropped out along the trail.Only seven racers have registered for the 2009 contest, including Hewitt and Basinger. Partly to generate future entries, the organizers have continued to operate a simultaneous 350-mile race ending in the village of McGrath, about a third of the way to the finish. For this shorter course, 43 men and women have entered under the flags of Britain, Japan, Spain, Australia, Italy, Germany, the United States and (separately) Alaska.For the early December training session, four racers arrived. There was Aidan Harding, 30, a mountain biker from Princes Risborough, England. Despite his lack of experience on snow, Harding was considered a serious racing prospect. There was George Azarias, a young Morgan Stanley banker from New York. A practiced hiker, Azarias had little cycling experience.And there were Jon and Denise Whyte, a married couple in their early 50s with five children from previous marriages. The Whytes, veteran distance racers, intended to ride a tandem bicycle of their own design. Though Merchant had sought to dispel them of that notion, he could not bring himself to refuse entry outright, largely on account of Jon Whyte’s reputation.Whyte, a successful veteran of Formula One auto racing crews, had left that sport to design a renowned line of full-suspension mountain bikes bearing his name. For the Iditarod trail, he had built a two-seated silver contraption with a single-wheeled trailer meant to bear the survival gear of a second rider without the additional drag of carving a second rut in the snow.As the late-November snowfall blanketed the strip malls of Wasilla, Merchant drove his charges in an unheated van to a remote parking lot. The racers piled rucksacks and bicycles into an eight-foot plastic bin hitched to the rear of a snowmobile. As the machine kicked up powder and exhaust, the racers made their way to a hilltop, where piles of snow had buried picnic tables.In warmer months this place would provide sanctuary for northern phalaropes, green-winged teal, sandhill cranes, godwits, whimbrels, snipe, dunlin and sandpipers. Its waters would yield hundreds upon hundreds of king salmon. But now the Matanuska-Susitna Valley was quiet. Moose and barred owls, hardy creatures, kept watch from a distance. Now and again a propeller plane flew overhead. The daytime temperatures failed to exceed zero.Merchant, a onetime cowboy and mechanic by trade, cut a blithe figure, seemingly oblivious to the icicles in his salt-and-pepper mustache. He deferred at times to his wife, Kathi Hirzinger-Merchant, a German immigrant more than two decades his junior and a fearless athlete who had cycled the course to Nome. Training camp opened with instructions on trail safety and etiquette.“The key to being safe if it’s really cold or the wind is blowing really bad,” Merchant said, “is having everything packed in a logical order, where you can find everything in the order you need it. It’s not just an inconvenience out here to not be able to find your stuff. It can cause you to lose fingers.”The racers practiced unpacking their bikes, melting snow for water and drying their clothes. They ate chocolate and pasta. At night they slept under the stars in thermal bags.On the third morning of camp Denise Whyte lost consciousness in her sleeping bag. Merchant carried her into the kitchen tent, where the racers assembled a makeshift convalescence bed of backpacks, sleeping bags and coats beside a portable wood stove.“Feel her cheek,” he said.“This one’s warm, but this one’s cold,” he said. “Strange.”Merchant said: “I’m not a doctor, but I’ve been a guide since 1979. Honestly, I believe what is wrong with her is nerves. Coming out here in the cold, and responding to it, out of her comfort zone.”The men touched her cheek again. No change.As a few hours of daylight backlighted the cloud cover, Hirzinger-Merchant led Harding and Azarias out for a 35-mile bike ride. The riders wore lamps on their foreheads like miners. Past a sign that read, “Do Not Enter,” they descended to a steep boat launch.Following the frozen river, the riders passed gnarled saplings that leaned inward from the banks. They turned uphill, over a narrow passage of chunky ice that narrowed again before opening to the whitewashed tundra. In the distance was a field of spindly pines. The grade of the trail rose, giving way to the grandeur of Mount Susitna. The riders stared down at the snow, pressed their gloves into the thermal bags attached to their handlebars and deposited their weight on their pedals.Back at the tent, Denise Whyte was stirring. Her husband offered a cup of melted snow. Together they decided to disassemble the tandem bicycle, catch a ride to Anchorage and fly home.“Well, this wasn’t quite the way we thought we’d be leaving this camp,” Jon Whyte said, packing his bags. “We’ve got five children. When I dragged you out of our bivy this morning, I thought, ‘What am I going to tell Doug?’ We can’t have that.”Denise Whyte took a long drink of the murky water.“We thought this would be the next challenge, so to speak,” she told her husband. “But it’s not, for me.”Outside the tent, Merchant was loading their tandem bicycle into the plastic bin hitched to his snowmobile.'"
"'08-12-24,'1','Prominent scholars in Hong Kong, which is controlled by China but enjoys greater freedoms than the mainland, also signed the letter.Mr. Liu, a 53-year-old literary critic who has directed the Independent Chinese PEN Center, a group of writers who advocate broader free speech, was taken by security officers from his home on the night of Dec. 8 and has not been heard from since.Human rights advocates say Mr. Liu has been made a target because he was one of the driving forces behind Charter 08, the recent manifesto demanding democratic reforms and accountability from the Communist Party that was signed by more than 300 Chinese and posted on the Internet.Others who signed the manifesto have also been detained and questioned. All except Mr. Liu have been released.The officers who detained him took computers, cellphones and personal papers from his home. His wife and other family members have received no word of his whereabouts or condition.The open letter to Mr. Hu says: “For the international community to take seriously China’s oft-stated commitment to respect human rights and the rule of law, and for China’s own citizens to trust the judicial system to redress legitimate grievances, it is urgent that China’s central leadership ensure that no one be arrested or harassed simply for the peaceful expression of his or her views.”The letter notes that although Mr. Liu has been detained in the past for several years, he has never been convicted of a crime.Mr. Baum, the political scientist at the University of California, circulated the petition on Chinapol, a Listserv managed by Mr. Baum that is read by many scholars of China. In an interview via e-mail, Mr. Baum said that he usually tried to avoid using the Listserv for political causes but that this case was different.“While I have always tried to maintain Chinapol’s political neutrality, some violations are so egregious that I cannot, as a sentient being, remain neutral,” he said in an e-mail message.Bruce Jacobs, a professor of Asian languages and studies at Monash University in Australia, said he signed the petition because “Liu was clearly arrested because of Charter 08.”Mr. Liu supported the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and continued his dissident writings afterward, work that led to his detention by the authorities. Starting in 1996, he spent three years doing hard labor for having “repeatedly stirred up trouble and disrupted public order.” Since 1999, he has been allowed to continue his activism, but has been under surveillance.Nicholas Bequelin, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, said that if Mr. Liu was formally arrested and charged, that would mean Chinese leaders wanted to show intellectuals that the Communist Party was hardening its line and was unwilling to tolerate any dissent.“He’s been detained before,” Mr. Bequelin said. “But if they send him to jail, that sends a political signal.”'"
"'08-12-24,'1','The CIT Group, the commercial lender, won preliminary approval on Tuesday to receive $2.33 billion under the government’s $700 billion financial bailout program.The announcement came a day after the Federal Reserve approved the company’s request to become a bank holding company in order to qualify for funds under the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program.Several commercial finance companies, hit by the financial crisis, have followed the same strategy. Bank holding company status also would allow CIT to borrow directly from the Fed’s discount window.“We continue to believe that CIT’s conversion to a bank holding company should substantially enhance the company’s financing platform over the longer term,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a research note.The CIT approval followed the company’s debt-for-equity swap last week, which was expected to raise $1.5 billion.Also on Tuesday, the credit card company, American Express, received preliminary approval to get $3.39 billion under the government’s $700 billion financial bailout program, the company in the United States said on Tuesday.'"

"'08-12-25,'0','“Pageant” goes behind the scenes, dreams, breakdowns, freakouts, sequins, glitter and fabulous falsies of the Miss Gay America pageant, an annual competition for female impersonators who are every bit as dedicated (and hysterical) as mainstream beauty queens.And they are also, within the context of drag, just as traditional as their scepter-wielding sisters. Not for these divas the punk-inflected stylings you find on the cutting edge of the drag scene. This is female impersonation of the old school: lip-synching, Hollywood glamour, Liza, Judy and Fosse, Fosse, Fosse!This classicism is not without its charm, and it’s touching, in a goofy sort of way, to see how seriously everyone takes it. Directed by Ron Davis and Stewart Halpern, “Pageant” follows a manicured handful of fiercely committed drag masters with their eyes on the prize: a tiara, scepter, seven grand in cash and the priceless claim on bragging rights as America’s queen supreme.Supported by family, friends and leopard-print stilettos, the hopefuls primp and tuck and rehearse their routines en route to the 34th competition in Memphis. The location inspires one contestant to call for a moment of silence for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, but for the most part the festivities are more in line with the pantomime by a plus-size diva (“Call me Pork Chop — everybody does!”) to an inevitable round of “And I Am Telling You.” Dream, girl, dream.Produced and directed by Ron Davis and Stewart Halpern; director of photography, Clay Westervelt; edited by William Haughse and James Cude; music by Rob Johnson; released by Illusion Arts Productions.

"'08-12-25,'0','Traci Hughes, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police Department, said that New York was not asked to send officers this time because the city had not sent any officers to the previous inauguration, in 2005.“We were working under the assumption that because New York didn’t want to participate in 2005, we presumed they didn’t want to participate this time, when the demands would be greater,” Ms. Hughes said.But Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the New York Police Department, said the department was not aware of any request in 2005.He said that in early September 2001, Washington did ask New York to send a contingent to the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, scheduled for the end of the month. The meeting was expected to be a target of anti-globalization protesters, who had made their mark in violent demonstrations during a world trade meeting in Seattle in 1999.The request from Washington arrived shortly before Sept. 11. At the time, Mr. Browne said, the Police Department was reviewing liability and indemnification issues before agreeing to send any officers. But once the terrorists struck, the whole matter was dropped.“It just fell through the cracks,” he said.Since then, Washington has apparently labored under the misimpression that New York was not interested in sending officers to augment the local force. Mr. Browne said that there was no such feeling in New York and that the city had sent contingents to other cities, including more than 300 officers and emergency equipment to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.“It’s not upsetting as much as it is perplexing, because of our proximity to Washington,” Mr. Browne said.Kristopher Baumann, head of Washington’s police union, said he, too, was surprised.“No one weighed the proximity to Washington or their experience, and it seems a little troubling when you have large urban agencies very close to us that the request was not made,” he said. “I question how well thought out this was.”Other large police forces have reacted to Washington’s request in a variety of ways as local budgets are strained in the tight economy.Philadelphia, for example, is sending 290 officers and supervisors. Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey, who was the police chief in Washington during the 2001 and 2005 inaugurations, said Washington initially asked Philadelphia for 48 officers but expanded the request when it realized the crowd could be the biggest ever. He said he asked for volunteers, and more than 500 officers put up their hands.“We chose our best officers, as a reward for a job well done,” Mr. Ramsey said. “They represent our city, it’s a historic event and our people are pretty excited about it.”He said he was certain that the department would be reimbursed for all costs for the three-day assignment.The City of Los Angeles, however, was not interested in sending any of its police officers. Although Chief William J. Bratton actively campaigned for Mr. Obama, a spokesman said he believed it made more sense for departments on the East Coast to respond.But Los Angeles County agreed to send 112 sheriff’s deputies, over the vocal opposition of some county supervisors.Ms. Hughes of the Metropolitan Police declined to describe the overall costs of importing 4,000 officers or how much of the reimbursement costs would come from the federal government.“Rest assured, everyone will be reimbursed,” she said. “For what and how much, I can’t be specific.”'"
"'08-12-25,'0','Even as the authority played down the risks, the spill reignited a debate over whether the federal government should regulate coal ash as a hazardous material. Similar ponds and mounds of ash exist at hundreds of coal plants around the nation.The Tennessee Valley Authority has issued no warnings about the potential chemical dangers of the spill, saying there was as yet no evidence of toxic substances. “Most of that material is inert,” said Gilbert Francis Jr., a spokesman for the authority. “It does have some heavy metals within it, but it’s not toxic or anything.”Mr. Francis said contaminants in water samples taken near the spill site and at the intake for the town of Kingston, six miles downstream, were within acceptable levels.But a draft report last year by the federal Environmental Protection Agency found that fly ash, a byproduct of the burning of coal to produce electricity, does contain significant amounts of carcinogens and retains the heavy metal present in coal in far higher concentrations. The report found that the concentrations of arsenic to which people might be exposed through drinking water contaminated by fly ash could increase cancer risks several hundredfold.Similarly, a 2006 study by the federally chartered National Research Council found that these coal-burning byproducts “often contain a mixture of metals and other constituents in sufficient quantities that they may pose public health and environmental concerns if improperly managed.” The study said “risks to human health and ecosystems” might occur when these contaminants entered drinking water supplies or surface water bodies.In 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed stricter federal controls of coal ash, but backed away in the face of fierce opposition from utilities, the coal industry, and Clinton administration officials. At the time, the Edison Electric Institute, an association of power utilities, estimated that the industry would have to spend up to $5 billion in additional cleanup costs if the substance were declared hazardous. Since then, environmentalists have urged tighter federal standards, and the E.P.A. is reconsidering its decision not to classify the waste as hazardous.A morning flight over the disaster area showed some cleanup activity along a road and the railroad tracks that take coal to the facility, both heaped in sludge, but no evidence of promised skimmers or barricades on the water to prevent the ash from sliding downstream. The breach occurred when an earthen dike, the only thing separating millions of cubic yards of ash from the river, gave way, releasing a glossy sea of muck, four to six feet thick, dotted with icebergs of ash across the landscape. Where the Clinch River joined the Tennessee, a clear demarcation was visible between the soiled waters of the former and the clear brown broth of the latter.By afternoon, dump trucks were depositing rock into the river in a race to blockade it before an impending rainstorm washed more ash downstream.The spill, which released about 300 million gallons of sludge and water, is far larger than the other two similar disasters, said Jeffrey Stant, the director of the Coal Combustion Waste Initiative for the Environmental Integrity Project, an environmental legal group, who has written on the subject for the E.P.A. One spill in 1967 on the Clinch River in Virginia released about 130 million gallons, and the other in 2005 in Northampton County, Pa., released about 100 million gallons into the Delaware River.The contents of coal ash can vary widely depending on the source, but one study found that the mean concentrations of lead, chromium, nickel and arsenic are three to five times higher in the Appalachian coal that is mined near Kingston than in Rocky Mountain or Northern Plains coal.Stephen A. Smith, the executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said it was “mind-boggling” that officials had not warned nearby residents of the dangers.“The fact that they have not warned people, I think, is disastrous and potentially harmful to the residents,” Mr. Smith said. “There are people walking around, checking it out.”He and other environmentalists warned that another danger would arise when the muck dried out and became airborne and breathable.Despite numerous reports from recreational anglers and television news video of a large fish kill downstream of the spill, Mr. Francis said the T.V.A.’s environmental team had not encountered any dead fish. On Swan Pond Road, home to the residences nearest the plant, a group of environmental advocates went door to door telling residents that boiling their water, as officials had suggested, would not remove heavy metals.Environmentalists pointed to the accident as proof of their long-held assertion that there is no such thing as “clean coal,” noting two factors that may have contributed to the scale of the disaster. First, as coal plants have gotten better at controlling air pollution, the toxic substances that would have been spewed into the air have been shifted to solid byproducts like fly ash, and the production of such postcombustion waste, as it is called, has increased sharply.Second, the Kingston plant, surrounded by residential tracts, had little room to grow and simply piled its ash higher and higher, though officials said the pond whose wall gave way was not over capacity.Environmental groups have long pressed for coal ash to be buried in lined landfills to prevent the leaching of metals into the soil and groundwater, a recommendation borne out by the 2006 E.P.A. report. An above-ground embankment like the one at Kingston was not an appropriate storage site for fly ash, said Thomas J. FitzGerald, the director of nonprofit Kentucky Resources Council and an expert in coal waste.“I find it difficult to comprehend that the State of Tennessee would have approved that as a permanent disposal site,” Mr. FitzGerald said.The T.V.A. will find an alternative place to dispose of the fly ash in the future, Mr. Francis said. He said that at least 30 pieces of heavy machinery had been put in use to begin the cleanup of the estimated 1.7 million cubic yards of ash that spilled from the 80-acre pond, and that work would continue day and night, even on Christmas. The plant, which generates enough electricity to support 670,000 homes, is still functioning, but might run out of coal before the railroad tracks are cleared.About 15 houses were affected by the flood, Mr. Francis said, and three would likely be declared uninhabitable. “We’re going to make it right,” he said. “We’re going to restore these folks to where they were prior to this incident.”A spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency, Laura Niles, said the agency was overseeing the cleanup and would decide whether to declare Kingston a Superfund site when the extent of the contamination was known.United States coal plants produce 129 million tons of postcombustion byproducts a year, the second-largest waste stream in the country, after municipal solid waste. That is enough to fill more than a million railroad coal cars, according to the National Research Council.Another 2007 E.P.A. report said that over about a decade, 67 towns in 26 states had their groundwater contaminated by heavy metals from such dumps.For instance, in Anne Arundel County, Md., between Baltimore and Annapolis, residential wells were polluted by heavy metals, including thallium, cadmium and arsenic, leaching from a sand-and-gravel pit where ash from a local power plant had been dumped since the mid-1990s by the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. Maryland fined the company $1 million in 2007.As it grew dark in Kingston, a hard rain enveloped Roane County, rendering the twin smokestacks of the steam plant, as locals refer to it, barely visible amid the dingy clouds.Angela Spurgeon, a teacher and mother of two whose dock was smothered in the ash-slide, said she was worried about the health effects, saying that on the night of the accident everyone was covered in sludge.“The breathing is what concerns me, the lung issues,” Ms. Spurgeon said. “Who knows what’s in that water?”'"
"'08-12-25,'0','Verizon Communications, the telecommunications company, has been awarded $33.2 million in a lawsuit against an Internet services company that it claimed had registered hundreds of domain names with Verizon trademarks.The default judgment of $50,000 for each of 663 addresses registered by the Internet company, OnlineNic, was issued last Friday by United States District Judge Jeremy D. Fogel in San Jose, Calif. Judge Fogel froze OnlineNic’s assets and ordered the transfer to Verizon of all identical or confusingly similar addresses.Verizon sued OnlineNic of San Francisco in June, accusing the company of trademark infringement and illegal “cybersquatting,” or registering addresses intentionally to confuse Web users. Such knockoff names often take users to pages that advertise competing products, Verizon said.“This case should send a clear message and serve to deter cybersquatters who continue to run businesses for the primary purpose of misleading consumers,” Sarah Deutsch, an associate general counsel at Verizon, said Wednesday in a statement.Verizon sought as much as $66.3 million in damages over names that included myverizonwireless.com, iphoneverizonplans.com and verizon-cellular.com.OnlineNic registered more than 900,000 domain names similar to some of the world’s biggest companies, including Google, Adidas, the News Corporation’s MySpace, Wal-Mart Stores and Yahoo, Verizon said in court papers. Verizon accused OnlineNic of using an automated process to register the addresses and employing “numerous means to conceal its true identity.”OnlineNic’s Web site says the company has been an accredited registrar since 1996 for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, the organization that oversees the functioning of the Internet.'"
"'08-12-25,'0','A county prosecutor in New York has suspended his investigation of an accountant who audited the books of Bernard L. Madoff, the financier accused of operating a $50 billion Ponzi scheme.The prosecutor, District Attorney Thomas Zugibe of Rockland County, said Wednesday that he would leave the investigation of the accountant, David Friehling, to the United States attorney in Manhattan.The federal agency has been investigating the case since Mr. Madoff’s Dec. 11 arrest on a securities fraud charge. Mr. Friehling’s firm operated out of a 550-square-foot space in New City, a northern suburb of New York City.“Following our discussion with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, it’s apparent our efforts would be a duplication of theirs,” Mr. Zugibe said. “We’re satisfied the federal government is properly exploring Mr. Friehling’s involvement.”Among the clients of Mr. Madoff, 70, who said they were victims of his scheme were banks, hedge funds, universities, charities and individual wealthy investors. The auditors, Friehling & Horowitz, said in a fiscal 2007 audit that Mr. Madoff’s financial statements gave “reasonable assurance” they were “free of material misstatement.”'"
"'08-12-25,'0','Federal officials took issue with some of the data compiled by the Syracuse group and said that they had maintained a strong commitment to rooting out fraud and abuse in the stock markets. While the S.E.C. could not provide numbers of its own on criminal cases arising from its investigations, Scott Friedstad, the deputy director of enforcement at the commission, said the numbers did not reflect “the reality that I see on the ground.”“We are as committed as ever to vigorous enforcement efforts,” he said.But a number of investor advocates and securities lawyers who are critical of the S.E.C.’s recent performance say they will be anxiously watching the incoming Obama administration to see what steps it may take to restore the agency’s battered credibility and re-establish it as a watchdog against corporate abuse.President-elect Barack Obama has named Mary Schapiro, head of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, to lead the S.E.C, and he has promised an overhaul of the agency and other financial regulatory offices to provide tougher oversight.“I think the S.E.C. has completely fallen down on the job,” said Jacob H. Zamansky, a New York lawyer who specializes in representing investors who have lost money in fraud cases. “They’re more interested in protecting Wall Street than protecting investors. The new administration has to do a complete overhaul of the S.E.C.”The F.B.I., which frequently investigates stock fraud cases either on its own or in partnership with the S.E.C., has also had a sharp decline in the number of white-collar cases it has brought in the last several years — partly a reflection of a huge shift in staffing and resources to counterterrorism operations since the Sept. 11 attacks, officials said.David Burnham, co-director of the Syracuse research group, which is known as the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, said the decline in stock fraud prosecutions growing out of the F.B.I. “really is no surprise. It’s a reflection of a choice that was made right after 9-11 to move investigators into terrorism, and this is the cost of that.“Maybe it’s the correct call,” he added, “but with both the F.B.I. and the S.E.C., the federal government is really the only place that does white-collar crime on a systematic basis.”The economic collapse of the last few months has brought intense scrutiny of the S.E.C. amid accusations that it failed to foresee and prevent the collapse of one major financial institution after another as a result of risky overinvestment in mortgage-backed securities.“As an overheated market needed a strong referee to rein in dangerously risky behavior, the commission too often remained on the sidelines,” Arthur Levitt, who served as chairman of the S.E.C. during the Clinton administration, told the Senate Banking Committee in October.The Madoff scandal, now under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, has ratcheted up criticism even further.Christopher Cox, chairman of the S.E.C., ordered an internal investigation last week into what he said were the agency’s “multiple failures” to investigate credible allegations of wrongdoing by Mr. Madoff.The S.E.C.’s own data suggests that the agency has put increasing emphasis on using non-criminal means, like civil fines and what are known as deferred prosecution agreements, in dealing with allegations of wrongdoing. The number of S.E.C. cases handled through civil or administrative remedies has grown from 503 in 2000 to 636 this year.Critics of the S.E.C. also attribute the decline in criminal cases to shortages in staffing and resources in the agency’s investigative units, policy changes that have reduced the authority of investigators to pursue cases on their own, and a “revolving door” phenomenon that has led investigators to leave the agency for high-paying jobs in the industry that they once helped to monitor.“It’s been awful,” Sean Coffey, a former fraud prosecutor in New York who now represents investors in securities litigation, said of the S.E.C.’s recent enforcement record. The agency has “neutered the ability of the enforcement staff to be as proactive as they could be. It’s hard to square the motto of investor advocate with the way they’ve performed the last eight years.”Mr. Coffey said he believed the declining number of stock fraud prosecutions is partly a result of the backlash the Bush administration experienced after its aggressive pursuit of corporate crime following the Enron collapse in 2002, which led to the creation of a national task force on corporate wrongdoing.In the last few years, he said, “the administration has been sending the message that we’re going to loosen the binds on the market to compete in the global marketplace, and they’ve pulled the throttle back on prosecutions because it wasn’t politically necessary anymore.”'"
"'08-12-25,'0','Balogun, a 25-year-old junior, impressed the Oklahoma coaches after arriving in Norman as a transfer during the summer; in fact, he almost earned a starting role. But he has seen limited playing time this season and is unlikely to play much in the B.C.S. title game, even though Oklahoma has been thin at linebacker. Balogun, who has recorded seven tackles in nine games, is still learning the Sooners’ defensive scheme.What he may lack in playbook knowledge, he has nearly made up for with athleticism and commitment.In a telephone interview, Coach Bob Stoops said of Balogun’s journey: “It’s incredibly unique and unlikely. Mike had a dream and felt, Hey, even though he was a little late pursuing it, it was time to do it, buckled down and got it done. He continues to make improvement. He’s on the right track.”Balogun, who is from Upper Marlboro, Md., said he had stopped playing football at Suitland High School because he did not get along with a coach there. A few years after graduating, Balogun said, he and his girlfriend, Aieshah Armwood, had a baby girl, Aminah.To help support Aminah, now 4, Balogun went to work as a carpenter’s assistant. He had to show up each day by 6 a.m., and his starting hourly wage was $13.50. He would lug plywood, take measurements and clean the construction site.“It was gruesome,” Balogun said. “Hot and sweaty days. You really were tired. It was rough.”In the evenings, he would take the field with local teams in the semipro North American Football League. Coaches and players pay up to $2,000 a season to participate, including costs for their helmets, for long bus trips and for time on local fields. And there was no guarantee that the team would be intact by week’s end, with some players quitting midseason.The quality of play was unpredictable. But even among the better athletes, Balogun stood out.“It became clear he didn’t belong out there because of his work ethic,” Charles McGriff, who coached Balogun with the Maryland Marauders and the D.C. Explosion, said in a telephone interview. “He was dominating. Sideline to sideline, he made plays. He was ferocious with the physicality.”After living for a year and a half as a construction worker by day and an athlete by night, Balogun decided to continue his education and pursue football.He tried out for Lackawanna on the recommendation of friends familiar with the college and its football program.Lackawanna is a private college of about 1,300 students. Its main campus has essentially one academic building amid the narrow streets and storefronts of Scranton. It has sent more than a dozen football players to prominent programs like West Virginia, Florida and Maryland. Bryant McKinnie, a 6-foot-8 offensive tackle with the Minnesota Vikings who was an all-American at Miami, is perhaps Lackawanna’s most famous player.Balogun made Lackawanna’s team, and when he arrived he had speed and size — everybody knew him as Big Mike — but he had little football savvy. He played sparingly his first year.“He was just this unskilled, athletic guy,” said Lackawanna Coach Mark Duda, who is also the college’s dean of enrollment services. “He could run around and knock you down. He knew where the ball was, and he could get to the football. But we were throwing everything at him at once.”Balogun was a 23-year-old freshman, and he lived in an all-male dormitory with his 18- and 19-year-old teammates. His maturity was evident. He told them to tone down their playful wrestling matches, and awakened them for 6:30 a.m. workouts. He set the example, Duda said; one time he stayed in a game despite having broken a few of his front teeth in a collision.In his sophomore season, Balogun recorded 86 tackles and was named a second-team all-American junior college player. It took only three or four games, Duda said, for programs like Michigan State and Arkansas to show interest in him.Oklahoma needed linebackers, particularly when Curtis Lofton entered the N.F.L. draft after his junior season, and Balogun had gained notice as a promising talent. Balogun committed to play for Oklahoma not long after the Sooners’ defensive coordinator, Brent Venables, contacted Lackawanna.“They were fascinated that a kid of that ability level wouldn’t be a traditional high school signee kid,” said Duda, who played five seasons in the N.F.L. “It was kind of an out-of-nowhere deal.”Oklahoma’s coaches use words like explosive and impressive to describe Balogun. His teammates, like defensive tackle Gerald McCoy, refer to him as “an old man.”At Lackawanna, the talk about Balogun has not subsided since he left. The college sends e-mail messages to students and faculty members with a schedule of Balogun’s and other former players’ locally televised games. Opposing coaches ask Duda about Balogun and his adjustment to Oklahoma.“How the heck does Mike Balogun, who doesn’t play high school football, go to Lackawanna College and play junior college football and then play in the national championship game?” Duda said. “Now if someone was to write that, you’d have to put a fiction tag on that, wouldn’t you?”'"
"'08-12-25,'0','Students at Sloan and other major business schools encounter aspects of hedge funds in classes like investment management, financial engineering, endowment management, even entrepreneurship.But Yale is among a handful of colleges in the New York area, including New York University, Columbia and Cornell, that go a step further and offer a course in hedge fund administration and operations taught by someone with real-world experience, Leon M. Metzger.“Members who are looking to learn the secrets of moneymaking are advised to register for other investment management courses,” Mr. Metzger writes in the syllabus, which is styled after an offering memorandum for a hedge fund.Mr. Metzger worked for 18 years at Paloma Partners, one of the granddaddies of the hedge fund industry, and he likes to remind people that more hedge funds blow up because of poor administrative controls than poor investments.Regardless of the investment strategy, Mr. Metzger said, “if the firm lacks sound risk management, best valuation practices and top-notch operational controls, it is a candidate for failure.”Sharon M. Oster, dean of the Yale School of Management, says teachers with real-life experience offer a valuable complement to the academic curriculum.As a former practitioner, Mr. Metzger grounds the class in current events and practical application of theory. For instance, the class devoted to valuation involved a three-hour discussion of Merrill Lynch’s sale of $30 billion of collateralized debt obligations to the Lone Star Funds for 22 cents on the dollar and financing support.“Talking about valuations is slightly more interesting than watching grass grow or paint dry, but talking about this sale brings the topic to life,” Mr. Metzger said.Jacob Navon, an executive recruiter who was among the nine judges who bombarded the Silk team and another group of students presenting their mock hedge fund, said he thought schooling them in presentation and other practical skills was invaluable.“That’s an angle not uniformly taught,” Mr. Navon said.Interestingly, few of the students in the class planned to pursue a career in hedge funds.“I knew a long time ago what I was going to be doing, and it wasn’t hedge funds,” said Yulee Newsome, who will be joining Dow Chemical when he graduates. “But it seemed to me that I would be pretty remiss if I left business school and didn’t know about one of the more important aspects of finance.”Mr. Newsome, whose first career was as a nuclear engineer aboard a Navy submarine, was a member of a team that tried to sell the judges on a strategy that played investments in oil off against investments in alternative energy.“We emphasized one type of trade in our presentation, so I was a little concerned that they were going to look at us as a one-trick pony, though I thought the judges quite liked what we presented,” said Jonathan Morris, who used his experience on a commodities trading desk last summer to shape the concept.“Learning that I can get in front of a group like that and impress them gives me added confidence as I look to move into the hedge fund industry.”'"
"'08-12-25,'0','LOS ANGELES — In a surprise ruling, a federal judge in Los Angeles said he intended to grant 20th Century Fox’s claim that it owns a copyright interest in the “Watchmen,” a movie shot by Warner Brothers and Legendary Pictures and set for release in March.The decision was disclosed in a five-page written order issued on Wednesday. Gary A. Feess, a judge in the United States District Court for Central California, said he would provide a more detailed order soon.Fox has been seeking to prevent Warner from releasing the film. The superhero adventure, based on the “Watchmen” graphic novel, is being directed by Zack Snyder (who also directed “300”) and has shaped up as one of most eagerly anticipated releases for next year.A Warner spokesman, Scott Rowe, declined to comment on the ruling and the studio’s plans.At an earlier hearing, the judge said he believed that issues in the case could be settled only at a trial, which was scheduled for late January. On Wednesday, however, Judge Feess said he had reconsidered and concluded that Fox should prevail on crucial issues.“Fox owns a copyright interest consisting of, at the very least, the right to distribute the ‘Watchmen’ motion picture,” the ruling said.Fox acquired rights to the “Watchmen” graphic novel in the late 1980s for the producer Lawrence Gordon, but eventually dropped its own plan to make a movie from its story, about the underside of life for superbeings.'"
"'08-12-25,'0','Some are already feeling it. Mexico, for example, is likely to have a 4 percent decline in the flows of migrant money in 2008, according to World Bank estimates. The biggest declines next year are expected in the Middle East and North Africa, because of economic slowdowns in the Persian Gulf and Europe.“There’s definitely a serious moderation in the growth of remittances,” said Dilip Ratha, a senior economist at the World Bank who tracks migrant money flows.The decline will be less severe than for other flows, like foreign investment, Mr. Ratha said, but its effects will be amplified in countries like Tajikistan that have come to depend on rapidly growing remittances. The country will rank first in the world in 2008 for remittances as a portion of its economy — 54 percent — according to an estimate by the International Monetary Fund.“The Tajik economy is not sustainable without migration,” Mr. Ratha said. “It is not diversified. People are the most important resource they have.”The reason dates to the Soviet collapse, when factories closed, subsidies from Moscow dried up and villages like Tosh-Teppa, 25 miles north of Afghanistan, were left to rot. More than 80 percent of the population lived under the poverty line of about $2 a day, and Tajiks began to export the only thing they had: themselves.“The population has been completely abandoned by the state,” said Paul Quinn Judge, who runs the International Crisis Group’s Central Asian program. “When it comes to providing for basic needs — healthy drinking water, heat in winter — they are utterly failing.”The money the migrants sent back was a lifeline. When Borun, a 42-year-old with a degree in agriculture, first went to work in Russia, a vicious civil war had just ended, and his family was eating corncobs to survive. When his two children came down with malaria, there was no money to take them to a hospital and they died after a local medical office gave them all that it had: aspirin and mosquito netting.“We would have died without that money,” said his mother, Umiyavi, 59. Like many people interviewed for this article, Borun would not give his last name for fear the Russian authorities would refuse to let him back in to work.When oil profits were high, workers from Central Asia, the Caucasus and Eastern Europe poured into Russian cities, as many as 10 million by some estimates, making Russia the country with the second largest immigrant population, after the United States.Like most Tajiks working in Russia — 700,000 to a million people — Borun worked in construction. It was one of the sectors hardest hit by the credit crunch and falling oil prices this fall. Borun’s wages for a job renovating the Lenin Museum in Moscow were delayed. In November his employer paid up, but then immediately fired him.“They said those who came from abroad have to go,” he said, shivering in a thin jacket in his small house in Khodja-Durbod, a village near Tosh-Teppa. About 300 workers were fired, he said, mostly Tajiks and Uzbeks.Economists do not expect effects to be felt broadly in labor markets until well into next year, but the trend of booming remittances has clearly ended. In Tajikistan, remittances rose just 1 percent in November, compared with the same month last year, according to the I.M.F., down sharply from a record growth of about 90 percent early this year.That has brought a quiet desperation into households like Ms. Sayidova’s. The area is missing so many men that it feels like wartime, and its daily allowance of four to six hours of electricity is the same as in Baghdad. Malnutrition is widespread. Unicef estimates that more than one-third of children are stunted. Ms. Sayidova’s 13-year-old son has the body of a 6-year-old.Ms. Sayidova is part of a new generation of women who are less protected from poverty than their mothers. The Soviet Union required girls to finish high school, but since its collapse the number of girls who graduate has fallen by 12 percent. Ms. Sayidova dropped out and married at 14. She was ashamed to have to borrow money from her mother to buy winter clothes for her children and Vaseline for her hands.Migrant money had offered a safety net. Roofs were built, houses expanded and the basic needs of a large portion of society provided for. In the years of the migrant boom, the portion of the population living in poverty fell by a third, to 50 percent. In Khodja-Durbod, a school was built on migrant money, with each family contributing $100 and 320 bricks. It is missing both a math teacher and a toilet, and its headmaster is concerned that with the crisis, it will not get either.Still, migrants do not seem to be giving up and returning home, the biggest worry for Western governments that see large numbers of poor unemployed men just north of Afghanistan as a potential security risk. Instead, people interviewed over three days last week said they would dig in further to hold on to any chance for a job, particularly if the Russian authorities made good on threats to reduce their numbers.Borun’s oldest son is an exception. He worked for a few months gathering scrap metal in Moscow when he was 16. The experience was so painful that he returned to Tajikistan and began riding his bicycle 13 miles every morning to a better school.“He saw the way we lived, without respect,” Borun said bitterly. “He doesn’t want to be like his father.”'"

Is there some way these files can be opened?A. Files with the “.wps” extension on the end of the name are actually Microsoft Works files. Microsoft Works is a relatively inexpensive software suite ($40) for home users that comes with its own word processor, spreadsheet program and other organizational tools.Although Word and the Works word processor are both made by Microsoft, the two programs use different file formats. Some editions of Word and Works may be able to open each other’s formats if you go to the File menu and use the Open command on the file in question. But some versions of Word may need the help of conversion software to open the Works documents.Microsoft has instructions for downloading and using its own Works converter to open files with Word at support.microsoft.com/kb/315757. Its technical support site also has a page about using Word’s built-in tool for recovering text from any type of file at support.microsoft.com/kb/290946, though this option does not preserve any special text formatting or graphics that may have been in the Works file.There are also third-party products that can open and convert files from a variety of word-processing, graphics and spreadsheet programs (including those used on a Mac).

"'08-12-25,'0','To watch “Marley & Me,” the bland, obsequious adaptation of John Grogan’s best-selling memoir of his up-and-down relationship with an unruly Labrador retriever, is to tune in to an era that seems so close and yet so distant. In those naïve old days — the 1990s through the first part of this century — Florida real estate boomed, newspapers flourished and the heavens rained money.Because the movie, directed by David Frankel (“The Devil Wears Prada”), plays by the rules of Hollywood, John and Jenny Grogan (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston), never age. The Grogans, golden-fleeced journalists, move from Kalamazoo, Mich., to West Palm Beach, Fla., where they adopt a yellow Lab that John names Marley (after Bob). Except for the occasional thunderstorm that freaks out the neurotic dog, the weather in Florida is always sunny with low humidity.Later in the movie, after nearly a decade and a half have passed and the Grogans and their three model children have moved to a greeting-card perfect stone house with a barn in rural Pennsylvania, the years seem not to have touched them. Mr. Wilson’s blond surfer locks remain unflecked with gray. The waistline of Ms. Aniston’s Jenny, after bearing three children, shows no sign of a bulge.Although the Grogans have their spats, one of which drives John temporarily out of the house, the screenplay glosses over their domestic crises to convey the fantasy of a marriage that is mostly smooth sailing, save for Jenny’s exhaustion after the birth of their third child. (The possibility of post-partum depression is cautiously broached, then dropped as though too hot to handle.) Most of the time the Grogans get along fine, largely because John is a laid-back dude verging on a doormat. As for the couple’s romantic chemistry, there is plenty of cuddling but little heat.If Jenny, the no-nonsense household boss, is mercifully forgiving and appealingly curvaceous, beneath her surface perkiness she is awfully dull; early on, the movie conveniently forgets she is a journalist. Mr. Wilson’s John verges on stupefied. His vague, drawling passive-aggression and dazed chipmunk smile are not traits usually associated with an aspiring hard-news journalist who finds his niche writing a humorous column about his incorrigible dog.'"
"'08-12-25,'0','There are no discernibly nasty Nazis in “Valkyrie,” though Hitler and Goebbels skulk about in a few scenes, shooting dark, ominous looks at the heroic German Army officer played by Tom Cruise. Perhaps they’re wondering what this Hollywood megastar is doing in their midst, a sentiment that you may come to share while watching Mr. Cruise — who gives a fine, typically energetic performance in a film that requires nothing more of him than a profile and vigor — strut about as one of history’s more enigmatic players.That enigma was Claus von Stauffenberg, a count and a colonel who, though he lost one eye, an entire hand and several fingers while fighting on behalf of the Reich, made several attempts to assassinate Hitler and seize control of the government. At the core of Stauffenberg’s spectacularly ambitious plot was Valkyrie, Hitler’s plan for the mobilization of the home army that Stauffenberg hoped to hijack in order to quash the SS and its leaders. It didn’t work, of course, for complicated reasons, though also because by 1944, as William L. Shirer bluntly puts it in “The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,” the conspirators were “terribly late.”You don’t learn how belated the coup d’état was in “Valkyrie,” which might matter if this big-ticket production with Mr. Cruise in an eye patch and shiny, shiny boots had something to do with reality. But the director, Bryan Singer (of the “X-Men” franchise), and the writers, Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander, aren’t interested in delivering a history lesson: that’s why Ken Burns was born. Slick, facile entertainment is the name of the game here, as it is in all Mr. Singer’s films, including “Apt Pupil” (about a Nazi war criminal and the American boy next door who outs him) and “The Usual Suspects,” an intricately plotted story with men and guns, secrets and shadows that Mr. McQuarrie wrote. The secrets have already begun swirling by the time “Valkyrie” opens with Stauffenberg, stationed in North Africa, bitterly recording his opposition to Hitler in a diary right before losing various body parts to the war. After his convalescence he meets Maj. Gen. Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh), who, sometime earlier, tries to blow up Hitler with a bomb hidden in bottles of French liqueur. (Russian vodka might have been more effective.) Stauffenberg soon joins the conspiratorial party that includes other British class acts brandishing high military rank and speaking in lightly accented or unaccented English: Bill Nighy as Gen. Friedrich Olbricht, Tom Wilkinson as Gen. Friedrich Fromm, Terence Stamp as Gen. Ludwig Beck and Eddie Izzard as Gen. Erich Fellgiebel.Most of the crucial rebellious officers are played by British actors, while some of the Nazi diehards are played by Germans, which wouldn’t be worth mentioning if this cacophony of accents weren’t so distracting. But, as with the casting of Mr. Cruise, whose German voice-over quickly eases into English, this international acting community invokes an earlier studio age, when Peter Lorre and Claude Rains delivered their lines in exotically flavored English and everyone pretended that Rick’s Cafe really was located in Casablanca and not on a back lot. If Mr. Cruise doesn’t work in “Valkyrie,” it’s partly because he’s too modern, too American and way too Tom Cruise to make sense in the role, but also because what passes for movie realism keeps changing, sometimes faster than even a star can change his brand.Though Mr. Singer’s old-fashioned movie habits, his attention to the gloss, gleam and glamour of the image, can be agreeably pleasurable, he tends to gild every lily. Hitler (David Bamber) doesn’t need spooky music or low camera angles to be villainous: he just has to show up. Mr. Singer’s fondness for exaggeration can even undercut his strongest scenes, as when Stauffenberg visits Hitler to secure approval for the rewritten Valkyrie plan. If implemented, the plan will bring down the Führer who, for his part, seems intent on bringing down the house with leers and popping eyeballs. Mr. Singer appears to have taken cues here from “Black Book,” Paul Verhoeven’s World War II romp, but he’s too serious to make such vaudeville work.Stauffenberg, who hated Hitler but worshipped the Reich, sacrificed himself on the dual altar of nationalism and militarism, which makes him a more ambiguous figure than the one drawn in “Valkyrie.” He’s a complex character, too complex for this film, which like many stories of this type, transforms World War II into a boy’s adventure with dashing heroes, miles of black leather and crane shots of German troops in lockstep formation that would make Leni Riefenstahl flutter. It’s a war that offers moral absolutes (Nazis are evil) and narratives (Nazis are evil and should die) that seem easier to grasp than any current conflict. Truly, World War II has become the moviemaker’s gift that keeps on giving, whether you want it to or not.“Valkyrie” is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Bombs, guns and executions, though little blood.Directed by Bryan Singer; written by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander; director of photography, Newton Thomas Sigel; edited by John Ottman; music by Mr. Ottman; production designers, Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb; produced by Mr. Singer, Mr. McQuarrie and Gilbert Adler; released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and United Artists.

"'08-12-25,'0','Wednesday evening, an American Airlines plane hit an icy patch on a runway at O’Hare and slid sideways into the grass, The Associated Press reported. No one was injured.The problems were not limited to the nation’s midsection. In the New York area, flights at Newark Liberty International and John F. Kennedy International were delayed from two to three hours because of snow and ice. LaGuardia airport was largely unaffected. But on the West Coast, passengers at San Francisco International Airport were facing about 90-minute delays as powerful gusts of wind buffeted the area.In Toronto, workers at Pearson International Airport scrambled to resume operations after snowstorms battered the region, forcing officials to cancel more than 300 flights.But none of those airports were able to contain their chaos. Problems at O’Hare rippled through every corner of the country, causing delays at most major airports.Cliff Cole, a spokesman for Amtrak, said there were service disruptions at railroad stations from Chicago to the Northeast because of the harsh weather in the Midwest.A combination of high winds, heavy snow and sub-zero temperatures spurred equipment delays and left numerous ice-covered locomotives in need of thawing out, causing “a domino effect,” Mr. Cole said.One of the more problematic lines was the Lakeshore Limited, which runs between Chicago and New York. “In that area they’ve had extremely cold weather, a lot of snow and windy conditions,” he said. “It’s causing problems with equipment, and when trains run inordinately late, we have re-crewing issues because crews can’t work more than 12 hours.”Christmas Day was expected to provide a brief respite, with the weather from Chicago to New York turning from stormy to dry and slightly warmer, though still chilly, said Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.The Northwest and mountain states might not be so fortunate. Parts of the region from Washington to Colorado were expecting an additional one to two feet of snow, Mr. Orrison said, adding that even parts of California might see a snow-white Christmas.There were pockets of relief, however. About 300 travelers had to spend Tuesday night at the Portland International Airport, and about 100 people bunked down at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport.But by Wednesday snowy conditions had subsided enough to allow service at airports to resume to near normal levels. On the streets of Seattle, the eight inches of snow that coated the city over the weekend — the most snow the city has seen in a decade — were largely washed away by intermittent rain, taking with it the winter-playground feeling that had delighted many residents.But on Wednesday morning, Sea-Tac airport had an emergency of another kind. As Alaska Airlines workers were removing ice from the wings of an aircraft, de-icing fluid was sucked into the plane’s ventilation system, sickening about 25 people who were exposed to fumes, airport officials said.The six-member crew, as well as one off-duty crew member and 18 passengers, were examined by emergency medical technicians at the airport after complaining of eye irritation, said Paul McElroy, a spokesman for the airline. Mr. McElroy said Flight 528, scheduled to depart for Burbank, Calif., at about 7 a.m., was at the gate, fully boarded with the cabin door closed, when a crew began spraying the outside of the plane with de-icing fluid.Mr. McElroy said all 143 passengers were transferred to another new plane for the flight to Burbank. He said Alaska Airlines policy required that the crew and the off-duty staff member be examined at a local hospital.In Oregon, ice and sleet forced road closings and left many people home alone for the holiday. By Wednesday evening, more than 50,000 homes and businesses were struggling to get by without power — down from the 286,000 customers who lost power in a fierce weekend storm.But officials with PGE, Oregon’s largest utility, warned that the number of homes and businesses without power were increasing as snow-covered tree limbs snapped.At least 18 highway deaths were blamed on the weather, including three in Wisconsin and one in Massachusetts, The Associated Press reported.'"
"'08-12-25,'0','“It’s a very substantial amount of money that’s been freed up,” said Abiel Reinhart, North American economist at JPMorgan Chase. “That’s a definite positive for consumers. It’s probably the only positive at this point.”Oil prices continued to fall on Wednesday, declining $3.63, to settle at $35.35 a barrel in New York trading. Crude prices are 75 percent below their July highs of more than $145 a barrel.Financial markets in New York took the economic news in stride on a shortened trading day. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 48.99 points, or 0.58 percent, to 8.468.48, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 1.86 points, or 0.22 percent, to 865.02. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 3.36 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,524.90.Retailers are bracing for a bruising post-holiday season as Americans bargain hunt. Many have slashed their earnings outlooks and are offering deep discounts and “doorbuster” sales simply to entice shoppers into their stores.Households continue to save more money as many Americans adjust to stagnant wages and reduced working hours and brace for the possibility of layoffs. The Commerce Department reported that personal savings increased 1 percent in November compared with 0.7 percent in October.Personal incomes dropped by 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.1 percent in October.Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims continued to hit new highs. Unemployment has risen to 6.7 percent this year and employers cut 533,000 jobs in November.The Labor Department reported on Wednesday that the number of people filing for unemployment for the first time rose to 586,000 in the week ending on Saturday, up from a revised 556,000 a week earlier.The manufacturing sector marked another weak month, with new orders to factories for durable goods — items expected to last at least three years — falling 1 percent, to $186.9 billion, the Commerce Department reported. While it was the fourth consecutive month of declines, the drop was actually smaller than Wall Street’s expectations of a 3 percent decline.Helping to drive down that November number was a 37.7 percent drop in demand for commercial aircraft. The production of cars, machinery, furniture, appliances and a range of other goods has tumbled this year, according to Federal Reserve data.Over all, industrial production has declined 5.5 percent so far this year as auto assembly lines closed and home construction was at a near standstill. The Federal Reserve has tried to prime the pump by promising to buy debt backed by mortgages and consumer loans, and by cutting interest rates.The Fed’s moves have helped lower borrowing costs, according to one measure. The rate on a 30-year fixed mortgages fell to a national average of 5.14 percent over the last seven days, its lowest point in 37 years, according to a survey by Freddie Mac.The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 3/32, to 113 28/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.18 percent, from 2.17 percent late Tuesday.'"

"'08-12-26,'1','Undermining women’s reproductive rights and access to health care has been a pervasive theme of the outgoing administration. On his first full day in office, President Bush imposed the “global gag rule,” which prohibits taxpayer dollars from going to international family-planning groups that perform abortions using their own funds or that advocate for safe abortion laws.So it was unsurprising, but still dismaying, that the secretary of health and human services, Michael Leavitt, chose to extend that dismal record at the last minute with yet another awful regulation. A parting gift to the far right, the new regulation aims to hinder women’s access to abortion, contraceptives and the information necessary to make decisions about their own health. What makes it worse is that the policy is wrapped up in a phony claim to safeguard religious freedom.The law has long allowed doctors and nurses to refuse to participate in an abortion. Mr. Leavitt’s changes elevate the so-called right to refuse beyond reason to an increased number of medical institutions and a broad range of health care workers and services — including abortion referrals, unbiased counseling and provision of emergency contraception, even to rape victims.The impact will be hardest on poor women who rely on public programs for their health care.In July, Barack Obama, still a senator at the time, signed a letter to Mr. Leavitt, along with some of his colleagues, urging Mr. Leavitt to scrap an earlier draft of the regulation. It cited a number of problems that were perpetuated in the final version.The Health and Human Services regulation is due to become effective on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day. By acting right away to suspend its implementation, President-elect Barack Obama and his choice to succeed Mr. Leavitt, Tom Daschle, can block irresponsible changes that threaten people’s rights and defy the federal government’s duty on public health.They should do so, and promptly follow up with a formal rule-making proceeding to rescind the regulation once and for all. And they can get rid of the gag rule.'"
"'08-12-26,'1','Mr. Adams, for his part, went to Saks Fifth Avenue on Christmas Eve to shop for a last-minute gift for his wife, as he always does. But he stayed away from the pricey perfumes, veering instead to the makeup counter to buy creams she might need and would normally pick up for herself.Of course, this cutback Christmas can also be seen as the season of the sales. Some took advantage of bargain trips to resorts; others filled bags with merchandise at half price. “Everything was really cheap,” said one woman, a bit defensively, as she boarded a train to see family in , laden with Bloomingdale’s bags that were teeming with red-wrapped gifts.For the Lombardo family, Christmas Eve has always been about the Feast of the Seven Fishes, a traditional Italian banquet.But with business at the family’s pizzeria in Harrison, N.Y., pinched, the Lombardos scaled back. Each of the 18 adults and seven grandchildren was served the seven courses, but the grownups survived on one tail instead of two. The crowd shared a few dozen clams on the half shell instead of 10 dozen or more, the shrimp cocktails were more modest, the linguini had fewer blue crabs, and there was a bit less scungilli. There were fewer Alaskan king crab legs, too.“We’re not getting a lot of businessmen taking their clients to lunch,” Sofia Lombardo, a daughter of one of the founders, said of her family’s restaurant, Sofia’s Pizzeria. “They just have slices instead of chicken parmesan.”The tug of tough times also led the Lombardos to trim their gift-giving. Last year, the adults traded “secret Santa” gifts worth about $75 each. This year, they decided to limit each gift to $30.Ms. Lombardo’s parents and one of her brothers did away with swapping gifts entirely. “My family always went to the nines,” she said. “Is it weird not opening gifts on Christmas Day? Yes. But the catering business is not where it’s been in the last few years.”Even with less, there were countless attempts to make Christmas as happy as it has always been. Parents, in particular, took pains to give their children an abundance of gifts, even while watching the price tag.Last year, Veronica Tyms bought 30 presents for cousins, in-laws, friends and their children. This year, she chopped her list in half and fully expected the would-be recipients to do the same. “We didn’t have to talk about it,” said Ms. Tyms’s friend Margaret Gregory, who joined her this week on a bargain-hunting trip to the store in the Atlantic Terminal Mall in Brooklyn. “People just understood.”Both women, however, still showered their children with presents. Ms. Gregory ticked off the list for her 18-year-old daughter: “clothes, movies, perfume, makeup.” Ms. Tyms bought gifts for her 8-year-old son and more than a dozen other children of friends and relatives.“My son still believes in ,” she said. “I’m not ready to change that yet.”Ed Chin of Greenwich, Conn., who landed at job at China Merchants Bank in September after being out of work for six months, skipped the usual trip to to visit his in-laws and to , and he canceled his family’s traditional Champagne brunch. Rather than expensive gifts for each of their four children, ages 9 to 14, Mr. Chin and his wife, Julie, bought an Xbox video game console for them to share.“Even people in Greenwich have to tighten up,” Ms. Chin said of her wealthy hometown. “This is not the time to spend money on this kind of stuff.”Dominic Giangrasso, who runs the computer systems at ConEdison Solutions, hooked up a Web camera to his flat-panel television so that his pregnant daughter, who lives in , could watch Christmas dinner at his home in Westchester County rather than spend money on traveling there.The Rev. Jos Kandathikudy, the priest at Syro Malabar Catholic Church in the Bronx, said that last year he walked from the rectory through the neighborhood to admire the fanciful decorations. This year, he said, the streets were mostly dark.“Businesses and residences both; I think people just want to and need to save money — everything is reduced,” he said. “But this is not the meaning of Christmas. It is not about lights and presents.”Father Kandathikudy was one of many ministers to preach about how the tough economic times could help people focus on the religious meaning of Christmas.One parishioner at the Church of the Ascension on West 107th Street simply handed over $500 to the Rev. John Duffell last week, saying only that someone needed it more than he did.And at the Church of Saint Raymond on Castle Hill Avenue in the Bronx, one altar girl had trimmed her wish list.“My daughter understood that things were difficult this year,” said Maria Gonzalez, 40, as she walked into the noon Mass at the church, beaming as her daughter, Jessica Garcia, led the processional. “She loves and has worked so hard to practice, so all she wanted was a keyboard. She wants to play music to serve God, and I want to help her in that.”'"
"'08-12-26,'1','Yet the longer-term health of the Chinese economy may depend on regulators’ and bank managers’ ability to accomplish all of this without impairing the credit quality and risk management systems still being introduced here. Failure could expose Chinese banks to the kinds of problems now bedeviling their Western rivals.Testing managers could be part of the answer. China has a long history of relying much more heavily than Western countries on tests to choose winners and losers — imperial officials were tested for their knowledge of literature as early as 2,000 years ago. Mao eliminated many examinations, but Deng Xiaoping began to revive them after 1978, partly as a way to weed out incompetent officials who had risen through the ranks based only on political connections or seniority.As the number of college graduates rises steeply in China and universities struggle to maintain the quality of education in a rapid expansion, the number of exams is rising even more quickly. That is particularly true in financial services, as the government worries about repeating the West’s financial mistakes.More cautious and more heavily regulated, Chinese financial institutions appear to have weathered the crisis better so far. Chinese banks require down payments of 20 to 50 percent on mortgages to discourage borrowers from reneging on debts, and since 2004 have been forced by the government to limit their real estate lending.But like the United States and many other countries, China faces falling real estate prices and steeply declining share prices — and regulators are increasingly worried.“Bad loans are already showing an upward trend, especially in the property market, where the mortgage default risk is growing at an accelerating pace,” said Jiang Dingzhi, the vice chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, at a conference this autumn. He provided no details, nor have Chinese banks released any recent updates on their nonperforming loans.Bush administration officials have pushed China to open up its financial markets and allow greater financial innovation. “That need not be at odds with learning the lessons from the recent turmoil in the United States,” David H. McCormick, the under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, said, adding that improvements in international financial regulation were also needed.Without singling out China, Mr. McCormick cautioned that protectionism was “a very real risk — throughout history in times of stress, in times of turmoil and anxiety, there’s a tendency to turn inwards.”Chinese banks have disclosed holdings of American mortgage-backed securities, but such holdings have been tiny compared with the banks’ total assets. Yet — despite signs of trouble in the domestic real estate sector — regulators have focused on foreign transactions in particular, fearing that international turmoil in financial markets will spread to China.“There are new sources of volatility that threaten our sound and stable growth,” the China Banking Regulatory Commission said in a statement in October. “It is important to recognize these new problems and make careful decisions to cope with them.”Some financial experts warn that China may go too far in continuing to limit competition for its banking system through heavy regulation. “Strengthening regulation of risk control, strengthening bank examination — all of these are good in principle,” said Shang-jin Wei, a Columbia University finance professor. “It’s always difficult to resist the temptation to go overboard, and China might miss the chance to strengthen its banking system.” For instance, with the government maintaining very large majority stakes in each bank, Chinese banks remain susceptible to pressures to lend to politically connected borrowers.The China Banking Regulatory Commission already has a basic competence test for bankers but abruptly authorized three more in July, all of which are supposed to be ready by the end of this year. The new tests are for risk managers, certified financial analysts and information security engineers.Approximately 200,000 people in the banking sector alone will be required to pass the risk management test within one year or lose their jobs, said Walter Wang, the president of ATA, a Beijing-based company traded on Nasdaq that administers many of the Chinese government’s financial regulatory tests.Even bank branch employees who sell products like mutual funds and currencies will be required to pass the risk management test. The only limit on how many times someone can try to pass the test is that the tests are typically administered three or four times a year.Chinese regulators are also preparing to require bank employees involved in the issuance of mortgages to start taking a national qualification test late next year as well, Mr. Wang said. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission is also drafting extensive new test requirements, and the government is considering certification tests for real estate brokers and other professionals.“The authorities are paying attention to what is happening outside of China, and they are reacting,” said Carl Yeung, ATA’s chief financial officer.Mr. Li, the stock broker, took his recent test at the College of Computer Science and Technology at the Beijing University of Technology. He was one of 2,500 men and women taking the brokerage test, most of whom appeared to be in their 20s or 30s. Age discrimination is widespread in China, partly because many people who grew up during the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s were denied years of formal education.The college, on the northeast outskirts of Beijing, has a leafy campus that rivals those of many American universities, and is certainly well equipped. Each of the 2,500 test takers was sent to a different desktop computer, arranged in rows on desks in a series of well-lighted halls.Before taking the test, each test taker was photographed and the image stored. Some in China try to send ringers to take the test for them. When there is any hint of fraud, the photos taken at the test center are compared with reliable photos of the person who was supposed to be taking the test.In some cases, the tests offer a guide to where China wants to go someday in financial deregulation: Mr. Li had to take the stock brokerage test for a third time because he had previously failed twice a section involving financial derivatives.“The financial derivatives are not even launched yet in the market,” he said, “so we don’t have practical experience.”'"
"'08-12-26,'1','Asian stocks rose on Thursday and early Friday, while shares in the Persian Gulf, Russia and China retreated. Dubai’s benchmark index fell for a seventh day on concern that economic growth would slow.Japanese shipping companies and electronics makers led gains in Asia on speculation falling oil prices would ease fuel costs and encourage consumers to spend more.The Nikkei 225-stock average rose nearly 1 percent in Tokyo on Friday morning as investors went bargain hunting. On Thursday, the Nikkei 225 climbed 1 percent, to close at 8,599.50.Financial markets in Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the Philippines were closed Friday.“Cheaper oil will allow Americans to spend more on discretionary items,” said Yoshinori Nagano, a senior strategist at Daiwa Asset Management, which manages about $96 billion in Tokyo.“Higher fuel costs have eaten into company profit, and with crude falling by this degree, we’ll probably see the opposite effect next year.”'"
"'08-12-26,'1','She sees danger in the youth riots in Greece, even with their anarchist character. “It’s a cry of alarm, a kind of warning,” she said. “We shouldn’t believe that what’s happening in Greece can’t happen here.”Not everyone agrees with her dark assessment, of course. Jean-Claude Gaudin is the longtime mayor of Marseille, a member of the governing center-right party and vice president of the French Senate. A large man of 69, with a voice that echoes around his palatial office, Mr. Gaudin dismisses those fears.“Samia Ghali belongs to the opposition,” he said. “There it is. She may be surprised by the calm and serenity of the city, and maybe she would hope that it won’t work well. But we’ve been announcing so many disasters for the last 14 years, and none of them has taken place.”Because of the sea and the beaches, and because the population is so mixed — with poor and Muslim communities inside the city, not funneled into suburban ghettos like those near Paris — Marseille, he said, is a model of racial calm. “There are fewer disturbances in Marseille than in any of the other big cities of France,” he said. “This is a city used to foreigners.”Integration, however, is not the same, notes one of Mr. Gaudin’s contemporaries, Jean-Pierre Daniel, who lives and works in the “northern neighborhoods” above L’Estaque. One small safe harbor here is L’Alhambra, a movie palace of the 1930s, lovingly restored by the city of Marseille and Mr. Daniel, 69, a determined man in love with cinema.Son of a merchant mariner, Mr. Daniel has run L’Alhambra since it reopened in June 1990 — seven years after the city bought it as a wreck. Nearly six of those years were spent in that special form of French debate called “cultural politics.”The left, which dominated the area, finally agreed with the right that a “cultural center” should be built to help “rehabilitate the neighborhood,” Mr. Daniel said. But the city did not have enough money, “so they bought an old cinema instead, as a political gesture, and they asked me to run it.” It is the only public hall in an area of nearly 100,000 people.The only request, he said, “was not to provoke the voters with politics.” With that charge, he created a place for education, relaxation and culture. The theater is of the old style, with 250 seats in steeped rows and a huge screen from floor to ceiling. He shows a mix of classic and modern films, both popular and art-house, featuring Chaplin, Tati and Pagnol as well as current releases from Woody Allen and Claire Simon.Mr. Daniel and his deputy, William Benedetto, 38, soon to succeed him, present 150 different films a year, with 18 showings a week. There are special shows for schoolchildren, many bused from other parts of Marseille. Prices are kept low — about $5.50 for an adult, around $3.50 for those under 13. Some 45,000 people a year, half of them children, come to see films.The theater is owned by the city, which provides half the annual budget of $850,000. About 20 percent of the budget comes from tickets, with the rest from state and regional grants.Mr. Daniel and Mr. Benedetto say they believe that attending a movie theater is a kind of socialization that cannot be had watching television at home.“The hall of a cinema, like the theater, the circus, the stadium or the arena, is a space of a precise form designed to welcome the public, assembled to have an experience, to look and listen together to a spectacle that provokes thoughts and emotions,” Mr. Daniel wrote in the Alhambra newsletter.In the lobby, the theater displays an early projector, a praxinoscope, and there are work rooms for film students and a small studio. Nearby is the editing table Pagnol used for his film “Marius.”Ms. Ghali praises the theater, as does Mr. Gaudin. “It’s a very interesting initiative of the city,” he said, “but it won’t overturn the landscape.”Mr. Benedetto has a slightly smaller ambition. “It won’t change the world,” he said. “But we have the conviction that these movies can change the lives of these kids — they will ask themselves questions that resonate.”'"
"'08-12-26,'1','In Darfur, the death count is not known, but Mr. Holmes estimated that up to 300,000 fatalities could be attributed to the outbreak of war.The fear in the south is that some small spark — like the confrontation of a few soldiers at a checkpoint in Abyei last May — could reignite the conflagration not just in one town, but across the south. That in turn might draw in combatants from the governments or rebel movements in the countries around southern Sudan, few of them models of stability. They include Congo, the Central African Republic and Uganda.But since the two sides reached the peace agreement in 2005, the world has to some extent stopped paying attention. “We work in the shadow of Darfur,” said David Gressly, the regional coordinator in the southern capital, Juba, for the United Nations mission in Sudan. “In general there was a lack of engagement in what was going on here.”The thousands who fled the town or its immediate environs remain displaced, their insecurity confirmed by a skirmish early this month that left two policemen dead.“If there is peace, these things should not happen,” said Amol Bol, a 57-year-old sorghum farmer who, like thousands of others, remains stuck in a shantytown of reed and plastic huts around the town of Akog, south of Abyei. “Now we live in fear that this peace will fall apart, because we were attacked in our houses.”Kuol Deng Kuol, the paramount tribal chief, said government soldiers burned all 50 of his tukuls, the mud brick huts with conical thatched roofs that dot the countryside here. “They want to chase us away from the area, to create a reality that there are no Dinka living in Abyei,” he said. “The peace may have been signed, but the implementation is not going in the right direction.”Both sides were dragging their feet in carrying out the peace plan, initially envisioned as a six-year transition culminating in a 2011 referendum on whether the south would achieve independence or Sudan would remain united. Complicated national elections are scheduled before that, with the date depending on an uncompleted census. In theory, there is a government of national unity from both sides overseeing it all, but Sudanese officials and diplomats point out that there is little real integration.That problem was particularly acute around Abyei. The shock of the violence finally prompted both sides to agree to a set of reinforced peace guidelines last June. Among other things, it calls for the integration of police and army units from the north and south, a process that still lags, and the sharing of oil revenues from the area, a continuing problem. Both sides also agreed to submit their border demarcation dispute around Abyei to international arbitration, with a decision due around next June.But progress is slow, and it is not hard to see why both sides would be stalling.A sign welcoming passengers approaching the squat terminal of the airport at Juba neatly captures the wrinkle in the fight for autonomy: “Our Peace. Our Land. Our Oil. Our Liberty.”The most significant oil resources in southern Sudan lie right along the still-unmarked border between north and south, with notable deposits underneath Abyei. The inability to agree on how to share that oil is holding up the peace process. As it stands now, though, if the south votes for independence in 2011, it will take some 80 percent of the reserves with it.It has no way of getting the oil out of the landlocked south without relying on the north, unless it wants to invest billions of dollars in precious resources in building a pipeline to the sea, most likely through Kenya. Thus, diplomats say they believe that the crucial piece of the plan stalling peace is the lack of a long-term deal for sharing oil revenues. “The fight over land on the border is a proxy discussion for the fight over oil,” said Richard Williamson, President Bush’s special envoy for Sudan.There is consensus on this among outsiders, even if senior officials from both sides try to dismiss the oil argument, noting that the north and south have been hostile toward each other basically since independence from Britain in 1956. Both sides also vow they are committed to the peace plan because the war cost so much. The problem is that the leisurely pace of carrying out the peace agreement now threatens stability. Mr. Williamson noted that the agreement was past the halfway mark of a six-year process. That gives plenty of scope for history, raw nerves and the lingering bitterness to wear away at the treaty, he said.“This is a peace agreement that needs constant tending if it is ever going to turn into a garden,” he said.'"
"'08-12-26,'1','Now, in a reverse miniature brain drain, Chinese financial institutions are taking advantage of the downturn and focusing on the newly unemployed to diversify and upgrade their own staffs.“We’re looking very hard right now for experienced, senior-level talent who have knowledge of China. For our junior-level positions, we continue to recruit from our local Chinese talent pool,” said Hong Chen, the chief executive of the Hina Group, a boutique global investment bank. The company specializes in cross-border mergers and acquisition advisory and has offices in Beijing and San Francisco.In another reversal of fortune, China, because of its closed financial sector — which Washington and the West have been insisting China open — has been largely shielded from the toxic mortgage-backed securities that brought down many of the world’s banks. Capital flows in and out of China are tightly controlled, and China’s capital markets are closed to foreign companies.But China’s insular financial system has also kept it underdeveloped. Although employees of large Chinese financial institutions usually graduate from top Chinese universities, they lack practical market experience.That lack of experience has sometimes led to poor decisions, and in some cases outright blunders. For example, the Citic Pacific Group of China recently said its realized and potential losses from an attempt to hedge currency risk associated with a large purchase of Australian dollars (needed to buy iron for its steel mills in China) topped $2.4 billion. The China Investment Corporation, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, which controls $200 billion in assets, has lost money on almost all of its investments, including a loss of $2.46 billion, or 82 percent, of the $3 billion it invested in the Blackstone Group.Perhaps it is not surprising then that the majority of the 27 financial institutions represented at the recruiting event, including Citic, the Bank of Shanghai, the Pudong Development Bank and the Shanghai Stock Exchange, all advertised for senior risk managers with 3 to 10 years of experience with international companies in comparable positions.More than 250 people preregistered for the Queens event and more than 850 packed the ballroom. A long line spilled down the hallway, forcing staff members to limit interviews to three minutes. The applicants were a diverse array of nationalities.“Institutions here are looking for people to fill senior positions overseeing risk management, compliance and derivatives. Most importantly, they’re looking for people with a global view,” said Qin Wang, 32, a banker and a member of the Chinese Finance Association, which helped organize the New York event.In addition to formal recruiting events, many financial sector workers have sought jobs in China on their own, working through friends and informal social networks.Tom Leggett, 30, left his investment banking job at Lazard in New York in July, ahead of expected layoffs, and moved to Beijing to search for opportunities. “I talked things over with my parents and friends and decided to come to Beijing to canvas the scene,” he said. “I’ve been talking to both recruiters and friends in my network.”Despite the swelling number of unemployed financial service employees, those qualified to work for Chinese firms is extremely small. Mr. Leggett’s background in Chinese — he studied Mandarin for four years as an undergraduate student at Columbia — made his move feasible. He has shocked many recruiters with his Chinese ability: “They see a tall, white guy and they’ve got low expectations. When they find out I can say a lot more than ‘hello,’ in Chinese, they begin to take me seriously.”While most Chinese employees of financial institutions can speak English, Chinese is still a must for many recruiters. “We’re looking for bilingual candidates because we are constantly negotiating with local Chinese companies, and those meetings are all in Chinese,” Mr. Hong of the Hina Group said.Despite the opportunities China can present, many candidates decide, in the end, not to move — hence the Chinese companies’ global search.Robert Eng, 53, who used to work in the global investment division of Citigroup in New York, traveled to Hong Kong to interview for the director of private wealth position at a large Chinese financial institution. He received an offer, but turned it down, choosing to remain in the United States.“The compensation package was great, but at this point in my life it doesn’t make sense for me; my family is here. Maybe if I were 20 years younger,” Mr. Eng said.For many ambitious overseas candidates, a matter of worry is that they are all but guaranteed to hit a glass ceiling at state-run Chinese companies. Senior management is appointed by the personnel department of the Communist Party — regardless of the votes or recommendations of shareholders or board directors.And for many foreigners, the decision to move to mainland China involves accepting a drastic change in lifestyle.Brian Connors, 35, is the owner of the Bridge cafe, a popular Italian-style restaurant and cafe in the northwest of Beijing that caters to foreigners studying Mandarin and Chinese looking to practice their English.“I’ve seen expatriates come and go — it’s a cyclical thing here. One of the major setbacks that causes foreigners to leave is health: pollution and congestion are hard on your body and lifestyle. The cost of living is really low and there’s great service here but the infrastructure is still developing,” he said. “It’s like living like a king over here; a king of a sort of busted castle.”The transition is easier for bilingual overseas Chinese like Kenneth Chen, 29, who is studying for his M.B.A. at the New York University Stern School of Business. Mr. Chen said that if he was offered a job, the decision to move to China would be a no-brainer: “In this environment, I don’t need anyone to persuade me to go to Shanghai. I want to go.”'"
"'08-12-26,'1','JERUSALEM (Reuters) — The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert on Thursday issued a “last minute” appeal to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to reject the militant leadership of Hamas and stop firing rockets at Israel, warning that he would not hesitate to use force.Other Israeli officials also issued hard-line statements, indicating that Israel might be preparing an offensive against Gaza.“I didn’t come here to declare war,” Mr. Olmert told Al Arabiya, an Arab broadcaster widely watched in Gaza. “But Hamas must be stopped — that is the way it is going to be.”He issued what amounted to a public call to Gazans to overthrow Hamas, the Islamic group that controls the territory. “I’m telling them now,” he said. “It may be the last minute. There will be more blood there. Who wants it? We don’t want it.”Mr. Olmert has resisted calls from within Israel for a major military operation against Hamas, but rocket and mortar fire from Gaza since a six-month truce brokered by Egypt expired last week has increased pressure on him to act. However, some political analysts in Israel cautioned that Israel faced constraints in attacking Gaza, including the fact that past operations have not halted the rocket attacks.Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, a leading candidate to replace Mr. Olmert in an election scheduled for Feb. 10, held emergency talks with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Thursday in Cairo. Mr. Mubarak cautioned against an escalation.Ms. Livni said Hamas had to pay for “unbearable” rocket fire, saying, “Enough is enough.”Adding to the saber-rattling, Israel’s army chief, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, said Israel would have to act with “all our force to hurt the terrorist infrastructure and change the security reality.”'"
"'08-12-26,'1','But corporations have also begun to take their economic power more seriously, especially in emerging markets.Many corporate programs employ microloans, grants or gifts to promote business education. Goldman decided to take a different approach after its research showed that per-capita income in Brazil, China, India, Russia and other emerging markets could rise by as much as 14 percent if women had better management and entrepreneurial skills.“It’s not only philanthropy they’re after,” said Geeta Rao Gupta, president of the International Center for Research on Women. Goldman “had the idea that investment in women means a return on the gross national product of the country, and on household income.”The company set aside $100 million over five years to bring business education to 10,000 qualified women business owners in developing countries, a commitment that remains unchanged despite banking industry turmoil.Ms. Rao Gupta said the long-term view that Goldman and others were taking in emerging markets might help form a new economic stratum in societies where women’s participation in business traditionally had been restricted. Laws and customs in some countries, for example, bar women from opening bank accounts or require a husband’s permission to set up a company.“This is the next step for women because it’s investing long term in business skills,” said Ms. Rao Gupta, whose institute researches and provides technical assistance for women in developing countries.The hurdles can be high. Few women in Africa pursue a business education, often the preserve of well-to-do students heading for corporate jobs. In 50 major business schools in Africa — a continent of 900 million people — only 2,600 women were enrolled in local M.B.A. programs, Goldman’s research found.To foster entrepreneurship and management education, business schools in developing countries are being paired with 50 universities and organizations in Europe and the United States.Earlier this month, for example, 10,000 Women announced that the Yale School of Public Health would work with Tsinghua University to provide management and leadership education to Chinese women working in public health. Women remain at their jobs, allowing them to be with their families and apply their new skills on the spot.“Women often don’t have two years to get an M.B.A.” said Dina H. Powell, who oversees Goldman’s initiative. Family considerations as well as cultural differences make it difficult for many women to leave their home country for study abroad.In Cairo, about 100 women annually can earn a business certificate by participating in the program, where they learn accounting, market research, e-commerce, fund-raising and how to structure a business plan.In countries where attending school can be dangerous for women, a different tack is taken. The Thunderbird School of Management, using Goldman funds, brings Afghan women to its Phoenix campus for five weeks of training. The bank is also financing the training of local professors to teach business courses to women in Kabul.AT&T donated $125,000 through a foundation this year to bring women entrepreneurs from developing countries to the United States for a three-week college-level business course and a week of mentorship with American women business owners.“This is still a small part of what we do,” said Laura Sanford, the foundation’s president. “But it’s an area that’s going to grow as it becomes more recognized that women are part of the economic landscape, and as business owners, they contribute to the economic welfare of their country.”'"
"'08-12-26,'1','Getting rid of divisions and rehabilitating others is nothing new to Philips. The company has shrunk, in terms of annual gross sales, by 30 percent over the last seven years, to 26.8 billion euros, or about $37.5 billion.It continues to sell businesses. In 2006, it sold 80.1 percent of its semiconductor business. It reduced its share in LGPhilips LCD, a joint venture with LG Electronics of South Korea to make TV displays.Philips never made any headway in the low-margin, increasingly commoditized television business. It announced last April that it would cast off its American and Canadian TV operations and license the Philips brand to Funai in exchange for a royalty on sets sold. It has also ended TV sales in Australia and New Zealand.It did not do much better with other home entertainment products. On Jan. 1, it will discontinue selling DVD, Blu-ray and home theater surround-sound devices in the American market. Funai, a Japanese company, will make and market the products with the Philips name. The company will continue to sell TVs in some markets, and it will also keep selling MP3 players, shavers, toothbrushes, baby care products, home appliances and portable music accessories. Only two years ago, half its revenue came from consumer electronics, but now it is less than 43 percent.“I could see the day when they get out of TV in Europe,” said Simon Smith, director and equity analyst at Credit Suisse in London. Mr. Smith noted that in this low-margin business, Philips “innovates around the edges,” to maintain profits.Yet even though the world is simultaneously aging and becoming more environmentally conscious, the sudden economic downturn could change Philips’s short-term fortunes. Last month, Philips said it would lay off 1,600 health care division employees, 5 percent of its work force, because of the recession. And it is unlikely that an LED light bulb that costs more than $50 will find many eager buyers as companies and households cut back.Mr. Kleisterlee wants to get Philips back to the size it was in 2000. “In five years, I want to grow Philips to a 30 billion euro ($37.9 billion) business,” he said.To get there, Philips has gone on a buying spree. In the last two years it has picked up 16 companies, 11 of them in the United States, including some that specialize in health care and lighting.Philips bought Lifeline, a home health care monitoring system, and Respironics, which makes equipment to treat sleep apnea and other sleep disorders. The division already specializes in medical imaging, competing against General Electric and Siemens in advanced CT, MRI and X-ray machines, and claims a 40 percent global market share (50 percent in the United States) for in-patient monitoring, including ultrasound and other pregnancy-monitoring equipment.Philips also sells cardiac home monitors that transmit data to a doctor’s office, home defibrillators and a variety of out-patient monitoring systems for assisted living operations.Its new Lifeline division extends the reach beyond the hospital by monitoring 720,000 elderly or infirm at-home customers in the United States and Canada. It is also working with an intriguing business model. “I don’t want to sell blood pressure cuffs and defibrillators,” said Ronald Feinstein, Philips Lifeline’s president. “I want to give them away and charge a monthly fee.”Customers, who pay $35 to $45 a month, are given a pendant or a TV set-top box that connects to Lifeline. If they experience a medical problem, they push a button on the device to summon help.The company loses about 35 percent of its subscribers each year, mostly because of death. Nevertheless, the subscriber base has been growing about 10 percent a year. The company says it has 60 percent of the home-monitoring market in the United States.The final addition to the revenue stream: the 250 installers who show the subscribers how to use the devices also sell them other products, like fall detectors and automatic pill dispensers.The second part of its shopping spree secured Philips a leading position in the market for the next generation of light bulbs that may eventually replace compact fluorescent bulbs. It bought Color Kinetics, a developer of advanced LED lighting products, and Genlyte, a lighting fixtures maker best known for its Lightolier brand.Lighting is also expected to make important gains in emerging markets as consumers there gain more income. “One of the very first things people buy in emerging markets is light,” Mr. Sivignon said.Most of the lighting will use LEDs, or what the industry calls solid-state lighting. Philips is spending heavily on the technology. The bulk of its research and development budget, about 5.2 percent of global lighting revenue, is used for LED research.Philips expects that in two years, 20 percent of its lighting sales for commercial use will come from LEDs. The company is using demonstration projects to promote its vision of lighting’s future. The London Eye ferris wheel has been retrofitted with Philips LED products. Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway, plans to use Philips LED lights exclusively on an island he owns near Connecticut to cut his power consumption. Philips has also bid on a project to light the Empire State Building.LED bulbs typically use one-tenth the power of traditional light bulbs and last up to 20 times as long. But their prices remain high — a LED that could replace a $1 incandescent light bulb or a $2 compact fluorescent bulb now costs about $60.

"'08-12-27,'0','The National Archives has already begun trucking boxes of paper records from the White House to a warehouse it is leasing in Lewisville, Tex., not a great distance from where Mr. Bush’s presidential library is to be built, at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.The archives invoked its emergency plan to deal with problems in transferring two types of electronic files: a huge collection of digital photographs and the “records management system,” which provides an index to most of the textual records generated by Mr. Bush and his staff members in the last eight years.Archivists said it could be weeks or months before these files could be indexed and searched.In their plan, archives officials wrote, the transition poses “unique challenges” because of the huge volume of electronic records, some of them in “formats not previously dealt with.” Even though archivists have been working with the White House to survey the documents, “there is always a possibility that some electronic records may be overlooked,” the officials wrote.If the electronic records of the Bush White House total 100 terabytes of information, as archives officials estimate, that would be about 50 times the volume of electronic records left behind by the Clinton White House in 2001 and some five times the contents of all 20 million catalogued books in the Library of Congress.“It’s a monstrous volume of material, and some people wonder if the system can absorb it,” said Lee White, executive director of the National Coalition for History, a collection of 60 archival and historical groups.Sam Watkins, a transition liaison officer at the archives, said his agency was expecting to receive 20 to 24 terabytes of e-mail alone from the Bush White House. By contrast, Mr. Watkins said, the volume of e-mail from the Clinton White House was less than one terabyte.While some routine messages may be of little interest to historians, the law does not generally permit White House officials to pick which messages to preserve. And for an administration not documented by the tapes that captured the inside story of the Johnson and Nixon White Houses, e-mail may provide a substitute, historians say.The archives said it had “a high level of confidence” that it could bring the e-mail into its electronic record-keeping system and retrieve messages in response to requests from Congress and the courts.But Thomas S. Blanton, director of the nonprofit National Security Archive, a plaintiff in several lawsuits seeking Bush administration records, said the National Archives’ track record did not justify such a claim.Archives officials said they might have been better prepared for the transition if the White House had cooperated earlier.Millions of White House e-mail messages created from 2003 to 2005 appear to be missing and may not be recoverable. And in September 2007, the top lawyer at the National Archives wrote in a memorandum that he had “made almost zero progress” planning the transition because the White House had ignored repeated requests for information about the volume and formats of electronic records.In May of this year, the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, found that “the administration has not yet provided specific information on the volume and types of data to be transferred” to the archives. Linda D. Koontz of the accountability office warned in May and again in September that the National Archives might not be ready for the torrent of electronic records on Jan. 20.Questions remain about how quickly the archives will be able to make the records accessible to Congress, the courts and researchers, said Paul Brachfeld, the archives’ inspector general.“The electronic records archives system may be able to take in a tremendous amount of e-mail and other records,” Mr. Brachfeld said. “But just because you ingest the data does not mean that people can locate, identify, recover and use the records they need.”The contingency plan, quietly approved by the National Archives on Nov. 7, emphasizes the difficulties posed by large numbers of White House records created with proprietary commercial software.Proprietary products can create problems because they quickly become obsolete, as anyone who has weathered the transition from VHS tape to DVDs can attest. The National Archives seeks to preserve electronic records in a form that can be used for decades to come.Even if the technology were perfect, some historians, librarians and watchdog groups say they do not fully trust the administration to preserve its records.Their worries were heightened by a filing by Mr. Cheney’s lawyers this month in a lawsuit filed by the National Security Archive, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and other interest groups. The filing said neither the National Archives nor the court “may supervise the vice president or his office” for compliance with the Presidential Records Act.“There’s some anxiety, particularly given the attitude of the office of the vice president toward records preservation and disclosure,” said Steven Aftergood, of the Federation of American Scientists, who is editor of the online publication Secrecy News.A Cheney spokesman, Megan M. Mitchell, said that his office had been handing over records to the archives “for some time now” and that concerns about the vice president’s intentions were misplaced.“We will do everything we can under the law to preserve records,” Ms. Mitchell said.But J. William Leonard, who stepped down in January as the top archives official overseeing classified records, said there was ample reason for skepticism.Mr. Leonard, who clashed while in government with the vice president’s office, noted a remark that Mr. Cheney made in September 2007, at the presidential library of Gerald R. Ford, for whom Mr. Cheney once worked as White House chief of staff.“I’m told researchers like to come and dig through my files, to see if anything interesting turns up,” Mr. Cheney said. “I want to wish them luck, but the files are pretty thin. I learned early on that if you don’t want your memos to get you in trouble some day, just don’t write any.”'"

"'08-12-27,'0','“We had a partner that was double-dealing us,” he said during an interview in his house in a Washington suburb. “Anyone can be snookered and double-dealt. But after six years you have to start to figure it out.”At times speaking with the cool dispassion of a career intelligence analyst, Mr. Riedel has a professorial air as he sits in his living room surrounded by books about South Asia and the Middle East, and memoirs by past C.I.A. directors. His wife, whom he met at the C.I.A., continues to work at the agency as a Middle East analyst.His new book, “The Search for Al Qaeda,” jabs at the Bush administration for diverting troops and resources from Afghanistan to Iraq, and for a byzantine intelligence apparatus that “lacks a sheriff to lead the posse” in the hunt for Qaeda operatives.He believes that the terrorist network is hoping the United States keeps troops in Afghanistan and Iraq for the long haul.“In its view, the ‘bleeding wars’ offer the best opportunity to defeat the United States,” he writes. “It is much easier to kill the enemy in Mesopotamia and Afghanistan’s traps.”And yet Al Qaeda is not invulnerable: “It lacks a cohesive vision of the future and a workable plan for government. It has often overplayed its hand and created strong blowback.”MR. RIEDEL struggles at times to lay out a path for the president-elect on Pakistan — the foreign policy headache he calls “the hardest part of this whole thing” — that is vastly different from the course the Bush administration has charted in recent months.For example, he believes that the C.I.A.’s campaign of airstrikes using remotely controlled Predator aircraft should continue if there is solid evidence about the whereabouts of militant leaders inside Pakistan.Washington must approach Pakistan with a “subtle and deft touch,” he said, and strengthen the civilian government of President Asif Ali Zardari, the husband of Benazir Bhutto, the slain former prime minister, to act as a counterweight to Pakistan’s military and intelligence apparatus, which still dominates Pakistan’s political life.Winning over the generals, Mr. Riedel said, could require a tough-love approach: overhauling military aid to Pakistan and cutting sales of the big-ticket weapons the country has used to keep pace with its archrival, India. Instead, he argues, the United States should be providing equipment like helicopters and night-vision goggles to help Pakistan’s military navigate the mountain passes where militants have established their base.It was Washington’s too cozy relationship with Mr. Musharraf’s military government, he argues, that fueled the intense hatred for the United States in Pakistan. He cites polls that more Pakistanis blame the United States than either India or Al Qaeda for the recent surge of violence in the country.“Anytime in Pakistan where more people blame you than India for the country’s problems, you are in deep, deep trouble,” he saidBorn in Queens, Mr. Riedel was just a year old when his father, a political adviser at the United Nations, moved his family to Jerusalem and later to Beirut, Lebanon. As fighting spread throughout Beirut during the Lebanese civil war in 1958, he was forced to flee with his mother and brother and relocate for two months to Naples, Italy.After the travels of his youth, he decided to study Middle East history as an undergraduate at Brown University, and earned a master’s at Harvard in medieval Islamic history.As a career analyst, he spent most of his C.I.A. years on the agency’s sprawling campus in Langley, Va., but he occasionally got a taste of a clandestine officer’s life during trips abroad. On a trip to Beirut in 1983, 25 years after he had evacuated the city as a boy with his family, he found that many things there had not changed.Jumping off a helicopter at the American Embassy, an official asked him if he wanted a handgun or a shotgun. “I wanted the next flight out, that’s what I wanted,” he recalls with a laugh.He remained in the C.I.A.’s service his entire career but did a tour of duty at the Pentagon and worked as a senior adviser at the National Security Council under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush. On Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Riedel was sitting next to Condoleezza Rice, then the president’s national security adviser, at a staff meeting when she learned that planes had hit the World Trade Center.DESPITE his ties to President-elect Obama — he has advised the campaign since 2007 — he says he has no desire to return to the grind of government service. He is currently researching a book on Israel’s nuclear doctrine.Some of his former C.I.A. colleagues describe him as unflappable and usually eager to champion a dissenting analytical view. This did not always make him a popular person at the spy agency — a place often criticized for “groupthink.”“There are a lot of people at C.I.A. who were more wedded to traditional ways of thinking who butted heads with Bruce, and he certainly has his share of people there who don’t care much for him,” said Kenneth Pollack, who worked with Mr. Riedel both at the N.S.C. and the C.I.A. and is now his colleague at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution.For instance, in the 1970s as the United States continued to back the shah of Iran, Mr. Riedel was among a small group of analysts to predict the fall of the shah’s government and the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini.Today, however, he is in lockstep with his former C.I.A. colleagues on at least one matter: the necessity for Pakistan’s pre-eminent spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, to sever its longstanding ties to militants operating in Pakistan’s tribal areas. These are ties the Bush administration never found a way to break, as the ISI has used the militants as a proxy force there for decades.And they will not be broken, Mr. Riedel said, until Pakistan’s generals and spy agencies acknowledge what Pakistan’s president learned only through heartbreak — that the struggle against Al Qaeda and its ilk is “their war” as much as it is America’s.“Zardari knows it’s his war, because he buried his wife,” he said. “That tragedy is also an opportunity.”'"
"'08-12-27,'0','That is a popular mantra, especially now. Ultrasafe comes at a cost, however, and there are not many bulletproof investments that yield more than 2 or 3 percent, experts said. For the risk-averse, that might be plenty when you just do not know what might lurk around the corner.And because conditions may worsen before they improve, older investors should check that their bond investments are indeed what they thought they were — and that they fit their tolerance for risk. “We are in a 2 to 3 percent world, and if they want to earn more than that they need to proceed cautiously,” said Gary Cloud, a bond manager at Financial Counselors in Kansas City, Mo.Several advisers and bond experts recommended that investors maintain higher cash reserves than they might in more normal times. Keeping two to three of years of living expenses in extremely safe investments, like a certificate of deposit or a money market account at a large financial institution, can provide some breathing room. That way, investors will not be forced to sell investments at an inopportune time.Investors also need to remember that bond funds and individual bonds work a bit differently. With an individual bond, investors are guaranteed to receive their original investment back after it matures, as long as the company does not implode. With bond funds, there is no such guarantee because the value of the bonds inside will fluctuate with market conditions. That means the value of the investment will vary, too.Of course, a sizable pile of money is needed to build a portfolio of individual bonds as opposed to simply purchasing a bond fund. Opinions vary widely — from $50,000 to $500,000 — on the amount needed to be properly diversified, though several experts agree it can be done with about $100,000 to $200,000. It is probably best to sit down with an adviser, preferably a fee-only adviser or one that charges by the hour, to go through the pros, cons and costs of each.Some advisers have strong feelings about both instruments. Some refuse to use bond funds because they say they do not know what they own, though that problem can be addressed by using index funds, whose investments remain relatively static. Other advisers say they cannot attain the level of diversification with individual issues. Whatever you decide, knowing what you own and understanding the risks involved are what really matters. And if a bond investment promises high returns, a little mental bell should go off as a warning signal.“We see a lot of retirees come in and they have a lot of their fixed-income investments in aggressive funds,” said Richard Rosso, a financial planner with Charles Schwab in Houston. “They have gotten seduced by the yield of the fund and didn’t look at how that yield was being derived.”Instead, investors should anchor their portfolios with a fund, or combination of funds, that hold wide swaths of high-quality government-backed, corporate and mortgage-backed bonds — with short- to intermediate-term maturities, experts said. (Shorter-term securities are less sensitive to changes in interest rates; when rates rise, bond prices fall). Low expenses are extremely important because bond funds do not yield much to begin with. The Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund fits that bill. It is up nearly 5 percent this year and charges a rock-bottom 0.07 percent of assets. Two actively managed options, Harbor Bond, managed by Bill Gross of Pimco, and FPA New Income — up 2.2 percent and 4.03 percent, respectively — are considered strong choices where capital preservation is a top priority, Ms. Sjoblom of Morningstar said. But, of course, they are more expensive.Beyond a fund like the Vanguard Total Bond Market, advisers also recommend adding a dose of international bonds as well as Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, whose interest payments and underlying principal keep pace with inflation. Deflation fears are trumping inflation fears, at least for the moment, which has caused the price of TIPS to drop. But the government has printed a lot of new money and is expected to keep doing so, experts said.“There is a possibility that inflation will heat up in the future, so why not add money as a hedge for future inflation?” said Mr. Rosso, especially now, when TIPS are attractively priced. He recommends limiting allocation of these to no more than 10 percent of bonds in a portfolio. They can be purchased directly (but keep those in a tax-deferred account) or in a fund or exchange-traded fund.Meanwhile, high-quality municipal bonds — or funds — may be appropriate for certain investors. Because municipal bonds are generally tax-free, they tend to pay less in interest than their taxable counterparts, and normally make sense only for people in the highest tax brackets. But many top-rated municipal bonds are now yielding more than taxable bonds, which makes them attractive to a broader population, experts said. Despite budgetary troubles in places like New York and California, and the economic headwinds all municipalities face, advisers said sticking with the highest-quality short- and intermediate-term general obligation munis — or those backed by a municipality’s taxing power — are a reasonably safe bet.“You can make the argument that anyone will do better owning that,” Mr. Podnos said. Long-term municipal bond funds have lost 10.5 percent for the year as of Wednesday, and shorter-term funds are up 0.5 percent, according to Morningstar. Short- and intermediate-term funds are not subject to as much volatility, he said, and will produce a combined tax-free yield of 3 to 4 percent, the equivalent of a 5 to 6 percent taxable yield.For investors with even less tolerance for risk, advisers recommend the following:C.D.’S Certificates of deposit, which pay a fixed interest rate but lock up money for three months to five years, are guaranteed by the government for up to $250,000 for each depositor at each bank. Guarantees are scheduled to drop to $100,000 for each depositor at the end of next year. Callable C.D.’s may offer even higher yields, but remember that you are being paid more to take on extra risk: the bank can return your money before the C.D. matures, so you may have to reinvest at a potentially lower rate, Mr. Rosso said. And keep in mind that C.D.’s will penalize you, sometimes substantially, if you withdraw before maturity.F.D.I.C. BONDS These government-backed bonds come with variable or fixed rates. They tend to pay more than Treasuries, with several batches of three-year bonds paying slightly more than 3 percent, though newer bonds have been paying slightly less. They have largely been issued by large financial institutions — like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo — participating in the government program that was created in October to help bolster the credit markets. The debt will be sold through next June and must mature in less than three years. Before you consider these, check whether there are comparable deals in C.D.’s.GINNIE MAE Not to be confused with Fannie or Freddie, Ginnie is owned by the government and issues securities that are backed by federally guaranteed or insured mortgages. Translation: these are safe. Several advisers recommend Ginnie Mae funds — or the actual securities — as a higher-yielding alternative (about 2 percent) to money-market funds. But there is a big caveat: If interest rates move higher, the value of these securities will drop, Mr. Podnos said.PRE-REFUNDED MUNIS Pre-refunded municipal bonds, along with escrowed-to-maturity municipals, are solid options because the payments the bond issuer must make to investors over the life of the bond are held in an escrow fund, usually comprising United States government securities. The yields tend to pay about two percentage points above Treasuries with a comparable maturity, said William Larkin, a fixed-income manager at Cabot Money Management. Just be sure the collateral is Treasuries. “It’s the safest of the safe,” added Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management.'"
"'08-12-27,'0','EMI, which owns the group’s recordings, remastered them at least two years ago. According to a 1989 agreement that ended 20 years of lawsuits between the Beatles and EMI, the label can do nothing without an O.K. from Apple. But Apple is supposedly keen: early in 2007 it hired Jeff Jones, a record executive whose last job was overseeing historical reissues for the superb Sony Legacy series.There would have been no reason to hire someone with that background if archival reissues were not in the company’s plans, and since Apple acts only with the unanimous consent of its four shareholders — Mr. McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison — presumably all four have agreed to a release program, at least in principle.And how many record labels, just now, are facing an army of consumers who are saying, in effect: “We’ve bought this music several times already — on mono and stereo LPs, on picture discs and audiophile vinyl, perhaps on cassette and most recently on CD — but please, we beg you, sell it to us again.”So what’s the holdup? No one is willing to say, but Mr. McCartney recently asserted that EMI was demanding an unspecified concession that the Beatles were unwilling to make.Frankly, the reasons hardly matter at this point: to collectors awaiting these releases, either on physical CDs (improved sound being the main point of remastering) or as digital downloads (where convenience trumps audiophile considerations), the inability of Apple and EMI to get this music onto the market is a symbol of how pathetic the record business has become, and how dysfunctional Apple continues to be. On Beatles chat boards and Web sites, the $395 pen, in particular, was greeted with derision.This must be intensely frustrating for Mr. Jones; in fact, people close to EMI and Apple say he has a significant list of projects that he would love to release. But in the nearly two years he’s been at Apple, he has presided over the video game agreement and a DVD documentary about the making of the “Love” show (which, in truth, includes a few revealing moments, showing the difficulties of dealing with Apple’s shareholders, from Cirque du Soleil’s point of view).While EMI and Apple have been squabbling, collectors have taken matters into their own hands, pooling unreleased tracks and compiling anthologies that are far more ambitious than anything EMI is likely to release. Usually, these unauthorized desktop bootleg projects (which are of course illegal) have attractive cover art and copious annotations, and these days money rarely changes hands for them: the people who compile them distribute them freely (and encourage others to do so) either on home-burned CDs and DVDs or, increasingly, on the Internet.Some are curatorial masterpieces. A label called Purple Chick has assembled deluxe editions of each commercially released album, offering the original discs in their mono and stereo mixes, along with the singles (also in mono and stereo) released at the time, as well as every known demo, studio outtake and alternative mix.Drawing mostly on an earlier generation of less obsessively organized bootlegs and adding otherwise unbootlegged rarities when they turn up, Purple Chick has generally chosen the best-sounding and most complete takes (editing together fragments where necessary) and has done some speed correction and other sonic tweaking.It offers upgrades, as well: when copies of the unmixed, unedited four-track masters of four songs from “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” began circulating at the end of last year, Purple Chick revised its “Sgt. Pepper” compilation to accommodate them.So if you wanted to celebrate the anniversary of “The White Album,” you could turn to Purple Chick’s “Beatles Deluxe,” which covers 10 CDs. And if you want to begin the new year by commemorating the 40th anniversary of the “Let It Be” sessions, which ran from Jan. 2 to 31, 1969, you still have a few days to find Purple Chick’s “A/B Road,” which offers nearly 96 hours of those sessions on 83 CDs.It can be a slog — songs are rehearsed endlessly — but its best moments are magical. Along with discussions, fights and jam sessions, you hear classic tracks coming together, from the first time one of the Beatles walks the others through its chord progression, straight through to the finished arrangement, with lyrics taking shape along the way.Purple Chick has also compiled the group’s BBC radio performances on 10 CDs and a CD-ROM (compared with EMI’s two-CD official release), and is currently working its way through all the available concert recordings.Another label, Lazy Tortoise, is compiling chronologically all the Beatles’ television and radio interviews. And on DVD, the FAB label is doing the same with the group’s film and television appearances, from 1962 to the present.Nobody who collects these things would hesitate to buy officially released archival projects, if only Apple and EMI would release them. Perhaps by the time the 40th anniversary of the “Abbey Road” album rolls around, on Sept. 26, Apple and EMI will have gotten it together.'"
"'08-12-27,'0','“A drastic fall in the number of orders means several companies will be forced to cut their work force,” Mr. Thumann said in an interview with the German news agency D.P.A.Already the automobile, chemical and wood processing sectors have introduced shorter working weeks and even some layoffs.In addition to seeking more federal spending, the Federation of German Industry has repeatedly called on Mrs. Merkel to cut taxes, especially employers’ contributions to the social welfare system, to encourage more consumer spending.The dispute over taxes has even led to a wedge between the two conservative parties that support Mrs. Merkel, her Christian Democratic Union and its allied party in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union. Taxes must be lowered immediately, the Bavarian party said. Mrs. Merkel said she preferred to wait until after the federal elections.Conservative officials said the Bavarian party was acting more for political reasons than economic ones. It fared poorly in recent state elections, losing its absolute majority for the first time in several decades. Under new leadership, the party is aiming to win back disaffected voters in time for the European Parliament elections in June and the federal elections in September largely by adopting a line that is more independent of the Christian Democratic Union.The European Union, while weakening its criticism of Mrs. Merkel’s cautious approach to dealing with the economic crisis, still wants the German government to do more because it has the largest economy in Europe.Mrs. Merkel, so far, has kept the lobbyists, the state leaders and the European Union guessing about her final package.After a meeting Tuesday of representatives from the 16 federal states and Mrs. Merkel’s chief of staff, Thomas de Maizière, it appeared that the government wanted to limit spending to keep it well within the limits of Europe’s Stability and Growth Pact, according to politicians present. The pact limits deficit spending to 3 percent of gross domestic product, so the limit in Germany’s case amounts to about 80 billion euros.Ingolf Deubel, finance minister of Rheinland-Palatinate, who attended the meeting, told the newspaper Rhein-Zeitung that the Merkel government wanted to keep any extra spending to about 25 billion euros.Regional politicians want more public money for big infrastructure projects, to which the government has already allocated 12 billion euros. It has also made 500 billion euros in bank guarantees.Mrs. Merkel and Peer Steinbrück, the finance minister, seem to have concluded that they will face criticism no matter what action they take.If they increase spending, they risk violating the Stability and Growth Pact. But if they do not, they face further complaints from other European Union countries, notably Britain and France, and from industry here for not doing enough to bring Europe out of the economic crisis.'"
"'08-12-27,'0','HONG KONG — In China’s first modern deployment of battle-ready warships beyond the Pacific, a naval task force set out Friday to begin escorts and patrols in the pirate-infested Gulf of Aden, state news media reported.A supply ship and two destroyers departed from Sanya, on the island province of Hainan, carrying a total of about 800 crew members, according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.“In addition to missiles, artillery and satellite communications, special troops who are trained for the tasks will also be on board the warships,” said Xiao Xinnian, deputy chief of China’s naval forces, in a news broadcast on CCTV, the state network.The task force commander, Rear Adm.

Most of that passes through the gulf, along with huge shipments of raw materials from Africa.'"
"'08-12-27,'0','“The output results were very disappointing,” said Satoru Ogasawara, an economist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo. “They are much worse than expected.”Japan’s export-dependent economy has been hit especially hard by the downturn in the United States and Europe because those economies are key markets for corporate giants like Panasonic, Nissan and Toyota.“It was U.S. excess consumption that was behind Japan’s growth in the past few years,” said Mr. Kono of BNP Paribas.With the United States and Europe now in recession, Japan’s exporters have been forced to issue a string of profit warnings and production and staff cutbacks.The data on Friday showed manufacturers planned to scale back output a further 8 percent this month, putting the manufacturing sector in line for a quarterly drop of 11.1 percent. This, combined with figures out Monday showing that exports in November dropped a staggering 26.7 percent from a year earlier, shows the overall Japanese economy is heading for a contraction of more than 5 percent this quarter, said Mr. Kono, the BNP Paribas economist.Many economists say they believe the first two quarters of 2009 also look set to contract, before the economy bottoms out during the second half of next year.For next year over all, Mr. Ogasawara of Credit Suisse forecast that Japan’s economy would shrink 2.1 percent.Adding to the bleak picture, other data on Friday showed Japanese manufacturers’ inventories continued to swell despite the production cutbacks, as shipments declined more rapidly than the companies’ ability to rein in output. This means companies will be burdened with huge inventory build-ups, which will hamper their ability to rebound once the economy does start to bottom out.Data also showed the jobless rate climbed to 3.9 percent in November, from 3.7 percent the previous month. Household spending slid a modest 0.5 percent but was widely expected to deteriorate sharply as the recession deepened.Meanwhile, annual core consumer inflation slowed to 1 percent in November, from 1.9 percent the previous month, thanks largely to a plunge in oil prices, and early December data for the key Tokyo region foreshadowed an overall December reading of only 0.2 percent.This puts the country in line for a slight fall in prices — that is, deflation — by the second quarter of 2009, according to Mr. Kono, the BNP Paribas economist.With interest rates in Japan already near zero, the Bank of Japan has virtually no room to cut the cost of borrowing further and will now resort to buying commercial paper, or short-term debt, to shore up ailing Japanese credit markets.Other economies in the region have also raced to shore up their ailing economies as the impact of the slowdown in the United States eats into the key export sectors.In China, where the economy is rapidly losing momentum and where the authorities last month announced a huge stimulus plan, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, said the country needed to devise more policies to bolster consumption to offset falling exports.And in South Korea, the economy ministry said that the country’s economy was in an “unprecedented crisis” but that the government would strive to avert an annual decline in exports in 2009.'"

"'08-12-28,'0','Nuclear power plants would then compete with coal-fired plants. Wind and solar power would have a shot against natural gas. Trains would compete with trucks. We would clean the air, create wealth and jobs through a new technology boom and drastically improve our national security.The market-driven innovation that brought us the Internet and the personal computer could quickly bring us new, cleaner fuels. A carbon tax that was fully offset (with payroll or income taxes cut by a dollar amount equal to the revenues generated by the new tax) would be as bold as the threat that we face.Conservatives do not have to agree that humans are causing climate change to recognize a sensible energy solution. All we need to assume is that burning less fossil fuels would be a good thing. Based on the current scientific consensus and the potential environmental benefits, it’s prudent to do what we can to reduce global carbon emissions. When you add the national security concerns, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels becomes a no-brainer.Yet the costs of reducing carbon emissions are not trivial. Climate change may be a serious problem, but a higher overall tax rate would devastate the long-term growth of America and the world.It is essential, therefore, that any taxes on carbon emissions be accompanied by equal, pro-growth tax cuts. A carbon tax that isn’t accompanied by a reduction in other taxes is a nonstarter. Fiscal conservatives would gladly trade a carbon tax for a reduction in payroll or income taxes, but we can’t go along with an overall tax increase.The good news is that both Democrats and Republicans could support a carbon tax offset by a payroll or income tax cut. Former Vice President Al Gore has argued for eliminating all payroll taxes and replacing them with “pollution taxes.” He said in a speech at New York University’s law school two years ago: “It would be, in other words, a revenue-neutral tax swap. But, instead of discouraging businesses from hiring more employees, it would discourage business from producing more pollution.”The United States can’t solve climate change alone. The Kyoto climate treaty was rightly rejected by the Senate because China and India weren’t subject to its provisions. If China and India join the United States in attaching a price to carbon, their goods should come into this country without a carbon adjustment. But if they do not, every item they place on our shelves should be subject to the same carbon tax that we would place on our domestically produced goods, again offset by a revenue-neutral tax cut.If World Trade Organization rules entitle members to an unwarranted exemption from such a carbon tax, then we should change them. Outliers should not be allowed to frustrate the decision-making of the countries that are trying to prevent the security and environmental train wrecks of this century.As president, Barack Obama, by working with conservatives as well as the members of his own party, can at once clean the air, create jobs and improve the national security of the United States — a triple play for the next American century.'"
"'08-12-28,'0','And dogs. Dogfighting was banned under the Taliban, who considered it un-Islamic. But since the Taliban’s ouster in 2001, the sport has regained its earlier popularity, with dogfighters entering their charges in informal weekly tournaments on dusty lots in the country’s major cities.The sport has even experienced a resurgence in the south, where the influence of the Taliban is strongest, though the crowds have thinned somewhat since February, when a suicide bomber detonated himself at a dogfighting match. About 80 people were killed and more were wounded.Here in the capital, there are two tournaments every week, both on Friday, the day of prayer. The bigger one unfolds in the morning in a natural dirt amphitheater at the bottom of a craggy slope on the city’s outskirts. It draws thousands of men and boys as spectators — like most sports and sporting events in Afghanistan, it is almost exclusively a male pursuit.“It’s something from our ancestors,” said Ghulam Yahya Amirzadah, 21, whose family owns 17 dogs in Kabul and in their hometown in the northwest province of Badghis.Mr. Amirzadah, who is known in dogfighting circles as Lala Herati, said he inherited the pastime from his father, who ran fighting dogs in his youth.“It’s not about money,” Mr. Amirzadah said. “If my dog beats another dog, it makes me feel like I’ve won $100,000. I can survive just from the happiness.”On a recent Friday, Mr. Amirzadah was at the dogfighting amphitheater, though without his dogs. He was watching the fights and arranging future matches for his stable.More than 2,000 people were there — poor men who had arrived on foot as well as former warlords in sport utility vehicles accompanied by Kalashnikov-toting guards. And there were dozens of dogs — hulking, big-headed mastiff breeds that, in the right light and the wrong setting, might be mistaken for small bears. Some were so big that they had to be restrained by two men. A few owners, their arms tired, had lashed their dogs to the wheels of cars.An informal committee of arbiters, including Mr. Kefayatullah and Abdul Sabour, was selecting the fights and matching up the dogs. Some fights had been organized days in advance, with hundreds of dollars, sometimes thousands, riding on each.A ringmaster, a toothless old man with a turban and a limp, presided over the event. He carried a wooden staff that he used to beat spectators who crowded the dirt arena and members of the dogfighters’ entourages who blocked the view.Though dogfighting is again popular here, it is far from universally embraced. The country’s elite disparage it as the domain of the uncultured and the criminal.“In my personal view, it’s not a good thing,” said Ghulam Nabi Farahi, deputy minister of information and culture. “In today’s world, these animals should be treated well. But unfortunately, there’s a lot of fighting.”But dogfighters generally shrug at these sorts of remarks. In modern Afghan society, there are not many sources of entertainment, they argue. In addition, they say, the dogs are well fed and well treated.“The interest of the people is increasing day by day,” said Sher Mohammad Sheywaki, 50, who was standing on the edge of the fighting pitch. “Even if people are starving, they’ll still keep dogfighting.”A fight was about to begin. Two dogs were brought close by their owners, then released. They lunged at each other, thrusting upward on hind legs and clamping their jaws onto each other’s face. They tugged and twisted each other, looking for leverage, each trying to knock the other off balance.Their handlers pressed in, shouting encouragement and slapping the dogs on their haunches, as a jockey would a racehorse. A cameraman crouched nearby, recording the fight for collectors’ DVDs. A large cloud of dust enveloped the scrum.This fight, like most others, was over in a few minutes when one dog had pinned the other to the ground and held him there. They were pulled apart and hauled out of the ring.In some countries, dogfighters will fight their dogs to the death. But Afghan dogfighting is more akin to Greco-Roman wrestling. A dog is declared the victor when he clearly establishes his dominance over the other, or when the weaker dog displays one of the telltale signs of submission, including backing off from the fight or putting its tail between its legs. They are usually pulled apart before they can inflict serious damage on each other.The stakes for dogfighters are too high to risk their charges any further. Dogs may be a costly investment for the average Afghan, but they can also make their owners money.On the eve of the fight between Mr. Kefayatullah’s dog, Palang (meaning tiger), and Abdul Sabour’s dog, Zambur (bee), the planned $50,000 purse dropped to $10,000, according to Mr. Kefayatullah.The fight took place on a sunny and chilly Friday morning this month. It was heavily anticipated, and the crowd was large. For more than 10 minutes, Palang and Zambur tore against each other, drawing blood. Mr. Kefayatullah, Abdul Sabour and others with money riding on the fight stayed close and yelled encouragement, according to Mr. Amirzadah, who attended.Eventually, Zambur, Abdul Sabour’s dog, ran out of steam and Palang overwhelmed him, prompting the men to call a halt to the fight. In celebration, friends of Mr. Kefayatullah swarmed Palang, whose fur was wet with blood, and showered him with Afghani bills.Except for deep wounds on a leg and an ear, Palang was O.K. But his owner was not. Minutes after the fight, Mr. Kefayatullah collapsed and was rushed to the hospital. He had a heart attack.“It was a stroke of joy and happiness!” he joked a week later, as he lay in a ward in the Wazir Akhbar Khan Hospital in Kabul. His wife and daughter sat at his bedside. “I’ll be up in no time,” he said, “and everything will be back to normal, like before.”His wife’s face visibly tensed. “No you won’t!” she said, glaring. She was serious. He was smiling. The daughter looked embarrassed.“It’s over,” Mr. Kefayatullah’s wife continued. “I will kill the dogs! I will give them some pills.”Mr. Kefayatullah shrugged and smiled again, trying to defuse the situation. “She says a lot, but I don’t listen,” he said, and he vowed to be back at the Friday dogfights — with his champion dogs — soon enough.'"
"'08-12-28,'0','Over 23 years, dozens of Cooper’s clients fired, dismissed, replaced, terminated or, in the sanitized parlance of news releases, “relieved of his duties.” Still, it hurts every time.“It doesn’t matter if it’s 1 or it’s 12, it’s personal with me, because these are my dear friends and I’ve been with them so long,” Cooper said last week in a rare telephone interview. “If you talk to them, they’ll tell you — I’m there not just to do their contracts. I’m there for the highs and lows.”Sometimes those highs and lows come in rapid succession. Rivers coached the Boston Celtics to the championship last June. Nate McMillan, another Cooper client, is leading a fantastic revival in Portland, where the Trail Blazers were 18-12 through Friday.The vicarious thrills are offset by vicarious anguish.The firings began Nov. 22, when P. J. Carlesimo was dismissed by the Oklahoma City Thunder. Two days later, Eddie Jordan was fired by the Washington Wizards. Sam Mitchell (Toronto) was the next to go, then Randy Wittman (Minnesota) and Maurice Cheeks (Philadelphia). The purge continued Dec. 15, with the Sacramento Kings firing Reggie Theus.Cooper found some degree of solace when the Kings named Kenny Natt, another client, as the interim coach. But mostly, he wondered how any of these teams could claim to have improved their prospects.“If you’re firing six guys at the beginning of the season, but you’re replacing them with an interim coach, what’s the message you’re sending right there?” Cooper said. “Did you make a change because the interim coach is a better coach? I haven’t figured that one out, that logic.”Philadelphia, Washington and Minnesota replaced their coaches with front-office executives — none of whom are expected to return next season. Natt, Scott Brooks (Oklahoma City) and Jay Triano (Toronto), all former assistants, are considered long shots to hold onto their jobs. None of the six teams have shown improvement. The storm of pink slips set one record — for the most N.B.A. coaches fired before Christmas — and reminded Cooper how much the league has changed.“The owners are different; it’s not the Gordon Gunds of the past, it’s not the Davidsons of the past,” Cooper said, referring to Gund, the former Cleveland Cavaliers owner, and Bill Davidson, the aging Detroit Pistons owner.In the last decade, the N.B.A. has had an influx of young, hyperenergetic owners, like the Maloof brothers in Sacramento, Mark Cuban in Dallas, Robert Sarver in Phoenix and Dan Gilbert in Cleveland. They sit courtside at games, cheering, howling and engaging with fans and the news media.“This new breed of ownership are big fans,” Cooper said. “They’re not just businessmen, they’re fans of the N.B.A. And they’re hands-on and they’re real involved and their expectations are very high. I think it starts there. There’s a lot of pressure on general managers and coaches by the new breed of ownership.”Astronomical player salaries and the rise of powerful player agents created some of those pressures. Coaches have much less leverage than they did 20 years ago, and they are competing with agents for influence over their own players and even with their general managers.“The general managers will tell you today that they’re getting more calls about minutes and about touches than they ever have before from the agents,” Cooper said.The stakes for the coaches are also much higher. In 1986, coaches earned an average of $200,000, and no one used an agent. Then Wilkens hired Cooper and secured a $600,000-a-year deal with the Cavaliers.Today, the average coaching salary is about $3.5 million. Assistants generally earn between $200,000 and $400,000, depending on their experience and their position on the staff. Agents are not universally used, but dozens of coaches now employ them.For the first time, Cooper also has a serious rival in the business — Warren LeGarie, a San Francisco-based agent who represents seven current coaches, two dozen assistants and several front-office executives. LeGarie’s growing stable of coaches includes Mike D’Antoni of the Knicks, Rick Carlisle of the Mavericks, Mike Brown of the Cavaliers and Mike Dunleavy of the Clippers.The rest of the league’s coaches use lawyers or lesser-known agents for representation. (A number of coaches used player agents until the players union began enforcing a conflict-of-interest rule that had been flouted for years.) At least two teams, Chicago and San Antonio, are known for being hostile to coaching agents and discourage their employees from using them.Only one other agent has multiple clients in the N.B.A. coaching ranks: Joe Glass, who represents Charlotte’s Larry Brown and Atlanta’s Mike Woodson. (Tyler Glass, Joe’s grandson, works with Milwaukee’s Scott Skiles.)So the field is mostly divided between LeGarie and Cooper, who are engaged in a sort of silent rivalry. They say they have never met and have no interest in each other’s business. They stand mutually aloof, in contrast with the ruthless player-agent business, in which charges of client poaching fly daily.“I don’t know if there’s any competition,” LeGarie said, referring to him and Cooper. “We represent totally different types of clients.”Cooper and LeGarie also provide a study in contrasts. LeGarie, a longtime player agent who shifted his focus to coaches five years ago, is a social butterfly and a consummate power broker (or “broker of happiness,” as LeGarie whimsically calls himself). He started the N.B.A.’s summer league in Las Vegas and is a frequent presence in N.B.A. arenas.“I love the guys,” LeGarie said. “I really, truly like hanging out with them. We have the best time.”Cooper, despite his longevity and extensive network, is rarely seen at N.B.A. events and is even more rarely heard from. He generally turns down interview requests.“I’m really a very behind-the-scenes guy,” Cooper said. “I’ve chosen to be that way. My clients are the star, and I’m not trying to position myself that I am the influence in the situation.”Cooper and LeGarie have much in common. Both have an abundant passion for the N.B.A. Both say they are selective in choosing clients and have no intention of building a monopoly. They also emphasize the need to take care of their coaches before, during and after contract signings. They certainly can empathize with the sting of seeing one’s client fired.“It’s brutal,” LeGarie said. “You’ve got to be strong enough to tell them what they’ve got to hear, not what they want to hear.”While Cooper’s company has blossomed into a diverse sports and entertainment agency, with 168 employees and clients throughout sports and broadcasting, Cooper is still hands-on with his N.B.A. clients. “That’s still my baby,” he said.The rapid-fire firings have not seemed to dampen his enthusiasm, and he predicted that all six coaches would be hired again.“None of these got fired on a controversial situation,” Cooper said. “I’m very proud of them, that every single one walked out with their heads high and with their dignity.”'"
"'08-12-28,'0','In the case of the Fed, the money comes from its authority to print dollars from thin air. Since late August, the Fed has expanded its balance sheet from about $900 billion to more than $2.2 trillion, creating $1.3 trillion that did not exist to replace some of the trillions wiped out by falling house prices and vengeful stock markets. The Fed has taken troublesome assets off the hands of banks and simply credited them with having reserves they previously lacked.In the case of the Treasury, the money comes from the same wellspring that has been financing American debt for decades: Investors in the United States and around the world — not least, the central banks of China, Japan and Saudi Arabia, which have parked national savings in the safety of American government bonds.Americans have gotten accustomed to treating this well as bottomless, even as anxiety grows that it could one day run dry with potentially devastating consequences.The value of outstanding American Treasury bills now reaches $10.6 trillion, a number sure to increase as dollars are spent building bridges, saving auto jobs and preventing the collapse of government-backed mortgage giants. Worry centers on the possibility that foreigners could come to doubt the American wherewithal to pay back such an extraordinary sum, prompting them to stop — or at least slow — their deposits of savings into the United States.That could send the dollar plummeting, making imported goods more expensive for American consumers and businesses. It would force the Treasury to pay higher returns to find takers for its debt, increasing interest rates for home- and auto-buyers, for businesses and credit-card holders.“We got into this mess to a considerable extent by overborrowing,” said Martin N. Baily, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “Now, we’re saying, ‘Well, O.K., let’s just borrow a bunch more, and that will help us get out of this mess.’ It’s like a drunk who says, ‘Give me a bottle of Scotch, and then I’ll be O.K. and I won’t have to drink anymore.’ Eventually, we have to get off this binge of borrowing.”Some argue that the moment for sobriety is long overdue, and postponing it further only increases the ultimate costs. “Our government doesn’t have enough spare cash to bail out a lemonade stand,” declared Peter Schiff president of Euro Pacific Capital, a Connecticut-based trading house. “Our standard of living must decline to reflect years of reckless consumption and the disintegration of our industrial base. Only by swallowing this tough medicine now will our sick economy ever recover.”But most economists cast such thinking as recklessly extreme, akin to putting an obese person on a painful diet in the name of long-term health just as they are fighting off a potentially lethal infection. In the dominant view, now is no time for austerity — not with paychecks disappearing from the economy and gyrating markets wiping out retirement savings. Not with the financial system in virtual lockdown, and much of the world in a similar state of retrenchment, shrinking demand for American goods and services.Since the Great Depression, the conventional prescription for such times is to have the government step in and create demand by cycling its dollars through the economy, generating jobs and business opportunities. That such dollars must be borrowed is hardly ideal, adding to the long-term strains on the nation. But the immediate risks of not spending them could be grave.“This is a dangerous situation,” says Mr. Baily, essentially arguing that the drunk must be kept in Scotch a while longer, lest he burn down the neighborhood in the midst of a crisis. “The risks of things actually getting worse and us going into a really severe recession are high. We need to get more money out there now.”Had the government worried more about limiting spending than about the potential collapse of the mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it might have triggered precisely the dark scenario that consumes those who worry most about growing American debt, argues Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations.China purchased a lot of Fannie and Freddie bonds with the understanding that they were backed by the American government. No bailout “would have been portrayed in China as defaulting on the Chinese people,” Mr. Setser said. That would have increased the likelihood that China would start parking its savings somewhere other than the United States.The most frequently voiced worry about the bailouts is that the Fed, by sending so much money sloshing through the system, risks generating a bad case of rising prices later on. That puts the onus on the Fed to reverse course and crimp economic activity by lifting interest rates and selling assets back to banks once growth resumes.But finding the appropriate point to act tends to be more art than science. The Fed might move too early and send the economy back into a tailspin. It might wait too long and let too much money generate inflation.“It’s a tricky business,” says Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, and a former economic adviser to President Reagan. “There’s no math model that tells us when to do it or how.”But that, as most economists see it, is a worry for another day. Some policy makers are focused on staving off the opposite problem — deflation, or falling prices, as demand weakens to the point that goods pile up without buyers, sending prices down and reducing the incentive for businesses to invest. That could shrink demand further and perhaps even deliver the sort of downward spiral that pinned Japan in the weeds of stagnant growth during the 1990s.“Those who claim that sharp increases in federal borrowing and the national debt would be ill advised at the present time, when the economy is weakening while deflation threatens, have failed to study Japan’s history,” declared the economist John H. Makin in a report published by the conservative American Enterprise Institute — ordinarily, a staunch advocate for lean government.So back to the well Americans go, putting aside worries about debt, unleashing another wave of synthesized money in an effort to prevent deeper misery.“Right now,” Mr. Setser says, “the risk is not doing enough.”'"

"'08-12-28,'0','But heart-stopping film events like that have been popping up every few weeks this year.Or at least it felt that way if you were willing to close your eyes and take a ride with Hollywood’s marketing mavens and those who help them along in the media, old and new.It’s all great fun — and, in the heat of the moment, can seem tantalizingly real. Remember the high-heeled stampede toward “Sex and the City”? What a romp! Cosmopolitans. Bus tours. Girls’ nights out.Eventually, about 22 million tickets were sold. That puts it on a par with “Steel Magnolias” in 1989 or “The First Wives Club” in 1996 — movies that played to about the same number of viewers, but did so with considerably less noise.Even this year’s really big one, “The Dark Knight,” was never quite as big as it felt. Clear away the urgent reports about 6 a.m. screenings and Imax-size demand, and you are left, according to an always-sobering tally kept by the Box Office Mojo Web site, atboxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm, with the 26th-most-popular movie of all time, in terms of tickets sold.Apparently, movie events that were once routine are now routinely treated as thrilling.Part of the reason is obvious: Those vast, exciting openings we all love have acquired a kind of false amplitude from ticket price inflation. A movie ticket in 2007 cost $6.88, on average (and at least 20 cents more in 2008), up nearly 47 percent from $4.69 in 1998. In general, the cost of consumer goods rose only about 27 percent in the same 10 years, according to a popular inflation calculator available on the Web at westegg.com/inflation/.Inevitably, the weekend box-office numbers loomed larger and larger, even as fewer people were going to see the pictures.According to Media By Numbers, a consulting company that tracks such things, admissions to theaters — adrift for years — are now about 3 percent behind last year’s count, even as box-office revenue is poised to top the $9.7 billion record set in 2007.If inflation-soaked numbers consistently look exceptional — with a $42 million opening weekend, even “High School Musical 3: Senior Year” began to feel like a blockbuster — they have appeared to grow still more in the magnifying lens of the Internet.Who can resist the drama when box-office aficionados at Fandango.com, Movietickets.com, Boxofficeguru.com and Deadlinehollywooddaily.com start pumping up the volume, and building their own traffic, in the weeks before a movie like “Twilight” opens?Before you know it, fans trample one another at a mall and make TMZ.com. Pretty soon, even The New York Times is staking out “Twilight”-mania at a shopping center in suburban Philadelphia.All not to be scooped on a movie that so far has had about as many viewers as the dimly recalled angel romance “Michael,” from 1996.Maybe everything looks a little bigger than it really is in these somewhat hysterical times.“It’s certainly easier to create a media event, if you have the right stars and get the right traction,” said Howard Bragman, a Hollywood publicist who, with Michael Levin, has made a study of contemporary publicity in a book, “Where’s My Fifteen Minutes?,” which was recently published by Portfolio Hardcover.The problem, Mr. Bragman said, “is that there’s shockingly little relationship between the publicity, i.e., the hype, and butts in seats.”In truth, a little exaggeration is probably good for the movie industry (though it does not do much for journalism). Studios need the excitement of seemingly enormous openings to juice waning DVD sales while they wait for the next truly big thing — a new distribution format that would let companies once again resell all those movies that have been peddled previously on broadcast television, cable, videocassettes and discs.Until that happens, though, it may be a good idea to keep an inflation calculator handy. Just so we don’t start kidding ourselves about what is really going on here.As colossal as it seemed back in May, “Iron Man” was no “Twister.” The 1996 tornado film, that year’s No. 2, easily outsold the superhero, this year’s second-biggest event, 55 million tickets to 45 million.And “Turner & Hooch,” from 1989, would have looked like a very big deal — more than a third bigger in ticket sales than Disney’s dog-movie-of-the-century “Beverly Hills Chihuahua,” actually — if that sloppy old hound had slobbered on Tom Hanks in 2008.'"
"'08-12-28,'0','The Long-Term Capital episode looks small when viewed against all of that. But it was important precisely because the fund was not a major firm. At the time of its near demise, it was not even a major money center bank, but a hedge fund with about 200 employees. Such funds hadn’t previously been brought under regulatory protection this way. After the episode, financial markets knew that even relatively obscure institutions — through government intervention — might be able to pay back bad loans.The major creditors of the fund included Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, all of which went on to lend and invest recklessly and, to one degree or another, pay the consequences. But 1998 should have been the time to send a credible warning that bad loans to overleveraged institutions would mean losses, and that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would make these losses good.What would have happened without a Fed-organized bailout of Long-Term Capital? It remains an open question. An entirely private consortium led by Warren E. Buffett might have bought the fund, but capital markets might still have frozen because of the realization that bailouts were not guaranteed.And Fed inaction might have had graver economic consequences, especially if a Buffett deal had fallen through. In that case, a rapid financial deleveraging would have followed, and the economy would have probably plunged into recession. That sounds bad, but it might have been better to have experienced a milder version of a downturn in 1998 than the more severe version of 10 years later.In 1998, there was no collapsed housing bubble, the government’s budget was in surplus rather than deficit, bank leverage was much lower, and derivatives markets were smaller and less far-reaching. A financial crisis related to Long-Term Capital, however painful, probably would have been easier to handle than the perfect storm of recent months.The ad hoc aspect of the bailout created a precedent for what has come to be called “regulation by deal” — now the government’s modus operandi. Rather than publicizing definite standards and expectations for bailouts in advance, the Fed and the Treasury confront each particular crisis anew. Decisions are made as to whether a merger is possible, whether a consortium can be organized, what kind of loan guarantees can be offered and what kind of concessions will be extracted in return. So far, every deal — or lack thereof, in the case of Lehman Brothers — has been different.While there are some advantages to leaving discretion in regulators’ hands, this hasn’t worked out very well. It has become increasingly apparent that the market doesn’t know what to expect and that many financial institutions are sitting on the sidelines, waiting to see what regulators will do next. Regulatory uncertainty is stifling the ability of financial markets to engineer at least a partial recovery.John Maynard Keynes famously proclaimed that “in the long run we are all dead.” From the vantage point of 1998, today is indeed the “long run.”We’re not quite dead, but we are seriously ailing. As we look ahead, we may be tempted again to put off the hard choices. But perhaps the next “long run,” too, is no more than 10 years away. If we take the Keynesian maxim too seriously, and focus only on the short run, our prospects will be grim indeed.'"

"'08-12-28,'0','Before Pounce arrived last April in their Upper West Side no-dogs-allowed co-op, the family had owned beta fish and gerbils.“The big problem with any of those is cleaning the cages and tanks, and when there’s no payoff, it’s kind of a drag,” said Ms. Edwards, 44, a health care policy consultant whose allergy to cats ruled out a feline solution to the family’s desire for a more interactive pet.“I had no interest in living with birds because they’re not my style — they’re in my airspace,” Ms. Edwards said. “It was hard to figure out a pet that would be acceptable to me and cuddly enough for the kids. I thought maybe turtles or some sort of reptiles — they’re not cuddly, but they don’t jump out of your hands.”A rabbit didn’t enter their thoughts until the day Dylan happened upon a floppy-eared Holland lop at a pet store. As he wandered around the shop cradling the 12-week-old bunny, Ms. Edwards recalled, “people started telling us how trainable rabbits are — how they can be litter-box-trained and you can let them out of their cages.”They took the rabbit home and within a month (during which Pounce litter-box-trained himself) they gave him virtually free rein over their two-bedroom apartment. (Pounce’s occasional misfires take the form of odorless hard pellets about the size of an M&M.)“He’s a lot more petlike than I expected,” Ms. Edwards said. “Rabbits like company, and they’re smart.”Pounce typically spends his days with Ms. Edwards in her dining-room-cum-home-office. The plump six-pound rabbit nibbles on timothy hay and the edges of low-lying folders.When the boys are home, the rabbit may decide he needs some quiet time under the sofa. Or he may lounge attentively between Dylan and Liam while they play video games. Later at night, he snuggles up against the adults on the sofa for television.To be sure, Pounce has his naughty side. Rabbits are notorious chewers, and Pounce is no exception. He has gnawed through electrical cords and the corners of doors and drawers (now sealed with clear packing tape to prevent further incursions). Pounce has also denuded more than one potted herb plant left on a seductively low-hanging shelf.He also sheds enough to warrant Ms. Edwards’s use of the vacuum cleaner once or twice between her housekeeper’s biweekly visits, and the special recycled paper lining his litter box needs to be changed twice a week to prevent odor.On the other hand, unlike the dog the family had initially wished for — and now could have, thanks to a recent change in building pet policy — Pounce doesn’t bark, need grooming or demand to be taken for walks.Mr. Gaherty, 45, a geophysicist, wasn’t consulted on the decision to adopt Pounce. But he sounded affectionate toward the rabbit in a nonpublic, indeterminate-pronoun kind of way.“I’m a dog person, and you can’t say it’s like a dog,” Mr. Gaherty said. “You can use food to make it responsive. Rabbit food smells better than cat food, litter boxes smell bad either way, and rabbits chew but cats scratch, which is probably worse.”Like the Edwards-Gaherty family, would-be dog owners usually list interactivity high on their list of desired pet qualities, which is why many choose birds as a substitute.“Birds are extremely intelligent,” said Linda Pesek, a veterinarian at the Center for Avian and Exotic Medicine on the Upper West Side. “They can recognize their owners, and they can interact.”Tonia Misvaer couldn’t agree more. She and her husband wanted a dog, a pet prohibited by the lease on their rented apartment on the Upper West Side. They bought their first avian, a small parrot known as a lovebird, on impulse four and a half years ago.“Yogi had a lot of personality,” said Ms. Misvaer, 33, a graphic designer. The couple trained the bird to go to the bathroom in its cage and gave it unfettered access to their 900-square-foot duplex.“We were surprised that they make really interesting pets,” Ms. Misvaer said. “He had a chest of toys he played with on the floor, and he particularly liked to push things off bookshelves. We both liked him a lot, although he didn’t like my husband. He would poop in his shoes every once in awhile and drop things on his head.”After Yogi died from a melamine-poisoned treat a year and a half ago, the couple bought two more birds.“We wanted a little bit better of a parrot — one that could maybe talk and live longer,” she said. They settled on Swami, a Meyer’s parrot, and Odin, a Jardine’s parrot.“They’re both quiet birds and fairly small,” Ms. Misvaer said. “A lot of times when people think of parrots they think of huge macaw parrots. But Swami is six inches and Odin is seven or eight inches tall. They don’t squawk or scream, so they’re good apartment birds.”So far, the birds have learned a few words and can dog-whistle. (Swami can also wolf-whistle, which Ms. Misvaer discovered while riding with him on a crowded subway.)The facet of avian husbandry that has surprised Ms. Misvaer most is how time-consuming it is.“A dog will hang out and sit on your lap or take a nap,” she said, “but birds are constantly active. I mean, they’ll sleep a lot, but they demand a lot of attention. Odin has terrible separation anxiety. When I’m in the apartment he will run across the floor and look up at me until I pick him up and put him on my shoulder. Also, if you want a healthy parrot you really need to cook. We spend maybe 30 to 60 minutes a day preparing food —cutting up fresh fruit and vegetables and baking bird bread.”It’s common for neophyte owners to assume that birds are low-maintenance creatures, said Stephen L. Zawistowski, an animal behaviorist and the executive vice president and science adviser for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.“They’re not a great pet if you’re out of the apartment all day,” Mr. Zawistowski said. “They need company more so than a cat. If you don’t interact with birds, they can develop behavior problems, and as a form of anxiety they will actually pick out their feathers.”Mr. Zawistowski says many bird owners are also stunned by how loud birds can be. For apartment dwellers, he recommends finches, especially the hardier zebra and society varieties: “They tweet a lot, but they’re not superloud. They’re interesting and active. You don’t need a massive cage. And you can keep several of them, so you don’t have to worry about social questions.”Parakeets are louder, more active and comical, he said, while “canaries have been an immensely popular bird in the city of New York since the mid-1800s.”“But with apartments you have to be very careful of cleaning products and pesticides, and the Teflon frying pans release fumes on the stove that are toxic to birds,” he said, “so you have to keep them away from the kitchen and the cleaning products.”There is also the matter of keeping pets away from the neighbors: Tales abound of escaped hamsters, among other things, that wind up in someone else’s apartment.This is of special import in a no-pet building, as most buildings with restrictions on pets prohibit any sort of animal — not just cats or dogs — without the permission of the board, said Lisa Breier Urban, a real estate lawyer with Breier Deutschmeister Urban & Fromme in Manhattan.“That’s not to say people don’t go to the pet store and buy whatever they want,” she said. “It’s much easier to harbor a pet in the building if it’s not a dog. Unless the animal is a nuisance, the buildings in general are not going to enforce the rules.”Typically, the nuisance consists of a foul odor coming from an apartment with cats, but not always.“We had a case where someone had two or three rabbits and they were not keeping the cages clean,” Ms. Urban said. “The neighbors complained about the smell, and the building required that the people get rid of the rabbits. And we had a case a couple of years ago where a rent-stabilized tenant had a lizard that ate crickets. The crickets were shipped in by mail, but somehow they got out all over the building and they had a huge cricket problem.”Beyond the special challenges presented by their sometimes hopping diets, reptiles frequently require high temperatures and humidity levels to thrive.Some owners, however, appreciate reptilian reserve.Evan Cohen has lived with a five-foot-long iguana, Roxy, for the past 11 years in a studio apartment in Greenwich Village. The iguana is house-trained (each morning it relieves itself in a paper-towel-lined bathtub, which Mr. Cohen scrubs down with bleach afterward) and wanders freely through the 525-square-foot dwelling.“I think that to him, this is his apartment, and he’s letting me live here,” said Mr. Cohen, 36, a former jack-of-all-trades who is now an undergraduate student at Columbia University. “I think he’d prefer it if I wasn’t living here. I admit he’s not a snuggly type of animal, but that never really bothered me — you can still pick up a 13-pound-lizard and hold him and pet him as much as he’ll tolerate.”Alice and Morgan Dontanville were barred by their lease from getting a dog, but wanted something that was cuddly as well as quiet, clean and relatively low maintenance. Back in high school Mr. Dontanville had owned an intelligent and extroverted rat; this led them to consider something in the rodent family. They eventually settled on a chinchilla.“Chinchillas have the advantages of the other rodents — they’re friendly and they respond to you — without the weird tail,” Ms. Dontanville said. “He looks like a cross between a small bunny and a giant mouse with a squirrel-esque tail. He has tiny little feet and legs and a big, pudgy, unbelievably silky body.”The Dontanvilles bought their first chinchilla several months ago at a pet store. After a couple of weeks, it fell ill with an intestinal blockage and, $2,000 in vet bills later, had to be euthanized. After learning more about the proper care and feeding of chinchillas (don’t give them pet-store food, recommended Ms. Dontanville, or keep the temperature over 75 degrees), they bought their current chinchilla, a six-month-old male named Ajax, from a breeder in Brooklyn.Ajax lives on Ms. Dontanville’s former craft table a few feet from the kitchen, inside a 32-inch-high black-wire cage made for rats. He is conveniently nocturnal, springing to life around 9 p.m. after the couple come home from work to their garden apartment in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Several evenings a week they take Ajax out of his cage for a romp in the chinchilla-proof second bedroom. (Chinchillas will chew practically anything, including much that is harmful to them.)“At first he was hiding a lot, but now he’s sitting on my lap a lot,” said Ms. Dontanville, adding that she and her husband had become surprisingly obsessed by Ajax. “He’s very affectionate and responsive but doesn’t really like to be held yet — you interact more than cuddle with him.”Grooming consists of an excited wriggle in a metal container about the size of a shoebox, filled with a specially purchased ash-like dust. And while chinchillas can’t be completely house-trained, their arborio-rice-size droppings are easy to sweep up.Much like dogs, Ms. Dontanville said, chinchillas care about and respond to attention from their owners. “You feel like you really matter, and he loves your attention the same way a dog really loves human attention,” she said. “It’s the appeal of a puppy without the daily walks and the pooper scooper.”'"
"'08-12-28,'0','The French chateau that provides the familial epicenter of Julia Leigh’s “Disquiet” is a daunting, high-ceilinged edifice, riddled with hidden passageways and disgruntled deer heads, surrounded by grandiose gardens. It’s the stuff of a Gothic novelist’s dreams — or would be if it weren’t for the noisy props of modern technology that disrupt the “Masterpiece Theater”-like air of repose.There’s little in the way of romantic dithering to be found among Leigh’s upstairs/downstairs assemblage, one should add, except for a stolen moment of sex that’s mediated entirely by cellphone. Nor are there any ghosts rattling about the hallways, unless you count the spectral light emanating from a television screen or the peripatetic corpse of a baby in want of a resting place. Don’t open the freezer door,s’il vous plaît.The spoils of 21st-century wealth commingle uneasily with the trophies of fortunes gone by in this exquisitely chiseled exercise in creepy minimalism. The second work of fiction from this chameleon-like Australian writer, it represents an arresting volte-face from her first novel, “The Hunter,” a ­testosterone-heavy portrait of a university zoologist who gets in touch with his inner beast.Here the primal male impulses that propelled Leigh’s first protagonist give way to the invincible (albeit late-blooming) maternal instincts of a battered mother of two who returns to the family manse that she abandoned 12 years earlier, intent on marrying despite the protests of her mother. The humbled-but-wiser Olivia arrives with her broken arm in a sling and her children in tow: Andy, a secretive 9-year-old, and his saucy kid sister, Lucy, who, at 6, is at that stage where nothing is more gratifying than declaiming the names of private body parts in public.Yet the drama of the prodigal daughter’s return is soon upstaged by the tragedy of a second homecoming, as Olivia’s brother returns from a local hospital with his wife and the lifeless body of their baby (a k a “the bundle”), strangled at birth by an inconveniently positioned umbilical cord. Marcus announces to his horrified mother that he and Sophie want to keep baby Alice at home for a day or two. “We’d like to get to know her before the funeral,” he explains.'"

"'08-12-28,'0','AS captivating as the temples of Angkor may be, Cambodia’s scorching sun, gritty air and pot-holed roads inevitably take their toll on even the hardiest travelers. Perhaps it’s by necessity, then, that Siem Reap, the town that lodges and feeds Angkor’s million annual visitors, has evolved into a chic haven of rest and relaxation. An international group of chefs has set up the country’s finest tables there, and bartenders in the vibrant night life are versed in sophisticated cocktails. Contemporary art has also found itself a home, with a gallery scene intent on nurturing local artists. It’s as though Siem Reap is finally picking up where the Angkorian kings left off some 600 years ago, resurrecting itself as the center of Khmer taste and culture.With Angkor Wat’s inspiring beauty just five miles away, it’s not hard to see why Siem Reap is at the heart of Cambodia’s flourishing art scene. Galleries are popping up in renovated shop houses, and hotels now exhibit the work of young Khmers and regional expats. Art Venues, a free brochure available in upmarket hotels, maps out walking tours to the town’s best spots. McDermott Gallery (FCC Complex, Pokambor Avenue; 855-12-274-274; www.mcdermottgallery.com), known for its emotive, dreamlike photographs of Angkor, takes Asia’s cultural heritage as its curatorial focus. At the Arts Lounge inside the fashionable Hôtel de la Paix (Sivatha Boulevard; 855-63-966-000; www.hoteldelapaixangkor.com), contemporary works fill the minimalist space, where well-heeled guests sip designer cocktails like the Oolong Kiwi Sling, made with tea and vodka.Cambodian cooking doesn’t get the attention it deserves, especially compared with the fare of its food-trendy neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam. Though the basic ingredients are similar — lemongrass, garlic, ginger, fish sauce — Khmer cooking is subtler and lighter, employing less chili, pungent herbs and coconut milk. For an innovative lesson on local flavors, sample the seven-course Khmer tasting menu ($31) at Méric, a dimly lighted Art Deco-themed restaurant, also at the Hótel de la Paix (note: dollars are widely accepted in Siem Reap). Dishes, which change daily, might include chicken and pumpkin saraman (a type of Khmer curry) and stir-fried frog’s legs with holy basil served in hollowed-out bamboo reeds and miniature woks. To heighten the experience, dine on one of Méric’s hanging cushioned daybeds, which swing alongside a flame-lighted pool.Prolong the post-dinner buzz with a pre-slumber rubdown at Frangipani Spa (617/615 Hup Guan Street; 855-12-982-062; www.frangipanisiemreap.com). With modern art on the walls and fresh orchids in vases, the spa feels like the plush digs of a fashionable friend’s home. Sink into the low sofa as you sip tamarind juice while your feet are bathed in a frangipani-filled tub, the prep to a glorious 60-minute massage (from $22).It might be brutal, but it’s worth getting up this early to experience the famous Buddhist temples of Angkor Archaeological Park (admission, $20), the 155-square-mile area that counts Angkor Wat among its more than 100 temples. Less crowded at this hour is the ninth-century Phnom Bakheng, a five-tiered, rectangular temple built on a hill. The few lotus-shaped towers that remain are testament to the 108 that once stood. You’ll have to work for the view: it’s a 15-minute hike up to the sandstone terrace, which overlooks an endless expanse of jungle and mist-shrouded hills. It’s a mesmerizing spot from which to watch the sun paint the sky in blues and oranges.'"

"'08-12-28,'0','IN a year in which the price of food skyrocketed, those restaurants that managed to dish out meals that were tasty and easy on the wallet took on a special luster.Two places in New Haven stand out: Lalibela, for Ethiopian food, and Thali Too, for Indian.At Lalibela, Shilmat Tessema, chef and owner, serves her homespun cuisine in an easygoing, college-town ambience. Appetizers like the raw green peppers stuffed with tomato and the timatim fitfit, a salad of tomatoes and injera, an Ethiopian flatbread, are notable for their quiet, fresh simplicity; currylike entree stews are short on price and long on flavor.Prasad Chirnomula’s second New Haven restaurant, Thali Too, is smart and youthful, the food bright tasting and stylish in presentation. Dinner entrees are just $10 (it helps that the menu is entirely vegetarian). The menu spans India’s diverse regional cuisines, and even seasoned Indian food lovers are likely to find something new here; try the panki, a spicy rice batter spread between two banana leaves and steamed, eaten after a quick dunk in sambhar, a spicy vegetable stew.Two other New Haven restaurants, Caseus and 116 Crown, offer good, mid-priced food in distinctive, urban-chic settings.Caseus (a cheese-making term pronounced KAY-see-us) marries a cheese shop, selling artisan cheeses and specialty foods, with a bistro. The cozy European ambience makes it a good spot for a tête-à-tête, whether you are seated at one of the small tables or brushing elbows with the hipsters at the bar. The macaroni and cheese is excellent, and reasonably priced.The cuisine at 116 Crown is also good bistro fare, served tapas style on small plates. But John and Danielle Ginnetti’s place is more lounge than restaurant — the cocktail menu is substantially longer than the food menu. With a very successful combination of food, style and a full-time D.J., 116 Crown is unique to the New Haven late-night scene.'"

"'08-12-29,'0','But researchers said the company’s own documents revealed a complex strategy that used several approaches to make sure smoking-related health issues were put on the back burner of China’s public health agenda.“Everyone and their mother wants a piece of the Chinese market,” said Monique E. Muggli, the first author of the paper and a nicotine researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. “What was unique about China was BAT’s efforts to train the local industry in China on their playbook, causing controversy and doubt around second-hand smoke where none really existed, and targeting the local tobacco industry, which is government owned.”As recently as 2006, despite two decades of research into the harms of second-hand smoke, China’s State Tobacco Monopoly Association was issuing statements that more research was needed to determine the effects of smoke exposure, she noted.One of British American Tobacco’s initiatives was to fund the Beijing Liver Foundation, which operated under the auspices of an established charitable organization that BAT considered had an “anti”-smoking agenda. BAT used the liver foundation “to reprioritize the agenda of the Ministry of Public Health” and to “divert the public attention from smoking and health issues to liver diseases,” according to company documents. The foundation was also used as a platform to promote BAT’s message that liver disease, rampant in China, “is the number one killer” there.In 2000 and 2001, BAT used the liver foundation’s Web site to disseminate the message that second-hand smoke is not harmful, the documents indicate. The foundation funded research on second-hand smoke that dismissed the risks of environmental smoke exposure and convened expert panels to report the findings to the media.Awareness of the risks of smoking to nonsmokers is particularly low in China, with only about one-third of Chinese citizens aware of the health risks of second-hand smoke, according to Chinese Ministry of Health estimates.Even though the consensus among most public health experts is that there is no safe level of second-hand smoke exposure, Ms. Muggli said, BAT promoted the use of air filtration and ventilation systems in restaurants, hotels and other public spaces as a “route to avoid smoking bans,” the paper said.. The company also pushed for “resocialisation” of smoking, industry code for accommodating smoking and avoiding public smoking bans, according to the report.Although many cities in China have public smoking bans on the books, the restrictions are not usually enforced, the paper said.In other presentations to the media, BAT sought to “present the message that tobacco smoke is just one of the sources of air pollution and a very insignificant one compared with other pollutants,” the paper said, quoting from company documents.The company held “smoking and health seminars” for representatives of China’s state tobacco monopoly, in which it trained them how to convey the message that there is insufficient data to prove that second-hand smoke is harmful to children or other adults, and hence no need for government regulations.The Chinese cigarette market is dominated by the state tobacco monopoly, but foreign cigarette companies will have more access to China’s 350 million smokers when the country eliminates tariffs on foreign cigarettes and opens up the market in accordance with international trade agreements, according to Teh-wei Hu, a professor at the school of public health at the University of California, Berkeley and an expert on China’s tobacco policy.About 540 million Chinese are exposed to second-hand smoke each year, resulting in more than 100,000 deaths, experts say.'"

"'08-12-29,'0','One of my New Year’s resolutions is to use up all of the bags and half-filled bags of dried beans in my pantry before they get too old. Dried beans won’t spoil with age, but once they are more than a year old, they take longer to cook. And sometimes old beans never seem to soften up no matter how long you cook them.Beans are an economical, delicious and comforting way to feed your family well. They are an excellent source of protein, low in fat and exceptionally high in fiber. They are also a good source of calcium, iron, folic acid and potassium. Perhaps it is because beans are so economical that the custom of eating them on New Year’s Day for prosperity exists in so many cultures. Here we eat black-eyed peas (Italians and southern French eat chickpeas; Japanese eat red beans). Try this warm black-eyed peas salad on the first of the year.

"'08-12-29,'0','E-mail? The same men (and like the tech guys, they’re mostly men) who were managing millions upon millions of other people’s dollars can’t be relied upon to set up their own e-mail accounts?“A lot of these guys are used to working in investment houses where they have chefs coming and making them omelets in the morning and baking them cookies in the afternoon, and all that,” Mr. Madigan said. Maybe they could, or maybe they couldn’t, figure out how to set up a secure, backed-up account that syncs with their BlackBerry and has a professional-sounding name. Either way, he said, they’re used to a certain level of service.Mr. Madigan also found that many of his new home-office clients don’t want any old Gmail account. They want an e-mail account that looks and works and feels just like the one they had in their office, a level of familiarity that’s not just efficient but comforting. And that’s true for their other computer systems as well, right down to which corner of the screen they’ll see their instant messenger icon pop up. “We’re selling them that ‘big bank’ feel,” said Mr. Madigan, who also helps set up his clients with computers with the power to handle market data feeds and high-volume printers. “Oftentimes they’re trying to look like a bigger operation, with a more professional approach,” Mr. Madigan said.For the most part, said Mr. Madigan and Adam Cabezas, a client services engineer with Chelsea Technologies, the newly unemployed hedge funders they’ve met haven’t seemed demoralized by the turn of events. “The typical person I’m seeing is somebody who’s been a go-getter his whole life,” said Mr. Cabezas, who has been spending time with the clients at their homes, helping them arrange their new lives. “They’re definitely in reaction mode — they want a fast turnaround. That’s the way they’ve been trained, and that’s the way they’ve lived their whole lives. They’re very optimistic.”If anything, said Mr. Madigan, he urges his employees to bring an even higher level of professionalism into the homes of their clients, all in the name of maintaining that investment bank feel in an alternative setting. He requires his workers to take their shoes off before entering clients’ homes (God knows how much their carpets cost), and to avoid using their bathrooms, waiting instead for a lunch break outside the home. The systems Mr. Madigan sets up may ultimately boil down to a series of brilliantly arranged zeros and ones, but he understands that part of his business — part of so many businesses — is creating an illusion, in this case, a new one that replicates, as closely as possible, the old one. Many of his new clients will probably spend some of their solitary lunch breaks pondering just how much illusion is good for business, and at what point it teeters into dangerous folly.When setting up home offices, Mr. Madigan’s colleagues enter into people’s private domains and sit with them for hours, talking through the various systems, explaining how they work and how to respond when something fails. His code of professionalism requires that the tech specialists try to avoid personal conversations, but every once in a while, after all those hours of working in tandem, they can’t avoid it. Mr. Cabezas was getting ready to leave one former banker’s apartment after setting up the last system for a home office when the client confessed that he was really going to miss having co-workers, that collegiality, that sense of community. Mr. Cabezas assured him that with instant messaging and e-mail and video conferencing, he’d surely feel in touch — in technology, the promise of comfort.'"
"'08-12-29,'0','Some energy auditors can be like auto mechanics: They both have incentives to find problems so that they can get paid to fix them. Leaky windows? No problem, we can weatherize them. Ancient air-conditioners? We can sell you the latest Energy Star models.By contrast, L & S Energy Services, a 19-employee firm in Clifton Park, N.Y., 15 miles north of Albany, provides only advice, no strings attached. Since 2003, the company has conducted about 1,200 audits for small businesses under a program run by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. It has also provided energy consulting to some 30 apartment buildings comprising 3,500 units, as well as universities, hospitals and office buildings.In total, about $1 million, or 60 percent, of its annual revenue comes from the authority, known as Nyserda, which collects it from utility customers throughout the state in the form of the little-noticed System Benefits Charge on each month’s bill.“We try not to farm out a recommendation because of the conflict of interest,” said Ronald Slosberg, the company’s vice president. “We point them to Nyserda, where there are additional loan programs.”L & S is one of four companies statewide that have auditing contracts with Nyserda to provide these soft-sell services to car dealers, churches, machine shops, pizzerias, restaurants, shoe stores and a host of other operations that have less than $75,000 in annual electric costs. Over the past two years, L & S has done about 700 of these audits across the upstate region. Audits cost up to $400, but the businesses can get a refund from Nyserda if they buy the energy-efficient equipment that L & S suggests, from outside electricians, plumbers and others.'"
"'08-12-29,'0','David B. Iannarone, a former R.T.C. lawyer who is managing partner at a firm that handles defaulted commercial real estate loans, said, “The people who worked on this back in the early 1990s are back in vogue.”The agency was set up by the government in 1989 to sell off what ultimately grew to $450 billion worth of real estate and other assets assembled from 747 collapsed savings banks.What is obvious to former R.T.C. officials is that, like the last go around, a great deal of money will be made by a select group of investors and business operators, particularly those with government contacts. The former government officials said in interviews that much of what is motivating them is a desire to help the nation recover from this latest stumble. But they acknowledge they intend to be among the winners who emerge.“Fortunes will be made here, no doubt about it,” said Gary J. Silversmith, one of more than a dozen former R.T.C. officials interviewed who now are involved in enterprises seeking to profit from bank bailouts.The busiest money-making arena so far for these R.T.C. alumni is in helping distressed banks line up cash infusions from the Treasury, as they seek a piece of the bailout.Robert L. Clarke, controller of the currency under the first President Bush and a former Resolution Trust board member, has been advising banks throughout the South on how to get their share of the bailout money.“I have been absolutely inundated,” said Mr. Clarke, who now works at Bracewell & Giuliani, the law firm based in Houston affiliated with the former New York mayor and presidential candidate Rudolph W. Giuliani.Mr. Clarke’s labor on behalf of his clients has included calling federal regulators to urge them to reconsider plans to reject applications for federal bailout money. He would not identify the banks, saying it might undermine public confidence in them.But Mr. Clarke said his intervention, in at least some cases, has been successful.Eugene Ludwig, the comptroller of the currency under President Bill Clinton during the final stages of the savings-and-loan cleanup, runs Promontory Financial Group, a banking consultant group whose clients include struggling banks.“I must get an e-mail a day from people who I worked with back then about what to do about the current mess,” Mr. Ludwig said. “It is not so much capitalizing on it as really just, how do we contain the flames?”Many of the former federal officials like Mr. Ludwig have stayed in the field, working as lawyers or contractors who buy up and resell seized bank properties. What is remarkable now is just how busy they are.“It is a great time to be a banking lawyer,” said Thomas P. Vartanian, a partner in the Washington office of Fried Frank, who is the former general counsel to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which led a bank bailout effort in the 1980s.The planned sale by the F.D.I.C of the assets of IndyMac, the failed bank, has turned into an alumni event of sorts for veterans of the R.T.C. era, including John J. Oros, who was chairman of a financial industry council that advised bank regulators during the savings and loan crisis. Now he is a partner in J. C. Flowers, one of the private equity firms negotiating to buy part of IndyMac.In the space of one weekend in September he explored buying out the troubled insurer A.I.G. and worked with Bank of America on an aborted acquisition of Lehman Brothers. Then he advised Bank of America on its last-minute switch to buy Merrill Lynch before Lehman’s collapse hammered Wall Street.Although the financial meltdown is a disaster for the country, Mr. Oros said, “the opportunity going forward is unprecedented. It is fantastic. It is as if I had been training for this for the last 40 years of my career.”The biggest profits will most likely be made, the former federal bank officials agreed, by those who figure out a way to benefit from what could turn into one of the greatest fire sales of bad debt and bank assets in American history.Through September of this year, 25 banks had failed, compared with three in 2007. An additional 171 are on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s list of troubled banks, more than double the watch list at the end of last year.As a result of these failures, and other related industry troubles, billions of dollars’ worth of real estate or at least mortgage-backed securities and other “illiquid” financial instruments will most likely need to be sold off at discounted prices to investors who stand to profit if they can sell the assets at a higher price once the economy recovers.The question right now is just how this unloading of bad debt will take place.So far, the federal government is relying on financial institutions to find a way on their own to sell off bad debts or assets they end up with as a result of foreclosures. But some financial industry players are arguing that a modern-day R.T.C. should be established, to help set prices for this bad debt, and speed the move toward a recovery.The R.T.C. alumni are prepared to profit through either route.Mr. Seidman, for example, has been hired as an adviser to SecondMarket, a company based in New York that early next year will start a virtual marketplace that intends to resell some of the trillions of dollars worth of distressed mortgage-backed securities, the financial instruments that helped fuel the surge in housing prices.Mr. Seidman has already set up meetings between company executives and federal regulators, including at the F.D.I.C., said Barry E. Silbert, the company’s founder.Mr. Silversmith, meanwhile, who during the savings and loan crisis helped arrange the sale of thrift assets, has teamed with Barry Fromm, the chief executive of Value Recovery Holding, one of the big government contractors who handled these sales. The two in recent weeks have held meetings with some of Mr. Silverstein’s former colleagues, including James Wigand, the deputy director in charge of the F.D.I.C. division that sells seized assets, to work on a plan to get ahold of some of the new wave of properties the federal government intends to put on the market as a result of recent bank failures.Many of the investors who built legendary fortunes during the savings and loan crisis — like Sam Zell, the chief executive of the Tribune Company, and Joseph E. Robert Jr., the chief executive of J. E. Robert Companies — are also looking for ways to get back into or expand their distressed assets trade.Mr. Zell, who has fared less well in his Tribune investment, recalled the instinct for capitalizing on the misfortune of others that earned him the sobriquet “the grave dancer” when he started buying up properties from failed savings and loans.“When I started the first opportunity fund in 1988, I was the only one bidding — if they didn’t sell to me, they didn’t sell to anyone,” Mr. Zell recalled.Now, he said, “The best opportunity right now is in the debt area, mortgages. We have been buying all along.”R.T.C. experience is certainly no guarantee of success, the agency veterans acknowledge.Peter Monroe, who was president of the R.T.C. oversight board from 1990 to 1993, has already bought about 300 distressed properties in Detroit, through a venture capital company he formed called Wilherst Oxford. Figuring out a way to profit from the investment — even though some of the houses cost him only a few hundred dollars — has proven to be a challenge.“It is like a high-hurdle race: you can get going fast, but you have to jump over one hurdle after the other,” Mr. Monroe said. “It has turned out to be more complicated than even I expected.”'"
"'08-12-29,'0','BANGALORE, India (Reuters) — The outsourcing company Satyam Computer Services postponed its board meeting until Jan. 10 to give itself time to consider a series of options to shore up investor confidence.Shares of Satyam, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, have plummeted by about 40 percent since a botched effort two weeks ago to buy two infrastructure companies.The board was expected to meet on Monday to consider a share buyback, but news last week that the company had been barred from doing business with the World Bank added to its woes.Satyam, based in Hyderabad, India, said in a statement issued late on Saturday night its board would consider measures to strengthen the company’s governance structure, including increasing the size of the board and altering its composition.“In order to ensure that these questions are properly addressed, and that the interests of stakeholders are fully and carefully considered, Satyam has decided to broaden the scope of its deliberations beyond a possible buyback of its stock,” its chairman, B. Ramalinga Raju, said in the statement.It had also hired DSP Merrill Lynch to review the company’s strategic options.'"
"'08-12-29,'0','Although they are digital, most of the high-definition televisions sold so far do not have Internet connections. But Mr. Hooper argues that televisions soon will also be connected to home networks and the Internet.“We are all making this investment in high-definition television, but all we are doing with them is watching TV the same way,” Mr. Hooper said. “They can actually provide all sorts of experiences, whether it is viewing family photos or connecting to the Internet to watch video.”Cisco can draw on much of its existing business line to help build its home electronics products. It is the leading maker of routers and switches, the devices that act as the traffic lights of the Internet in connecting one computer to another. In 2005, it bought Scientific Atlanta, one of the leading makers of equipment for cable TV systems. And Linksys, which it bought in 2003, is the top seller of devices used to set up wireless and wired networks in homes and small businesses.Sales directly to consumers represented only 2 percent of Cisco’s $40 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year. But the company is counting on home entertainment, along with Scientific Atlanta and some other new initiatives the company calls “advanced technology,” to provide much of its growth.Despite Cisco’s dominance of the corporate market and its $27 billion in cash, it faces a number of challenges as it tries to find a place in the home. The Cisco brand is not associated with consumer electronics. The company runs fast-paced commercials with the slogan, “Welcome to the human network,” but it is not particularly clear what Cisco is offering to consumers.“I don’t think that when they hear the name Cisco they think of great products in consumer electronics,” said John MacFarlane, the chief executive of Sonos, which already makes systems that send music around the house wirelessly.With the exception of Apple, other computer companies have not had much success in consumer electronics. Dell and Gateway have been in and out of the television and music player business. Hewlett-Packard is still trying to sell computers, servers and set-top boxes designed to move video around the home, but it, too, has dropped out of the television business. Intel, the computer chip maker, abandoned its Viiv brand of processors for media center computers after consumers gave the cold shoulder to the devices, which had been promoted as the key to moving content around their houses.Mr. Hooper says Cisco has no interest in selling televisions. It will continue to make set-top boxes that bring in programs from cable and the Internet, but it assumes that eventually all televisions will simply connect directly to home networks.Consumers, however, have not been all that interested in set-top boxes, despite many offerings from companies including TiVo, Vudu and Roku. The most successful has been the Apple TV, which can be used to watch downloaded movies and television programs, but it is still what Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, called a “hobby” rather than a business like the iPod or the iPhone.It is not so clear to consumers why they would need to get online video on their TVs when they have hundreds of channels and increasingly thousands of video-on-demand choices from their cable systems. “Consumers are reluctant to pay for another service and find a home for another box in their living rooms to duplicate much of the content they already get from cable,” said Ross Rubin, a consumer electronics analyst with the NPD Group.While Cisco is building out its line of consumer electronics products to sell directly to consumers, it has other ways to profit from the growth of home networks. Its Scientific Atlanta unit sells set-top boxes through pay-TV companies, such as a video recorder offered as part of AT&T’s Uverse television service. It is splitting ad revenue with the media companies for which it runs Web sites. And it wants to develop technology with which Internet providers and media companies can sell new Internet-based services for a monthly fee. One example would let people store music and video on the Internet, rather than on discs or their own hard drives, so they could get access to it anywhere.“Today your content is very tightly tied to a device,” Mr. Hooper said. “Your music is tied to your iPod. Your games are tied to your PlayStation.” Cisco is pressing media companies to change their business models to sell more flexible digital rights to their content. “If I forgot to sync my iPod before I left home, I can connect in my hotel room,” said Mr. Hooper.Ultimately, Mr. Hooper said, the company expects to make the most money by offering home video conferencing. Today, Cisco is making a major effort to sell Telepresence rooms to corporations for $40,000 to $300,000 each. These have big high definition TV and a fancy audio system on each end, connected by a high-speed Internet connection, meant to simulate face-to-face meetings.Cisco envisions bringing a cheaper version to consumers in the next year or two. Consumers would place a small camera next to a television to chat with friends and relatives from their family room couches. Cisco is trying to develop standards that would make placing a video call as easy as dialing a phone number and that would allow the recipients to see notices of incoming calls on their televisions.Mr. Hooper said this technology would be so much better than the current Webcam-on-a-PC video chat systems that users would be willing to pay their cable companies a monthly fee for it. “Once you can go to full HD quality, with simple setup and high-quality experience, it tips the balance,” Mr. Hooper said.For Cisco, however, the biggest profit still may not be in the gadgets, but in the plumbing. Video is by far the biggest user of bandwidth and as more people use the Web to watch programs, networks will be forced to buy more routers, switches and equipment.'"
"'08-12-29,'0','Mark Heller, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that that energy reflected the deep feeling among average Israelis that the country had to regain its deterrent capacity.“There has been a nagging sense of uncertainty in the last couple years of whether anyone is really afraid of Israel anymore,” he said. “The concern is that in the past — perhaps a mythical past — people didn’t mess with Israel because they were afraid of the consequences. Now the region is filled with provocative rhetoric about Israel the paper tiger. This operation is an attempt to re-establish the perception that if you provoke or attack you are going to pay a disproportionate price.”Numerous commentators on Sunday, both in Israel and in the Arab world, noted that the shadow of the 2006 Lebanon war was hanging over the attack on Gaza. Then, Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Islamist group, was lobbing deadly rockets into Israel with apparent impunity and had captured two Israeli soldiers in a crossborder raid.Israel invaded southern Lebanon and for 34 days carried out air, sea and land assaults before a truce was negotiated. But Hezbollah, by successfully shooting thousands of rockets into Israel while under attack and sounding defiant to the end, won a great deal of credit among Arabs across the region and used its prestige to grab a decisive role in the Lebanese government.The risk to Israel in Gaza seems of a parallel nature — that if the operation fails or leaves Hamas in the position of scrappy survivor or even somehow perceived victor, it could then dominate Palestinian politics over the more conciliatory and pro-Western movement for years to come. Since Hamas, like Hezbollah, is committed to Israel’s destruction, that could pose a formidable strategic challenge.And despite unwavering expressions of support for Israel from President-elect during his campaign, Israel is also that its aggressive military posture will not alienate the new administration.There are internal complications as well. At Sunday’s government meeting, Mr. Olmert portrayed the Lebanon war, which he led, not as a failure but as something of a model for the current operation, since the northern border has been completely quiet ever since. But most Israelis disagree.Israel began that war vowing to decimate Hezbollah without fully realizing the extent of its military infrastructure, underground bunkers and rocket arsenals. And while many in Lebanon and overseas considered Israel’s military activities to be excessive, in Israel the opposite conclusion was reached — that it had been too restrained, too careful about distinguishing between Hezbollah and the state of Lebanon.“We were not decisive enough, and that will not happen again,” a senior military officer said in reference to that war, speaking on condition of anonymity, some weeks ago. He added, “I have flown over Gaza thousands of times and we know how to hit something within two meters.”The current operation started only after preparation and intelligence work, military commanders said, leading to a true surprise attack on Saturday and the instant deaths of scores of Hamas men. The Israeli military had mapped out Hamas bases, training camps and missile storehouses and systematically hit them simultaneously in an Israeli version of “shock and awe,” the sudden delivery of overwhelming force.It was , the defense minister, who directed the preparations, and politically it is Mr. Barak who stands to gain or lose most. As chairman of the Labor Party, he is running for prime minister in the February elections and polls show him to be a distant third to the Likud leader, , and the Kadima leader, Foreign Minister .But if Hamas is driven to a kind of cease-fire and towns in Israel’s south no longer live in fear of constant rocket fire, he will certainly be seen as the kind of leader this country needs. If, on the other hand, the operation takes a disastrous turn or leads to a regional conflagration, his political future seems bleak and he will have given Hamas the kind of prestige it has long sought.Ron Ben-Yishai, a veteran military correspondent who writes for Yediot Aharonot, said that Mr. Barak had phoned him shortly after the 2006 Lebanon war and said it had been an enormous error. Israel should have waited and prepared before reacting to Hezbollah, choosing its moment and circumstances, he said.And that, Mr. Ben-Yishai said, is what Mr. Barak did, not only behind the scenes but through a subtle public disinformation campaign. On Friday night, after having decided to launch the operation, he appeared on a satirical television program. An attack seemed at least several days away and Hamas, which had been holding its breath, relaxed. The next day, the Jewish Sabbath and the first day of the Arab workweek, Israel struck.There is palpable satisfaction at the moment in the Israeli government and the military because the operation so far is seen as a success. Few have focused on the fact that at this stage in the 2006 Lebanon war, there was the same satisfaction — before things turned disastrous.'"
"'08-12-29,'0','Major League Baseball has perhaps the most advanced online business of the major sports, and offers a season of games streamed online for $79.95, a price that league executives say will come down slightly in 2009. Robert A. Bowman, the chief executive of M.L.B.com said that piracy hurt business, but that “it’s embryonic, it’s not widespread, and we have a distinct advantage in that we have a better product.”Ms. Deutsch, the lawyer at the N.B.A., hosted a gathering recently of executives from other sports leagues — not just in the United States but around the world — at the N.B.A.’s offices in New York City to discuss ways of combating live-game piracy.“We view it as an international issue,” she said.That is not just because sports leagues abroad face the same issue, but also because the pirates themselves, the hubs of the peer-to-peer networks that facilitate the illicit streaming of live games, are mostly outside the United States. Often they are in China, where some of the most popular services started as student projects, say league executives who have tracked the digital trail of their pirated games.While the biggest services are located in China, it takes a fan, often in the United States, to upload the actual stream for distribution to the wider Internet. This is done by using a PC-tuner card, a $50 device that connects a television to a computer, or by uploading the stream from a legitimate online video subscription to a peer-to-peer network.As technology advances, the problem is likely to become worse as the quality of the picture becomes better. “This can only become a more enjoyable experience,” said Christopher Stokes, the chief executive of NetResult, a company in Britain that consults with the leagues and acts as a sort of Web detective in locating digital pirates.A recent unpublished report for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, the first major study of the issue, concluded, “This poses a major issue for the leagues and organizations who own and control sports as the sale of broadcast rights represents a major source of revenue, enabling the sports leagues to thrive and continue, from grassroots level to professional league.” The organization helps developed nations tackle mutual economic problems.David Price, the head of piracy intelligence at Envisional, a consultant that helped prepare the O.E.C.D. report, said: “I think it’s different than looking at movies or music. You might not go to the cinema, but you’ll buy the DVD. With sports, they very much have this one shot to get you to watch the game. If suddenly there is a way to get that live transmission for free, then there is a real threat to their business.”When leagues try to shut down the pirates, executives can find themselves immersed in an endeavor rife with international intrigue: investigators for the Premier League, England’s top soccer league, chased an offender to Cyprus to serve him court papers, according to Oliver Weingarten, a lawyer for the league.On a recent morning at the Manhattan offices of Major League Baseball Advanced Media, M.L.B.’s digital unit, an executive started a laptop and went to a live feed of a soccer game on ESPN Hong Kong that was carried by TVants.com. M.L.B. officials say TVants.com, based in China, is one of the biggest providers of live game feeds.M.L.B., which employs three people full time to monitor the Web for piracy, first noticed one of its games being illicitly streamed live on the Internet during a 2006 division series game between the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers. In 2007, M.L.B. documented 3,000 incidents of its live games being stolen; last season that number grew to 5,000. (There are 2,430 regular season games a season).“Even if you take a modest number of viewers per transmission, the number gets very large, very quickly,” said Michael J. Mellis, general counsel for M.L.B.com. “We do think it impacts our business, or we wouldn’t be so worried about it.”The N.B.A.’s popularity in China, thanks in large part to the star power of Yao Ming, the Chinese star on the Houston Rockets, has made its games some of the most popular for pirates and viewers. A single game last year between the Rockets and the Dallas Mavericks drew 1.1 million viewers, mostly in China, over the China-based service Sopcast.As a result, the N.B.A. has gone so far as to form a partnership with two peer-to-peer streaming services in China to offer legitimate streaming of live games.Gary Gertzog, the general counsel at the N.F.L., says enforcement is difficult. This season alone the league has disabled several hundred sites, but each Sunday its games are available on a number of Web sites. “Live games online is clearly something that has proliferated over the last two years,” he said.In combating piracy, one method of enforcement is off limits, executives say. They will not, like the music industry did, sue individual fans who are uploading games to peer-to-peer platforms.“I’d like to think we’ve learned some cautionary lessons from the music industry,” said Mr. Mellis of M.L.B. “What is the utility in suing individuals who are part of a larger chain of events?”So a steady flow of cease-and-desist letters flow out of the offices of each league’s law firms. Moral suasion is used on foreign governments — M.L.B., for example, has been in discussions with the Chinese government about shutting sites there. Sometimes it works: Sopcast, a service that was begun as a project at Fudan University in Shanghai, now blocks M.L.B. games. (Virtually every other sport’s games can still be seen over the service.)“If this is a baseball game, it’s still the top of the first, or the bottom of the first,” Mr. Mellis said. “This is going to take years.”'"
"'08-12-29,'0','GENEVA (AP) — A Swiss man suspected of involvement in the world’s biggest nuclear smuggling ring has been released from prison after more than four years of investigative detention, his family said Sunday.Urs Tinner, 43, was freed several days ago, his mother, Hedwig Tinner, told The Associated Press by telephone from eastern Switzerland.His brother, Marco Tinner, 40, remains in detention while prosecutors appeal for his release to the federal criminal court in Bellinzona, she said.The family’s information was confirmed by an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules.The Swiss Supreme Court had rejected previous requests for the release of the Tinner brothers, but told investigators in August to consider — “within months” — whether to set them free pending a possible trial.The brothers, along with their father, Friedrich, are suspected of supplying the clandestine network of Abdul Qadeer Khan — creator of Pakistan’s atomic bomb — with technical know-how and equipment that was used to make gas centrifuges. Dr. Khan sold the centrifuges to countries with secret nuclear weapons programs, including Libya and Iran, before his operation was disrupted in 2003.Swiss investigators have struggled to piece together a complete picture of the alleged activities of the Tinners within the Khan network since their arrest.'"
"'08-12-29,'0','PARIS — A multibillion-dollar joint venture between Dow Chemical and a state-owned Kuwaiti company fell victim to the financial crisis and the collapse of oil prices after the Kuwaiti government said Sunday that it would back out of the deal in the face of opposition in Parliament.The government of the prime minister, Sheik Nasser al-Mohammad al-Ahmad al-Sabah, said in a statement that it had decided to cancel an agreement to create K-Dow Petrochemicals, a venture between the Kuwaiti company, Petrochemical Industries, and Dow Chemical, that was to be the world’s largest maker of polyethylene.The collapse of the deal could complicate matters for Dow and its chief executive, Andrew N. Liveris. He had hoped to use the proceeds to finance the company’s $15 billion acquisition of Rohm & Haas, a specialty chemicals company based in Philadelphia. Shares of Dow, which is based in Midland, Mich., and is the biggest maker of chemicals in the United States, have fallen 51 percent in 2008, and the company might find lenders reluctant to finance the Rohm & Haas deal in the current business environment.Like its rivals BASF and DuPont, Dow has been sharply curtailing output in the face of the severe downturn. Prices for some products are falling by as much as 50 percent. Mr. Liveris said in November that he expected “a pretty protracted global recession, probably going into 2010.”Dow Chemical said in a statement Sunday that it had been “verbally informed” of the Kuwaitis’ decision and that Dow was “extremely disappointed.” It said it was evaluating its options.'"

It also names as defendants the Times' executive editor, its Washington bureau chief and four reporters.Iseman represented telecommunications companies before the Senate Commerce Committee, which McCain chaired. In February, as McCain was seeking the Republican presidential nomination, the Times reported that McCain aides once worried the relationship between Iseman and McCain had turned romantic.The article said that both McCain and Iseman denied any romantic relationship, but the lawsuit says most readers would find that obligatory.""That The New York Times would make such aggressive and sensational allegations and insinuations in the face of on-the-record denials by Ms. Iseman and Senator McCain only reinforced the message to readers that The New York Times in fact believed that Ms. Iseman and Senator McCain had indeed engaged in an `inappropriate relationship,' a relationship that was romantic, unethical, and a conflict of interest,"" the lawsuit says.

"'08-12-30,'1','JERUSALEM — A rare point of consensus in Israel, a normally fractious country, has been the desire to see Gilad Shalit, the Israeli corporal who has been held captive in Gaza for more than two years, return alive.Yet when Israelis woke up on Monday to a report on Egyptian television that the soldier, now 22, had been hurt in the Israeli bombardment of Hamas facilities in Gaza over the last few days, the news was met with almost a stoicism. Despite very real fears for the soldier’s safety and an instinctive understanding that the attack on Gaza involved a calculated risk for Corporal Shalit, many were also prepared for what could be emotional manipulations by the other side.Hamas, the militant Islamic group that controls Gaza and is holding Corporal Shalit, has demanded the release of some 1,400 Palestinian security prisoners from Israeli jails, including many convicted of deadly terrorist attacks, for his return. The group’s officials refused to confirm or deny the report that he was injured, which first cropped up on Islamist militant Web sites.So far, if only out of respect for the soldier’s family, Israeli leaders have tried to keep Corporal Shalit out of the political fray. But in a country where 18-year-olds are conscripted into the army and the military prides itself on never abandoning its own, his fate has gripped the nation.The Israeli military said in a statement that the soldier, who was seized in a cross-border raid by Hamas and other militant groups in June 2006, was a “valuable asset” to Hamas; in the military’s view, the group would do all it could to keep him alive.'"
"'08-12-30,'1','TEHRAN — Authorities stormed the private office of Iran’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Shirin Ebadi, on Monday, seizing her computers and her clients’ documents.Ms. Ebadi, who is the country’s most prominent human rights activist and an outspoken critic of the government, has recently come under increasing pressure from the government. The move on Monday appeared to be part of an effort to limit her activities ahead of presidential elections in June.This month, the authorities shut down her Center for Defenders of Human Rights, a coalition of human rights groups and other political activists whose members were planning to celebrate the 60th anniversary of United Nations Declaration on Human Rights.In a telephone interview, Ms. Ebadi said that five men from the judicial authorities arrived at her office on Monday afternoon, claiming they had a warrant to take her computers and documents to investigate whether she had evaded her taxes.

Gross domestic product in the country rose 0.1 percent from the second quarter, when it shrank 0.3 percent, the national statistics office, Insee, said. The figures are unchanged from a Nov. 14 estimate. Consumer spending rose 0.2 percent in the third quarter after stagnating in the second quarter. Households saved 15.4 percent of their disposable income, the lowest rate in two years. Exports and imports rose 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, after falling the previous quarter.'"
"'08-12-30,'1','Ms. Bordas turned to Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. With the help of Catholic Charities, she applied for financial aid from the Human Resources Administration and a Family Eviction Prevention Supplement allowance. But before that aid came through, $499.73 from the Neediest Cases Fund helped Ms. Bordas avoid being evicted.Her only earned income, she said, is the occasional $60 she can make by baby-sitting for two other children who live in her building. Ms. Bordas, in an interview, said that she would much prefer to be self-sufficient and had applied for a job at McDonald’s. Her caseworker from Catholic Charities, Saby Torres, present at the interview as her translator, admonished her gently:“We’re going to have to look a little harder, O.K.?” she said.Ms. Bordas said that she came to America in 1992 from the Dominican Republic, and that she had been on solid financial footing until 2005, when she was pregnant with her youngest — Alexis, a boy — and his father, a mechanic, was stabbed to death.“He supported us all, and it became very hard without him,” she said. “A cousin of his told me he was stabbed in some type of altercation in the Bronx, and that was the only thing I heard. That’s when the bad life started. I started going to church to ask for food.”The father of Demmy and Stephanie, her older sister, is in prison upstate on a drug conviction, Ms. Bordas said, adding that she didn’t know exactly where because she had no interest in communicating with him.Before Demmy was born, doctors said that the baby would have Down syndrome, and that a genetic defect had created holes in her heart.“She had open-heart surgery when she was one month old and stayed at Columbia-Presbyterian for five months,” Ms. Bordas said. “I visited every day until I could bring her home.”Ms. Bordas has sought intervention services for Demmy since her birth, but raising her has been a struggle. She did not walk until she was 3 and could not feed herself until she was 5.The apartment is the family’s haven. Alexis and his mother sleep in the bedroom, and the two girls sleep on couches in the living room.“We do not go out very much, because it hurts me too much, the way people look at Demmy,” Ms. Bordas said. “I am afraid they will be mean to her. I try not to make her think that she’s different.”Demmy, who had disappeared from the living room, returned in a white gown and announced that she had dressed up because her birthday was tomorrow.“I like to look at you,” Ms. Bordas said, laughing and hugging her daughter. She said she hoped to get her a cake, though she doubted she could afford it.How to HelpChecks payable to The NewYork Times Neediest CasesFund may be sent to:All gifts are acknowledged;special lettersare not possible.

"'08-12-30,'1','A British children’s clothing retailer, Adams Childrenswear, was on the brink of a form of bankruptcy protection, a spokeswoman for the company said. The spokeswoman, Ginette Gisborne, said the retailer, based in central England, had applied to go into administration, a form of bankruptcy protection, and expected to be placed in the hands of administrators at PricewaterhouseCoopers. The administrators will then try to salvage as much of the company as possible for the benefit of creditors. That can involve trying to keep the business as a going concern or breaking it up and selling it. Adams, which employs about 2,000 people, has 260 stores in Britain and more than 100 international outlets in the Middle East and Europe.'"
"'08-12-30,'1','It’s a tangled web that nature weaves. The typical ecosystem is filled with organisms that are linked in some way — one preys on the other, or lives off the other parasitically, or depends on the other in some way.Honeybees and caterpillars, however, have little to do with each other, even though they often exist in the same ecosystem. The honeybee pollinates plants while foraging for nectar; the caterpillar eats foliage. They are like two ships passing in the night.So it may come as a surprise to learn that honeybees actually have an impact on caterpillars, in an indirect way. The buzz of bees flying by, researchers report in Current Biology, causes caterpillars to stop destroying plants.Jürgen Tautz and Michael Rostas of the University of Würzberg in Germany conducted a simple experiment with pepper plants and beet armyworm caterpillars in two enclosed tents. A hive was connected to one of the tents, and honeybees flew around on their way to two sugar-solution feeders inside the tent.After about two weeks, the researchers measured the amount of plant foliage eaten by the caterpillars. In the tent with the bees, they discovered, about 60 percent to 70 percent less foliage was consumed compared with the other tent.Like many other caterpillars, the army beetworm has sensory hairs that are stimulated by airborne vibrations. And like many other caterpillars, this species is preyed upon by wasps. So it has a wasp-avoidance technique: when it senses the vibrations, it stops moving or drops off the plant.'"
"'08-12-30,'1','A rash of retailing bankruptcies is expected in the new year, but as the clock winds down on one of the weakest holiday shopping seasons in decades, the fallout has already begun.On Monday, the Parent Company, an Internet retailer of children’s products, had the dubious distinction of apparently becoming the first well-known retailer to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after Christmas. The company made the filing along with nine of its subsidiaries, including eToys. Many analysts did not expect bankruptcy filings to begin until January or February.Michael J. Wagner, chief executive of the Parent Company, called the bankruptcy filing “an unfortunate but necessary and responsible step to preserve the company’s value for our stakeholders in light of the ongoing challenging retail environment.”Challenging is hardly the word. This year, retailers including Circuit City, Boscov’s, Sharper Image, Mervyns, Linens ’n Things, Whitehall Jewelers and Steve & Barry’s filed for bankruptcy protection.And that is very likely the tip of the iceberg. After studying more than 180 companies, AlixPartners, a restructuring firm, estimates that over the next 24 months there will be a fourfold increase in the number of retailers in deep distress — companies that do not have enough working capital or are unable to finance their debt.'"
"'08-12-30,'1','People who have seasonal allergies pay particular attention to one part of the weather report: the pollen count, or the average number of grains in a given volume of air.When it comes to causing sneezing and suffering, however, not all pollen is created equal. And determining what plant species the pollen comes from usually requires looking at the grains under a microscopic. That takes time.Researchers in Germany have taken another approach to identifying pollen, from its chemical signature. Franziska Schulte of Humboldt University of Berlin and colleagues report in the journal Analytical Chemistry that they have identified pollen of 15 tree species using Raman spectroscopy.A pollen grain contains a wide variety of molecules, including polymers (which form the outer layer), pigments, proteins, fats and carbohydrates. In Raman spectroscopy, photons from a laser are scattered by the molecular vibration of a sample, and the resulting energy changes in the photons are analyzed. So each pollen type, with its own mix of molecules, produces a different spectroscopic profile.An advantage of this approach is that the analysis can be done very quickly, with little or no preparation of the pollen grains required. That raises the prospect of future pollen reports that specify the precise mix of grain types in the air and are provided in close to real time.'"
"'08-12-30,'1','One more reason for getting a good night’s sleep: sleeping an extra hour a night may help control coronary artery calcification, a major risk factor for heart disease.The effect, reported in the Dec. 24 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, was so strong that the researchers concluded that one extra hour of sleep was the equivalent of lowering systolic blood pressure to a normal 120 from 136.“While this is an intriguing new finding, this one study does not by itself establish a causal relationship,” said Diane Lauderdale, the senior author and an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Chicago. “It may be that there is some other factor that influences how much people sleep and independently influences calcification.”The scientists followed 495 healthy men and women, ages 35 to 47, for five years, measuring their sleep patterns with electronic monitoring devices and examining their arteries with CT scans.Over all, the group averaged 6.1 hours of sleep a night. But after controlling for age, blood pressure, cholesterol and other factors, those who averaged an extra hour’s sleep every night reduced their risk of calcification by about one-third.'"

"'08-12-31,'1','DHAKA, Bangladesh (Reuters) — Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her allies won a huge parliamentary majority in Bangladesh’s first election in seven years, officials said Tuesday, but her longtime rival said that there had been large-scale ballot-rigging.Analysts said it was unclear whether the losing parties would accept the result or call their supporters to the streets to protest. Independent monitors said the election had appeared largely fair and credible.By late Tuesday Ms. Hasina’s party, the Awami League, had won 229 seats and her alliance a landslide 263 seats in the 300-member Parliament, election officials said. Begum Khaleda Zia, a longstanding Hasina opponent who is also a former prime minister, contended that widespread election fraud had resulted in her party’s winning only 31 seats.The voting signified Bangladesh’s return to democracy after two years of emergency rule by an army-backed government.About 100 people were injured in post-election violence, the private television channel Diganta TV said. Another channel, Bangla Vision, reported two deaths.'"
"'08-12-31,'1','Lewis’s book, which Oher said he had not read since it was published in 2006, has dueling story lines.The first chronicles the evolution of the left tackle position and projects Oher, an athletic 6 feet 5 inches and 318 pounds, as the prototype for football’s next great tackle.The second tracks Oher’s academic development, which takes a drastically different trajectory when he is adopted by a wealthy family and enrolled in an elite private school.The football part of Oher’s journey appears to have played to form.The ESPN.com analyst Todd McShay lists Oher as the No. 4 tackle prospect and projects him as a late first-round pick. Gil Brandt, a former Cowboys executive who is an analyst for NFL.com, said he considered Oher the country’s best tackle prospect because of his athleticism. But he said he worried that Oher “doesn’t have the killer instinct.”Lewis said in a telephone interview that he was under the impression that Oher would have been a first-round pick if he had left Ole Miss after his junior year.Oher said he benefited greatly from returning for his senior year. He lauded Mike Markuson, the new offensive line coach, and Don Decker, the strength coach, for helping to mold him into a better tackle.The best part for Oher, though, has been winning games after Ole Miss went 10-25 in his first three seasons.“To finish up winning five games in a row, beating L.S.U. and Florida and Auburn, it’s a lot of fun,” Oher said. “Coach Nutt says that winning is the greatest high, it’s the biggest high you can get.”Coming into the season, it was debatable whether Oher was the best lineman on his team, never mind in the country. When the Rebels needed a tough yard last season, they usually ran behind right guard John Jerry, who switched to right tackle this season.Two former Ole Miss staff members, Jacob Rogers and Aaron Ausmus, said in telephone interviews that they liked Oher and thought he had a bright future, but they did not have the same elite projections for Oher as Lewis did in his book.Rogers, who was a three-year starter at Southern California and a lineman for the Dallas Cowboys, worked as a volunteer with Ole Miss last season. Rogers said he felt that Oher could be a “solid player” in the N.F.L. and that he projected more as a guard than as a tackle.“From being around the position long enough and seeing the type of player he is, I don’t know if he has the ranginess,” said Rogers, the defensive line coach at Central Connecticut State. “His skill set fits better in the interior, at the guard position.”Ausmus, who preceded Decker as the Ole Miss strength coach for football, said Oher was a great athlete but came to Mississippi “raw” and lacking experience in the weight room.“He’s probably one of the better athletes I’ve been around at that type of a position,” Ausmus said. “He was a little bit behind just as far as strength. He had to really work at it, and he did. Nothing really stood out good or bad. He was consistent; he did his job.”Along with his lofty on-field hype, Oher came into Ole Miss as an academic question mark. Lewis’s book details how Oher qualified for college eligibility via online courses through Brigham Young University; Lewis termed it “the great Mormon grade-grab.” Oher had so little academic background that he made it to his senior year of high school without even knowing basics about a right angle or the Civil War.“A lot of simple things I should have known, I didn’t know,” Oher said in a campus interview this month.The publicity of Oher’s academic background, which, Lewis wrote, included 11 different institutions in his first nine years of school, brought with it some concern. Karen Schiferl, the university’s senior associate athletics director for academic support, said that there were times during Oher’s career that she wished “The Blind Side” had never mentioned him. She said one of the difficulties was the perceptions embellished because of the book.“People were saying, ‘He can’t read,’ ” Schiferl said. “Well, that’s not true. There were a lot of misconceptions.”She added that Oher’s level of academic preparedness coming into college did not prove unique.“The interesting thing is that I don’t know if that’s necessarily different than other students or student-athletes,” she said. “Here in the state of Mississippi and in this area, there’s an exposure level that’s different. I’ve been at Maryland, Indiana and Northern Illinois, and I don’t necessarily know if it’s necessarily way different than kids in certain circumstances and situations.”Oher said he did not know what his grade-point average was, but he and Schiferl did say that he was on track to graduate with a degree in criminal justice. Oher said he would leave Ole Miss after the Cotton Bowl to work out for the N.F.L. draft, but he expected to complete his degree online.He said that Ole Miss was difficult academically, but that he felt as if he “breezed through” and was caught up after the years of neglect.Schiferl said that Oher had bouts with apathy, as any other student or student-athlete would, but was generally hard-working and pleasant. “He worked hard and did what he was supposed to,” she said.As his college career winds down with Ole Miss a surprising participant in a marquee bowl game, Oher said that he could not have written a better ending to his story.“It’s been a long road and a lot of hard work,” Oher said. “It’s been special for me. It’s been a great time. I wouldn’t change it for the world.”'"
"'08-12-31,'1','With a deadline looming for New York City to agree to increase the pay of in-home day care providers or face losing the state subsidy for the care of more than 100,000 poor children, city officials still had not agreed on Tuesday night to pay for the raises.Since October 2007, the city has refused a state order to give raises to these 28,000 providers, saying that the only way to pay for the increase — which it estimates would cost $53 million a year — would be to cut 6,300 day care slots to poor children. The state says the increase is mandated by federal law and sent the city an ultimatum this month to abide by it.City officials have continued to say publicly that some sort of resolution will be reached before the deadline, the close of business on Wednesday. Yet that has not stopped high-level city officials like Deputy Mayor Linda I. Gibbs and Deputy Mayor Kevin Sheekey from lobbying the governor’s office directly to win some concessions in how much the city will pay. The city has asked, for example, not to have to pay the day care providers retroactively, people familiar with the negotiations say.So far, however, the city has met stiff resistance from the powerful United Federation of Teachers, which has represented the day care providers for about a year.In addition, state officials say federal law does not allow them to compromise. They have reiterated their threat to stop federal and state reimbursement for subsidized day care — worth about $40 million a month — if the city does not produce a plan by end of the day.'"
"'08-12-31,'1','He had three years left on a contract that was to pay him about $20 million, The Associated Press reported. Last spring, Shanahan and his wife, Peggy, sold their suburban mansion for $16 million, according to The Rocky Mountain News, and began building a 35,000-square-foot home.Then the Broncos became the first team since divisional play began in 1967 to blow a three-game lead with three games remaining. On Sunday, with the American Football Conference West division title at stake, the Broncos lost to the San Diego Chargers, 52-21, to finish 8-8. They missed the playoffs for the third year in a row, the franchise’s longest drought since 1980-82.“After giving this careful consideration, I have concluded that a change in our football operations is in the best interests of the Denver Broncos,” Bowlen said in a statement. “This is certainly a difficult decision, but one that I feel must be made and which will ultimately be in the best interests of all concerned.”Shanahan spent 21 seasons in Denver, initially as a quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator under Dan Reeves, who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in the 1980s — all defeats. After a 20-game stint coaching the Raiders (Al Davis fired Shanahan four games into the 1989 season, and the two have feuded since over money that Shanahan says he is still owed) and two more seasons as a Broncos assistant, Shanahan became the offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. Working under Coach George Seifert and tutoring quarterback Steve Young, Shanahan helped the high-octane 49ers to a championship in 1994.Bowlen brought Shanahan back to Denver as the coach in 1995, as Elway’s career was winding down and his legacy seemed saddled by those three Super Bowl losses. The Broncos went 13-3 in 1996, losing to Tom Coughlin’s Jacksonville Jaguars in a playoff upset. But the Broncos went 12-4 and 14-2 the next two seasons, capped by Super Bowl victories that bestowed heroic status on Shanahan and Elway in the Mountain Time Zone.Shanahan could not find another quarterback to mold into a champion. He invested four seasons with Brian Griese, four with Jake Plummer and the past two with Jay Cutler.Although Cutler gave the Broncos hope for the future, Shanahan was ultimately undone by an increasingly leaky defense, something a revolving door of defensive coordinators could not seal, and a string of questionable draft picks and free-agent signings that Shanahan made as the team’s executive vice president for football operations. In Shanahan’s absence, the Broncos are in the market for a general manager as well.The Broncos’ defense was ranked among the league’s top seven in seven of the nine seasons beginning in 1997. In the last four years, however, the defense plunged to middle-of-the-pack status, then to No. 29 in 2008.In 16 seasons as an N.F.L. head coach, Shanahan compiled a 146-98 record. His teams were 8-5 in the playoffs, but 1-4 in the decade since Elway retired after Super Bowl XXXIII.'"

With government stacked up like layers of a wedding cake, the states need all the news coverage they can get, especially during a time of huge budget cuts. Unfortunately, the sour economy is also choking local news-gathering.The Tribune Company’s bankruptcy-court filing affects WTIC-TV, based in Hartford, which broadcasts nightly local news, and Connecticut’s largest newspaper, The Hartford Courant, where the most recent cuts in July reduced pages and staff by 25 percent. News of the Tribune bankruptcy followed the announcement by the Journal Register Company that it would close two of the five daily newspapers that it owns in Connecticut — The Herald of New Britain and The Bristol Press — and some or all of the 13 weekly newspapers it owns in the state unless it finds buyers.The Tribune Company’s troubles are in good part because of the large debt Samuel Zell incurred when he bought the business. But the economic downturn and the Internet’s inroads on print advertising have taken a toll on all newspapers.In New Jersey, The Star-Ledger of Newark is letting 151 employees go after they accepted buyouts, including what was the entire opinion page staff. The Record of Hackensack plans to move out of its headquarters and is already encouraging reporters to work from home. The Asbury Park Press has endured three rounds of layoffs this year. The Times’s regional coverage has been reduced, too.The most obvious news events, like murders, will always be covered, and journalism on the Internet may fill some of the gap. A feisty local news Web site in New Haven, The New Haven Independent, is currently giving The New Haven Register some competition. But, for now, there’s not much original local reporting on the Web, making it all the more likely that local government will get a pass.There’s less coverage of loopholes in Connecticut’s campaign financing law; few have investigated why Connecticut is burdened with the highest electricity rates in the continental United States. New Britain and Bristol have populations of more than 60,000. It’s hard to see what would fill the void when its newspapers die.'"

"'08-12-31,'1','WASHINGTON — A Washington lobbyist sued The New York Times and several of its reporters and editors Tuesday, charging that the newspaper had falsely created an impression that she had engaged in an improper romantic relationship with Senator John McCain.The suit, filed in the Federal District Court in Richmond, Va., said that a front-page article on Feb. 21 “falsely communicated” that the lobbyist, Vicki L. Iseman, and Mr. McCain “had an illicit ‘romantic’ and unethical relationship in breach of the public trust in 1999.” At that time, Ms. Iseman was representing clients before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, then headed by Mr. McCain.“Ms. Iseman did not engage in any behavior toward him that was anything other than professional and appropriate,” said the suit, which seeks damages of $27 million.The article, published at a time when Mr. McCain had clawed his way back from early setbacks to emerge as the all but certain Republican presidential nominee, examined his stated efforts to maintain high ethical standards even as he sometimes edged close to potential conflicts of interest. With its focus on the details of his Washington life behind the scenes, it provoked immediate debate and angry protest.The article did not directly say that Ms. Iseman and Mr. McCain had had a romantic relationship. But it did say several aides of his had been “convinced” that he had grown too close to Ms. Iseman and that he might be damaged if the relationship became known.The article quoted Ms. Iseman and Mr. McCain as denying that they had ever had a romantic relationship or engaged in any inappropriate behavior.'"
"'08-12-31,'1','“Egypt is helping the wounded and sending supplies for the people,” said Hishmat Abu Bakr, 63, who fought in the Arab-Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973. “But we’d prefer bigger help. We’d like to break the border and go die there with our brothers.”Harsher criticism of Mr. Mubarak was rare on Tuesday in northern Egypt, where the landscape and the architecture are nearly identical to that of Gaza, and where the economy is linked to smuggling food, supplies, arms and explosives there.Near the border — closed to visitors, including journalists, both ways — there is a heavy presence of police, military and secret police, the Mukhabarat, and numerous checkpoints along the roads on the way to the split border town of Rafah, which has been declared a military zone.The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and his ally, the Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon, have called on Egypt to open the border and the Egyptian people to break down the barriers. But Egyptian forces have clashed with Palestinians trying to leave Gaza, and Mr. Mubarak has said firmly that the border will remain closed.Egypt would reopen the Rafah crossing only when the Palestinian faction Hamas reconciled with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, and allowed him to reassert his authority over all Palestinian territory, including Gaza, Mr. Mubarak said Tuesday in a nationally televised speech.Mr. Mubarak condemned Israel’s “savage aggression.” But in a riposte to Arab critics who live at a distance, Mr. Mubarak said, “We say to those who are trying to make political capital out of the plight of the Palestinian people that Palestinian blood has a price.”Mr. Bakr, the 63-year-old war veteran, refused to believe it when told of Mr. Mubarak’s speech. “Mubarak could not say something so wrong,” Mr. Bakr said. “The Palestinians are his brothers.”Muhammad Ahmad, 25, who owns a dress shop called Farha, or Happiness, said Egypt was doing what it could. “If they open the border just like that, it will be chaos like last year,” he said. “That’s why we need an agreement. Here in El Arish, we’re so close to Gaza and yet there’s nothing we can do. It’s sad, but we’re powerless.”Two young men from Rafah had come to this seaside city, some 20 miles away, “to look at young women and to rest my head,” said Hassan Salem, 22. When the Israelis were bombing near Rafah to try to destroy the many smuggling tunnels that run between the Egyptian and Gazan side of the once-unified city, “we were almost knocked out by the noise,” said his friend, Khaled Kamal, 25, a postman.Everyone in Rafah has family on both sides of the border, Mr. Salem said, “so there’s a lot of worry — everyone on both sides of Rafah is worried.”The two young men sat in a tea shop, eyes glued to Al Jazeera and its nonstop television coverage of the wounded and dead in Gaza, with a special focus on two dead sisters, shown repeatedly lying in shrouds side by side.“When you see small children dying like that, why did they die?” Mr. Kamal said passionately. “What did they do?”Both were careful in discussing the tunnels, but Mr. Salem said, with a bit of exaggeration, “Israel destroyed maybe 40 tunnels the other day, but there are a thousand.”His words were echoed by Ahmad Abdo, 43. “The tunnels are our lifeline,” he said. “The Israelis bombed some, but they can’t bomb them all. Their economy is our economy.”Mr. Salem said all Arabs should help the Palestinians, but he was less clear about how.The military men in Rafah, Mr. Salem said, “are there to help.” But then he said, neatly describing the Egyptian dilemma, “Of course, if the Palestinians push through, the military is also there to push them back.”'"
"'08-12-31,'1','Many students take the SAT more than once, and the College Board automatically sends colleges the scores of every SAT test a student takes.Under Score Choice, students can choose their best overall SAT sitting to send to colleges, but they will not be able to mix and match scores from different sittings. (Each sitting includes tests in critical reading, mathematics and writing, with a top score of 800 in each area.)There is no additional charge if a student selects Score Choice, which also applies to SAT subject tests, formerly called SAT II and given in areas like history, sciences and languages.Score Choice is not a new concept. From 1993 to 2002, students were allowed to take as many SAT subject tests as they wanted and to report only their best scores to the colleges they applied to.In ending that policy in 2002, the College Board said that some students who had stored their scores had forgotten to release them and missed admissions deadlines. It also said that ending Score Choice would be fairer to low-income and minority students, who did not have the resources to keep retaking the tests.“It simply allows students to put their best foot forward,” said Laurence Bunin, a senior vice president with the College Board.With Score Choice, Mr. Bunin said, students can “feel very comfortable going into the test center because, goodness forbid, if for whatever reason they don’t feel comfortable, it won’t be on their permanent record forever.”William R. Fitzsimmons, the dean of admissions at Harvard, shares that view.“In some respect,” Mr. Fitzsimmons said, “Score Choice will help defuse some of the pressure and give students a sense that not everything is riding on the tests, which really is the case.”But Jerome A. Lucido, the vice provost for enrollment policy and management at the University of Southern California, said, “Students will like it because they’ll have a sense of control, but my sense is that it’s not worth the trade-off in terms of complexity and more gamesmanship.”A major concern has to do with how colleges will handle Score Choice.Admissions officials at some highly selective colleges — the University of Southern California, Stanford, Claremont McKenna and the University of Pennsylvania, among others — have said that, Score Choice or not, they want all the scores — from the SAT and the ACT.It is in the students’ best interest to send all scores, these officials say, because their practice is to combine the highest subscores from all of the score reports.“Our plan is to first tell students to relax,” said Bruce Poch, vice president and dean of admissions at Pomona College. “The habit here is like many colleges, which is to see it all, but consider for admission purposes the highest individual score.”Gary Meunier, a counselor at Weston High School, in Weston, Conn., said one reason he favored Score Choice was that while he believed that most schools did look at the highest subscores, he had also seen schools rule out students with any scores below 500.“Some kids, their performance in the classroom far exceeds the way they perform on standardized tests,” Mr. Meunier said. With Score Choice, “they get a couple more shots at it,” he said. “For those kids, they take it with a little less anxiety. At one test, if they blow it, no one’s going to see it.”Some critics of the new policy note that the SAT’s main rival, the ACT, which has been drawing increasing numbers of test takers, has long had a de facto Score Choice policy.“Was this a student-centered decision?” said Richard H. Shaw, dean of admissions at Stanford, referring to the College Board’s reason for introducing Score Choice. “Or was it business-centered because they’re worried about losing market share?”Mr. Shaw added that he was equally opposed to the ACT’s de facto Score Choice. “I don’t want to give them any credit whatsoever,” he said. “I think they started this.”Score Choice was developed in response to student demand, Mr. Bunin said. “The students were clear,” he said. “They thought that having some control over their scores would reduce their stress.”The College Board surveyed more than 3,000 high school students from a range of income groups and ethnicities, Mr. Bunin said. It also surveyed 700 counselors from a diverse group of high schools across the country, and 70 percent favored Score Choice, he said.But other counselors, as well as admissions officials, have expressed concern that the policy will give affluent students who can afford to take the SAT many times an even greater advantage.Among the questions being asked about how Score Choice will work is this one: What if a student opts for Score Choice and tries to apply it to a college that requires all the scores?Mr. Poch of Pomona said: “My own view is that tests are a transcript. I don’t get to choose which grades appear on a transcript any more than I get to suppress a driving record from an insurance company.”'"
"'08-12-31,'1','The 1920s-era Moondance Diner, which stood for years at Grand Street and Avenue of the Americas until it was closed and hauled 2,400 miles west last year, is on track to open in the tiny town of LaBarge, Wyo., in early January.Efforts to restore and reopen the diner were delayed over the past year by financing difficulties and heavy snow that collapsed much of the diner’s roof, said Cheryl Pierce, who bought the diner in 2007 with her husband, Vince, and took it to LaBarge.“We’ve had our bumps and glitches, and of course we’re over budget and over time,” Ms. Pierce said. “But ultimately we’ll be opening here shortly, and we’re really looking forward to it.”Ms. Pierce said health and other inspections are planned for the first week of January, with a target of Jan. 9 to open.In New York, the diner, which served cheeseburgers, fries, milkshakes and malts for nearly 80 years, had small roles in the first “Spider-Man” film and numerous episodes of television shows. In 2007, it was scheduled for demolition to make room for condominiums.The Pierces were looking for a restaurant investment when they spotted the diner for sale on a Web site and bought it for $7,500.'"
"'08-12-31,'1','It was a bit dispiriting to read Frank Bruni’s “A Celebrity and His Skillet” (Dec. 24). The alleged news in this article is that the celebrity chef Tom Colicchio cooked dinner for his restaurant patrons one recent evening.The idea that this is newsworthy seems pretty phony to those of us who stand at the stove every night in our kitchens and cook under conditions far less controlled than those in what Mr. Bruni calls an “occasional restaurant-within-a-restaurant.”We are supposed to take note because Mr. Colicchio has become a TV star and therefore doesn’t cook much anymore. So what? There are plenty of terrific cooks working every day and night in New York, and many of them probably put out food that is every bit as deserving of attention as Mr. Colicchio’s.I do not begrudge Mr. Colicchio anything. He is probably a splendid cook and businessman who has earned the successful path he’s chosen. I congratulate him. The idea, though, that his cooking one night a week is news makes The Times look simply infatuated with a TV star.The writer is the chef and owner of Pomme Restaurant in Clayton.'"
"'08-12-31,'1','A prominent Harvard child psychiatrist will curtail activities financed by the drug industry while Massachusetts General Hospital investigates his failure for years to disclose the consulting fees he received from drug makers.The psychiatrist, Dr. Joseph Biederman, a world-renowned and controversial researcher on childhood mental illness, has agreed to stop participating in speaking engagements and other activities paid for by pharmaceutical companies, and also to stop his work on industry-financed activities within the hospital. That includes clinical trials that are under way at the hospital, said Peggy Slasman, a spokeswoman for Massachusetts General.She said that the trials would continue but that Dr. Biederman would not be involved.“He’s just not going to be doing any of that as long as these review processes go on, until they wrap up and some decisions are made,” Ms. Slasman said.The hospital said in a statement that it was evaluating whether Dr. Biederman violated rules “related to potential conflicts of interest, disclosure and industry-institutional relationships.”Ms. Slasman said that Dr. Biederman would be allowed to continue working on federally financed research during the review.A lawyer for Dr. Biederman, Peter Spivack, said, “The agreement is one that was mutual.”Mr. Spivack said, “Dr. Biederman has done his best to comply with the disclosure policies of his employers, and he’s committed to future compliance with those policies.”'"
"'08-12-31,'1','Tannenbaum’s position may have become even more secure late Tuesday night when the team announced that Bill Cowher, the former Pittsburgh Steelers coach, was not interested in the Jets’ job. Cowher was likely to have sought more control over personnel than Mangini had — a situation that could develop if the Jets pursue other prominent candidates like Mike Holmgren, the departing Seattle coach, and Mike Shanahan, who was fired by the Denver Broncos on Tuesday.Still, it seems likely that Tannenbaum’s role in the organization will shape the search for Mangini’s successor.“I’m very comfortable with Mike,” said Woody Johnson, the team’s owner. “Mike is another guy that works around the clock, and he’s very smart about it.”Of course, Johnson vouched for Mangini, too, at least until Chad Pennington and the Miami Dolphins beat the Jets at Giants Stadium, securing the playoff berth the Jets had their eyes on when their record was 8-3. In fact, in Tannenbaum’s official biography, Johnson is quoted as saying that the general manager and the fired coach formed a “natural partnership.”By retaining Tannenbaum and not Mangini, Johnson indicated that he felt the Jets were built properly, including the uncharacteristic splurge on free agents this past off-season, but not necessarily coached that way.Johnson bristled at the suggestion the Jets were a floundering franchise. He called Mangini’s firing a decisive decision made to add to a solid foundation — built by two men who were once partners, only one of whom is still employed by the team.“Last year, we had an opportunity in free agency that we hadn’t had,” Johnson said. “We took advantage of it. It was successful.”The Jets’ off-season spree — complete with two major trades and $140 million spent on free agents, although much of that money is not guaranteed — marked a major shift for a franchise often described as thrifty. It also raised expectations.In came quarterback Brett Favre and nose tackle Kris Jenkins, in separate trades, along with free agents like left guard Alan Faneca, right tackle Damien Woody and linebacker Calvin Pace, among others.Tannenbaum had constructed a team to win immediately. But he was not without his misfires, including linebacker Vernon Gholston, the sixth overall pick in this year’s draft, who had 13 tackles for the season, and Favre, who doomed the Jets with nine interceptions in his last five games.Acquiring Favre in August fell to Tannenbaum, and although Mangini publicly supported the idea of bringing him aboard, he also quietly expressed concerns. The Jets changed their offense to accommodate Favre, who led the N.F.L. with 22 interceptions to match his total for touchdown passes.Tannenbaum said that the decision to fire Mangini was not based on one transaction or one player. Johnson repeatedly praised Favre and Tannenbaum.“It was really hard,” Tannenbaum said of letting Mangini go. “One day, I hope we can remain close, personal friends. I respect him. I like him. I admire him. I think the world of him.”Besides the Broncos, the Cleveland Browns and the Detroit Lions also fired coaches this week. Kansas City, St. Louis and Oakland could also have openings, leaving several teams to sift through a shallow pool of applicants.Johnson said that he did not believe one person could be both a general manager and head coach. “It’s too much,” he said. “There’s no way that you can do it, and really do it, because you’re always relying on somebody else. You may think that you have the power, but you can’t make those discerning decisions. There’s just too much work to do and be a coach.”Holmgren strongly disputed that statement two weeks ago, before his final home game in Seattle, when he said people who say that are “usually out-of-work general managers.”Whatever the duties of the new Jets coach, Cowher will not be performing them. He told the Jets on Tuesday that he was not interested in the job, Bruce Speight, a team spokesman, said in an e-mail message. The Jets said they did not discuss money or a change in organizational structure with Cowher.By all accounts, Cowher remains happy working for CBS as an analyst and is willing to wait until 2010 to return to coaching. He recently turned down the Browns, who, according to another Jets official, were to interview Mangini.The Jets’ growing list of potential replacements includes Bill Parcells, who can opt out of his contract in Miami if the team changes ownership, which it is expected to do this off-season; Marty Schottenheimer, whose son, Brian, is the Jets’ offensive coordinator; and Steve Spagnuolo, the Giants’ defensive coordinator. Spagnuolo is expected to have an interview with the Jets this week.Four of the 14 head coaches the Jets have hired had previous N.F.L. head coaching experience, including their two most successful: Weeb Ewbank and Parcells. The team’s last three — Mangini, Herman Edwards and Al Groh — were first-time N.F.L. head coaches.'"
"'08-12-31,'1','According to another report released Tuesday, the December survey of consumers by the Conference Board, overall consumer confidence dropped to its lowest levels on record this month, after rising slightly in November, as Americans braced for a long recession.Only 6.6 percent of Americans said that business conditions were good, and 6.2 percent of people said jobs were plentiful, down from 23.6 percent a year ago.Prices in every metropolitan area in Case-Shiller’s 20-city index dropped from September to October, and six of them — Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, Washington, Charlotte, N.C., and Tampa, Fla. — posted record one-month declines. The index excludes many midsize metropolitan areas and some large cities, like Houston and Philadelphia.The numbers show that the cities that had the greatest gains in the housing boom are now suffering the steepest drops as a flood of lender-owned homes and distressed sales hit the market.Prices in Las Vegas and Phoenix, where developers built subdivisions stretching into the desert, fell by nearly a third in October from 2008.Prices in Miami fell by 29 percent. There, homeowners who tried to wait out the market are paying a price, said Madeline Romanello, a real estate agent with Douglas Elliman. Sellers who turned down offers of $700,000 for a house they had listed for $900,000 are now scrambling to sell for $550,000, she said.Prices in New York declined 7.5 percent in October over the same month a year ago.Fourteen of the 20 cities in the Case-Shiller survey posted double-digit declines for the year. The relative winner was Dallas, which had the smallest decline, 3 percent.Realtors said that foreclosure sales and distressed sales dominated the market, forcing other sellers to lower their prices or take their homes off the market and wait.“If the house doesn’t have a foreclosure price on it, even if the owners aren’t in foreclosure, buyers aren’t even looking,” said Kathy Buterakos, a real estate agent in Grand Blanc, Mich. “It’s the worst I’ve ever seen it.”To stimulate interest in open houses, she has sent out bulletins to neighbors, posted notices in gyms and local apartment complexes and had her sister put up fliers at a hospital. But no one has responded, Ms. Buterakos said.The Case-Shiller numbers were the latest round of bleak news for the housing sector, which is at the center of the country’s broader economic troubles. Foreclosures, bad loans and collapsing housing prices contributed to the financial crisis earlier this year, and now the widening recession is dragging housing down even more.Last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned homes, which dominate the market, fell to the lowest rate in years. Home values tumbled 13 percent in November from a year earlier, the sharpest drop in more than 40 years, the industry group reported.A glut of unsold houses is weighing down the market, and housing is likely to deteriorate further in 2009 as the jobs picture continues to weaken. Unemployment is at 6.7 percent, its highest point in a decade, and is expected to rise further next year, to above 8 percent.“People who think they’re going to lose their job don’t buy a home,” Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities, said.'"
"'08-12-31,'1','BANGKOK — Dodging protesters outside the Thai Parliament on Tuesday, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva gathered a quorum at the Foreign Ministry building instead and delivered a policy speech inaugurating his already embattled administration.“The government has come into office at a time of conflict,” he said. “This conflict has become the weakness of the country.” Mr. Abhisit said the dispute, which has paralyzed the government and weakened Thailand’s economy over the past year, must be resolved to meet the challenges of the global economic downturn and revive the country’s crucial tourist industry.The return of street politics on Monday, when demonstrators forced a postponement of the new parliamentary session, showed the difficulties Mr. Abhisit will face as he tries to restore stability. Mr. Abhisit and lawmakers from his governing Democrat Party headed for Parliament on Tuesday morning in a convoy escorted by the police but were blocked from entry by thousands of protesters demanding a new election. They then detoured to the Foreign Ministry where a quorum of legislators had gathered.Protesters and hundreds of riot police officers had spent the night outside Parliament after the inaugural session was postponed Monday by the blockade.At one point, according to Reuters, the police tried to push open the gates to Parliament but were forced back inside by the protesters.'"
