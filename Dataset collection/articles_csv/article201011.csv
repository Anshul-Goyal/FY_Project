"'10-11-01,'1','But some analysts see the deal with Achronix as an indication that Intel intends to enter the contract manufacturing business in a more meaningful way.“I think this is only the beginning of Intel manufacturing for others,” said Gus Richard, a microprocessor industry analyst with Piper Jaffray.Intel has long held a manufacturing lead over its competitors in the PC and server chip markets, building chips with smaller components before rivals do. Those smaller pieces result in faster, cheaper, lower-power products. Historically, Intel has kept its collection of multibillion-dollar chip fabrication plants, or fabs, to itself to build the chips it designs in-house.Meanwhile, a few other companies, most of them located in Taiwan and China, have specialized in building chips that other companies design. These companies engage in a fierce, expensive battle to attract customers like Apple, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.Mr. Richard said that Intel had struggled to build a major business beyond PC and server chips, and that working with other designers could help it simultaneously learn new markets while offsetting the cost of its factories.“Manufacturing is their crown jewel, and they’re finding new ways to monetize it,” he said.He and other analysts characterized the move as a mere dip of the toe into accepting business from other chip designers. Achronix is a minor player in the relatively modest-size market for F.P.G.A., or field programmable gate array, chips.These chips fill a niche because they can be tweaked to push through specialized tasks at faster rates than the general purpose chips founds in PCs. Companies use these customizable chips to speed up things like routers and switches, and systems that handle digital signals and video. Increasingly, Wall Street has turned to them to speed their financial calculations, while oil and gas companies use the chips to power through geological data.The worldwide market for these chips is about $3 billion, about one-tenth of the size of Intel’s annual revenue. Intel does not currently compete in the market.By branching into manufacturing, even at a modest level, the company can gain some experience in building products for other designers, said Joseph Byrne, a chip industry analyst with the Linley Group. He said that came with challenges because Intel for the first time would need to meet the needs of external customers.Mr. Byrne added that the move had the chance to heighten competition in the F.P.G.A. market, is currently dominated by two companies: Xilinx and Altera. Both companies rely on contract manufacturers for the chips they design.John L. Holt, the chief executive of Achronix, said that tapping Intel as a manufacturing partner should allow the company to make faster, cheaper products than its rivals and expand the market for these chips.“F.P.G.A.’s have been too expensive because the top ones cost in the $1,000 range,” Mr. Holt said. “We will sell them for $400.”Mr. Byrne said Achronix in 2009 had virtually no market share but that it could make up ground quickly if the chips manufactured by Intel did deliver the expected cost and performance increases.“This will greatly heighten the threat” that Achronix poses, he said.But Mr. Richard of Piper Jaffray said that Xilinx and Altera remained well positioned and that it would be a “long stretch” to say that Achronix could quickly catch up.Intel, on rare occasions, has made chips for other companies in the past, but never at its most advanced manufacturing facilities.'"
"'10-11-01,'1','The Mexican government is fully committed to investigating cases of human rights violations. The military justice reform presented by President Felipe Calderón to our Congress has the dual purpose of strengthening the protection and promotion of human rights between the armed forces and civilians, and within the military.Moreover, the proposal will align Mexico’s legal framework with our international commitments on human rights, while strengthening our justice system.It is important to clarify that complaints from the National Human Rights Commission to the military do not automatically mean that a full investigation has been concluded or that a human rights violation has been found.Of the total number of complaints from the commission to the Ministry of Defense (4,266), the commission issued recommendations in only 62 cases (1.45 percent), all of which were fully accepted by the ministry.The Ministry of Defense and the Mexican Navy have recently established human rights offices and permanent training programs on human rights for their personnel.President Calderón’s government has an unwavering commitment to guaranteeing the rule of law and to safeguarding human rights for all. It is convinced that the fight against organized crime has to take place under a strict policy of respect for and promotion of human rights.'"
"'10-11-01,'1','But while investors have been staking out their positions for weeks, the announcement — and the potential ramifications — remain fraught with uncertainty. Given that the Fed’s news is expected to land as Wall Street is digesting Tuesday’s election results, analysts are bracing for a volatile day, particularly if the Fed underwhelms investors.“There is not going to be a headline-grabbing number,” said David Semmens, the United States economist for Standard Chartered Bank. “It will cause the market significant concern.”At the end of 2008, the Fed began a program to buy $1.7 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The purchases were announced in advance and came in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Now investors are waiting for a second round of such quantitative easing. Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has hinted that the central bank is likely to act.“The market is the world’s largest forecasting mechanism,” said Stephen Wood, senior portfolio strategist for Russell Investments. “Markets tend to move before things happen.”There have been plenty of signals to feed expectations. The annual inflation rate is running below 2 percent, while unemployment remains stubbornly high. The latest estimated gross domestic product pace of 2 percent for the third quarter and the core personal consumption expenditures rise of 0.8 percent, released on Friday, only added to what many saw as further justification for action.If the government spends $500 billion to $2 trillion on quantitative easing, the securities purchases are expected to be spread out over months. The Fed might spend $80 billion to $100 billion a month, constantly assessing whether the program is having the desired effect.“The Fed loves ranges because that gives them more options,” said Mr. Wood. “They will set expectations but not tip their hands. It will want to keep its powder dry, its options open.”But with quantitative easing already expected by the markets, such an announcement could disappoint investors. Treasuries and equities could modestly sell off in the short term if the amount is less than expected.“If there is any sign of a more cautious approach, or a smaller scale, you could see long-term bond rates rise, the dollar strengthen and perhaps stocks selling off a bit,” said Adrian Cronje, the chief investment officer of Balentine. “I think that is probably the area that is most likely to cause any correction to recent trends — if there is a sense that the Federal Reserve might back off.”Many analysts expect the second round of purchases to be mostly of two- and 10-year Treasuries, although the Goldman Sachs Group recently predicted that the Fed might include 30-year Treasury bonds in its program. Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott, said his firm expected $100 billion in monthly asset purchases, with the final amount contingent on future inflation.The dollar has been weakening against major currencies in recent weeks on the expectation of the Fed’s move. Gold, already at a high above $1,300 an ounce, could benefit even more if investors read an aggressive move by the Fed as a sign that inflation may eventually accelerate, said Jeffrey Nichols, senior economic adviser to Rosland Capital, in a recent speech.The stock market treaded water on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing virtually unchanged at 11,118.49. The broad stock market has gained about 9.5 percent since Sept. 1.“People have taken positions, and they are waiting to see what the trifecta is,” said Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst at Standard & Poor’s, referring to this week’s elections, Fed meeting and monthly national unemployment report. The question, he said, is whether the Fed’s expected action produces a yawn or a sigh of relief.'"

"'10-11-01,'1','Paul Kolton, who became the first full-time paid chairman of the American Stock Exchange without ever having worked as a stockbroker, died on Wednesday in Stamford, Conn., where he lived. He was 87.The cause was lymphoma, his daughter, Shelley Kolton, said.When Mr. Kolton was named president of the Amex in 1971, it was the first time an in-house employee, rather than a leading figure from the financial world, was put atop one of the major securities exchanges. He was elevated to chairman, a newly created post, a year later after the Amex’s board was reorganized.Mr. Kolton reached that position without ever having served as a stockbroker. A former reporter for The New York Journal of Commerce and a mystery writer, he landed his first Wall Street job working in public relations for the Amex’s bigger rival, the New York Stock Exchange.Much of Mr. Kolton’s tenure at the Amex was spent fending off the idea that the exchange should merge with the New York Stock Exchange. “Two independent, viable exchanges are much more likely to be responsive to new pressures and public needs than a single institution,” he said at the beginning of his presidency.During his tenure, the Amex, to great fanfare, introduced options trading in 1975, two years after the founding of the Chicago Board Options Exchange.After retiring from the Amex in 1977, Mr. Kolton was chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council and a director of several companies, including Standard Brands and Caldor.'"
"'10-11-01,'1','Apple is suing Motorola, saying that Motorola has infringed on patents related to its smartphones.Apple said in a filing that the Droid, Cliq, BackFlip and other phones from Motorola violate its patents related to the iPhone’s touch screen and user interface.Apple says it wants Motorola to stop using the patents and is seeking an unspecified amount of damages, as well as its lawyers’ fees and costs. The lawsuit was filed in a federal district court in Wisconsin on Friday.The suit comes after Motorola sued Apple in October over patent infringement.Motorola was a top cellphone maker in 2006, because of the popularity of its Razr clamshell phone, but it was surpassed by others when smartphones became popular. Meanwhile, iPhones from Apple have surged in popularity. The company sold 14.1 million last quarter.Motorola is the seventh-largest phone maker in the world. In North America, it is outstripped by Apple and Research In Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry. Motorola’s recent smartphones, like the Droid line of phones, run on Google Android software.'"
"'10-11-01,'1','Of all the things Agnelli gave Juventus, a stadium as grand as the San Siro was not one of them. He preferred fine players to fine buildings, or fine anything. His eye for a player, and his fortune, brought Boniperti to the Turin club in the 1950s, and Del Pierro in 1993.Neither were big or strong athletes. Both were giants of sporting talent, and of fidelity to La Vecchia Signora, or The Old Lady, as Juventus is affectionately known.One by one, Del Piero struck off the records of Boniperti in the zebra-striped shirt of Juve. Finally, on Saturday, the contemporary captain scored his 179th Serie A goal for the team, surpassing Boni’s 178, which he amassed from 1946 to 1961.“There are no more records to beat,” Del Piero said in answer to the media question on Saturday night. “But I will go on, because one needs to set new objectives.”He spoke, as he always does, of the team rather than himself in isolation. But pressed on his future, given that he turns 36 on Nov. 9, Del Piero answered: “Of course, I dream of scoring in the new Juventus stadium a year from now.“The decision on my contract renewal will be between myself and the club,” he said. “There is one certainty though, and that is I want to carry on playing — with Juventus or abroad. I cannot see myself wearing another shirt in Italy.”That in itself casts Del Piero apart from modern superstars. His goal Saturday, a typically sharp, right-footed rapier thrust, contrasted with the towering header by which Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored Milan’s only riposte.Del Piero had chosen to remain with Juventus when the club was shamed and demoted a division in 2006 after the match-fixing investigation in Italian soccer. Ibrahimovic was one of those who jumped ship rather than step down to Serie B.Del Piero has served just the one team apart from Padova, where he first started out as an apprentice player. Ibrahimovic is a trophy hunter, a butterfly of a modern superstar currently on his sixth career move in the past decade.“I have experienced some difficult time here,” Del Piero admitted, “but I have always been happy and proud of the path I have taken.”His happiness doubtless contrasted with Berlusconi’s mood when he visited the Milan changing room after the setback to the home club’s hope of recapturing the Italian league title.It will have been a greater contrast to Francesco Totti, the idol of Roma, who was sent off for fighting a Lecce opponent who fouled him off the ball Saturday.Totti’s volatility has occasionally cost his great talent dear — and will again, because he now misses next weekend’s Roma-Lazio derby at the Olimpico.To survive Italy’s scandals — and the allegations of doping and match-fixing attached to Juventus — must mean that Del Piero has a tough inner core. To sustain almost two decades as a creator among artisans is a mark of courage that makes him different from the rest.Agnelli dubbed him Il Pinturicchio, comparing his artistry on the field with that of the Renaissance painter Pinturicchio. And Agnelli made him, about a decade ago, the highest-paid individual in the sport at that time.Del Piero these days needs, as on Saturday, other players to be injured or suspended to get a starting role in his team. But he retains an aura of humility. He is a family man noted for his humor and for his support of cancer research.For the record, Boniperti played 444 Serie A matches and scored 178 goals. Del Piero’s full total of 466 Italian league games and 199 goals includes the 20 goals he scored in the one season Juventus played in Serie B. Del Piero’s career total in all games for Juve, including European competitions, is 647 games, 278 goals.Asked again on Sky television where he saw his future, Del Piero responded: “I’ll have to think, maybe tomorrow. I’m fit and I want to play. Bit by bit we’ll see how things go in the coming months.”His past is secure. His future, he says, is open. His place among Italy’s great goal scorers can still rise. He might catch Roberto Baggio’s 205 Serie A goal tally, but the leading all time mark in top Italian soccer, Silvio Piola’s 274 goals, is secure.That said, there is talk of Del Piero’s following the route of David Beckham and Thierry Henry, to an Indian summer in Major League Soccer in the United States.That could be months or years away. For now, Del Piero is savoring a special night in the San Siro and, as captain, he tells his team that such a victory is of value only if the performance is maintained week in, week out.The same applies in Spain. Madrid stays on top, thanks to Ronaldo’s brace of goals at Hercules, where Real came from a goal down to win, 3-1. Barcelona remains second after Messi not only scored a magical goal by outpacing and outwitting four defenders, but also set up David Villa to return to scoring form.Away from FIFA politics, it is still The Beautiful Game.'"
"'10-11-01,'1','In Qatar, officials acknowledged Sunday that one of the packages had been carried on two Qatar Airways passenger planes, apparently having eluded the airline’s cargo screening system. In Britain, officials were embarrassed about how long it took the authorities to identify one of the packages as a carefully concealed bomb.American and Yemeni officials still have little hard evidence about who was involved in the thwarted attack. On Sunday officials in Yemen discovered that Ms. Samawi’s identity had apparently been stolen, and that she was not the same woman who dropped off the packages. Ms. Samawi was released on bail on Sunday, and the authorities in Yemen have thus far arrested no other suspects.It was one more piece of a carefully designed and cleverly disguised plot that investigators believe was conceived by Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen, the group that American officials say might pose the most immediate threat to American soil.In television appearances on Sunday, John O. Brennan, President Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, said that American and British authorities were leaning toward the conclusion that the packages were meant to detonate in midair, en route to their destinations in Chicago. If that turns out to be the case, it would be a rare attack aimed at the air cargo system — one of the foundations of the global economy — rather than the passenger system, which has received the most attention from governments working to avoid a repeat of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.For the most part, governments around the world had bet that it was less likely that the cargo system would be the target of attacks, given that its flights carry few passengers.“It is time for the shipping industry and the business community to accept the reality that more needs to be done to secure cargo planes so that they cannot be turned into a delivery systems for bombs targeting our country,” Representative Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement.Congress in 2007, in legislation proposed by Mr. Markey, mandated that all air cargo be inspected before it is loaded onto passenger planes, setting an August 2010 deadline for the requirement. But as of the deadline, only about 65 percent of the cargo headed to the United States on passenger planes from abroad is inspected — and a far smaller proportion coming to the United States on all-cargo flights is physically checked, as these planes are not subject to the mandate.Even when the cargo is checked, air carriers in certain countries use equipment like X-ray detection devices or a visual check by an airport worker that often cannot identify packages with bombs, because the small amount of explosive material can be carefully hidden inside a routine electronic device, like a computer printer.Interviews in Washington, London and the Middle East reveal how the two bombs made their way through several countries before the tip from Saudi intelligence officials caused them to be pulled from airplanes.The bomb dropped at the U.P.S. office in Sana ended up in East Midlands Airport, near Nottingham, England, by way of Cologne, Germany. A terrorism alert from Washington provoked a search for the package, which was found and kept from being shipped to the United States. But British authorities took more than 20 hours to determine that it contained hidden explosives.Theresa May, the British home secretary, told the BBC that the government would review its security arrangements for handling air cargo entering or passing through Britain in the wake of the printer-bomb plot, but declined to give any details.In Britain, cargo operators are vetted and named “trusted carriers.” Cargo itself is not screened, which some experts said made British airports vulnerable to terrorist exploitation. Ms. May said that any changes would have to take into account economic concerns. “We’re well aware of the economic aspects of air freight transport,” she said.The second package — a bomb hidden inside a Hewlett-Packard desktop printer — was sent out Thursday on a Qatar Airways passenger flight to Doha, the Qatari capital. There it sat for a day, and was then flown 235 miles east to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where it arrived Friday in the local FedEx distribution warehouse.By that time Emirati authorities had received a warning call from Britain about a suspicious package there, and they identified the printer almost immediately, according to an official familiar with the investigation. Investigators removed and dismantled the explosive, which had been placed into the toner cartridge printer so carefully that all the printer’s components appeared to be in place and it might well have passed unnoticed.A cellphone was concealed in the bottom of the printer, and the printer head was designed to detonate the explosives.On Sunday, officials in Qatar said in a statement that “the explosives discovered were of a sophisticated nature whereby they could not be detected by X-ray screening or trained sniffer dogs.”As for who was behind the plot, evidence remains elusive, though officials believe the bombs bear the hallmarks of Al Qaeda in Yemen’s top bomb maker. On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a cable saying that the packages might have been linked to two schools in Yemen. If true, that would suggest that foreign students might have been involved in the plot, as in the attempted bombing of a commercial jetliner in Detroit last Dec. 25 by a Nigerian trained in Yemen.But American and Yemeni investigators are trying to determine whether the schools — listed as the Yemen-American Institute for Language-Computer Management and the American Center for Training and Development — even exist. There is a school in Sana called the Yemen American Language Institute, but it is sponsored by the United States State Department. Its director, Aziz al-Hadi, said in a telephone interview that the school “has never used FedEx or U.P.S.” and did not help foreigners obtain visas. The school does not have a reputation for attracting religiously conservative students, unlike some other language schools in Yemen. There is an American Center for Training and Development in Egypt, but not in Yemen.Ms. Samawi was released partly because the shipping agent for the courier company was brought into her interrogation and told investigators that she was not the person who had signed the shipping manifest, said a Yemeni official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Yemeni authorities have concluded that the plotters deliberately used Ms. Samawi’s name, address and telephone number to make the shipment look legitimate. Ms. Samawi’s mother was detained Saturday as well, but family friends said that was only because she insisted on accompanying her daughter.“She is a very open-minded person; we cannot believe these accusations at all,” said Siham Ahmad Haza, 24, who described herself as a close friend of Ms. Samawi’s, and a fellow student of computer engineering at Sana University. “She listens to music a lot, especially Western music. She loves foreigners, she’s a balanced person.”Ms. Samawi has two younger sisters, and her father works as an engineer in the Ministry of Agriculture and Water, according to family friends. The family lives in Shamlaan, on the outskirts of Sana.About 100 students protested at Sana University on Sunday, chanting “Freedom, freedom for Hanan!”'"

"'10-11-02,'1','Opening arguments began Monday in Austin in the trial of Tom DeLay, the former House majority leader, on state charges of money laundering, as prosecutors told a jury that Mr. DeLay had taken part in an illegal scheme to route $190,000 in corporate money to Republican candidates. A defense lawyer countered that none of the money was given directly to Texas politicians and asserted that Mr. DeLay was guilty only of being a better politician than his Democratic opponents. The contributions helped Republicans take over the Texas House in 2002, paving the way for the passage of a redistricting plan — designed by Mr. DeLay — that gave Republicans more control over the state’s Congressional delegation. In her opening statement, the prosecutor, Beverly Mathews, said: “There is nothing wrong with Republicans trying to dominate the political world. But the means to achieve that gain must be lawful.”'"

"'10-11-02,'1','American Media, the publisher that titillates the mind with tabloids like National Enquirer and firms the body with magazines like Men’s Fitness, announced on Monday plans to restructure through what it said it expected would be a quick and painless bankruptcy.Struggling under a debt burden seven times greater than its equity, American Media said it had decided after years of trying to avoid bankruptcy that its only viable path to stability was through the courts.The company, based in Manhattan, said it intended to continue business as usual while the restructuring unfolded, and did not expect any significant disruptions.“During this period, there should be no impact to our employees, vendors or advertisers,” American Media’s chief executive, David J. Pecker, said in a statement.“The reorganization should not affect American Media’s operations. Publications will function seamlessly, staff will be unaffected by the reorganization and customers should not notice any difference during the 60-day process.”The company is expected to file in the next two weeks, Mr. Pecker said.Such prepackaged bankruptcies typically allow companies to restructure in a relatively short time. Unlike many other bankruptcies, which can play out for months and sometimes years while a company and its lenders squabble over agreements to pay financial obligations, creditors and debtors have a working agreement before a prepackaged bankruptcy.'"
"'10-11-02,'1','Officials at the Transportation Security Administration declined Monday to discuss what new steps might be imposed. But aides on Capitol Hill said they expected the Obama administration to demand physical inspection of certain “high risk” cargo carried on all-cargo flights, particularly shipments coming from nations where terror groups are known to operate, like Yemen.The administration is also considering demanding more notice about the contents on cargo flights bound for the United States, so officials can perhaps intervene to request additional screening before a flight takes off. The current requirement for cargo manifests is four hours before the flight is scheduled to arrive.Experts say air cargo poses unique dilemmas because of the vast volume of packages and the patchwork system of regulations governing inspections. In addition, air cargo moves both on airlines that carry only freight and on passenger planes. And the freight industry is by no means uniform. There are giant players like FedEx and U.P.S. and hundreds of small companies.For now, freight carried on all-cargo planes does not have as stringent screening requirements as freight on passenger planes. Also, foreign carriers that bring cargo into the United States operate by their own sets of rules, which vary significantly from country to country.“The issue is you don’t have a seamless set of standards that apply globally from end to end in the global network with the same level of sensitivity,” said Robert W. Mann Jr., an aviation industry expert in Port Washington, N.Y.Still, T.S.A. officials emphasized Monday that even with the latest incident, air cargo security has improved in recent years, as demanded by Congress, particularly on domestic passenger flights, where cargo is now always inspected for threats before it is loaded.“We have taken significant steps to strengthen the security of international air cargo,” John S. Pistole, the T.S.A. administrator, said in a statement. “T.S.A. will continue to evolve our security procedures.”Every day, 20 million pounds of cargo, or 16 percent of the total freight carried by air into or out of the United States, are transported by passenger planes, according to the International Air Cargo Association. The vast majority, or 84 percent, is carried on cargo planes.“Screening all these packages is not as easy as screening passengers — it’s a much more difficult thing to do and do effectively,” said Edmund S. Greenslet, the publisher of The Airline Monitor, an industry trade publication. “It’s the weak link in the whole airline system.”The air cargo system is built into the way many companies do business. Medtronic, the world’s biggest producer of medical devices, for example, built a distribution center near a FedEx hub in Memphis to send out thousands of devices like spinal implants and heart pacemakers daily to hospitals worldwide.The way cargo is packed also makes it difficult to inspect. For example, many containers of goods headed to the United States arrive at airports shrink-wrapped and are given an exemption from the inspection requirement, said Stephen M. Lord, director of homeland security and justice at the Government Accountability Office.And American transportation security officials do not do enough to ensure that the inspections that foreign governments or air carriers conduct are rigorous enough to find explosive material about to be loaded onto passenger flights, Mr. Lord said.“They still have work to do to meet the existing mandate,” he said. “And that means there is a remaining vulnerability on air cargo.”Several European countries said Monday that they would suspend all cargo shipments from Yemen, with Britain also restricting shipments from Somalia. Germany halted all Yemeni passenger flights as well.Theresa May, the British home secretary, said the government would work with the aviation industry and with the manufacturers of airport screening equipment “to devise a sustainable, proportionate, long-term security regime” that would meet the new terrorist threat to air cargo shipments.Britain also said air passengers would not be permitted to carry on ink cartridges weighing about a pound, the size of those used in the plot. Both bans are to be in place, at first, for a month.Union officials representing pilots who fly cargo planes said the security of those planes needed to be improved.“We believe that current standards in air cargo screening are inadequate,” said Brian Gaudet, a spokesman for the International Pilots Association.Devices exist that would allow cargo companies to scan for explosives every container about to be loaded into the hold of an airplane, even without unloading the containers. But a single one of these machines — which use a technology known as pulsed fast neutron analysis — can cost more than $10 million, and five to 10 minutes are needed to check each shipment, industry officials said, a crippling cost given the thousands of different departure points globally for cargo.There are simpler options — bomb-sniffing dogs or small hand-held devices that can pick up traces of explosives.During the height of the international drug trade years ago, cargo shippers developed security algorithms to better identity suspect packages sent by occasional customers or individuals, said Mr. Sheffi, from M.I.T.Such algorithms use factors like a package’s origin, its destination and the cost of a shipment relative to the value of the object shipped, he said. Mr. Sheffi said he thought similar methods were being used today with packages that might have been sent by terrorist groups.Brian Clancy, a managing director at Logistics Capital and Strategy, a financial and strategic advisory firm based in Arlington, Va., said: “No system is ever going to be perfect, and the tricky part is knowing what to look for.”'"
"'10-11-02,'1','The widely expected prospect of a Republican takeover of the House of Representatives and possibly the Senate would be warmly welcomed by the banks, who want a break from the regulatory push of the last two years. Divided government makes it harder to pass new legislation and brings with it other benefits for the banks, like reducing the chances of an increase in corporate taxes.“At this juncture, gridlock is good,” said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association. “It’s time we take a breather from all the excess of regulation and Congressional legislation. Our members and customers are ready for common sense to reappear.”A Republican victory would also shift control of the oversight and appropriations process in Congress, and lobbyists are hoping that means less money for agencies like the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. to hire staff and aggressively enforce the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform bill passed this summer.While that bill is already law and a rollback would be tough, other attempts at an end-run around it are likely, especially if the Senate also switches hands. In that case, Republicans could block appointees the industry considered hostile at the Treasury, as well as at the S.E.C. and C.F.T.C. Nominees for two of the five commissioner’s seats at the S.E.C. will require approval by the Senate during the next session, while the term of one commissioner at the five-member C.F.T.C. expires.In addition, analysts and lobbyists say a Republican-controlled Congress may be less likely to investigate industry practices or hold oversight hearings that may embarrass the industry.While that won’t affect hearings like ones set for later this month in the Senate that will examine the foreclosure mess, it makes them much less likely in the next Congress. “It changes the tone in Washington,” one industry lobbyist said. “If a regulator knows they’re going to get yelled at on Capitol Hill, that influences their decisions.”Federal policy is likely to loom larger as the foreclosure crisis goes on — the majority of those foreclosed homes are owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises that dominate the mortgage market and are now controlled by the Treasury. What is more, some Democrats who have called for a moratorium on foreclosures, like Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat who is the Senate majority leader, are facing tough re-election fights and their exit could be a boon for the banking industry.Indeed, campaign donations from the financial industry in recent months have heavily favored the Republicans. In September, 71 percent of campaign donations went to Republicans, compared with 44 percent a year ago, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group.“It’s a dramatic shift and there’s little irony that it coincided with Democratic-led financial reform,” said Dave Levinthal, communications director for the Center for Responsive Politics. “The industry wasn’t at all thrilled with this legislation and since Democrats were driving it, they had an incentive to put their money with the party that might give them a more favorable shake in coming years.”A shift in party control could also alter the rhetoric coming out of the capital. On Wall Street, there is a feeling among many executives that the White House has demonized the big banks — and that complaint surfaced repeatedly at the Financial Services Forum event, as well as at one-on-one meetings in the last two months, according to several participants.Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and Lloyd C. Blankfein, head of Goldman Sachs, spoke the most, said one participant, although other top chief executives were present, including Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America, Oswald J. Grübel of the Swiss bank UBS and Abigail Johnson of the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments.There are lighter moments during the meetings, as well. At a Washington get-together earlier this year, Mr. Dimon teased Mr. Blankfein, repeating the latter’s famous remark that he “was doing God’s work.” A jovial Mr. Blankfein responded, “I’ll be the judge of that.”Mr. Dimon and Mr. Blankfein aren’t the only executives to occasionally lighten the mood. Before Mr. Geithner addressed the Financial Services Forum last month, the chief executive of the American International Group, Robert H. Benmosche, joked that he had nothing to say. “I’m just going to sit back and listen to my largest shareholder,” he said, a reference to the 79.9 percent stake the government holds in A.I.G. after its bailout by Washington. .While top government officials may occasionally come to them for group sessions like the Financial Services Forum, executives have also spent plenty of time recently calling on them individually at their offices.Unlike some other bank chiefs who left after the Financial Services Forum meeting wrapped up, Mr. Dimon stayed in Washington, meeting privately Oct. 8 with Elizabeth Warren, who was appointed in September to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They discussed eliminating the fine print from credit card offers and streamlining mortgage disclosures so consumers would have a better idea of the exact terms of their loans.A month earlier on Sept. 15, Mr. Dimon met privately with Mr. Bernanke at the Federal Reserve, as did Mr. Moynihan, who sat down on Sept. 3 for a 30-minute meeting to discuss the economy.More recently, on Oct. 13 and Oct. 14, the president of Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, met with officials at the C.F.T.C. to go over the rulemaking process, touching on subjects like reporting requirements for trades as well as limits on trading.“The intersection of Washington and the financial services sector has never been as important as it is now,” said Rob Nichols, president of the Financial Services Forum. “It’s critical to have a seat at the table and participate in a dialogue.”'"
"'10-11-02,'1','Five years after NASA set off interplanetary fireworks by slamming an 800-pound bullet into a comet, the same spacecraft that fired that bullet will be visiting a second comet on Thursday, this time without the collision.Traveling 27,000 miles per hour, the spacecraft, left over from the Deep Impact mission, will come within 435 miles of Comet Hartley 2 on Thursday at 9:50 a.m. Eastern time. Hartley 2 will be only the fifth comet to be photographed close up, and the event will make the spacecraft the first to have visited two comets.“This is going to give us the most extensive observation of a comet to date,” said Timothy W. Larson, the project manager for the mission.The primary mission of Deep Impact, launched in January 2005, was to visit Comet Tempel 1. As the spacecraft neared, it separated into two pieces — the main spacecraft, about the size of a subcompact car, and the 800-pound impactor, which crashed into the comet on July 4, 2005. From a spray of ice and dust gouged from the comet, scientists were able to identify some of the minerals beneath its surface.Comets are of particular interest to planetary scientists because they contain almost pristine ingredients from the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago.'"
"'10-11-02,'1','“It looks like we don’t have a treatment yet that really prevents recurrence,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. John Curry, a psychologist in the psychiatry department at the Duke University School of Medicine. “And we don’t have much of an indicator while the person is in treatment of how protected they’re going to be against recurrence.”The researchers also expected that youths who improved almost fully during the 12 weeks would have less chance of recurrence. They did not, although those showing no improvement at all at 12 weeks were more prone to another depression after recovery than those who showed at least some progress during the 12 weeks. Teenagers who also suffered from anxiety were more likely to become depressed again.“It’s a very important study,” said Dr. Aradhana Bela Sood, medical director of the Virginia Treatment Center for Children, who was not involved in the research. “As you counsel families, you can say there’s a 50 percent chance that this is going to recur,” and “now that we know that being female and having anxiety predisposes them, it’s certainly going to make me focus on the population who has this profile.”Dr. Curry said that while girls are known to be more prone to initial depression, it was unclear why 57 percent of girls who recovered became depressed again, compared with 33 percent of boys. “Maybe it has to do with something in girls around the particular age that this is going on, stressful life events or the way people cope with stress,” he said.Dr. Sood said that it might be related to hormonal changes or that “women tend to brood more, so the slightest stress is multiplied many times.”Dr. David Brent, a psychiatry professor at University of Pittsburgh’s medical school, who was not involved in the research, wondered whether more girls experienced a “more pure type of depression than you see in boys,” he said. “Maybe more boys get into trouble and feel sad, but when trouble goes away they feel better.""Most who got depressed again had only one episode in five years, but a few had two or three. The adolescent’s age made no difference.Dr. Curry said one limitation to the study was that researchers did not look at specific events in the youths’ lives to see if some encountered more stress than others. His team plans to examine whether those who received therapy or drug treatment over the five years were more or less prone to another depression.“We don’t know if the disorder is recurrent because it’s recurrent or because something happens to you after the first episode that makes you more vulnerable to another one,” Dr. Brent said. The study “points up the need for some kind of aftercare to prevent recurrence,” he said, and “highlights that what we’re doing now is not good enough.”'"
"'10-11-02,'1','Satie called his three-part “Socrate” a symphonic drama. The music is neither symphonic nor dramatic but a sparsely orchestrated, cantata-like setting of three excerpts from Plato’s dialogues. It received a rare outing on Sunday afternoon at Zankel Hall, with James Levine conducting the Met Chamber Ensemble.Devoid of the satire and wit often associated with Satie, “Socrate” (1918) features simple, repetitive rhythms and a transparent orchestral accompaniment for the graceful vocal lines, which are often delivered in a detached, recitative manner. Satie called the work a “return to classical simplicity with a modern sensibility.”The music barely hints at the drama of Plato’s texts, which are sung in French. The first movement, “Portrait of Socrates,” comes from “The Symposium”; the second, “The Banks of the Ilissus,” is from “Phaedrus”; and the third, “Death of Socrates,” is from “Phaedo.”The vocal soloists were excellent: the mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford and the sopranos Emalie Savoy, Susanna Phillips and Erin Morley. As Phaedo, Ms. Morley was particularly distinctive in the long monologue about Socrates’ death; she sang with poise and a silvery tone, the understated orchestral music and lilting vocal lines reflecting Socrates’ calm and dignity.Ms. Morley was also heard to fine effect in Webern’s Four Songs (Op. 12), which opened the program, sensitively accompanied by Ken Noda.The whirlwind of Pierre Boulez’s visceral “Sur Incises,” which concluded the evening, offered a vivid contrast to the mildly soporific “Socrate.” Completed in 1998, the work is based on “Incises,” a short virtuoso piano work Mr. Boulez had composed as a competition piece, and scored for an unusual lineup of three harpists, three pianists and three percussionists.'"
"'10-11-02,'1','BANGKOK — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited a former Khmer Rouge torture house in Cambodia on Monday and urged the nation to proceed with trials of the former regime’s surviving leaders in order to “confront its past.”On a visit to Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh, during a seven-country tour through Asia that has already taken her to Vietnam and China, Mrs. Clinton called for the strengthening of democratic institutions and for greater tolerance of opposition views.“It’s a very disturbing experience,” she said after a visit to Cambodia’s Tuol Sleng prison, where more than 14,000 people were held before being sent to their deaths in a killing field. “And the pictures — both the pictures of the young Cambodians who were killed and the young Cambodians who were doing the killing — were so painful.”The commandant of that prison, Kaing Guek Eav, was sentenced to 19 years in prison last July in the first part of a United Nations-backed trial of leading figures of the Khmer Rouge regime, which was responsible for the deaths of 1.7 million people between 1975 and 1979.A second trial involving the four most senior surviving leaders has been expected to follow, after they were formally indicted in September. But Prime Minister Hun Sen, who once said that Cambodia should “dig a hole and bury the past,” has said that he would not allow any additional prosecutions beyond those four.Mrs. Clinton repeated an argument that has been used by proponents of the trials, saying that “a country that is able to confront its past is a country that can overcome it.”'"
"'10-11-02,'1','By many measures, labor unions have been the Republicans’ fiercest, biggest-spending opponents in this year’s campaign, laying out more than $200 million in hopes of safeguarding the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate.So it should be no surprise that Republicans, who appear to stand a good chance of winning control of the House, are signaling that they plan to push bills and strategies to undermine labor’s political clout and its ability to grow.“Republicans are likely to pursue a version of what Samuel Gompers often said: ‘Reward your friends and punish your enemies,’ ” said Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown.One bill that is popular among Republicans would prohibit employers from ever agreeing to unionization through “card check,” a process often used today in which an employer recognizes a union as soon as a majority of workers sign pro-union cards — without holding a secret-ballot election. Another bill would severely crimp labor’s campaign spending by barring unions from using any portion of a union member’s dues for political purposes unless the member first gives written permission.A Republican-led House or Senate is expected to be more eager than a Democratic-controlled one to approve free trade agreements that unions oppose, and to be more reluctant to enact stimulus plans that unions have supported, like the recent bill that gave states $26 billion to help save the jobs of teachers, police officers and other government employees. A Republican-controlled House or Senate would probably block a labor-backed bill that would give firefighters and police officers in every state the right to unionize.“We fear that the Republicans are on the march, and that’s why we’re doing everything we can to stop them,” said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which is spending $91 million in the two-year campaign cycle.Mr. McEntee praised the $26 billion jobs bill. “That saved literally thousands of public-sector jobs,” he said. “I don’t think we’ll see something like that passed under John Boehner,” the Ohio Republican who is expected to become speaker if the Republicans win control of the house.All this means that Republicans may well go on the offensive against labor, after two years in which unions have been on the offensive. Labor leaders have pressed their Democratic allies, unsuccessfully so far, to muster the 60 votes needed in the Senate to advance card-check legislation. Many Republican and business leaders say the card-check process is unfair because union organizers often pressure workers to sign the cards, an assertion that the unions deny.“Most certainly, the issue of card check will be dead,” said Doug Heye, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. “That will be a victory for businesses large and small.”Mr. Heye said that many Republicans were likely to support legislation that would bar unions from spending members’ dues on politics unless members first “opted in.” Under current law, unions can spend a member’s dues on politics unless the member first opts out, a little-known procedure few workers follow.Mr. Heye said that when he visited campaigns around the country, union members who personally back Republicans had often complained that their unions were spending money to elect Democrats.Union leaders vigorously oppose the opt-in idea. “Obviously, this would further tilt the tables in favor of corporations in our political campaigns,” said Bill Samuel, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s legislative director. “Let’s hope the Republicans focus on putting people back to work, instead of taking away workers’ rights.”If the Republicans win control of the House, Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican, is expected to succeed George Miller, a California Democrat, as chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee.“One of the greatest threats to job creation is economic uncertainty,” Mr. Kline said in an e-mail after being asked about his plans should he become chairman. “The solution is to take economic threats — like tax hikes and card check — off the table and make the laws governing our workplaces more understandable, workable and effective for workers and employers.”Mr. Kline is chief sponsor of the Secret Ballot Protection Act, a bill with 115 House co-sponsors that would bar employers from agreeing to unionization through card check. He has also criticized two policies that are favorites of construction unions: the Davis-Bacon Act, which requires that contractors on federal public works projects pay workers the prevailing wage, usually near the union wage, even if they are not unionized; and project labor agreements, which tend to tilt the awarding of federally financed construction projects toward unionized contractors.Professor McCartin said, “I suspect the Republicans will target these policies by trying to make the case that they waste taxpayer money by promoting higher wages on projects that taxpayers pay for.”Ronald E. Meisburg, a Republican and former general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, predicted that if a Republican-controlled House cripples labor-backed legislative efforts to make it easier for workers to unionize, the Democratic-controlled labor board might take administrative steps. Mr. Meisburg noted that one Democratic labor-board member recently proposed making a change in the timing of workplace elections after employees file a petition to hold a unionization vote, reducing the delay to just five or 10 days.Unions want an accelerated schedule because they say employers have too much time to ply workers with antiunion propaganda, but employers complain that such quick elections deny them an adequate opportunity to campaign against unionizing.“We’re concerned that the N.L.R.B. will do exactly that,” said Randel Johnson, senior vice president for labor matters at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “It would be unfair to hold elections before employers have a chance to state their case.”Mr. Samuel predicted that labor could stop any Republican legislative offensive. “When Republicans won control of the House in 1994, they tried to roll back 60 years of labor protections for workers, but we fought them to a stalemate,” he said. “If the Republicans attempt that again, I think this story will repeat itself.”'"
"'10-11-02,'1','The Dow Jones industrial average gained 6.13 points to 11,124.62. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added 1.12 points to 1,184.38, while the Nasdaq composite index declined 2.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,504.84.On Wednesday the Fed is expected to announce a new round of bond purchases to help stimulate the American economy.The Fed’s F.O.M.C., or Federal Open Market Committee, meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected to announce a program to buy Treasury securities, and perhaps other investments, to pump more money into the financial system. Estimates as to the size of the purchases have ranged from $500 billion to $2 trillion.Many analysts expect the purchases to be mostly of two- and 10-year Treasuries, although Goldman Sachs predicted last week that the Fed might include 30-year bonds in its program.The Fed is hoping to provide further stimulus to the economy during a period of extremely low inflation and nearly double-digit unemployment. Investors are also hoping the generally upbeat third-quarter corporate earnings will translate into a rise in hiring, and then the hoped-for increase in consumer spending.While there has been some improvement in manufacturing and business confidence, Jason D. Pride, the director of investment strategy at Glenmede, noted that there was still a “missing link” between the corporate profits and their translation into jobs.Stanley A. Nabi, chief strategist for the Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said that third-quarter corporate earnings had been “far more solid than had been expected” and that the outlook for the next few quarters looked generally upbeat. News about a troubled bond insurance company, the Ambac Financial Group, was among issues “casting a shadow on the markets,” said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.Ambac said in a filing on Monday that it was in talks with creditors about a bankruptcy plan.The company, which said it had $1.6 billion in debt as of June 30, said it was in talks about filing a prepackaged bankruptcy, a speedier route that has the backing of a majority of creditors, by the end of the year.In the United States, manufacturing activity came in better than expected for October. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 56.9 points last month, from 54.4 in September, exceeding the forecasts of economists, who had expected a decline in activity to 54. New orders rose to 58.9, from 51.1 in September, reversing three months of declines.The employment component of the index rose to 57.7 points from 56.5 in September.While the numbers are a bright spot for the manufacturing sector, economists noted that there were still substantial challenges ahead for consumers struggling under debt and uncertainty in the jobs market.“Much will depend on the consumer, and we feel that the headwinds for consumer spending remain too brisk to expect substantial help on this front over the near to medium term,” Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, said in a research note.The Commerce Department also reported Monday that construction spending in Septemberrose to $801.7 billion, a seasonally adjusted, annualized figure that was above the revised August estimate of $797.5 billion. Spending on private construction in September was flat, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $482 billion, about the same as in August.Interest rates were up slightly. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 7/32, to 100 and the interest rate rose to 2.62 percent, from 2.60 percent late Friday.'"
"'10-11-02,'1','Middle-aged smokers are far more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia later in life, and heavy smokers — those who go through more than two packs a day — are at more than double the risk, a new study reports.Researchers analyzed the data of 23,123 health plan members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, when they were 50 to 60 years old.Twenty-three years later, about one-quarter of the group, or 5,367, had dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer’s disease and 416 with vascular dementia.After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37 percent more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up sharply with increased smoking; 44 percent for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more than two packs.Former smokers and those who smoked less than half a pack a day were no more likely to develop dementia than nonsmokers. The study was published online on Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine.To its lead author, Dr. Rachel A. Whitmer, an epidemiologist with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research in Oakland, Calif., the study offered a silver lining: unlike age and family history, she said, “this is one risk factor for dementia that can be changed.”'"

"'10-11-03,'1','Though the Iowa election was the most prominent, similar ouster campaigns were begun in other states against state supreme court justices running unopposed in retention elections — judges whose rulings on matters involving abortion, taxes, tort reform and health care had upset conservatives.Together they marked the rapid politicization of judicial races that had been specifically designed to be free of intrigue. Over the last decade, just $2 million was spent on advertising in retention elections, less than 1 percent of total campaign spending on judicial elections in that period, according to data compiled in a recent report released in part by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. More than $3 million was spent on retention election races this year, easily eclipsing the figure for the previous decade, according to the Brennan Center.The defeat was a bitter disappointment to much of the legal community here, which rallied behind the three justices, arguing that judicial standards require judges to follow their interpretation of the law and not their reading of public opinion. They had urged voters to consider issues like competence and temperament rather than a single issue when casting ballots.The three justices — Marsha K. Ternus, the chief justice; Michael J. Streit; and David L. Baker — did not raise money to campaign and only toward the end of the election did they make public appearances to defend themselves.“We wish to thank all of the Iowans who voted to retain us for another term,” the judges said in a statement. “Your support shows that many Iowans value fair and impartial courts. We also want to acknowledge and thank all the Iowans, from across the political spectrum and from different walks of life, who worked tirelessly over the past few months to defend Iowa’s high-caliber court system against an unprecedented attack by out-of-state special interest groups.“Finally, we hope Iowans will continue to support Iowa’s merit selection system for appointing judges. This system helps ensure that judges base their decisions on the law and the Constitution and nothing else. Ultimately, however, the preservation of our state’s fair and impartial courts will require more than the integrity and fortitude of individual judges, it will require the steadfast support of the people.”Though several groups formed to support their retention, they were significantly outspent by the organizations that bankrolled the ouster effort, including the National Organization for Marriage and the American Family Association.“We’re concerned about the precedent this has set tonight and what it means for the influence of money and politics on the judicial system,” said Dan Moore, co-chair of Fair Courts for Us, which supported the judges.The judicial races were perhaps the most hotly anticipated item on the ballot this year, a sharp contrast from years past in which the election were so low profile that more than a third of those who cast ballots left the section blank. “That’s the main reason I came out,” said Michelle Kramer, 36, a college student from Des Moines. “People can do what they want to do, they can love who they want to love.”Her friend and neighbor Cathy Hackett, 38, took the opposite view. “I voted no for every single one of them,” said Ms. Hackett, a customer sales representative who described herself as a conservative Christian. “I’m not anti-gay. I love everybody. But I believe that if two people are going to marry they should be a man and a woman.”The outcome will have no effect on the ruling that triggered the campaign, a 7-to-0 decision that found that a law defining marriage as between a man and a woman represented unlawful discrimination under the state constitution.But those who led the ouster campaign said they were more focused on highlighting to judges elsewhere, including those on the United States Supreme Court, the risks associated with leapfrogging public opinion on the issue of same-sex marriage. They noted that same-sex marriage has been initially approved by supreme courts in four states and by legislators in only three.Jeff Mullen, lead pastor at the Point of Grace Church, who helped organize religious leaders in opposition to the judges, said the vote should send a message to judges nationwide. “They weren’t supposed to legislate from the bench,” he said. “They did. They’re out of a job.”Depending on the speed with which new candidates are nominated, the replacement justices could be appointed either by Gov. Chet Culver, a democrat who lost re-election on Tuesday, or Terry Branstad, a Republican who previously served as governor. Each appointed one of the departing justices to the Supreme Court, and Mr. Branstad appointed Ms. Ternus to a lower court. Mr. Branstad has called for changing the selection system.'"

"'10-11-03,'1','New Orleans is finally rebounding from much of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina. But five years later, a big problem remains: blighted neighborhoods. To attract a vibrant middle class, these neighborhoods need to be repaired and restored, or, at the very least, stabilized. Residents who have been unable to rebuild because storm relief grants were too small or unfairly calculated need more help from the city and state.The problem is detailed in a new report issued by the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center, a nonpartisan research group. It says the city has 53,000 abandoned addresses — former homes and apartments — and is, by some measures, the most blighted city in the country.This presents a huge challenge, especially in mainly minority neighborhoods where most of the blight is found. In the current real estate market, it will be difficult to sell vacant properties. At the same time, the city should resist the temptation to sell properties to bargain-hunting speculators, who would likely sit on them, possibly for years.A better strategy would be to get properties into the hands of local residents who have already restored their own homes and who have a vested interest in quickly improving weed-filled lots next door. The city and state should also work closely with local nonprofit groups that have already contributed enormously to the rebuilding by fixing up many abandoned homes.There are 10,000 mainly minority homeowners who have yet to repair their homes, even though they were given grants under the $8.65 billion Road Home program. A lower court found a likely prima facie case of discrimination, asserting that black homeowners had “received lower awards than they would have if their homes were in predominantly white neighborhoods.” A federal appeals court will hear the case sometime next year. In the interest of rebuilding New Orleans, and justice, the state must find a way to help these people now.'"
"'10-11-03,'1','Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of management and organization at University of California, Berkeley, said that Mr. Ellison was using the trial to sully the image of his rivals. She likened his attacks to a negative campaign advertisement, calling them nasty but memorable in the minds of potential customers.“He’s killing two birds with one stone,” Ms. Pozner said.Geoffrey Howard, a Bingham McCutchen lawyer representing Oracle, told Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton, an eight-person jury and a packed courtroom that SAP executives had been well aware of the theft carried out against his client, and that, in fact, they had encouraged it. He painted a picture of a company so fearful of Oracle’s growing power that it chose to purloin its software in an effort to steal its customers.“The scope is vast,” Mr. Howard said. He also quoted from a 2005 e-mail written by Mr. Apotheker that said, “We need to inflict some pain on Oracle.”SAP’s lawyer, Robert A. Mittelstaedt of Jones Day, was contrite about the copyright infringement, telling the jury that SAP admits “that it did something wrong.” But he minimized its scope by saying that other than some lost profits and lost customers, Oracle suffered little damage.“They want a windfall,” Mr. Mittelstaedt said. “They want a bonanza that is all out of proportion to the harm.”The theft stems from SAP’s acquisition in 2005 of TomorrowNow, a company that provided technical support to some of Oracle’s customers. TomorrowNow routinely downloaded copies of Oracle’s software and maintenance manuals onto its computers and distributed some of those copies to clients — all without paying Oracle.One of the biggest questions about the trial is whether Mr. Apotheker will testify in person. Oracle’s lawyer was vague on the matter, leaving the door open to his appearing in a video deposition.Mr. Ellison has suggested that Mr. Apotheker, who started work at H.P. on Monday, is trying to dodge an appearance by staying outside the country. H.P. declined to comment on Mr. Apotheker’s whereabouts.Ray Lane, H.P.’s chairman, defended Mr. Apotheker’s integrity in a statement last week. He emphasized that Mr. Apotheker had known little about the infringement, and he called Mr. Ellison’s criticism merely an effort to harass Mr. Apotheker and “interfere with his duties.”At the trial, each side produced e-mails and internal documents that shed an unflattering light on the other.Oracle’s lawyer showed an e-mail in which an SAP executive had warned Shai Agassi, then SAP’s president, of the potential copyright liability of acquiring TomorrowNow. John Ritchie, a TomorrowNow employee, offered another blow in a video deposition by saying that his superior had ignored his concerns about copyright infringement and went so far as to tell him never to write anything down.SAP’s lawyer countered with e-mails in which Juan Jones, an Oracle employee, had referred to Toyota, an Oracle customer, with an expletive and boasted of refusing it a lower price on software. The lawyer said the contents had showed that Oracle’s poor service led to some customer defections and that SAP should not be held liable for those.Indeed, Oracle claimed that SAP had been trying to steal thousands of customers it provided support to, pointing to an internal SAP presentation. But SAP responded that despite its rosy projections, the company lured only 358 of Oracle’s 9,000 or 10,000 support business customers, and that many of them would have left anyway.'"
"'10-11-03,'1','Cotton inventories had been low because of weak demand during the recession. This summer, new cotton crops were also depleted because of flooding in Pakistan and bad weather in China and India, all major cotton producers.But demand from China, in particular, was rising. And as the economic recovery in the United States began, apparel makers and retailers placed orders for more inventory, spurring even more demand. As prices rose, speculators entered the market, driving prices even higher.“So far, it has shocked even the most veteran traders,” said Mike Stevens, an independent cotton analyst in Mandeville, La., in an e-mail. “It has resulted in panic buying by mills worldwide in order to ensure that they can keep their doors open.”As of Tuesday morning, the price of cotton (measured by cotton futures for December delivery) had hit a record high on worries that cold weather in China might have damaged some crops.Cotton’s swooping increase has some apparel companies switching production to countries with lower labor costs or milder customs charges. Lululemon Athletica, the sportswear company, is moving some manufacturing from China to Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh, where wages are lower, and Bon-Ton is benefiting from reduced-duty production in Egypt and Nicaragua.Manufacturers are also thinking smaller, examining whether a button or a thread can be replaced with a cheaper one, or whether the overall material mix can be changed so it is not so cotton heavy.“They are taking purchase orders from the retailer and having this conversation with them, saying, ‘Look, I can’t deliver this garment for a dollar this year when it cost me a dollar twenty-five to make it up,’ ” said Andrew Tananbaum, the chief executive of Capital Business Credit, which finances apparel makers and other importers. “ ‘So would you take this garment if it had not cotton but acrylic?’ ”Mr. Card, of the Jones Group, said the company had “whole teams” looking for more cost-effective materials that did not reduce quality. “That’s all they do,” Mr. Card said.Liz Claiborne, which makes brands like Juicy Couture and Kate Spade, said it is also playing with some of the materials it uses. One example, said Jane Randel, a spokeswoman, would be shifting from some imported Italian fabrics to “suppliers who produce their own raw materials or yarns.” The company may also reassess its contracts for so-called component materials — like buttons and trims — she said in an e-mail.At Bon-Ton, retail prices for the private-label clothes have increased about 5 to 8 percent so far this year, said Steve Villa, senior vice president of private brand at the company. Bon-Ton has been turning to different formulations, including sweaters blended with different rayons and synthetic fibers, to avoid further increases.“At some point, you adopt a different process that maybe will yield some cost savings or you are faced with passing that through,” Mr. Villa said.Of course, as apparel makers increase the price of cotton goods and also try to reduce their reliance on cotton, there are some risks.For starters, neither the apparel makers nor the retailers are certain that shoppers will be willing to pay more for cotton goods. “It’s an unanswered question at this point,” said Robert K. Shearer, chief financial officer of the V. F. Corporation.And — to the disfavor of many fashion purists — with prices unlikely to fall for some time, there could be wider popular acceptance of fabrics like polyester.“We may be training a new generation to be far more accepting of synthetic fibers, which is likely to hurt cotton’s market share in the long run,” said Ms. Johnson, the analyst with the First Capital Group.'"
"'10-11-03,'1','NYSE Euronext said that its third-quarter profit rose 2 percent as it benefited from a drop in taxes, which more than offset a slight slowdown in revenue.Revenue slipped 4 percent, but still beat forecasts. The drop in revenue was tied to a decline in pricing that exchanges have dealt with in recent years. Newer exchange operators have entered the market, forcing companies like NYSE Euronext to cut the price it charges to execute stock and derivative trades.NYSE Euronext — which operates the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Euronext in Paris among others — also grappled with declining market share because of the new competitors.However, the portion of trades NYSE Euronext completed rose during the third quarter compared with a year ago. Nasdaq OMX Group also announced a modest improvement in market share when it announced results last week.NYSE Euronext, like other exchanges, was also hurt by a slowdown in overall trading volume in the United States stock market during the summer. Volumes were especially light, even factoring in the seasonal slowdown. Cash market trading in the United States fell 22 percent during the third quarter.But the company’s profit still rose as a result of a smaller provision for tax payments during the quarter. NYSE Euronext earned $128 million, or 49 cents a share, during the third quarter, compared with net income of $125 million, or 48 cents a share, during the same quarter last year.Revenue after transaction-based expenses fell to $599 million, from $621 million during the same quarter last year.'"
"'10-11-03,'1','Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, reported disappointing sales on Tuesday, hurt by generic competition for its Lipitor cholesterol fighter and Effexor XR depression drug as well as weak revenue in emerging markets.Pfizer, the last large American drug maker to report third-quarter earnings, followed the example of most rivals with a higher-than-expected profit — largely from cost cuts — but disappointing sales as patents on some of its top-selling products face expiration.“Generic competition is causing pain, and this is just a taste of what Pfizer will be going through in the next few years,” Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar, said.Global sales of Lipitor, world’s top-selling medicine, dropped 11 percent to $2.53 billion in the quarter. The arrival in recent months of generics in Canada and Spain hurt Lipitor.A bigger threat to Pfizer will come next November, when Lipitor loses marketing exclusivity in the United States. Pfizer bought Wyeth last year for $67 billion, aiming to replace vanishing Lipitor revenue with the rival’s brands.But Effexor XR, a Wyeth antidepressant that once had annual sales of $3 billion, was battered by cheaper American generic versions released over the summer. Effexor XR sales plunged to $175 million in the third quarter. Pfizer’s earnings fell to $866 million, or 11 cents a share, from $2.88 billion, or 43 cents, a year earlier. Excluding merger costs and other special items, Pfizer, which is based in New York, earned 54 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 51 cents, Thomson Reuters said.'"
"'10-11-03,'1','KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — The Malaysian government pledged Tuesday that the opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim would receive a fair trial on sodomy charges, a nod to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s call for the case to be conducted transparently.Mr. Anwar, who faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of sodomizing a former political aide, has repeatedly called the trial a government conspiracy intended to end his political career, a claim denied by the government.At a joint news conference with Mrs. Clinton, who is on the Malaysian leg of her seven-nation Asia-Pacific tour, Anifah Aman, the Malaysian foreign minister, said that Mr. Anwar would receive a “fair and open trial.”“It is in my interest and in our interest to make sure that Anwar gets a fair trial,” Mr. Anifah said. “Because if there is such a thing as a political persecution, if it can happen to Anwar, it can happen to the rest of us.”Mrs. Clinton — who had just come from Cambodia, where she called for the continuation of trials against surviving members of the Khmer Rouge — said she had raised the issue with Malaysian officials.'"
"'10-11-03,'1','Stocks ended higher Tuesday as voters went to the polls for midterm elections and policy makers from the Federal Reserve met to decide whether they would start a new round of purchases of Treasury securities to help stimulate the economy.Such a decision, which will put downward pressure on long-term interest rates, is expected to be announced by the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday. Analysts said the market had been pricing in the prospect of the measure, called quantitative easing, for weeks as Fed officials made clear that the central bank was prepared to act if needed.But even as investors weighed the remaining uncertainty about the size and schedule of such a program, stocks edged higher, as the dollar weakened against the euro and the yen, and as analysts forecast that the Republican Party would take control of the House of Representatives.“I think some of the people are buying because they see a better market,” said Muriel F. Siebert, the president of Muriel Siebert & Company. “The Fed has made it obvious they stand ready to do what they think is good.”Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, said the Republicans could make significant gains. “We continue to suspect that fiscal policy will end up being largely paralyzed for the next two years as a result,” he said in a research note.'"

"'10-11-04,'1','Not that Jeter is fading that quickly. Even with his precipitous drop in batting average, he still resides in the upper tier of shortstops based on offensive categories, even if the overall competition at the position is not as robust as it once was.Among the 20 shortstops with the most plate appearances in 2010, Jeter ranked among the top eight in average (eighth), on-base percentage (sixth), doubles (seventh) and walks (third). No shortstop scored more runs (111) or had more hits (179) than Jeter, who, it should be noted, also made the most outs in baseball (511). He had those positive and negative numbers for the same reason — he had more plate appearances (739) in 2010 than every player but Rickie Weeks of (754).But that, too, points to the question of whether Jeter now needs more time off during the grind of a long season. Playing as often as he did ultimately exposes more of his weaknesses, and his defense, after a two-year revival, slid backward in 2010.By traditional measures, it was actually the best season of his career: a .989 fielding percentage and only six errors — two fielding, four throwing — indicating his ability to make the plays he is supposed to make remains intact. But according to the many advanced metrics that now measure defensive acumen, Jeter hurt the Yankees this past season by not getting to as many balls as he used to.After the 2007 season, Jeter altered his workouts to expand his lateral range. By practically every measure, his defense improved in 2008, and then again in 2009, though healthier legs and better positioning also likely played a role.But in 2010 among shortstops, Jeter had the fourth-worst plus-minus rating — a metric established by John Dewan, an author of the “Fielding Bible,” to evaluate defense — at minus-17. That essentially means Jeter made 17 fewer plays than the average shortstop.Another statistic, ultimate zone rating per 150 games, which incorporates errors, range, arm strength and double plays, determines a fielder’s value based on how many runs he saved or lost compared to the average player. According to that metric, Jeter, the year after preventing 8.0 more runs than the average shortstop because of his defense, in 2010 allowed 5.4 more runs, the sixth most among shortstops.If this were only about baseball and future production — and not about Jeter’s symbolic importance to the franchise — the Yankees could argue that Jeter, based on his statistics, age and veteran status, might be in line for a 2011 salary that would be half of the $21 million he earned in 2010.But that, of course, is not going to happen. Imagine Jeter making less money next season than the undependable , who is set to receive $16.5 million. So the Yankees — knowing that Jeter is the captain who still plays with resolve that rubs off on teammates, that he hits better than a lot of his peers at his position, but may be slowing on defense, that he might have three competitive seasons left, but perhaps not five — will have to figure out just how much they are willing to pay.Jeter, in turn, may have to decide how much less he is willing to make than he did in 2010. Compromise seems inevitable in this case, but it may not be that easy. Meanwhile, Jeter could probably use more rest.'"
"'10-11-04,'1','“I don’t want to be one of those guys you pick up the paper and read about,” he said, referring to news reports of young former professional football players dying of heart attacks.Quast was shaken in 2004 when the Hall of Fame defensive end Reggie White, whom he got to know with the Eagles, died of cardiac arrhythmia at 43. “He was larger than life,” Quast said. “When that happens to a guy like him, it makes you wonder if we’re all a piece of meat.”The cardiovascular screening program for retired N.F.L. players was created in 2003 by a retired New Jersey heart surgeon, Dr. Arthur Roberts, and was originally financed by the players union and private donations. The program has since expanded and moved under an umbrella group called the N.F.L. Player Care Foundation, which includes the union, the league, a player alumni group and the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Roberts, a star quarterback at Columbia in the 1960s known as Archie, said the issue of concussions in football had overshadowed the risk of heart disease to retired players.“The danger of concussions has exploded as a national issue because it has such a powerful effect on society,” Roberts said. “Our kids play sports and suffer concussions, not just gladiators playing professional football. But the reality is that cardiovascular disease is the leading killer of men.”Since May, Norman Hand, who played 10 N.F.L. seasons as a 300-plus-pound defensive tackle, has died of heart disease at 37; Harry Galbreath, a nine-year N.F.L. guard, has died of a heart attack at 45; and Jack Tatum, who had diabetes, has died of heart failure at 61.There have been other deaths of retired players this year and in past years, occasionally coming in flurries.Although some studies have shown retired N.F.L. players to have higher rates of indicators for cardiovascular disease like hypertension and artery-clogging plaque, experts say no hard data suggest that N.F.L. players over all are at greater risk of dying younger of heart disease than men of corresponding size and health in the general population. But most football players are recognizable names, especially to one another, and each death can heighten their fear.“It’s all very scary to read about these guys,” said Mike Quick, 51, a standout receiver for Philadelphia from 1982 to 1990, who was one of 45 former players screened in September. A broadcaster for the Eagles, Quick arrived early for the Saturday morning screening and later rushed to catch a flight to Jacksonville, Fla., where Philadelphia played the next day.“The things we put our bodies through, they just aren’t meant to do,” said Quick, who learned of the free screenings through the union.As an African-American, Quick worries because general-population studies have shown higher risk of heart disease for black men, although most experts studying heart disease in football say the drastic increase in linemen’s weight poses the gravest health threat.Dr. Sherry Baron, the coordinator for priority populations and health disparities at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, is updating her 1994 study that showed clear disparities across field positions. In a telephone interview, she said it was logical to assume that the size and speed of 21st-century players, believed to have created a more violent game that has intensified the neurological debate, have also elevated the dangers of cardiovascular disease by increasing the risk of debilitating injury that can limit postcareer activity, as in Quast’s case.But an examination of 201 player screenings from Roberts’s program in 2006 and 2007 by Dr. R. Todd Hurst of the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., found ailments in retired players of all sizes that harden arteries and can increase the risk of stroke and death by up to four times. That puts them in the same risk category as obese, nonathletic men.Hurst added that factors including genetics, possible steroid use (which he called “the elephant in the room”) and poor dietary habits “make it a real challenge for us as scientists to figure out where these guys fit to match them with others.”“Ultimately,” he added, “it is not playing in the N.F.L. that increases the risk; it’s what happens after they retire.”Roberts’s team — which includes several of his relatives and medical volunteers — has worked in conjunction with one headed by Dr. Jeffrey Boone of the Boone Heart Institute in Denver to screen almost 2,000 retired players. But Roberts acknowledged that a majority of about 16,000 retirees with at least one year of N.F.L. service remained elusively at risk.“You could make the argument that the ones who need this most are not the ones who generally show up,” he said, expressing some frustration.Roberts spent two years on the Cleveland Browns’ taxi squad while attending medical school at Case Western Reserve. In 1967, he signed with the Miami Dolphins, then in the American Football League. In the only game of his career, he completed 5 of 11 passes in a lopsided loss to Kansas City. He quit football after that season and eventually became a heart surgeon, performing thousands of operations until he had a stroke at 58 that ended his surgeon’s career.“The doctor wasn’t listening to the advice he was giving his patients,” Roberts said. “I neglected regular exams and follow-ups that I insisted my patients get. I wasn’t exercising, eating right. I should have known better. But when I had my stroke, it started a new phase of my life.”He came to believe that his sense of invulnerability had much to do with his athletic past. That thought helped him hatch the idea for the nonprofit Living Heart Foundation, which he initially dedicated to fighting sudden cardiac death in high school, college and professional athletes. Soon after, he focused on N.F.L. players, active and retired, hoping to help them avoid the mistakes he had made.“I feel as if all of these guys are a part of me,” Roberts said at the Philadelphia screening, where he played a largely supervisory role, greeting players, directing them to each station and making sure the traffic flowed freely. He was especially pleased when he recognized a player returning for a second or third screening.A fair number of the screened players in the past were told they needed immediate care, Roberts said. He recalled at least two — one of whom he knew from his playing days — who soon had coronary bypass surgery.“I score what we’ve done as far from perfect,” he said. “But after six years I do feel good about the effect we’ve had guiding players to procedures and helping them understand the risks. I believe we have saved some lives.”Brad Quast, whose fringe career was not unlike Roberts’s but who finished in much worse shape, was screened for the first time after the conversation last summer with his son and with the encouragement of his wife, Cyndi, who had been worried about his health. Two years ago, when he participated in an N.F.L. study on concussions, she was home when the results arrived by mail.“She opened them and it was, ‘Oh, God,’ ” Quast said. “Before that it was something we occasionally thought about. Now it was a medical person telling you about a lack of motor skills, short-term memory loss, fluid on the brain. They can talk about death rates not being higher, but what about the quality of life? I’ve already had to focus harder because of the memory loss, and I realized I could deal with this stuff later on or deal with it now. When I heard about the screenings, I thought this is also something I should do. Because of my knees, I think I’m at risk.”The two-plus-hour physical included an echocardiogram, carotid artery ultrasound and blood work. The findings were given to each man’s personal physician.During an exit interview with Dr. Lee Goldberg of the Penn Heart and Vascular Center, Quast was told that his arteries and ventricles were healthy enough. But the doctor advised him to substitute swimming for running and lectured him to avoid rich food. He also warned Quast that his weight, 248 pounds, was a little too high for his bone mass and 6-foot-1 frame.At Iowa, Quast was all-Big Ten in 1988 and 1989. He tied a team record with a 94-yard interception return for a touchdown against Kansas State. But the injuries he sustained while trying to make the Jets and the Eagles aborted his N.F.L. dream. By 1993, he could no longer pass a physical.“All of a sudden, you’re done at a young age — I was 25 — and you’re not the man anymore,” he said. “No one is picking up your drinks or paying for your gym. Guys’ girlfriends and wives are used to living a certain way, in a $700,000 house, and that can come to an abrupt end. Guys get scared; they get depressed.”Several former players at the screening said the loss of an N.F.L. income could be exacerbated by the stripping of one’s athletic identity and self-worth. Depression combined with physical limitations can lead to bad eating habits, weight gain, obesity, high blood pressure and hypertension.Kevin Guskiewicz of the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the University of North Carolina called this the snowball effect. His 2003 survey of 2,700 retired football players suggested links between osteoarthritis of the lower extremities and hypertension and coronary disease at rates higher than those in the general population.To make the screening program more effective, Roberts has been advised by consulting cardiologists to focus it on those making the transition out of football to better educate them on the dangers of an unhealthy diet and failing to maintain muscle mass.Quast earned a business degree at Iowa, easing his postfootball adjustment. He works as the director of sales for a company that provides outpatient pharmaceutical equipment. “I have a beautiful wife, three great kids and a heck of a lot to live for,“ he said.Golf may be possible again some day, he said, with cartilage growth treatment or knee replacements, which would be covered by the Eagles in a medical settlement. He has changed a few habits, seldom eating after 6 p.m. and trying to avoid beer.Yet with all that he has suffered and sacrificed, Quast and his family have not shunned football. His son Zach joined the high school team this fall after all. Quast helps coach a youth league in which his 10-year-old son, Shane, plays.“So many of my buddies have steered their kids away,” he said. “But it’s out there, and it has such appeal.” He paused and added, “My wife, she’s been really good about it.”'"
"'10-11-04,'1','As he celebrated winning New York’s governorship with 62 percent of the vote, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said New Yorkers sent him a mandate to “clean up Albany.” The problem is that New Yorkers, who complain a lot about Albany, also basically re-elected the whole bumbling, fumbling, corrupt Legislature.Democrats will continue to control the Assembly, and, so far, it appears as though Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, will continue to control the Democrats. At this point (not all races have been decided), the Silver crowd has lost a few seats but will have enough Democrats to override Mr. Cuomo’s vetoes. That limits their desire to negotiate.Mr. Cuomo will have a far different problem in the State Senate. Whether it is ultimately in the hands of Democrats or Republicans (and we might not know for a few days), New York’s State Senate still could be bitterly divided. Some of the old Senate crowd appear to have lost this year, but not enough of them.Some who are losing, like newcomer State Senator Craig Johnson, a Democrat from Nassau County, had been working for reforms like redistricting. What is worse, both parties seem all too ready to support the same leaders who helped get us here in the first place.There could be trouble from other quarters as well. Mr. Cuomo campaigned hard for State Senator Eric Schneiderman, who won as attorney general. But Mr. Cuomo did not endorse Tom DiNapoli, a Democrat who kept his job as state comptroller. The comptroller declares whether the budget is balanced and runs the $126 billion state pension. That offers a potential for conflicts with the new governor, especially if Mr. Cuomo tries to push for requiring the comptroller to have a board of directors to help him choose investors to the pension plan.Mr. Cuomo will have to use the power of his 62 percent wisely and quickly, since even big majorities soon lose meaning in Albany. What he needs are priorities:¶Offer a reform agenda at his inauguration on Jan. 1 and pass out proposed bills to the crowd. Redistricting, ethics reform, budget reform. Mr. Cuomo knows the list.'"
"'10-11-04,'1','A prominent rights lawyer who was released in September after years in prison remains under house arrest in his hometown in Shandong Province and is not allowed to receive visitors, Human Rights in China, an advocacy group, said Wednesday. The lawyer, Chen Guangcheng, is a vocal critic of government policies, especially of forced sterilizations or abortions by local officials trying to enforce adherence to the one-child policy. Mr. Chen was held under house arrest for one year starting in 2005, then was imprisoned for four years on criminal convictions. Human Rights in China said no one, not even Mr. Chen’s mother, had been allowed to visit Mr. Chen, who is blind, or his wife, Yuan Weijing, since early October.'"
"'10-11-04,'1','Only three months after the enactment in July of the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulation legislation that was intended as a response to the financial crisis, a section of the act has already been repealed.Though that effort — a bipartisan rollback of the ability of the Securities and Exchange Commission to exempt some data from the Freedom of Information Act — shows that Congress is not averse to rethinking parts of the law, it is small potatoes compared with the changes that some opponents of Dodd-Frank would like to see.Those include reining in the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, reconsidering limits on debit card fees and restricting the budgets and growth of the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In addition, Republicans and opponents of the law would like to reverse what they call the institutionalization of “too big to fail” for the largest financial companies.“We’re not under the illusion that there will be a massive rewrite of Dodd-Frank,” Edward L. Yingling, president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association, said in an interview. But he said that by using its oversight responsibility to conduct hearings on the regulatory process, “I think the new Congress is going to find that there have been unintended consequences that need to be fixed.”Near the top of the list for Representative Spencer Bachus, the Alabama Republican in line to become chairman of the Financial Services Committee, is to repeal the provision that calls for the government to seize and liquidate large troubled financial firms, according to people close to the congressman.The new law put the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in charge of seizing and breaking up large financial firms that are headed for collapse. Mr. Bachus has argued that creates the expectation that investors will be bailed out, and contends that existing bankruptcy law should govern failing financial institutions.'"
"'10-11-04,'1','In “Doctors Point to Caffeinated Alcoholic Drinks’ Dangers” (news article, Oct. 27), alarming reports of inebriated students ending up in emergency rooms are the tip of the iceberg.The broader problem is the number of young people who are manipulated by targeted marketing strategies into abusing this dangerous mix of chemical antagonists that could irreversibly damage their still-developing brains.Treatment centers across the country repair the lives of thousands of troubled teenagers whose multiple dysfunctions can be traced back to abuse of inexpensive alcoholic beverages explicitly created to entice the lucrative and impressionable youth market.This latest business twist, adding a high dose of caffeine to mask the effect of alcohol in sweetened drinks, has long-term consequences: heavy alcohol use in adolescence has been found to lead to a reduction in attention and executive brain functioning.How many more young people will fail to reach their full potential before we take Four Loko and beverages like it off supermarket shelves?'"

"'10-11-04,'1','Ms. Palin had endorsed dozens of candidates, including ones in some of the highest-profile races.The result was a mixed record that included some spectacular losses — the Delaware and Nevada Senate races — but plenty of victories that Ms. Palin and her allies have already begun to point to as evidence of her political prowess and her ability to shape and direct the unwieldy frustration that is fueling American politics.For Ms. Palin and a handful of other Republicans, Wednesday was not only a time to savor victory, but also a time to begin laying the groundwork for a bid to capture their party’s presidential nomination.Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, campaigned more quietly, but just as aggressively, for candidates this year in the hopes of building up the good will he needs to make a second deep run at the nomination. His political action committee donated more than $1 million to Republican candidates.Haley Barbour, the governor of Mississippi and the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, stood shoulder-to-shoulder Wednesday with Republican leaders in Congress as he claimed success in governors’ races across the country.Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota used his Freedom First political action committee to raise his profile and help Republican candidates.As they plot tactics and strategy, all of the potential Republican presidential candidates will need to navigate political terrain that appears to be more sharply conservative than it has been in the past.Four in 10 voters told exit pollsters on Tuesday that they supported the Tea Party movement. Self-described conservative voters accounted for 41 percent of this year’s electorate, up from 32 percent four years ago.It is not clear whether Ms. Palin will seek the presidential nomination.She has said that she would consider doing so if there are not other good candidates stepping forward.And if she does run, she may have to answer to the Republican establishment for pushing candidates who made it harder — not easier — for the party to seize control of the Senate on Tuesday night.In Delaware, Ms. Palin all but created the Tea Party candidate Christine O’Donnell, helping thrust her onto the national political stage over the strenuous objections of the Republican elite in Washington. And in the end, Ms. O’Donnell never had a chance, handing what quite likely would have been a Republican Senate seat back to the Democrats.And in Nevada, Republican celebration was muted when their top target, Harry Reid, the Senate’s majority leader, handily defeated Ms. Palin’s chosen candidate, Sharron Angle, to return to Washington.Farther west, in Ms. Palin’s home state, political turmoil still reigns thanks to Ms. Palin’s support for the Tea Party candidate Joe Miller’s successful bid to defeat Senator Lisa Murkowski during the Republican primary in Alaska this year. With “Write-in” winning more votes on Tuesday than anyone else, however, Senator Murkowski may retain the seat, having run an insurgent campaign that directly challenged Ms. Palin’s influence in her own state.In the meantime, Ms. Palin is taking advantage of the media attention she receives to retain a high profile.She will appear in a reality television show called “Sarah Palin’s Alaska,” in which she will celebrate the outdoors in her home state.In an advertisement for the show that ran Tuesday night, Ms. Palin is shown hiking and kayaking with her family.“I’d rather be doing this than in some dumpy old political office,” Ms. Palin says in the ad. “I’d rather be out here being free.”'"
"'10-11-04,'1','DETROIT — General Motors executives have been cleared for takeoff again.The automaker has met federal guidelines to use chartered aircraft as early as Thursday to ferry managers on a “road show” promoting G.M.’s public stock offering, according to government and company officials who declined to be identified.It is believed to be the first time that G.M. will use private jets for business-related purposes since the government demanded that it sell its fleet of corporate aircraft in 2008. As a condition for accepting emergency federal assistance, G.M. has required its executives to travel on commercial airlines.The use of private jets by the Detroit automakers to fly to Washington for Congressional hearings on an auto bailout in November 2008 was harshly criticized by lawmakers, who saw the jets as symbolizing the industry’s need to cut unnecessary costs.G.M. and other executives drove to the next hearing.But times and circumstances have changed, these officials said. The Treasury Department has not objected to G.M.’s use of private jets to woo potential investors because the arrangement does not violate the government restrictions against owning or leasing aircraft, said these officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly in advance of the stock offering.The Treasury Department, which oversees the American taxpayers’ 61 percent stake in G.M., would not comment directly on Wednesday about the company’s plans to rent the jets.'"
"'10-11-04,'1','MONROVIA, Liberia (Reuters) — President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf dissolved her cabinet on Wednesday, a move that will provide her a “fresh slate” for the next phase of her administration, her office said in a news release.No other reason was given for the move, but it comes in the midst of a crackdown on corruption in Liberia that has already implicated some public officials a year ahead of presidential elections.“President Johnson-Sirleaf told the ministers that the reason for demanding their mass administrative leave is that this administration is entering a critical stretch and this would afford her the opportunity to start with a fresh slate going forward,” the news release said. “The President further announced that a cabinet restructuring will be made in the shortest possible time and that several ministers could be reappointed.”Deputies will take over the ministers’ responsibilities until replacements are nominated.Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf has been in power since 2006 and was expected to seek another term in an election planned for 2011.An analyst said the move may be part of a strategy to improve her chances in the election.“Patience with her government is wearing thin over the issue of corruption,” said Joseph Lake of the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit. “She faces a strong challenge in the 2011 presidential election from local hero George Weah and this may be an effort to freshen up a weary cabinet.”Her critics say she has not done enough to root out corruption or ease tensions between communities divided by 14 years of near-constant civil war that left the infrastructure in ruins.Liberia is one of the world’s poorest countries, but its oil and minerals resources are drawing increased investment from energy and mining companies.'"

"'10-11-04,'1','The statement said nothing about asbestos, the word that initially set off concerns after some debris fell from the Garden attic during overnight maintenance Monday. Tests conducted by the city’s Department of Environmental Protection and by independent contractors concluded that no asbestos had been released into the arena.Garden officials, exercising what they called “an abundance of caution,” postponed Tuesday night’s game between the Knicks and the Orlando Magic. The teams are working with the N.B.A. to schedule a makeup date.The decision to reopen the arena was made by Garden officials alone. The city’s oversight effectively ended once testing concluded that there was no asbestos in the arena.“It’s essentially in their hands,” Farrell Sklerov, a spokesman for the D.E.P., said earlier in the afternoon. He added, “There’s no health risk.”Had the Garden remained closed, the Knicks would have been forced to postpone more home games or play them at another site, probably in New Jersey. Garden officials made initial inquiries with the Prudential Center in Newark, but never made firm plans to play there.On Wednesday, the Knicks seemed more concerned with cleaning up their offense and their record (1-2) than their aging arena. They lost close games to Boston and Portland last week, outcomes that left them with equal doses of frustration and hope. The tough schedule continues Thursday night in Chicago against the talent-rich Bulls.So Tuesday’s postponement, however inconvenient, was not all bad. It gave three key players — Anthony Randolph (sprained ankle), Ronny Turiaf (sore back) and Danilo Gallinari (sore wrist) — extra time to heal.It also allowed the Knicks to avoid, for now, a difficult matchup with Orlando’s Dwight Howard, perhaps the league’s most fearsome big man. The running joke was that the Knicks finally found a way to shut down Howard.“One of my better coaching performances,” Coach Mike D’Antoni said, chuckling. He added: “It was either Dwight Howard or breathing bad material. It’s a tossup.”D’Antoni said that his young team might be more ready for the challenge by the time the Knicks see the Magic.Several players came to the training center to work out or shoot on their own. But the unexpected postponement left them with a free night and an empty feeling.“It was tough,” Amar’e Stoudemire said. “I mean, we definitely was ready to play, was prepared for Orlando, was geared up, ready to go.”The players were either headed to the Garden or getting ready to leave their homes when they received word that the game had been postponed. Some players said they just relaxed and watched television. Some watched other N.B.A. games. D’Antoni said he watched game film of the Bulls.“I wanted to play,” said Gallinari, who is eager to break out of a shooting slump. “I wanted to play the game. That was not good news.”Gallinari was already on his way to Manhattan when he heard about the incident and decided to keep going. He walked around Central Park, visited the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue (to check out the iPad), then headed to SoHo for dinner at an Italian restaurant.It was a nice way to spend an evening, just not what he had in mind. Like his teammates, Gallinari had never lost a game to 40-year-old fire retardant.“Only in New York can that happen,” he said.'"
"'10-11-04,'1','Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin was born on April 9, 1938, at the height of Stalin’s purges in a village in the central Russian Orenburg region. The son of a rural truck driver, he worked as a machine operator at an oil refinery and graduated from a technical institute through correspondence courses. He then rose through the ranks in the Soviet gas industry, becoming minister the year Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power.He remained in charge in 1989, when the ministry was transformed into Gazprom, and made sure its assets stayed intact. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the supply of heating gas to apartments was never cut off, an accomplishment that the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta credited to the fact that “sly Viktor Chernomyrdin managed to ‘rebrand’ ” the gas ministry and protect it from perestroika-era pressure to sell it off.He enriched himself and his family in the process.In 2001, Mr. Chernomyrdin was ranked No. 8 on Forbes magazine’s list of Russian billionaires, with $1.1 billion. His garage housed a fleet of luxury cars, according to a financial statement on the Kremlin Web site.Mr. Chernomyrdin was famous for malapropisms, as when he told Parliament, “Government is not the organ in which one uses his tongue only,” or instructed his detractors, “If your hands are itchy, scratch yourselves in other spots,” or declared, “We will live so well that our children and grandchildren will envy us!”But former colleagues remembered a steely politician who helped anchor an often wayward government.Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, a former member of Parliament, recalled the day in 1993 when a standoff between Mr. Yeltsin and members of Parliament had brought Russia near civil war. Mr. Chernomyrdin called a meeting with leaders of all of Russia’s regions via speakerphone, chatting casually about coal stockpiles and pension payments and the weather.“Then Chernomyrdin says: ‘O.K., guys. You know what’s going on in Moscow. I’ll tell you what. I am the prime minister, and I have seven ministers sitting here next to me. We have a president, Boris Nikolayevich. He was popularly elected, we are supporting him. Get to work, support the president and don’t make any unnecessary movements,’ ” Mr. Ryzhkov recalled in a radio interview.He said this meeting, which was never made public, was the “decisive moment” in the crisis.Two years later, Mr. Chernomyrdin negotiated with the Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev, who was holding up to 2,000 hostages in the city of Budyonnovsk. The negotiations were carried live on television, and Russians watched in frozen horror as Mr. Chernomyrdin barked into the phone at Mr. Basayev.Most of the hostages were released, and Russians credited him.“It was incredible,” Katya Amachenova, a secretary, told The New York Times at the time.She added: “He was very calm. He acted like a leader. We haven’t seen that in a while.”While serving as prime minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin remained so closely associated with Gazprom that the political party he founded, Our Home is Russia, was jokingly referred to as “Our Home is Gazprom.” His company was allowed to expand lavishly despite falling behind on tax payments. It also stepped in to assist the Kremlin at key moments, foreclosing on the media empire of Vladimir A. Gusinsky, who had turned into a sharp critic, and putting pressure on neighboring countries like Georgia and Ukraine when they fell behind on payments.Mr. Yeltsin fired Mr. Chernomyrdin as prime minister in 1998, but tried to bring him back as the country spiraled into economic crisis. By that point, however, the president’s authority was on the wane, and Parliament blocked Mr. Chernomyrdin’s appointment.When Mr. Putin came to power, he replaced Mr. Chernomyrdin as chairman of Gazprom with a little-known adviser, Dmitri A. Medvedev. Largely shut out of the halls of power, Mr. Chernomyrdin put his experience in the oil and gas industry to use as ambassador to Ukraine, whose pipelines carry Russian gas to Europe. From 2001 until his retirement in 2009, he played a crucial role in disputes over natural gas prices that caused energy flows to Europe to be shut off on several occasions.Mr. Chernomyrdin’s funeral will be shown live on Russian television. Burial will be in the Novodevichy cemetery, alongside such figures as Khrushchev, Chekhov and Mr. Yeltsin.Mr. Chernomyrdin is survived by two sons. His wife of 50 years, Valentina, died in March, a loss that those close to the former prime minister said affected him deeply.Mr. Chernomyrdin will long be remembered for his fatalistic commentary on a botched monetary overhaul carried out by the Russian Central Bank in 1993: “We wanted to do it better,” he declared at a news conference, “but it turned out as usual.”'"
"'10-11-04,'1','“Then? It got lost in the mail. They actually remade the dress for me. I got it two days before the wedding. The new dress was a little smaller than the first one. I had to walk like a Japanese woman, the skirt was so tight.” She demonstrated this teetering, as if in an ankle-locking kimono.There are a number of gorgeously shaped stretch leather and suede dresses by Jitrois. Alexis Mabille, who was a designer at Dior, is equally well represented: a backless black dress with a starched white tuxedo collar; a black wool sheath with a neckline wreathed in a cluster of thick ivory satin bows the size of tea roses; an electric blue opera coat festooned with black crystals, for the avenging disco Romanov.I threw on an hourglass-shaped down parka by Ermanno Scervino with little gradating diamond tucks, lined in black sheep’s wool. I actually thought the price ($3,900), though prohibitive, was relatively reasonable for such a successful fusion of form and function.As I headed to the dressing room, I noticed Ms. Jacobson arranging herself on the couch nearby, to be gently attentive. This struck me as so kind, it made me feel unbearably special. I’m private about trying things on; I don’t usually leave the dressing room to flounce around demanding attention. I always felt this to be the domain of particular rich girls that my instincts always told me to beat up.But this was a strangely intimate moment, one I would ordinarily flunk by pretending it wasn’t happening. Realm is essentially Randi Jacobson’s own closet writ large, with the doors thrown open. The black leather Jitrois dress I was trying on was directly related to her own wedding gown. I realized it would be ungenerous and arrogant of me not to share my enjoyment of it. So, I zipped myself in, got over my gothically self-conscious bad self, and submitted to being a blushing Cinderella.“I’ve never looked this good in my life,” I said, stupefied at my reflection. “I look like Jane Birkin.”With the possible exception of a Gucci wrap-dress I tried on in 2007, this was true: The short leather dress and low-slung hip belt made me somehow taller, sexier and French. I got an unexpected yelp of approval from a young man working near the door — heady praise for a girl pushing 39 from the wrong direction. If I had a car, I would have sold it that afternoon to buy that dress ($3,825), regardless of the fact that I’d probably be too shy to ever wear it. (But, like that neutron bomb, I wouldn’t need to use it to know I had the power to destroy lives.)Realm is one of those rare shops that produce that uncanny tingling sensation that you only get in the presence of a legitimate labor of love. The personal choices that compose the inventory is Randi Jacobson’s voice — it’s how she sings.2. Taste trumps wealth. In rare cases, taste even makes wealth forgivable. The opera, after all, has always been a place devoted to indulging the elites with art and opulence — but the poor, too, may occasionally glimpse the spectacle of heaven.REAL ’M Randi Jacobson brings her version of Madison Avenue sensibilities downtown, shaming SoHo with a new level of meticulously chosen luxe.DEAL ’M If you have to look at price tags, you probably shouldn’t fall in love with anything here, but the space is generous, as are the dressing rooms, reflecting the innate generosity of Ms. Jacobson herself.MADE ME WANT TO STEAL ’M It’s a bold pack of labels you may never have heard of and can’t afford, but this collection of crushable handbags, bold jewelry and figure-flattering showstoppers is worth mooning over, even if just to dream of grand larceny.'"

"'10-11-05,'1','New York galleries frequently exhibit things rarely seen almost anywhere else in the country. A current example is the powerful terra-cotta “Head of a Gorgon,” newly attributed to Andrea del Verrocchio (around 1435-88), the Florentine sculptor, goldsmith and painter whose apprentices included Leonardo. This rare relief is one of several works — the majority in terra cotta — competing for center stage in “Body and Soul,” a remarkable exhibition of Italian Renaissance and Baroque sculpture assembled by Fabrizio Moretti and his frequent collaborator, the private dealer Andrew Butterfield.With streaming, flamelike curls accented by bat wings and a face ringed by a pair of entwined snakes, the Verrocchio is a far cry from Greek mythology’s gorgons, three sisters that included Medusa. The strong, contorted face is more male than female, but what is most striking is its realism. Minus the hair treatment, this is a terrified modern visage, shouting warnings. Even with the coif, the effect is still relatively current, if more heavy metal.The emphasis on terra cotta gives this show an amazing hands-on vitality that roams through several centuries. But after the Verrocchio gorgon, the main event is the face-off in the second room of two very different high Renaissance sensibilities.On one side, Jacopo Sansovino’s stunning figure group “Charity” (Rome, 1513) depicts an idealized woman with an infant and two prancing cherubs. Its undulating combination of bare limbs and appendages, draped torso and free-floating drapery reflects the recent discovery of the Laocoön, and also brings the grace and sophistication of Raphael into three dimensions.On the other side, Andrea Riccio’s fabulously grave and still “Madonna Dolorosa” (Padua, 1500-10) is a study in exquisitely restrained emotion and modeled form that suggests direct contact with Greek Classicism (not the Hellenism of the Laocoön) and probably the aristocratic Venetian Madonnas of Giovanni Bellini. It’s the southern versus the northern Italian Renaissance in three dimensions — and a win-win revelation for the viewer. ROBERTA SMITH'"

"'10-11-05,'1','Your attention is expensive. Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign spent $14.58 for every vote he received in the general election. Democrat Bill White spent $11.76. And those were the efficient contests.Carol Kent, a freshman Democrat who unsuccessfully defended her north Dallas seat in the Texas House, spent $64.06 per vote — the most of any of the 194 candidates running for state offices in this year’s general election, according to an analysis of campaign finance data by The Texas Tribune. In Irving, State Representative Linda Harper-Brown, a Republican, spent the second-highest amount: $63.72. She won.Judges, who raise less money and whose fates on the ballot tend to have more to do with their political affiliations than with their qualifications, spend only pennies per vote. Three Republicans won State Supreme Court races Tuesday: Eva Guzman, spending 26 cents per vote, Debra Lehrmann, 25 cents per vote, and Paul Green, just a dime per vote. Cheryl Johnson, a Republican re-elected to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, spent less than any other winner on the statewide ballot, using just $1,413 to win 3.2 million votes. She had no major-party opponent.The numbers are imprecise because of the way campaigns report their spending to the Texas Ethics Commission: at midyear, 30 days before the election and eight days before the election. The Tribune’s analysis looked at those reports, but does not include large contributions during the last week before the election, because spending for that period is not reported until end-of-year numbers are due in January. The analysis takes account of candidates’ expenditures, but not third-party spending on their behalf.The highest per-vote spenders were not always the biggest spenders over all. Mr. Perry and Mr. White, who ran expensive statewide races, spent the most but were also fishing in the biggest pool of voters. And this sort of unit-pricing favors the winners, whose spending is spread over a greater number of votes.“If money didn’t correlate to votes, we wouldn’t spend it,” said Glenn Smith, a Democratic consultant. “If everything else is equal, the guy with the most money wins.” But he said other factors — a backlash against Washington, for instance — can overwhelm financial advantages.In fact, the saying that you get what you pay for did not seem to apply this year. Half of the top 10 spenders per vote lost, including Ms. Kent ($64.06), Patrick Rose ($52.12), Michael Bunch ($49.37), Joe Heflin ($44.42) and Kristi Thibaut ($42.12). All were in House races; all are Democrats except for Mr. Bunch. Their successful opponents won spending less per vote. In respective order: Stefani Carter ($59.38), Jason Isaac ($21.01), Senfronia Thompson ($10.88), Jim Landtroop ($29.54) and Jim Murphy ($28.07).'"
"'10-11-05,'1','“The Noise About Public Radio” (editorial, Oct. 30), about National Public Radio’s handling of the Juan Williams firing, was timely and on the mark. NPR was correct in firing Juan Williams and had every right to do so after his remark about Muslims; however, it was indeed handled very poorly.Over the years public radio stations have enjoyed phenomenal audience growth and respect. Like any news organization, it makes mistakes, but for NPR to be accused of a political bias by the likes of talk radio hosts and Fox News is a sad example of how low our national debate has sunk.The writer is a retired program director and station manager for several public radio stations.While I agree that one can “hear the due diligence to fairness” in National Public Radio’s news reports, these are limited to a few minutes at the top and bottom of the hour. What I hear in the rest of NPR’s talking-head programming is an unrelenting far-left-of-center Democratic point of view that is reflected in virtually every question asked of guests.And there is nothing wrong with this. NPR can present whatever programming it wants. But I should not be forced to finance this with my tax dollars. All public funding of NPR and its affiliates must stop.Your editorial says that “an end to federal support for all public broadcasting” over National Public Radio’s firing of Juan Williams would be “the worst possible outcome.”It seems to me that ending government funding of NPR would be very desirable. As you note, only 2 percent of NPR’s budget comes from the federal government. As a result NPR is a regular punching bag for conservatives. It should just say no.'"

By taking meaningful action to reduce pollution now, at all levels of government, “we can save millions of people, or even our entire species.”'"
"'10-11-05,'1','Given the administration’s agenda, business groups will continue to have plenty to disagree about, and the chamber has pledged to be aggressive. But the hope is that the difficult early stages of the relationship will cool in favor of consultation and agreements to disagree.In the news conference, Mr. Obama did not mention the chamber. But he seemed to suggest that his often-repeated goal of creating “new rules of the road” for business needed to be better balanced against a new appreciation for the need to buck up firms that were struggling in the faltering economy.“I’ve got to take responsibility in terms of making sure that I make clear to the business community as well as to the country that the most important thing we can do is to boost and encourage our business sector, and make sure that they’re hiring,” Mr. Obama said. “We do have specific plans in terms of how we can structure that outreach.”The outreach includes the meeting this week between Mr. Geithner and Mr. Donohue, according to an administration official briefed on the discussions. The pair talked about the president’s coming Asia trip, including issues relating to the Group of 20 economic meeting, China and South Korea, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.The administration official said the meeting with Mr. Donohue was “actually pretty constructive on the international economic front.” In an interview, Tami Overby, the vice president for Asia at the Chamber of Commerce, said she would give Mr. Obama “high marks” for his recent work to complete a trade pact with South Korea.Mr. Obama said his administration had already been “talking to C.E.O.’s constantly.” But he declined to be specific about the outreach he intended with business. He also said he would be taking American executives along with him on Friday when he leaves for Asia in the hopes of helping to open foreign markets to more American businesses.Less than a month ago, in a public letter, Mr. Donohue accused the White House of a “smear campaign” against his organization. He wrote: “The administration and its Congressional allies are desperately trying to change the subject away from our stalled economy and nearly double-digit unemployment. They hope that by demonizing those who oppose their failed policies, they can fire up their dispirited and disappointed base and silence our voice.”And yet, both sides have now had victories. Mr. Obama bested the chamber in the first two years of his term, passing health care legislation and an overhaul of financial regulations over the group’s heated opposition. The chamber clearly won the most recent round, helping Republicans seize control of the House.In his remarks, Mr. Obama hinted at a new direction from the White House that could help reassure businesses.“I think setting the right tone publicly is going to be important,” he said, “and could end up making a difference at the margins in terms of how businesses make investment decisions.”'"
"'10-11-05,'1','Noting that the president had just invited Mr. McConnell and other Congressional leaders to dinner, Mr. Gibbs added, “I hope that Senator McConnell comes to the White House with that in mind in a couple weeks.”But not long after Mr. Obama told reporters at the White House that he had issued the invitation, Mr. McConnell was giving his speech.“The American people want us to put aside the left-wing wish list and work together on helping to create jobs and restore the economy to health and prosperity,” he said. “There is no reason the two parties can’t work together on achieving these goals. But whether or not the administration has a midcourse correction, Republicans have a plan for following through on the wishes of the American people.”Mr. McConnell suggested, though, that he did not hold out much hope that his party would get what it wanted in the next two years with Mr. Obama in the White House.“The fact is,” he said in a speech at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group in Washington, “if our primary legislative goals are to repeal and replace the health spending bill, to end the bailouts, cut spending and shrink the size and scope of government, the only way to do all of those things is to put someone in the White House who won’t veto any of these things.”With their Senate majority now shrunken by at least six, Democrats will find it harder to overcome Republican filibusters, leaving Mr. McConnell in a stronger position to impede the White House agenda and to work with the new Republican majority in the House to impose a more conservative stamp on legislation and force showdowns with Mr. Obama.“This gives McConnell immense clout and doesn’t leave Reid with much sway,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. “Now that the Democratic majority is even narrower and more Democrats will be worried about supporting Obama, McConnell feels the confidence to be even more aggressive and out front in his opposition.”For two days, Mr. McConnell has spoken of bipartisanship as his “friends on the other side” embracing his party’s ideas.“They can change course,” Mr. McConnell said of Democrats in his Thursday speech, “or they can double down on a vision of government that the American people have roundly rejected. If they choose the former, they’ll find a partner in Republicans. If they don’t, we’ll have disagreements ahead.”Mr. Obama invited Congressional leaders of both parties to the White House on Nov. 18, the first week of Congress’s lame-duck session.'"
"'10-11-05,'1','Michael Jackson’s “Bad,” blasted near the end of “Megamind,” the witty 3-D animated deconstruction of superhero movies from DreamWorks Animation, encapsulates the paradoxes of a story in which evil morphs into good and vice versa. There was always something innately silly in Jackson’s wispy-voiced, childlike affectation of macho ferocity. My first reaction to a singer whose clout suggested a crooked finger more than a clenched fist was, “Oh, come off it, little boy.”And so it is with Megamind, the movie’s blue-faced, green-eyed, eggheaded title character, whose grandiose evil schemes usually come to naught and who loses every battle with his not entirely virtuous nemesis, Metro Man. Voiced by Will Ferrell, Megamind is a hyper-sensitive brainiac who sounds a little like Stewie Griffin, the weirdly effete child played by Seth MacFarlane in “Family Guy” (whose British accent is said to have been inspired by Rex Harrison). More Conehead than cave man, Megamind, whose lair is an abandoned power plant cluttered with machinery, is a comic antihero for the age of the geek.Metro Man (the voice of Brad Pitt) is equally ambiguous. A smug, grinning Superman with a wavy Elvis haircut, he wallows in self-satisfaction as the residents of Metro City heap glory on him. His jaw is a little too prominent, his body a little too pumped, his attitude a little too cocky for him to be trusted as an unassailable moral paragon. He isn’t really a hero; he’s just a star.When at a certain point in the movie Metro Man is accidentally vanquished and is presumed dead, Megamind faces an existential crisis. Without an opponent he has no purpose in life. The movie’s central joke — that good and evil are meaningless unless both exist in continual opposition — is unusually sophisticated for an animated movie. And the screenplay by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons plays that insight every which way.Disconsolate, bored and at loose ends, Megamind decides he must create a Metro Man replacement. Wielding his considerable but imperfect magic, he transforms Hal (Jonah Hill), the nerdy redheaded cameraman for the local television station and the movie’s answer to Jimmy Olsen, into the super-powered Tighten (also Mr. Hill). But Tighten, an angry postadolescent outcast nursing many grudges, quickly discovers that wreaking vengeance against a world that looked down on him is much more fun than doing good, and he runs amok.'"
"'10-11-05,'1','Of this cavalcade of characters, “Plant man” seems to have come first and remained foremost, the energy source for all the others. But his stepmother was equally important. After his mother died, when he was 7, Von Bruenchenhein’s father married Elizabeth Mosley, a former schoolteacher in Panama who had returned to the United States to become a chiropractor. A painter of floral still lifes and a writer of pamphlets on things like reincarnation, she fostered Von Bruenchenhein’s love of the natural world (and, it would seem, a certain kind of free thinking). He considered her his mentor until she died in 1938.The time Mosley spent in Panama cannot be underestimated, given Von Bruenchenhein’s subsequent emphasis on tropical and exotic flora. In the 1930s he built a greenhouse and grew cactus, joined the local Cactus Club, studied botany and often said he was a horticulturalist.But his real artistic blossoming seems to have been inspired by Marie, whom he met in 1939, when she was 19 and he was 29, and married four years later. Over the next decade or so he took thousands of photographs of her in various states of undress, often wearing clunky heels, garters, scarves, and draped with pearls or flowers. When she dons dresses, they are floral prints. She is almost always seen against one of three or four floral backdrops, seated on small patterned rugs. Despite frequently bared breasts and thighs, the photos feel remarkably innocent.Von Bruenchenhein’s images belong to the complex history of set-up photography that gained critical mass in the early 1980s. Like a proto-Cindy Sherman, Marie assumes female, Hollywood-related roles. She serves as chaste pinup girl, Tahitian princess (or tourist), would-be starlet, Breck Girl, young Madonna (although they had no children) and much more.Von Bruenchenhein’s willing collaborator, Marie is, however, rarely completely at ease. There’s an awkwardness, even a subtle deer-in-the-headlights alarm that registers in these images and is perhaps the most direct reflection of Von Bruenchenhein’s personality available to us. It speaks to the intensity of his ambition, which one can imagine may have verged on the tyrannical, to her desire to please and to the undoubtedly claustrophobic quality of their enterprise. Marie Von Bruenchenhein was 63 when her husband died; she survived him by less than a decade.In the 1950s Von Bruenchenhein, partly inspired by tests of the hydrogen bomb, began painting on small masonite panels or cardboard. At the rate of about one a day, he turned out slightly garish semi-abstractions, manipulating paint with his fingers, combs and other small objects, including brushes made from Marie’s hair.These combustible little images suggest exotic plants, strange sea creatures or cosmic fireworks, as well as cover art for science-fiction novels; they hint at visionary architecture. Unfortunately there are only three examples of the 1950s paintings in the show, and they are relatively quiet ones at that.The mid-1960s brought a rash of drawings made with ballpoint pens, rulers and French curves that are the least known of Von Bruenchenhein’s work. Many of them were glued into a large album of wallpaper samples that is also part of the show, and that viewers can page through in digital animation. Their fine-lined forms oscillate among templelike buildings, floral designs, spaceships and outlandish stringed instruments — and often resemble distant cousins of Frank Stella’s painted-relief series from the 1970s.Meanwhile in the late ’60s Von Bruenchenhein began concentrating on sculpture in two distinct mediums. From clay scrounged from construction sites he made ceramics baked in his coal oven and decorated with whatever kind of paint he could find. The show includes small, oddly tentacled flowers related to some of the sea creatures in his paintings (although not the ones here); individual concaved leaves whose mixtures of color are especially rich; and perforated vases assembled from smaller ceramic leaves that suggest laurel wreaths run amok. In these pieces Von Bruenchenhein’s weirdness turns Victorian, especially in a flame-colored leaf-vase sitting on an ochre-colored pedestal that suggests an ornate occasional table.There is a similar emphasis on the incremental in the little thrones and towers he made out of salvaged chicken and turkey bones, using airplane glue and paint. Oddly inhabited even though empty — thanks to the protrusions of bones — the thrones befit a man who sometimes referred to himself and his wife as the king and queen of his self-created realm.A gold-painted tower, made mostly from vertebrae, is a creepier matter. But it does, however, dovetail with eight larger paintings from the late 1970s, when Von Bruenchenhein was painting exclusively on cardboard. Featuring lacy, visionary skyscrapers of an Art Deco sort, these works once more take advantage of mundane physicality, using the ridges and honeycomb of the cardboard, softened by paint, to suggest crenellated or brickwork surfaces or occasionally climbing vines.The skyscrapers emerging from lush, tropical greenness do their best to tie things together. They connect to the bone tower and leaf-vases and the space-age designs of the drawings. They suggest the profound attraction of fantasy, the conjuring of other worlds that starts with the photographs of Marie.But they lack the intensity and inventive paint handling of the paintings of the 1950s and ’60s, which show Von Bruenchenhein unbound. They have a place in the history of postwar painting, as surely as Marie in her many guises has one in postmodern photography.Von Bruenchenhein belongs among the great American outsider artists whose work came to light or resurfaced in the last three decades of the 20th century: Henry Darger, Martin Ramírez, Bill Traylor, James Castle and Morton Bartlett. But Von Bruenchenhein was not an isolate. He wanted people to see his work, wanted to sell it and approached galleries in Milwaukee without luck. One can imagine him being thrilled at the attention his work has received since his death, just as one can imagine him perusing the careful Folk Art Museum show and saying, “More, more, more.”'"
"'10-11-05,'1','Visually distinctive and aurally delightful, “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench” has style to burn. A soulful black-and-white commentary on love, art and their competing demands, this Boston-based musical from Damien Chazelle floats on a wave of spontaneity and charm.The whisper-thin story introduces us to Guy (Jason Palmer), a talented jazz trumpeter, and Madeline (Desiree Garcia), a rudderless waitress. A brief opening sequence summarizes their three-month romance as they fall, fondle and separate, he to pursue a new conquest, she to explore a new city.For the rest of the film, as the couple slowly circle back together — or maybe not — we will be entertained, enchanted, confused and frustrated in almost equal measure. Mr. Chazelle may have bitten off more influences than he can comfortably chew.Merging a slacker sensibility with documentary-style trembly-cam, and Hollywood song-and-dance numbers with naturalistic performances, “Guy and Madeline” suggests Claude Lelouch by way of Richard Linklater (with a smattering of Jacques Demy and an avalanche of John Cassavetes). When the film works — scenes of Boston street life frequently rise to the level of pavement poetry — it can take your breath away; when it doesn’t, you’ll wish its maker had given as much thought to plot and characterization as to framing and camera movement.The story’s dramatic weaknesses, however, are the music’s opportunities, and “Guy and Madeline” soars in the cool sizzle of Guy’s trumpet solos and the blissed-out atmosphere of his jam sessions. Eruptions of singing and tap-dancing — in a jazz club, a diner, a park — range from joyous to resilient to wistful, their choreographed emotions filling in for the characters’ maddening inscrutability. Both of the leads may be lovely to look at (Mr. Palmer moves with the delicacy of an urban fawn), but their lack of previous acting experience is only highlighted by their lack of satisfying dialogue.Spare in design and whimsical in tone, Mr. Chazelle’s vision unfolds in episodic, sometimes cryptic, bursts. Most of the mystery surrounds Elena (Sandha Khin), Guy’s new girlfriend, who flirts under assumed names and willingly goes home with a middle-aged stranger who approaches her on the street. Aggressive and sure where Madeline is passive and shy, Elena also provokes the movie’s most magical scene: a silent subway seduction, dense with restrained eroticism.'"
"'10-11-05,'1','“The pools are our major solution,” said Representative John Shimkus, an Illinois Republican who is in line to become chairman of the health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Shimkus said Republicans had proposed spending $25 billion on risk pools over 10 years.“If you give the states the power to use their money,” Mr. Shimkus said, “or to do cross-state compacts where they can build that pool, then I’m not one to say that doesn’t solve the problem.”Administrators of the risk pools, which are formally called Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plans, point to a variety of explanations for low enrollment: lack of awareness among a hard-to-reach target population, a requirement that applicants be uninsured for at least six months and premiums that, although set at market rates, are often unaffordable. Starting on Jan. 1, the Department of Health and Human Services hopes to draw more interest by giving consumers choices of plans with different costs and deductibles.“We’ve had about 350 applications, and I would characterize that as less than expected,” said Amie Goldman, chief executive of Wisconsin’s risk pool and chairwoman of a national association of state risk pool directors. “We’re all committed to getting there and spending all $5 billion and helping as many people as possible. But it’s a new program, and you kind of have to roll it out.”The program’s intent, however, was to fill a need quickly. By offering coverage to some of the country’s most medically desperate people, the risk pools were devised to serve as a bridge until 2014, when the law will require insurers to accept all applicants regardless of their health (that already applies to children under 19, under a provision that took effect in September).Unlike most commercial insurers, the risk pools accept individuals with any of a list of risky health conditions, like cancer or hypertension.Edward J. Kenyon Jr., 49, an electrician in Sanford, Me., whose multiple myeloma, a blood cancer, was diagnosed last spring, said the policy he bought in August from that state’s pool had been a godsend.Mr. Kenyon, who is self-employed, said he had not been able to afford health insurance for 20 years, and was managing to pay for a share of his chemotherapy treatments only through fund-raising by his family and friends.His cancer diagnosis, of course, made him uninsurable. When his doctors told him that he needed a bone marrow transplant, and that it could cost $350,000, he said he had to laugh to keep from crying.With the risk-pool coverage in effect, Mr. Kenyon has scheduled the transplant for Nov. 26. His monthly premium, he said, runs $419.54, with a $1,000 deductible.“It’s just been an enormous load lifted off of us,” Mr. Kenyon said. “We can try to think about what’s ahead of us with this transplant. One of the things they say when you’re getting treated for something like this is that you need to not be worried and just focus on getting well.”As recently as April, the chief actuary for Medicare and Medicaid estimated that 375,000 people would enroll in the risk pools this year. In an interview, Richard A. Popper, director of insurance programs in the Department of Health and Human Services, deflected questions about whether he was disappointed in the current pace of enrollment.“It takes a while for advocates and stakeholders to realize there’s this new plan,” Mr. Popper said. “We’re delighted the program is out there and making a difference in people’s lives and keeping people alive.”Before the law took effect, 35 states already operated their own risk pools, insuring a total of 208,000 people. But many of those pools require waiting periods for coverage of certain ailments, and premiums are typically 125 percent to 200 percent of standard rates, often making the policies impractical or unaffordable.The new pools authorized by the health care law do not have waiting periods (although applicants must be uninsured for six months) and premiums cannot be higher than normal rates. Out-of-pocket costs are capped at $5,950 a person, and there are limits on how much rates can vary with age.Twenty-seven states opted under the law to run their own pools, while the federal government is administering the others. Premiums and benefit options vary by state. A recent study by The Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan health research group, found that monthly prices for a nonsmoking 50-year-old ranged from $240 for a $5,000 deductible plan in Utah to $1,006 for a $1,500 deductible plan in Alaska.The study estimated that 6 million of the country’s 50.7 million uninsured might be eligible for the new pools.Finding them is not always easy, and experience has shown it can be inefficient to market niche insurance programs through radio and television advertising. Instead, state risk pool directors said they were trying to get the word out to doctors, hospitals and insurance agents.Several encouraged the federal government to invest more in marketing. Mr. Popper said there were no plans for broad-based national advertising.“I really think that people are not aware of the federal pool, there’s no question about that,” said Kären J. Larson, director of the pool in Washington State. “Just going around in my daily life, people that you would expect to know, like providers, don’t know. It’s just too far down in the details of health reform.”'"
"'10-11-05,'1','“The labor market has been a disaster for young people,” according to Andrew Sum, a professor of economics and the director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. Not only is it difficult for young people to find work, he said, but “40 percent of college graduates under 25 who have jobs are mal-employed, meaning they’re working at jobs that don’t require college degrees.” That is up from 30 percent in 2000.Stephanie McGurk, who majored in environmental studies, eventually took a job as a nanny. On Oct. 15, four months after she had moved home, she and Alex, who landed a job in his field of graphic design, found a small rental in Burbank, Calif.Not all young people are able to transition as smoothly. As a result, parents are improvising as they find themselves in the role of life coach, career counselor, financial adviser, real estate agent and pseudo-psychologist for their adult children. Here are some tips:EXPECT CHILDREN TO MOVE HOME It no longer has the same stigma. One in five people aged 25 to 34 lives in a multigenerational household, typically with their parents, according to a study released this year by the Pew Research Center. That figure has nearly doubled since 1980.A survey released last month by Twentysomething, a market research firm, found that 85 percent of those graduating last spring planned to move back home, up from 67 percent as recently as 2006. Even when children get jobs, parents should encourage them to continue living at home — at least as long as everyone can tolerate it, some personal finance experts say. Money that would have been spent on rent could be saved, or used to pay off credit cards and student loans.DO NOT SACRIFICE TOO MUCH If children move back home, it is reasonable to have them contribute in some way, said Ann Diamond, a financial counselor in New York City. “If they’re making enough money, you can ask them to pay some rent,” she said.Otherwise, agree on responsibilities, like making dinner a few nights a week or doing the laundry. Most important, parents should not put their own financial security at risk, experts say. “I see too many parents, especially mothers, helping out grown children when they should be squirreling away more money for their own retirement,” said Cindy Hounsell, president of the Women’s Institute for a Secure Retirement, a nonprofit organization in Washington.DO NOT MICROMANAGE CAREERS Parents should make it clear to their children that they are expected to be moving toward financial independence and give them a specific time frame to get a job, experts say. It is a good idea, however, to resist pointing out that their hopes of becoming rock stars, poets or even Internet entrepreneurs may not be realistic.“Instead of saying you have to compromise on your dream job, let them figure this out by themselves,” said Ms. McGurk. She added that she and her husband had let their daughter and houseguest know that their comfortable arrangement was not intended to be indefinite. “Right now there aren’t too many jobs available in the fair trade, natural food movement, dealing with indigenous farmers in L.A.,” she joked, referring to her daughter’s college major.HELP WITH FINANCIAL PLANNING Even if the subject of personal finance terrifies parents, it is a good idea to confront it for their children’s sake. Ms. Diamond suggested that parents sit down and talk through their basic monthly expenses, including cellphone charges, credit card debt and car insurance. Introducing a Web site like mint.com to assist with budgeting, debt repayment and savings goals can help a parent avoid being the one doing the nudging.“It’s a rude awakening for many people recently out of school,” said Ms. Diamond. “But you need to start the conversation and talk to them like adults.”HAVE THE DEBT TALK The average college student leaves school with more than $4,000 in credit card debt and $24,000 in student loan debt. It is wise for parents to make sure that children know the rates on their student loans and credit cards, and that they should pay the highest interest debts first.Parents should not co-sign credit cards for their children because the parents’ credit score will most likely drop if the child misses just one payment, finance experts say. Also, have them find out if they are eligible for the government’s Income-Based Repayment plan, which can reduce the cost of their federal student loans significantly. Try finaid.org and ibrinfo.org.If your children need money for graduate school, steer them to the federal Graduate Plus loan program, which charge a fixed rate of 7.9 percent. That may be lower than many private student loans. Go to studentaid.ed.gov.CONSIDER HEALTH INSURANCE Grown children may want help in paying off their car loans, but if money is tight, springing for their health coverage is a better idea. Under the new Obama health care rules, you may already be allowed to cover your children under 26 years old on your policy, whether they live at home or not. (Check state laws, too. New Jersey, for example, allows parents’ policies to cover their children through age 30.)LET THEM DEFINE SUCCESS More young people are pursuing nontraditional paths because of the abysmal job market. (Applications to the Peace Corps, for example, were up 18 percent last year, the highest since 1998.)After graduating from high school in 2008, Zach Cooper trained at the French Culinary Institute in New York City for a year and then went to college. After his freshman year, he told his parents that he was not returning to school because he had been offered a full-time job as a line cook at Morandi, a Keith McNally restaurant in New York.His mother, Lynn Sonberg, was not thrilled at first. “I wanted him to have the luxury of a period of intellectual exploration,” she said. But she is proud of his achievement. “He’s almost financially independent at age 20 at doing something he loves,” she said, “and that’s a blessing.”'"
"'10-11-05,'1','MUMBAI, India (AP) — India’s benchmark Sensex index closed at a record high Thursday, after the Federal Reserve’s decision to buy $600 billion in government bonds to shore up the United States recovery drove a surge of foreign investment into fast-growing India.The Sensex closed up 2.1 percent, at 20,893.6 points, topping a January 2008 closing high of 20,873.33, according to Bombay Stock Exchange data. The index touched an intraday high of 20,917.0, 290 points shy of its record intraday high on Jan. 10, 2008.“It’s the Fed’s quantitative easing,” said Nandan Chakraborty, managing director of institutional equity research at Mumbai’s Enam Securities. “It’s great for India.”Mr. Chakraborty said the Fed’s announcement, against a backdrop of slow growth and near zero interest rates in the developed world, would continue to bolster emerging market stocks, commodities and the rupee. A rising rupee will help India’s importers, like engineering, infrastructure and telecom companies, but will hurt its software services exporters, like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, which get more than half their revenue from North America.On Thursday, foreign investors poured $635.9 million into Indian equities and debt, bringing the year-to-date total to a record $36.3 billion, according to the securities regulator.'"
"'10-11-05,'1','Stocks surged Thursday as the markets responded positively to the Federal Reserve’s decision to buy more government securities to stimulate the economy.The Fed announced on Wednesday that it would buy $600 billion in new Treasury securities, in addition to continuing a previous program of asset purchases.Investors had been anticipating the announcement for weeks and initially had a muted response to it.The Dow Jones industrial average rose just 26.41 points on Wednesday.A day later, however, stock traders seemed much more enthusiastic.After the Fed decision, the markets “pretty much had a global recovery,” said Anthony Conroy, head equity trader at the BNY ConvergEx Group. “The Fed is being very accommodating.”On Thursday, markets in Asia and Europe rose, and then markets in the United States picked up the momentum.'"
"'10-11-05,'1','Companies, struggling in the midst of the worst recession since the 1930s, cut payrolls during the recession by 8.4 million jobs from December 2007 to December 2009. Productivity surged as companies were able to produce more with fewer workers.Many economists believe many companies have reached the limit of how much they can stretch their existing work forces.But that was not evident in another report issued by the Labor Department on Thursday: initial claims for unemployment insurance rose by 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 457,000 for the week that ended Oct. 30. Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a smaller rise.The increase comes after claims fell in four of the previous five weeks. Those drops had brought claims to their lowest level since July and raised hopes the job market was improving.Instead, claims have risen back above the 450,000 level they have fluctuated around all year. They will need to drop below 425,000 to signal sustained job gains.The weekly applications for unemployment benefits are volatile, but are considered a real-time snapshot of the job market. They reflect the pace of layoffs and indicate whether companies are hiring.The four-week average of claims, a less volatile measure, rose by 2,000 to 456,000.Claims fell steadily last year, from about 600,000 in June 2009 when the recession ended to about 470,000 at the end of the year. There has been little improvement since then.The unemployment claims report comes a day before the Labor Department is scheduled to release the jobs figures for October. Economists project that report will show that employers added a net total of 60,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate remained 9.6 percent for a third month.That would be an improvement from September, when the economy lost 95,000 jobs. But September’s figures were made worse by a loss of 77,000 temporary Census Bureau workers. Few temporary census workers remain and will not have much impact on Friday’s report.The economy needs to add at least 200,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth and to help get some of the 15 million people who are unemployed back to work.The number of people continuing to claim unemployment benefits dropped by 42,000 to 4.34 million, the lowest since November 2008. But that does not include several million people claiming extended unemployment aid, paid for by the federal government. More than 5 million people received the emergency benefits during the week ending Oct. 16, the latest data available. All told, more than 8.7 million people received jobless benefits that week.The emergency benefits program, extended several times by Congress, is set to expire at the end of the month. Many analysts doubt Congress will extend it again. That could cause as many as a million people a month to lose benefits, according to the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit group.'"
"'10-11-05,'1','HONG KONG — Asian stock markets took the details of a much-anticipated asset-purchase program by the Federal Reserve in stride on Thursday, with gains that were for the most part subdued, just as they were on Wall Street.In the end, the Fed’s move, which had been widely telegraphed for weeks, was more or less in line with what the markets had expected, and long priced in. The headline figure —Treasury purchases to the tune of $600 billion in coming months to stimulate the U.S. economy — was somewhat above what analysts had forecast, but not so much so that markets were spooked.On Wall Street, the reaction was muted: the Dow Jones industrial average gained 26.41 points, or 0.24 percent.The picture was not much different in Asia. Stocks inched up further on Thursday, after a mostly firm performance the previous day before the Fed’s announcement came out.The main gainer on Thursday was Japan, which was playing catch-up after having been closed for a national holiday. The Nikkei 225 index jumped 2.2 percent, as the Japanese yen dropped slightly against the U.S. dollar. But at 80.8 yen per dollar, it remains near 15-year highs against the U.S. currency.'"

"'10-11-06,'0','The United States weathered criticism of its human rights record from friends and foes alike on Friday in a United Nations forum in Geneva that the administration of President George W. Bush had boycotted as hypocritical. Senior American officials defended the United States against allegations that it used torture and said the Obama administration had begun “turning the page” on practices of the Bush administration that had caused global outrage. But the United States’ conduct in its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and its campaign against terrorism — notably its treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and the Abu Ghraib jail near Baghdad — have come under heavy criticism from human rights organizations. The Obama administration is committed to closing Guantánamo and ensuring that all detainees, no matter where they are held, are treated humanely, American officials said. “Between Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantánamo, we have conducted hundreds of investigations regarding detainee abuse allegations, and those have led to hundreds of disciplinary actions,” a State Department legal adviser, Harold Hongju Koh, told the forum.'"
"'10-11-06,'0','Breathless, with beads of sweat forming on his brow, Jahumi Harrigan, 23, hurried into the gym at Cathedral High School on East 56th Street on Friday morning, hand in hand with his 13-year-old sister, Asha.They had gotten lost on their way from Upper Manhattan, and arrived almost an hour after nearly 200 other eighth graders had filed in for an exam that could determine their high school futures.A week ago, thousands of city students hunkered down to bubble in the answers on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, which determines placement in top public schools, including Stuyvesant and Bronx Science.But on Friday, a similarly stressful test, known as the Test for Admission Into Catholic High Schools, was taken by about 8,000 eighth graders from Archdiocese of New York schools, public schools and private schools who want to attend one of the dozens of Roman Catholic high schools in the region that require the test. Students who go to school in Brooklyn and Queens, which constitute the Diocese of Brooklyn, and other schools will take the test next Saturday.Asha, who had been preparing for the test for weeks with the help of her six older siblings, squeaked into a seating for latecomers. Outside, Amy Rivera stood anxiously. Her daughter Precious, 13, began studying in the summer, with test-preparation books and supervised nightly hourlong study sessions. The payoff, Ms. Rivera said, was that on Friday morning, Precious was not nervous.“Pretty much I know she’s going to ace it,” Ms. Rivera said.Carolyn Ellefson, a project manager at Riverside Publishing Company, which creates the test, said that preparation was not necessary, though her viewpoint will certainly not stop the practice. “If your kid is going to school every day and paying attention every day,” she said, “they are going to do just fine.”The test replaced the Cooperative Entrance Exam, known as the Co-ops, in 1994. It costs $52 to take, lasts about three hours, and consists of reading, language and math sections as well as a portion that tests “general abstract reasoning,” said Joseph Gerics, the associate superintendent for secondary education at the archdiocese.Students select three Catholic schools to apply to. If a student is rejected by all three but still wants to attend a Catholic school, Dr. Gerics is notified and can submit the candidate’s name to other schools with openings.Unlike the public school test, which is the only factor in determining which students are admitted to the top schools, the Catholic school test is important but not the only factor, somewhat like colleges’ use of the SAT. Some Catholic schools do not even require the test, including a few of the most prestigious, like Regis, Convent of the Sacred Heart and the Loyola School.Those that do require the test, like Cathedral, also look at things like middle school grades and attendance records, said Joan Close, Cathedral’s principal.Still, students were not taking their chances on Friday. Julissa Ramirez, from Holy Cross School on West 43rd Street, brought a chunky pencil she had saved since first grade; her classmate Mary Stanley wore her lucky pastel blue hat to Cathedral, one of several testing sites. The test, like the schools, are open to students of all religions. And while the schools do deliver a Catholic education, the test has no religious component.But for some Catholic students, their faith steadied them. Genesis Espinal wore a Jesus charm necklace and fingered her late grandmother’s blue and red plastic rosary between her hands. Chloe DeJesus, 13, who wore a shirt with Justin Bieber’s photo (“Because I’m his girlfriend,” she said), prayed with her hands clasped under her desk during the bathroom break.One aspect of the exam did have Catholic school overtones: Most of the testing sites, including Cathedral, were single sex. Although some students have friends who will be taking the same test next week, the possibility of their sharing questions did not concern organizers. “How many multiple-choice questions can you remember, really?” said Ms. Close, the principal.Chloe acknowledged that some of her Brooklyn friends had been particularly insistent. “They said, ‘When you are taking the test, just take out your phone and take a picture,’ ” she said. “I said, ‘No.’ What happens if the cops find me?”'"

Mr. Ban said that China was on the path to political reform and building a society based on the rule of law. “I hope that the Chinese government will further expand the space for civil society and take further steps that reflect and uphold its commitment to international human rights standards,” he said at a news conference. He stopped short of calling on China to release imprisoned dissident Liu Xiaobo, the winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, an award that infuriated Beijing.

"'10-11-06,'0','The N.F.L. players union Friday issued a disciplinary complaint to the N.F.L. agent Ian Greengross for the reported actions of his associate Kenny Rogers.The National Football League Players Association said in an e-mail that its action had nothing to do with Rogers’s apparent involvement in the recruitment of Cameron Newton, the star Auburn quarterback and a front-runner for the Heisman Trophy.John Bond, a former Mississippi State quarterback, said in a statement on Thursday that Rogers, his former teammate, wanted a “specified payment” to secure Newton’s services for Mississippi State.The union’s committee on agent regulation and discipline issued the complaint to Greengross for “violating numerous provisions of the N.F.L.P.A.’s Agent Regulations.”The union said that Rogers was alleged to have “misrepresented to prospective player-clients that he was an N.F.L.P.A. employee, a club official and an official from a testing service in an effort to recruit them.”'"
"'10-11-06,'0','OMAHA (AP) — Berkshire Hathaway posted an 8 percent decline in third-quarter income Friday as a result of losses on its derivatives portfolio, but the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and many other operating companies performed well.The company, run by Warren E. Buffett, said it earned nearly $3 billion, or $1,814 per Class A share, during the quarter, down from $3.24 billion, or $2,087 a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 21 percent, to $36.3 billion from $29.9 billion.The biggest factor in the decline was a $95 million loss on Berkshire’s derivatives, some of which are tied to equity markets and credit-default swaps. Last year’s third-quarter profit was helped by a mostly unrealized $1.1 billion gain as the value of derivative contracts tied to equity indexes soared.Mr. Buffett has said Berkshire’s operating earnings are a better measure of how the company is performing because those figures exclude the value of derivatives and investment gains or losses. Berkshire, based in Omaha, said its operating earnings rose 36 percent, to $2.8 billion in the quarter, over last year’s $2.06 billion.On that basis, Berkshire earned $1,692 a share, exceeding the $1,676 a share estimated by three analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. The Burlington Northern railroad added $706 million, helped by increases in industrial, agricultural and consumer product shipping. The railroad’s revenue grew 22 percent, to $4.4 billion.Berkshire said results at Fruit of the Loom, Iscar tools and Forest River RVs improved.'"

"'10-11-06,'0','LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The first day of the Breeders’ Cup started with an altercation between the jockeys Calvin Borel and Javier Castellano over rough riding. It ended with confusion and concern over whether one of the favorites in the Ladies’ Classic, Life at Ten, was healthy enough to be in the $2 million race.In the Breeders’ Cup Marathon, Borel, everyone’s favorite rider at Churchill Downs, went wild after being swung wide around the final turn.“I’ll kill you,” he screamed at Castellano in the winners’ circle. Castellano — who had, in fact, appeared to interfere with Borel’s mount, A. U.

"'10-11-06,'0','Jill Clayburgh, an Oscar-nominated actress known for portraying strong, independent women, died on Friday at her home in Lakeville, Conn. She was 66.The cause was chronic leukemia, with which she had lived for 21 years, her husband, the playwright David Rabe, said.Ms. Clayburgh, who began her career in films and on Broadway in the late 1960s, was among the first generation of young actresses — including Ellen Burstyn, Carrie Snodgress and Marsha Mason — who regularly portrayed characters sprung from the new feminist ethos: smart, capable and gritty, sometimes neurotic, but no less glamorous for all that.“I guess people look at me and they think I’m a ladylike character,” Ms. Clayburgh told The New York Times in 1982. “But it’s not what I do best. I do best with characters who are coming apart at the seams.”She was known in particular for her starring role in “An Unmarried Woman” (1978), directed by Paul Mazursky. For her performance as Erica, a New Yorker who must right herself after her husband leaves her for another woman, Ms. Clayburgh was nominated for an Academy Award. (The best-actress Oscar that year went to Jane Fonda in “Coming Home.”)'"
"'10-11-06,'0','The average sale of a foreclosed home in the third quarter recouped only 57 percent of the money left unpaid by the original borrower, Fannie Mae said.The company sought to underscore Friday that it now conducted business with greater sobriety, even though losses on old loans would persist for years.“The loans we have acquired since the beginning of 2009 reflect our commitment to realistic, common-sense lending standards and sustainable homeownership,” Michael J. Williams, Fannie Mae’s chief executive, said in a statement.The government seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008 to ensure the availability of mortgage loans. The companies provide money to lenders by buying new loans; those loans then are bundled into securities for resale to investors.The Obama administration has said that the two companies should be replaced by a new system of government support for the mortgage market. The administration said it planned to present recommendations to Congress early next year.In the meantime, to keep the companies in business, the government provides enough money each quarter to balance their books. In exchange, the companies must pay the government a quarterly dividend. The companies have now absorbed $152.8 billion in taxpayer aid and returned $16.5 billion in dividend payments.The need for aid has tapered off in recent quarters. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the companies, estimated last month that they might need only $19 billion more so long as housing prices did not decline sharply.But both the finance agency and a separate study by Standard & Poor’s cautioned that the total cost could more than double if the housing market stumbled.One uncertainty is the impact of delays in the foreclosure process, driven by revelations that some mortgage servicers — the companies paid by Fannie, Freddie and other investors to collect payments from borrowers — failed to follow the legal requirements for seizing homes from those borrowers.Fannie and Freddie lose money from the time a borrower stops making payments until the home is resold to a new owner. The length of that process has increased sharply during the housing crisis, as the sheer volume of foreclosures swamped the machinery. The new problems could extend the process even further.Bank of America, which services 26 percent of Fannie Mae’s loans, suspended foreclosures for weeks while retooling its process. Fannie, in turn, said that it would suspend efforts to resell foreclosed homes that previously were managed by Bank of America, or other servicers that announced similar steps.Fannie warned that the problems also could discourage potential buyers, extending the time it took to sell homes and reducing sales prices.Fannie owned about 167,000 homes at the end of September, more than twice as many as at the same time last year. It declined to say how many of those homes were affected by the problems with the foreclosure process.Freddie, which owns an additional 75,000 homes, and Fannie both said that they could not estimate how much the problems were likely to cost.As Fannie explained in a regulatory filing on Friday, “We cannot predict how long the pause on foreclosures will last, how many of our loans will be affected by it or its ultimate impact on our business or the housing market.”'"
"'10-11-06,'0','There is no official qualification standard, but most of the women invited to run the elite women’s race are in at least 2:50 shape. David Monti, a consultant for New York Road Runners, said he was honest with the women who, despite borderline credentials, expressed interest in running the professional race.“I’ve said, ‘You could be stuck in the back and have to run by yourself,’ ” Monti said. “ ‘Are you mentally prepared to do this should that happen?’ ”For most of these women, the advantages that an elite starting bib confers outweigh the challenges. Among the amenities that only the professional runners enjoy: access to a hospitality suite, staffed with masseuses and chiropractors, during race week; special transportation to the starting line on Staten Island; a cushy warm-up area; and designated fueling stations along the course where the runners can drink from their own preplaced water bottles.And only runners in the all-women’s race are eligible to win prize money. That is a particularly relevant point this year because the race is doubling as the United States women’s marathon championship, with cash prizes awarded to first ($40,000) through 15th place ($1,000).Even for the runners who finish out of the money, the prestige of competing in the elite women’s race may be reward enough to compensate for some potentially lonely miles on Nov. 7.“There’s only so much recognition that the 2:40-type marathoners get these days,” said the race director, Mary Wittenberg, who has run a 2:44. “They’re very good, but most of these women have full working lives, and they don’t have the luxury of being professional athletes. So we give them the chance to be rock stars for the day. And we’ve had lots of breakthrough runs in New York from women who were not surrounded by a big pack, or even got caught on their own a bit.”Christa Iammarino, a 36-year-old nurse anesthetist from Wilmington, N.C., has opted to make her New York debut in the professional women’s race.“It’s just an experience to be able to start with those runners, the best in the world,” said Iammarino, who is hoping to break 2:50. “But you obviously can’t get caught in the excitement of how fast some of them will be going out, and you just have to run your own race.”Monti said that among the 48 women scheduled to compete in this year’s women’s elite race are a handful whom he and Sam Grotewold, the professional athletes manager for Road Runners, recruited from the regular race. Monti and Grotewold screened for potential 2:50 types among the tens of thousands of women who had registered themselves to run New York and offered a few of them a spot in the elite event. Some accepted, drawn to the pro race’s exclusivity and aforementioned perks. Others declined, preferring the experience of running elbow to elbow with the masses.Last year at age 52, Joan Benoit Samuelson, winner of the inaugural women’s Olympic marathon in 1984, eschewed the elite women’s race in favor of a spot on the regular starting line. Running under the radar and alongside a few men, Samuelson ran 2:49:09, shattering the New York 50-plus age-group record and coming within a second of her own American record for the 50-54 age division. (Confused television commentators, believing Samuelson had started with the elite racers and therefore thinking her time was 30 minutes slower than it was, called the late miles of her race as if she were struggling to a 3:20 finish.)Samuelson is not running New York this year — she improved her American age-group record to 2:47:50 in Chicago earlier this fall — but there will be other athletes who opt to run the regular race rather than risk going it alone. Most, however, relish the chance to toe the elite starting line with the Olympic medalists Shalane Flanagan and Derartu Tulu and other top-caliber athletes.“I’m not sure how many opportunities I’m going to have in my lifetime to do something like this,” said Katy Hatch, a Lincoln, Mass.-based ophthalmologist and mother who is hoping, at 34, to improve her personal best of 2:52:10. “So I decided to go with the women’s start, even though I know I’m probably going to be running a good portion of the race by myself.”'"
"'10-11-06,'0','LONDON — HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank by market capitalization, said Friday that its earnings rose in the third quarter but warned that the economic recovery in emerging markets was losing some steam.The chief executive, Michael Geoghegan, said there were likely to be “some bumps in the road ahead” in developing countries, especially in China. HSBC generates most of its earnings growth in Asia.“Our latest data from emerging markets points to a slowdown in the rate of recovery,” he said in a statement. But the bank added that it still expected growth in the region to outpace that of the developed world for the foreseeable future.HSBC said pretax profit in the third quarter was “well ahead” of the period a year earlier, as money it set aside to cover bad loans reached its lowest quarterly level since early 2007. Its lending business in the United States accounted for the biggest share of improvements, it said. Business in October was “in line with third-quarter trends,” HSBC said. HSBC does not give detailed earnings figures for the quarter.Royal Bank of Scotland also reported lower provisions for bad loans in the third quarter. The bank, which is majority-owned by the British government since a bailout, narrowed its loss to £1.15 billion, or $1.86 billion, in the third quarter, from £1.8 billion in the same period a year ago.'"

"'10-11-07,'0','“I needed to cut some corners somewhere,” Smith said.When he finally got her outside and clear, Zenyatta charged. She shot by Musket Man and Paddy O’Prado and absolutely gassed the Preakness champion, Lookin at Lucky.There was only one colt left, and he was a good one. Blame had won 8 of 12 in his lifetime, and 5 of his last 6. His rider, Garrett Gomez, had threaded Blame between two rivals and still had seven lengths on Zenyatta with the wire getting closer.“At the eighth pole, I thought I was going to get there pretty easy,” Gomez confessed. But then he peeked beneath his arm and saw Smith and Zenyatta getting bigger and bigger.“I knew she’d be coming,” Gomez said. “She’s the best I’ve ever seen.”Smith was fanning Zenyatta, a mare he loved, with his left hand. She dug in, and Blame’s lead grew smaller with every stride. With 20 yards to go, Zenyatta was at Blame’s tail. Then hip. Then neck. There was a roar, the flash of a finish-line photo, and then silence.Gomez thought he and Blame had won. Smith knew they had.The photo finish will show that a dwindling head separated Zenyatta from a perfect 20-0 record. The race chart will say Blame covered the mile and a quarter in 2 minutes 2.28 seconds and rewarded his backers $12.40 for a $2 bet.The sight of Smith in tears, his head buried in his hands moments after the race, showed the fuller story. It told of how a kind and fast horse can lead to heartbreak as well as majesty.Smith was inconsolable. He is a Hall of Fame rider who has been on the best horses in the world. But Zenyatta, he would tell you, “was the best ever, a gift from God, my everything.”It did not matter to him that this was a race for the history books, and Zenyatta was just as amazingly noble in defeat as she had been in her victories. He, Shirreffs and the Mosses had campaigned a thoroughbred who transcended the racetrack. They shared her with casual fans, who in turn fell for Zenyatta’s charisma and mastery.Gomez understood what he had done by defeating Zenyatta, and he was not entirely comfortable with it. He won three races this Breeders’ Cup and readily admitted that the victory atop Blame here was the biggest of his career.“I really do have mixed emotions about it,” he said. “She’s been an ambassador for racing. We had a lot of people out here supporting her. She was going for 20 of 20, and she came up a head short. I’m glad I was able to give her the defeat, but at the same time I wish she could have gone out 20 for 20 at someone else’s expense.”Instead, Zenyatta went out at the expense of Smith. Or at least he thought so, and he could not stop replaying the race.“I got away slow and got squeezed out of there,” Smith tried to explain, tears swimming at the corner of his eyes. “I couldn’t level her off. If you have to blame anyone today, it would be me.”Soon, the tears streamed down Smith’s face, and what could have been weighed too heavily on him.“It’s my fault,” he said. “She should have won, and it hurts.”Smith lifted his head when he was asked how good his horse was.“She ranks up there with the greatest of all time,” he said.Zenyatta had run like one of the greats. Blame’s trainer, Albert Stall Jr., knew she had, too.Smith, however, wanted to make sure the horse he loved got the accolades he felt she deserved.“If I’d have won this, you could arguably say she was” the greatest, he said. “To come up a nose short.”“It’s too hard,” he said.'"
"'10-11-07,'0','“Now, I’m not saying that non-black candidates cannot do that; indeed they can,” Mr. Clark said. “What I am saying is that these problems are prevalent in our community, and we ought to be able to make sure that we develop leaders who are trying to address and solve those issues.”Short of a black candidate reaching Chicago’s political mountaintop, the group wants to ensure that “the black business community has a voice, a seat at the table” and that the next mayor, regardless of race, sex or ethnicity, is “responsive to the needs of all Chicagoans,” said Ralph G. Moore, a council member and president of Ralph G. Moore and Associates, a management firm.“But the issues are much more complex than they were 40, even 20, years ago,” Mr. Moore added. “You don’t have all the black business people on board just because a candidate is black. There are members of the black business community who are very comfortable in supporting candidates who are not black.”Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments, who is black, is the co-chairman of the mayoral campaign of Rahm Emanuel, President Obama’s former chief of staff. Her boss, John W. Rogers Jr., the founder of Ariel and a longtime supporter of Mayor Richard M. Daley, is also black. Mr. Rogers, along with James Reynolds of Loop Capital Markets and Mr. Clark, is a co-chairman of the leadership council.“In some ways, we are trying to relive the experiences of Harold’s election,” Mr. Rogers said. “It’s been very interesting, very healthy. There’s a real sense of coming together.”The leadership council was formed seven weeks ago, shortly after Mr. Daley announced he would not seek a seventh term. There is a sense of urgency among the members — that they are already behind.“People don’t understand that this is a 60-days campaign,” said Melody Spann-Cooper, president of WVON Radio and a member of the council. “The window is closing fast. We need to be on the same page, so we can pool our collective resources to support the best candidate.”The council has commissioned a citywide poll of a long list of potential candidates — black, white and Hispanic.“I want to be very thoughtful and careful in choosing my words,” Mr. Clark said. “Yes, I think it’s important for the black community to identify candidates, but these candidates must have the ability to cross over. If a candidate can’t reach across ethnic lines, then he or she will not be successful.”The council members have also held meetings to analyze each of the 11 black mayoral hopefuls. Who can get on the ballot? Who can register voters? Who can energize the base? Who can raise money?“Money is going to be key to this race,” said Jacky Grimshaw, a former adviser to Mayor Washington who is not a council member “The black business community is going to be very important.”The council estimates it will take a minimum of $3 million for a candidate to be competitive. According to news media accounts, Mr. Emanuel is expected to have more than twice that amount by the end of the year.“Matching dollar for dollar, considering the national prominence of at least one of the candidates, will be hard to do,” Mr. Clark said. “Which is why it’s also important to have an organization, to have a base, to have people who you can put in the field.”In a sign of just how difficult the process will be, the council essentially admitted it was divided when it announced that it had identified two candidates with the best chance of winning — though it will not necessarily back them. The two, State Senator James T. Meeks and former Senator Carol Moseley Braun, have high name recognition. Mr. Meeks is pastor of one of the largest churches in the state, with a congregation of about 20,000.In assembling the group, Mr. Rogers said, the council made sure to include business leaders from earlier generations, like George Johnson, 83, a former banker whose mother took him to Chicago from Mississippi when he was 2.Mr. Johnson helped found Independence Bank on the South Side and financially supported both Dr. King’s Chicago Freedom Movement in the 1960s and a generation later the winning mayoral campaigns of Mr. Washington.“It was so exciting to see George Johnson come to the first meeting,” Mr. Rogers said. “To hear some of the stories was inspiring. It makes me feel good to see us reaching back and understanding that there is much to be learned from that prior leadership.”One of those stories begins in Chicago, where Dr. King spent 1966 campaigning for open housing. The movement had almost no money, and Dr. King had no idea where he was going to get the $30,000 he needed to cover payroll and other expenses like travel and bail.A bank in Atlanta had turned him down for a loan, and Dr. King was about to catch a plane and scour the country for donations when his lieutenant, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, told him a group of black Chicago businessmen could raise the money. Mr. Jackson had been working with several of the men, trying to help them get their products on the shelves of white-owned stores that refused to stock their goods.Dr. King was skeptical, but agreed to sit down with the businessmen, who included Mr. Johnson.“Our bank loaned Dr. King $140,000 to get him out of the hole in 1966,” Mr. Johnson said. “All the members of the executive committee signed personally. We were all on the hook. We were ready to pay, but he paid it all back.”As Dr. King left the meeting that night, Mr. Johnson said, “he was so emotional he had tears in his eyes. That was a great, great period. Years later, we did the same thing for Harold.”The question is, Can they do it again? Can lightning be captured in a voting booth one more time?'"
"'10-11-07,'0','But those who know Bishop Robinson say he has no intention of retiring from public life. His status as a symbol in the international gay rights movement means that after he steps down, he will have no shortage of platforms from which to preach his message that God blesses gay relationships too. (Through a spokesman, he declined interview requests.)Bishop Robinson has become a national figure. In 2009, he gave the invocation for the opening event of the inauguration of President Obama. He also sees himself as an evangelist to people alienated from Christianity.The election of Bishop Robinson in a church in Concord, N. H., in 2003 was the shot heard round the Christian world. It cracked open a longstanding divide between theological liberals and conservatives in both the Episcopal Church and its parent body, the Anglican Communion — those churches affiliated with the Church of England in more than 160 countries.Since 2003, the Communion’s leaders have labored to save it from outright schism, not just over homosexuality, but also over female bishops and priests.The current strategy, pushed by the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Rowan Williams, is for each regional province to sign a “covenant” of common beliefs.The covenant has been slowly making its way through laborious writing and approval processes, which could take years.Late last month, an international coalition of liberal Anglicans started a campaign to reject the covenant, saying, “The covenant seeks to narrow the range of acceptable belief within Anglicanism.”The group, Anglicans for Comprehensive Unity, said, “Rather than bringing peace to the Communion, we predict that the covenant text itself could become the cause of future bickering and that its centralized dispute-resolution mechanisms could beget interminable quarrels and resentments.”The church in New Hampshire suffered less fallout under Bishop Robinson than the Episcopal Church or the Anglican Communion. Only one New Hampshire congregation departed during his tenure, a congregation long unhappy with the direction of the Episcopal Church, according to diocesan leaders.The number of active members in New Hampshire fell 3 percent, from 15,259 in 2003 to 14,787 in 2009. In that period, the Episcopal Church, like most mainline Protestant denominations, lost about 10 percent of its members. (It had about two million in 2008, the last year for which statistics are available.)Bishop Robinson won critics over with a leadership style that was decisive but collaborative, said Margaret Porter, moderator of the diocesan council.“The people who were skeptics, that did not last,” she said. “He was willing to meet them where they were. There were churches that were reluctant to have him visit as bishop for a time, and I think he now visits every congregation and is welcomed.”But the pressure on Bishop Robinson became apparent in 2006. He took a monthlong leave to be treated for alcoholism. He said Saturday that he was in his fifth year of sobriety.He and his partner of more than 20 years had a civil union ceremony in New Hampshire in 2008.Bishop Robinson is no longer the only openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church. Bishop Mary D. Glasspool was consecrated in Los Angeles earlier this year.In his resignation speech in New Hampshire, Bishop Robinson said: “This is the one place on earth where I am not ‘the gay bishop.’ I believe that you elected me because you believed me to be the right person to lead you at this time. The world has sometimes questioned that, but I hope you never did.”'"
"'10-11-07,'0','Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column.It’s been more than 25 years since either party had a supermajority in the Texas House, but the Republicans are on the lip of it.The status upgrade matters far beyond bragging rights. It forces new strategies for the legislative session in January and will ripple into the 2012 election. When a party wins everything, as the Republicans have in Texas this year, it gets almost everything its way. It also has everything to lose.The rules at the Capitol are set up to make some sorts of legislation more difficult to pass. It takes two-thirds of the House, for instance, to tap the state’s Rainy Day Fund, which is expected to top out at $9 billion this year. With a biennial shortfall estimated at $20 billion, give or take $5 billion, scrounging budget writers and state leaders are already warning lawmakers not to use all of the Rainy Day money. Not to worry: The conservative supermajority is more likely to make drastic cuts than to make withdrawals from the savings account.It takes two-thirds to pass amendments to the State Constitution on to voters. Those same scroungers have talked about legalizing casino gambling or at least slot machines, and the resulting taxes and fees could raise $1 billion or more for the state treasury.The current political maps for the Texas House were designed to elect up to 90 Republicans — on a good day. In 2002, the first election after the current district boundaries were drawn, Texans put 88 Republicans in the House. Since then, they’ve dropped to 87, then 81, and then — when Barack Obama was running for president and Democrats turned out in droves —to just 76. One of those Democrats has since switched parties, so the partisan divide before last Tuesday’s election was 77 to 73.'"
"'10-11-07,'0','Taxes are not the only heavy lifting for Congressional leaders in the lame duck session. Before they can go home for the holidays — to celebrate or lick their wounds — there is a lot more of the people’s work left to do.If lawmakers do not extend federal unemployment benefits, two million workers will be dropped just in December. It is hard to imagine that Congress could deny help to out-of-work Americans. Except that is exactly what happened this summer when federal benefits lapsed for 51 days, cutting off 2.5 million people. Senate Republicans and a few Democrats insisted that reducing the deficit was more important. That did not stop many of the same senators from preserving tax loopholes for certain wealthy money managers.Deficits matter, but not more than a recovery (benefits are a powerful stimulus) or the economic survival of millions of Americans. Short-term extensions breed uncertainty and anxiety, which are also bad for the economy. The best thing this lame duck Congress can do is extend the benefits for 12 months, with the expectation that things will be better by the end of next year.The right choice is just as clear when it comes to fixing the Medicare payment formula. If lawmakers fail to act, payments to doctors for tests, procedures and office visits will drop by 23 percent on Dec. 1. Many doctors will decide they cannot afford to treat Medicare patients.This is a long-standing problem that would be too costly (on budget projections) to fix permanently, so Congress has repeatedly approved temporary fixes. We don’t like budgetary flimflam. In this case the alternative would be disastrous. Congress should delay the cuts through the end of 2011, and commit to work in the interim to find a permanent solution.'"

"'10-11-07,'0','The goal, Mr. Yoffie adds, was to build a profitable business with a lot of recurring revenue, based on service contracts and software licenses, and to attract industry partners and software developers to use its technology.Over the last 10 years, Apple has embraced much of the same strategy — in broad strokes. The company’s partners and developers build on its iPhone and iTunes software and share with Apple their revenue for music and software applications sold on the iStore. These complementary offerings encourage more sales of Apple’s hardware, and have become money makers on their own.“Each company has created an ecosystem of partners and developers around its core products,” Mr. Yoffie says. “And both depend on ongoing innovation.”When Steven P. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, the company was saddled with inefficient manufacturing, loose cost controls and bulging inventories. It lost more than $1 billion in fiscal 1997. In early 1998, Mr. Jobs recruited Timothy D. Cook, an operations expert, from Compaq, who had previously spent 12 years with I.B.M.Under Mr. Cook, now Apple’s chief operating officer, the company is a model of lean efficiency. It holds seven days’ worth of inventory, compared with an average of more than 30 for most technology companies, analysts say.Companies typically try to manage payments so they collect cash from customers slightly before they have to pay suppliers, thus making money by investing the cash before payments are due. Apple collects its cash in 25 days, on average, and pays its suppliers in 85 days — an extraordinary, 60-day spread that generates an extra $1 billion in cash flow a year, estimates A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst at Bernstein Research.That achievement is made easier, Mr. Sacconaghi notes, because Apple makes its billions in profit from just a handful of products. But the scale at which it buys components for its hit products, like iPhones and iPods, gives the company some Wal-Mart-style muscle with its suppliers.Fostering consistent innovation, experts say, requires a balance of management systems and inspirational leadership. At Apple, the inspiration wellspring is the megawatt personality of its leader, Mr. Jobs, and its ability to make consumer products that delight millions of people.At I.B.M., the inspiration engine is more subtle and conceptual. In late 2008, Mr. Palmisano and his team settled on a theme: the deployment of scientific research and technology to tackle big challenges for business and society in fields like energy, pollution, transportation and health care. And the company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on its “Smarter Planet” advertising campaign.“Sure, it’s marketing, but it’s also a big idea that explains the company’s mission to the world and to its employees,” says John Kao, an innovation consultant to governments and business.A striking difference between the companies, experts say, is in their approach to research. I.B.M. has laboratories around the world, spends $6 billion a year on research and development, and generates more patents a year than any other company. Five I.B.M. scientists have won Nobel prizes; the company’s researchers attend scientific conferences, publish papers and have made fundamental advances in computing, materials science and mathematics.Apple, by contrast, focuses only on product innovation, not scientific invention. “Apple does research insofar as it advances their laser-focused product aspirations,” observes Michael Hawley, a computer scientist who worked for Mr. Jobs at NeXT, a pioneering but commercially unsuccessful computer company.At Apple, the emphasis is not on the basic science of traditional research but on the “behavioral science” of the user experience, explained a former Apple manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he still had ties to the company.APPLE has technical experts who constantly scout new commercial technologies, he said; they work with suppliers, often co-inventing down to the chip level. Then prototypes and initial products are produced, with constant refinements. They are shown not to focus groups or to other outsiders, but only to Mr. Jobs and his lieutenants. For example, three iPhone prototypes were completed over the course of a year. The first two were tossed out, the third passed muster, and the product shipped in June 2007, the former manager said.“That is the rocket science — the product,” he said.'"
"'10-11-07,'0','The essentials of estate tax law can be captured in two numbers: the amount of an estate that is exempt from taxes, and the rate paid on estates larger than that exemption. In 2001, the exemption was $1,350,000 for a married couple, and half that for a single person. The maximum tax rate was 55 percent. Between 2002 and 2009, the exemption for a couple was gradually raised to $7 million and the maximum rate was lowered to 45 percent. Gifts of any size from one spouse to the other are not taxed, unless the spouses are of the same sex. (But don’t expect that inequity to be fixed anytime soon.)If Congress had simply indexed the 2009 limit to adjust automatically for inflation, and left the tax rate at 45 percent, we would have a reasonable law in place and would have avoided a decade of uncertainty. Instead, we have granted a tax holiday to the heirs of rich people who have done their families the courtesy of dying in 2010, but we’ve left everyone else in a muddle.Consider three courses that Congress might take:Do nothing and go back to the 2001 exemption and rates.Make the 2009 rates and exemption permanent, an approach that the Obama administration favors.Make the 2010 rules permanent, thereby eliminating the estate tax, as the Republican leadership would like to do.In thinking about these options, let’s debunk two common misconceptions.First, it is incorrect to say the estate tax amounts to double taxation. The wealth in many large estates has never been taxed because it is largely in the form of unrealized — therefore untaxed — capital gains. A 2000 study found that for estates worth more than $10 million, unrealized capital gains represented 56 percent of assets. For estates with active farms and businesses, the percentage is much higher. If no estate tax is imposed, capital gains taxes can be avoided indefinitely.The second myth is that the estate tax somehow threatens family farms — that they would need to be sold if they couldn’t pay the tax. But under the $7 million exemption proposed by the Obama administration, such cases would be exceedingly rare.What should Congress do? The most important step would be to end the uncertainty by legislating a permanent set of rules. If Congress doesn’t act, even middle-class households might soon be facing an estate tax. And of all the taxes in our system, the estate tax probably requires the most advance thought. (It is called “estate tax planning,” after all.) To avoid future showdowns in Congress, the exemption should be indexed for inflation if the estate tax remains.But what about the tax rate? The proposed 45 percent rate is the lowest since 1932, but it still sounds high, almost confiscatory. Yet we must keep that $7 million exemption in mind. The Tax Policy Center estimates that in 2009, the average effective rate (taxes paid as a proportion of the entire estate) was 19.4 percent for all taxable estates. Even for estates above $20 million, the rate was only 22.4 percent.We could lower the rate if we also lowered the exemption, but that would be a mistake. Dealing with the estate tax is a major nuisance, so it should apply to as few people as possible. With the $7 million exemption, only 3 estates in 1,000 would have to pay any tax. And those with estates that big could certainly afford a good lawyer to help them further increase the effective size of their exemption.ONE might think that eliminating the tax — that is, continuing the 2010 rules — would end this reporting burden for everyone. In fact, the opposite is true. There are new filing provisions in 2010 for any estate with more than $1.3 million in unrealized capital gains. Previously, the original prices for assets in an estate weren’t important because the income tax bases were “stepped up” to current levels. Now, the I.R.S. wants to know the original purchase prices, which you will have to enter on a form that the agency has not yet provided.So if your affluent grandpa died this year, now might be a good time to start looking for the receipt for that original Picasso he bought in Paris 50 years ago.Which brings us to fiscal discipline. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that eliminating the estate tax would cost about $500 billion over the next decade. The Obama proposal, if indexed to inflation, reduces that loss of revenue by about half. Some Republicans will want to hold out for a complete elimination of the tax and may try to postpone acting until the new Congress convenes. If a spike in deaths occurs in late December, we will know whom to blame.So let’s be serious. There are lots of ways to spend $250 billion. Trim the deficit, improve education, support the troops, or make sure heiresses like Paris Hilton have the proper attire for trips to St.-Tropez. At this time in our history, which of them seem prudent?'"
"'10-11-07,'0','The arrival of organized criminal syndicates to the software piracy scene has escalated worries at companies like Microsoft, and . Groups in , and Eastern Europe appear to have supply chains and sales networks rivaling those of legitimate businesses, says David Finn, Microsoft’s anti-piracy chief. Sometimes they sell exact copies of products, but often peddle tainted software that opens the door to other electronic crime.“As long as intellectual property is the lifeblood of this company, we have to go protect it,” Mr. Finn says.Microsoft has adopted a hard-line stance against counterfeiting. It has set up a sophisticated anti-piracy operation that dwarfs those of other software makers; the staff includes dozens of former government intelligence agents from the , and , who use a host of “CSI”-like technology tools for finding and convicting criminals.But the hunt for pirates carries with it a cost to Microsoft’s reputation.The company’s profit from Windows and Office remains the envy of the technology industry, and critics contend that Microsoft simply charges too much for them. In countries like , where Microsoft encourages local police officers to conduct raids, the company can come off as a bully willing to go after its own business partners if they occasionally peddle counterfeit software to people who struggle to afford the real thing.“It is better for the Indian government to focus on educating its children rather than making sure royalties go back to Microsoft,” says Eben Moglen, a law professor at Columbia Law School and a leading advocate of free software.Mr. Finn argues that Microsoft has no choice but to be aggressive in its fight, saying its immense network of resellers and partners can’t make a living in areas flush with counterfeit software. He says consumers and businesses are being coaxed into buying counterfeit products that either don’t work or do serious harm by clearing the way for various types of electronic fraud.And, crucially, the counterfeit software cuts into Microsoft’s potential profit. A software industry trade group estimated the value of unlicensed software for all companies at $51.4 billion last year.The most vociferous critics of Microsoft and the overall proprietary software industry describe the anti-piracy crusade as a sophisticated dog-and-pony show. They say the software makers tolerate a certain level of piracy because they would rather have people use their products — even if counterfeit — than pick up lower-cost alternatives. At the same time, the critics say, the software companies conduct periodic raids to remind customers and partners that playing by the rules makes sense.“It has always been in Microsoft’s interests for software to be available at two different prices — expensive for the people that can afford it and inexpensive for those that can’t,” Mr. Moglen says. “At the end of the day, if you’re a monopolist, you have to tolerate a large number of copies you don’t get paid for just to keep everyone hooked.”Microsoft has demonstrated a rare ability to elicit the cooperation of law enforcement officials to go after software counterfeiters and to secure convictions — not only in India and , but also in China, , , and . Countries like , and have set up intellectual-property protection squads that rely on Microsoft’s training and expertise to deal with software cases.As Mr. Moglen sees it, these efforts underscore a certain level of desperation on the part of American companies and the economy of ideas on which they have come to rely. “This is the postindustrial United States,” he says. “We will make other governments around the world go around enforcing rights primarily held by Americans. This is a very important part of American thinking around how the country will make its living in the 21st century.”MICROSOFT’S pursuit of software counterfeiters begins in , at one of the company’s 10 crime labs.Donal Keating, a physicist who leads Microsoft’s forensics work, has turned the lab into an anti-piracy playpen full of microscopes and other equipment used to analyze software disks. Flat-screen monitors show data about counterfeit sales, and evidence bags almost overflow with nearly flawless Windows and Office fakes. Mr. Keating serves as the CD manufacturing whiz on what amounts to Microsoft’s version of the A-Team, clad in business-casual attire.The undercover operative of this group is Peter Anaman, a lawyer who was born in and educated in ; he taught hand-to-hand combat to soldiers during a stint in the French army and then taught himself how to write software. Mr. Anaman has applied his software skills and training to explore a shift in piracy from groups that make CDs to those that offer downloads online.Through three online personas — two female and one male — Mr. Anaman chats with and sometimes befriends hackers in Russia and Eastern Europe who use stolen credit card numbers to set up hundreds of Web sites and offer products from Microsoft, Adobe and Symantec. “It is part of gathering human intelligence and tracking relationships,” Mr. Anaman says.Through an artificial intelligence system, Microsoft scans the Web for suspicious, popular links and then sends takedown requests to Web service providers, providing evidence of questionable activity. “The Web sites look professional,” he says. “And some of them even offer customer support through call centers in India.”The counterfeiters, however, have automated systems that replace links that Microsoft deep-sixes. So the company has turned up the dial on its link-removal machine.“We used to remove 10,000 links a month,” Mr. Anaman says. “Now, we’re removing 800,000 links a month.”He describes the groups behind these sites as “part of the dark Web,” saying they have links to huge spam, virus and fraud networks. Microsoft’s tests of software on some popular sites have shown that 35 percent of the counterfeit software contained harmful code.Anthony Delaney, who started at Microsoft 25 years ago — driving a forklift to move boxes of its products for shipment — has worked his way up to become its piracy data guru.On one of the flat screens, Mr. Delaney brings up a world map that lets users zoom into a city just as they would if hunting for directions online. But instead of highlighting landmarks and popular stores, the map illuminates Microsoft’s retail partners. Hover a mouse over a shop in , for example, and you can see how much software it sells, how often Office is sold in tandem with Windows, the failure rate for authentication codes and how many cease-and-desist letters have gone to suspicious sellers in the area.According to the map, the area within a 50-mile radius of accounted for more than 200 “actions” last year, including 165 cease-and-desist warning letters to companies suspected of selling pirated software.“We can see that only 5 percent of your sales have Office attached to Windows,” Mr. Delaney says. “If that’s below the average for the area, we may go have a chat or conduct a test purchase.”This rather eclectic bunch is joined by about 75 other people, including former agents of the I.R.S., , Secret Service and Interpol, and former prosecutors — all of whom work under Mr. Finn.A former assistant United States attorney in New York, Mr. Finn directs this squad from a office. He says Microsoft spends “north of $10 million” a year on its intelligence-gathering operations and an estimated $200 million on developing anti-piracy technology.Mr. Finn talks at length about Microsoft’s need to refine the industry’s equivalent of fingerprinting, DNA testing and ballistics through CD and download forensics that can prove a software fake came from a particular factory or person. And his eyes widen as he thinks about advancing this technology to the point that Microsoft can emphasize the piracy issue directly to customers.“Imagine the day when a consumer finds a link that says, ‘Click here if you would like a forensic examination of your disk,’ ” Mr. Finn says. “You put the disk in, the computer reads it and suddenly you see a map of everywhere that counterfeit has been seen all over the world. If people see it in a graphic and visual way, I think they are more likely to help.”THE software thieves monitored by Microsoft come in various shapes and sizes.College students, grandmothers and others have been found selling cheap, copied versions of software like Windows, Office, Adobe’s Photoshop and Symantec’s security software on and other shopping Web sites.And people unwilling to pay for discounted software, meanwhile, can find free versions of popular products online that offer downloads to all manner of copyrighted material.Microsoft’s investigators, however, spend much of their time examining how large-scale counterfeiters produce copies at factories and then distribute their wares around the globe.The biggest counterfeit software bust in history occurred in July 2007 in southern China. The Public Security Bureau there and the F.B.I. found a warehouse where workers assembled disks, authentication materials and manuals and prepared them for shipping. All told, investigators found $2 billion worth of counterfeit Microsoft software, including 19 versions of products in 11 languages. Software produced by this syndicate turned up in 36 countries on six continents.As one means of trying to tell the genuine article from a fake, Microsoft embeds about an inch of a special type of thread in each “certificate of authenticity” sticker found on boxes of software and computers. The investigators spotted dozens of spools of counterfeit thread — 81 miles worth — at the Chinese warehouse.Microsoft has found that operations of this scale tend to include all the trappings of legitimate businesses. Workers spend years building up contacts at software resellers around the globe, offering them discounted versions of software. Then they take the orders and send them off via shipping services, Mr. Keating says.Many Microsoft products make users enter an activation code to register the software and have it work properly. The syndicates trade in stolen versions of these codes as well, and sometimes set up their own online authentication systems to give people the feeling they have a legitimate product. Groups in Russia and Eastern Europe, with various cybercrime operations in play, now use money gained from credit card fraud schemes to buy activation codes.About a decade ago, only a few companies had the expertise or the $10 million needed to buy machines that could press CDs and DVDs. Today, someone can spend about $100,000 to buy second-hand pressing gear, says Patrick Corbett, the managing director at a CD plant owned by Arvato Digital Services, which produces Microsoft’s retail software in Europe.“Just five years ago, there were five sites in China that supplied the whole country,” Mr. Corbett says. “Now these machines are commonplace.”A prized object in the factory is the stamper, the master copy of a software product that takes great precision to produce. From a single stamper, Arvato can make tens of thousands of copies on large, rapid-fire presses.Crucially for Mr. Keating, each press leaves distinct identifying markers on the disks. He spends much of his time running CDs through a glowing, briefcase-size machine — and needs about six minutes to scan a disk and find patterns. Then he compares those markings against a database he has built of CD pressing machines worldwide.This system allows Microsoft to follow the spread of CDs from factories like the ones in China. The company conducts test purchases of software — online and in stores — and receives copies from some of the 300,000 people who have complained about running into counterfeits over the last four years.Microsoft keeps tight controls over its partners that produce CDs. But counterfeiters get around these measures by stealing stampers and presses, presenting factories with fake paperwork from Microsoft or printing in a factory when it isn’t doing official business — a practice known in the industry as producing “cabbage.”To make life harder for the counterfeiters, Microsoft plants messages in the security thread that goes into the authenticity stickers, plays tricks with lettering on its boxes and embosses a holographic film into a layer of lacquer on the CDs.To the untrained eye, the counterfeit software in Microsoft’s labs appears to be exact replicas, right down to the boxes. Chinese counterfeiters mimic the built-in hologram simply by placing a holographic sticker across the entire surface of a CD; then they use other machines to erase some of the unique identifiers found at microscopic levels.Such tactics have pushed Microsoft to create a new type of digital fingerprinting technology that scans a disk’s software code for special defects. The same techniques allow Microsoft to find malicious code that may have been injected in its products.THE grand question surrounding Microsoft’s anti-piracy razzle-dazzle is whether it’s worth the cost.The piracy problems tend to run highest in regions where there is less money to pay for Microsoft’s products. Backers of free software like the Linux operating system take aim at these areas, and Microsoft also faces growing competition from , which gives away its Office rival to consumers and sells a business version at prices far below what Microsoft typically receives.“We love Microsoft’s heavy-handedness,” says Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit organization. “We want 100 percent of the people using Windows to pay for it, because in those places where you have a lot of pirated use of Windows, we don’t have any cost advantage.”Microsoft’s critics portray its behavior as reactionary, saying the company is trying to protect old business models as new devices and services arrive.“If people are going to steal something, we sure as hell want them to steal our stuff,” says Michael Simon, the chief executive of LogMeIn, a company whose software is used in smartphones and tablets. “When you have a saturated market like Microsoft and have no growth in these devices, then it might be different.”The anti-piracy tactics employed by Microsoft rub many people in the software industry the wrong way as well.The Business Software Alliance, which is financed in part by Microsoft and conducts audits and investigations on its behalf, spends about $50 million a year going after counterfeiters and offers rewards to people who report the use of pirated software in their companies. The alliance also finances the oft-cited annual study performed by the research firm IDC that comes up with a dollar amount tied to piracy losses.Robert J. Scott, a lawyer at Scott & Scott in , contends like many others that the alliance’s figure is too high and that the group draws imprecise conclusions about the purchases that people would have made if they weren’t pirating software.“I don’t put much stock in those reports,” says Mr. Scott, who advises businesses being audited by the alliance and other software companies.The alliance defends its numbers, and Mr. Finn at Microsoft says the group’s figures are accurate. He plays down the central accusation that Microsoft would face less of a piracy threat if it just lowered prices. “We have seen no connection between piracy rates and price,” he says, citing the company’s own pricing experiments. “I think it’s a canard.”Meanwhile, Microsoft-sponsored raids and customer audits sometimes have a public relations fallout.Two years ago in India, Microsoft hired Anup Kumar, a 10-year veteran of the Central Bureau of Investigation, in part to teach the company how to push software piracy cases through the local bureaucracy. When raids followed, many local software sellers chided the government in the local press, saying it bowed to Microsoft’s will.And, last month, Microsoft altered its policies in Russia after a spate of incidents in which local security services seized computers of advocacy groups and opposition newspapers, using the pursuit of stolen software as justification. Microsoft said it would provide a blanket software license for advocacy groups and media outlets, and offer legal aid to such groups caught up in software inquiries.The protection of intellectual property has become a high-stakes political game where countries that do Microsoft’s bidding expect some kind of return on their effort, according to Joseph Menn, author of “Fatal System Error: The Hunt for the New Crime Lords Who Are Bringing Down the Internet.”“It’s part of the geopolitical process,” he said, “and Microsoft has a level of clout that a lot of other folks don’t in Washington and in other countries.”Mr. Finn argues that Microsoft’s anti-piracy efforts and training of law enforcement are a benefit to countries that want to build out their tech sectors and show they value intellectual property.“Intellectual property is a critical engine of economic growth,” Mr. Finn says. “That’s not just for large companies, but also for small businesses and entire countries. We work with governments that are realizing this is in their best interests.”'"
"'10-11-07,'0','IT is not the sort of list that automakers aspire to top: in August, the Highway Loss Data Institute, an industry research group affiliated with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, named the Cadillac Escalade as the vehicle with the highest rate of insurance claims for theft. The group reported that 2007-9 Escalades had a claim frequency of 10.8 for every 1,000 insured vehicles, about five times more often than the average passenger vehicle.In addition to claims for the entire vehicle being stolen, that figure includes break-ins and the theft of parts like chrome wheels or GPS navigation systems. The industry group noted that while the Escalade was equipped with ignition immobilizer technology, thieves could still haul the luxury S.U.V.’s away on flatbed trucks.Actually, it wasn’t nearly so tough.After the theft figures were released, news reports emerged suggesting that the Escalade’s popularity with thieves could be traced, in part, to the ease of stealing one.One demonstration of how thieves got around the antitheft electronics was provided by a Detroit television station, WXYZ, which obtained video from a security camera that showed an Escalade being stolen in 14 seconds. In the video, a thief breaks the driver’s side window and enters the truck. Quickly, an accomplice pulls up behind the Escalade and pushes it down the street.That would not work in most recent vehicles because the steering wheel lock makes it impossible to steer the stolen vehicle. But General Motors eliminated the steering lock from Escalades in January 2006, reasoning that the electronic security system provided sufficient protection.The decision to forgo a steering wheel lock, a feature that has been around for at least four decades, is not endorsed by experts. The National Insurance Crime Bureau emphasizes the value of locks as an antitheft measure, an extension of common-sense precautions, while an electronic immobilizer is only a third-layer defense.'"

"'10-11-07,'0','Dunn, an outgoing New York Irishman who had been a major star at Fox in the early 30s (notably in Frank Borzage’s “Bad Girl” and Raoul Walsh’s “Sailor’s Luck”), had by this point in his career been reduced to Poverty Row productions because of a serious drinking problem.Kazan’s direction judiciously draws on Dunn’s still functioning charisma (his character is the best-liked, least-employed man in his neighborhood), his personal history (his character is an alcoholic, whose dreams of becoming a music hall star have collapsed because of his problem) and a new kind of interiority (Dunn needs no dialogue to express his anguish and tragic resolve when, on a fateful Christmas Eve, he looks at his sleeping daughter and realizes he will never be able to give her the education she deserves). A seamless combination of canny professionalism and private confession, Dunn’s performance is all but unbearably poignant and earned him a richly deserved Oscar for best supporting actor.It would be the first of 9 Oscars (and 21 nominations) won by actors under Kazan’s direction, and he would receive Oscars for his own work on “Gentleman’s Agreement” (1947) and “On the Waterfront” (1954). Yet when the Academy’s board of directors voted him an honorary Oscar in 1999 for lifetime achievement, there were demonstrations outside the auditorium and deep divisions inside. Kazan’s decision to name names in his testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952 remained a source of bitterness in a film industry permanently traumatized by the anti-Communist witch hunts of the cold war.“On the Waterfront,” with its story of a soulful longshoreman (Marlon Brando) who testifies against the mobsters who have taken over his union, is often viewed as Kazan’s attempt to justify his actions. Yet the figure of the informer, and scenes of brutal betrayal, had haunted Kazan’s work for years, from the waitress who accuses an ex-lover of murder in the documentary-style crime drama “Boomerang!” (1947) to the legions of Judas figures who surround Brando’s Christlike revolutionary in “Viva Zapata!” (1952). Could Kazan’s testimony have been as much a consequence of his personal pathology as his politics?Whatever its root cause, Kazan’s public enactment of this primal scene of treason seems to have liberated something in his art. This filmmaker, who once hid behind “important social themes” — the simplistic treatment of anti-Semitism in “Gentleman’s Agreement,” the self-canceling racial politics of “Pinky” (1949) — became eager to explore the most agonizingly intimate details of personal relationships.Betrayal remains a central theme in “Baby Doll” (1956), a rustic sex farce as imagined by Tennessee Williams, and is both interpersonal and political in the prophetic 1957 film “A Face in the Crowd” (starring Andy Griffith as a radio performer with demagogic instincts). But the archetypical Kazan scene becomes the fumbling intimacies between inexperienced lovers: Brando and Eva Marie Saint in “On the Waterfront,” James Dean and Julie Harris in “East of Eden” (1955), Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood in “Splendor in the Grass” (1961).Both the boxed set and Mr. Scorsese’s documentary build toward “America America” (1963) as the pinnacle of Kazan’s achievement, and it is difficult not to be stirred by this nearly three-hour epic of immigration. Inspired by the story of Kazan’s uncle, an Anatolian Greek living under Turkish rule who came to America at the turn of the 20th century, the film insists on the ruthlessness (and frequent betrayals) of an intensely driven young man (Stathis Giallelis) as he burns through a succession of relatives, friends and even a sympathetic young fiancée (Linda Marsh) back home. By the time he steps off the ferry from Ellis Island, he is utterly alone, with only the ground of his new country to kiss.But Kazan may never have made a more perfect film than “Wild River,” a perennially overlooked 1960 production, in color and CinemaScope. In some ways the film feels like a summation of Kazan’s career and concerns. The setting is the mythic American South of the Tennessee Williams films; the political context is the New Deal, which helped form Kazan as a young member of the Group Theater; and the stars are Montgomery Clift, one of the first actors he helped to establish, and Lee Remick, his recent discovery from “A Face in the Crowd.”The big social themes are here too: Clift plays a field officer for the Tennessee Valley Authority sent to a small town in Alabama to chase a cranky old woman (Jo Van Fleet, Dean’s mother in “East of Eden”) off her island plantation, which the construction of a new hydroelectric dam will soon put underwater.But so is that tender, tremulous Kazan sense of innocence and intimacy, as Clift, twitchy and vulnerable, comes together with Remick, playing the young widow who is the Van Fleet character’s granddaughter and the unacknowledged heir of her matriarchal authority.Kazan’s women are often so strong as to be a bit frightening to his uncertain heroes (a theme already present in the relationship of James Dunn and Dorothy McGuire in “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn”). But here Remick’s power is both immense and benign. In an extraordinary scene, perhaps the longest in the movie, she proposes to him, offering herself as both wife and mother, partner and protector. In Kazan’s world of deceit and betrayal, she is presenting him with something exceptional: perfect trust, and the peace that comes with it.

"'10-11-07,'0','Algebra is often a turning point. Until then, math is largely the manipulation of numbers: multiplication tables, long division, fractions of pizzas. Algebra is where the abstract notion of a variable x is introduced, signifying some unknown quantity that is to be uncovered.For college-bound students, understanding algebra is critical: the College Board added algebra II to the SAT in 2005. Algebra now accounts for up to 40 percent of its math section and more than half of the ACTs.“The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Algebra Word Problems,” a new addition to the cottage industry of books to help struggling math learners, is written clearly and covers the expected topics. But it also falls into the common trap of ridiculous word problems:A tank contains 20 gallons of antifreeze solution. When it is full, it contains 15 percent antifreeze. How many gallons must be replaced by an 80 percent antifreeze solution to get 20 gallons of a 70 percent solution?Why would a student years away from a driver’s license care about antifreeze? Who the heck is calculating antifreeze concentration? No wonder so many people slog through word problems to conclude math has no bearing on their lives. (The answer: a little less than 17 gallons.)Danica McKellar, better known as Winnie Cooper, Kevin’s love interest on the TV series “The Wonder Years,” retains the rigor yet takes a friendlier approach (she substitutes the word “Happyland” for algebra in the first chapter) in her latest best seller, “Hot X: Algebra Exposed!”Aimed at teenage girls, “Hot X” is a cross between a math class and a slumber party, and a perky, self-affirming slumber party at that: interspersed among the math are anecdotes about boys and testimonials about struggles and triumphs with math.Beginning with the cover, which looks more like Cosmopolitan magazine than a math book, Ms. McKellar exhorts her readers to be smart and confident. (“I’m here to tell you that giving up on ourselves because of our own stereotypes and limited imagination is a far more destructive force than any change or obstacle ‘out there.’ ”)Those parts sometimes come across like public service announcements, but Ms. McKellar knows her math.After “The Wonder Years,” she majored in math at the University of California, Los Angeles, and even helped prove, along with a professor and fellow undergraduate, an original theorem now known as the Chayes-McKellar-Winn Theorem. “Hot X” follows her other pre-algebra books, “Math Doesn’t Suck” and “Kiss My Math,” which took a similarly irreverent tone. There are no antifreeze problems here. Ms. Mc-Kellar employs chocolate syrup instead to explain the concept.Even for someone who is not a teenage girl (me), it’s a fun read. But the underlying pedagogy is traditional. She covers greatest common factors and least common multiples. She presents the FOIL (an acronym for first, outer, inner, last) procedure of multiplying binomials, the same as I learned about 30 years ago.To Ms. McKellar, the deficiency of math teaching is not the curriculum, but the presentation. “Hot X,” she says, “is math repackaged, totally.”The next giant hurdle is calculus and its befuddling premise of adding up an infinite number of infinitesimally small numbers. A mash-up of rigorous calculus and pop culture can be found in “The Manga Guide to Calculus,” which, as its title indicates, presents calculus through Japanese-style animation. The book, by Hiroyuki Kojima, an associate professor of economics at Teikyo University in Tokyo, is part of a series of comics exploring subjects like physics, statistics and molecular biology.The framing story is of a newspaper bureau chief who gives her cub reporter calculus lessons to give more depth to her reporting. Certainly more journalists with a working knowledge of calculus would not be a bad thing, and manga lovers might find enough entertainment to carry them through the arduous lessons. The characters start spouting dialogue that sounds like textbooks, and the narrative periodically grinds to a halt for a lesson. The first chapter, for example, ends with three artless pages on how to calculate a derivative.I skipped over the math to the next comic panels — and then the plot petered out, too.I found myself wishing that Ms. McKellar, who makes math relevant without dumbing it down, would cover the rest of the high school math curriculum — and that someone would do the equivalent for boys.'"
"'10-11-07,'0','Some courses have always required the professor’s permission or a portfolio review. But with the cost of higher education soaring, and top colleges teeming with class valedictorians, high expectations are even higher.“Parents have this incredible pressure throughout the school years to build a résumé, and when your child finally gets to college and the competition’s still there, you think, wait a second — when can you finally buy the experience that you want?” says Rob Lippincott, whose daughters attend the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Vermont. “It’s exasperating!”After taking one introductory writing class at Oberlin, Theresa Traber’s daughter, Francesca, submitted a portfolio for the next level and was locked out. Her audition for a theater class was likewise a flop. “It didn’t surprise me because the writing program at Oberlin is pretty elite and elitist, but I was pretty angry at the time,” Ms. Traber recalls. “Just because she wants to do medicine, does she have to do that exclusively?”“Part of the reason Frannie went to Oberlin,” she says, “was to get a liberal arts education, even though she’s a science person.”The liberal arts tradition of studying broadly goes only so far. Schools want to maintain small class sizes, and faculty is limited. Top professors want the most promising students. Universities want the most accomplished alumni.But, parents wonder, when can a student acquire new skills or develop budding interests if not in college? Why should a student who got into the Ivy League have to re-audition? And if a student wants to try the stage, even if she can’t act worth a darn, or chirp along with the choir, aren’t parents paying for the privilege?“People come in with a consumer mindset,” says Matthew Santirocco, dean of the College of Arts and Science at New York University. “And I agree with them: if you’re getting a private education, you should be able to take the courses you want, when you want them. But whether there’s a sense of entitlement or not, there’s a university mindset, too.”While N.Y.U. tries to meet student demand for coveted courses — language, creative writing, popular seminars — he says, “We will always have wait lists. We have to be realistic.”Sylvia Watanabe, chairwoman of Oberlin’s creative writing department, says this in defense of selectivity: “We can’t accommodate the many students who come to Oberlin who want to major in creative writing.” But, she says, being choosy benefits the most dedicated. “The higher that bar is set, the more writing students feel they can accomplish. We get some pretty astonishing work coming out of our courses at the 200 level.”Indeed, creative writing classes are not for dilettantes.“We don’t teach people to write — they are already writers,” says Ms. Oates, a professor in Princeton’s creative writing program. Ms. Oates, along with literary luminaries like Edmund White, Chang-rae Lee, Paul Muldoon and Jeffrey Eugenides, read student portfolios and rank them to determine which students qualify to take a class. “These are not composition classes for students to learn to write,” she says. “They are fiction-writing workshops for people who know how to write.”Zachary Solomon, a senior at Princeton majoring in comparative literature, didn’t qualify when he submitted poetry his freshman year. “Those who got in received a congratulatory e-mail, and the rest of us were wait listed or rejected,” he says. “It was kind of like the college application process.” He ultimately gained admittance his sophomore year.And pity the student who has never set foot in a darkroom. To take any class within Princeton‘s photography program, students must submit a portfolio and undergo a lengthy interview about their experience prior to college. “I took photography for four years in high school,” says Grace Remington, who qualified her sophomore year.Colleges often track students early, favoring those fine arts, engineering or pre-med students who dutifully log in prerequisites and barrel along within their major. Professors will prefer upperclassmen, majors and minors, and “A” students, especially when selecting among students for advanced classes and seminars for which they have discretion.As a sophomore at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, Amber Gibson has had no trouble getting into the journalism courses she needs. But she is not so privileged when it comes to other subjects.“For my electives, I get no priority,” she says. At registration, when Ms. Gibson put in her “shopping cart” a popular Russian mafia class whose professor had great ratings, the course was already full.At Yale, “Studies in Grand Strategy” has become, as the historian Paul Kennedy puts it, “a cult among cult classes.” The course is co-taught by John Lewis Gaddis and Charles Hill, a onetime Reagan adviser. This year, John D. Negroponte, a former deputy secretary of state, is helping out. Henry Kissinger makes annual vists.“If you’re an ambitious Yalie and you want to be president or secretary of state, it has become a thing that you have to take this class,” Dr. Kennedy says. Each year, around 100 undergraduates compete for 15 spots (nine go to graduate and professional students). This year, Dr. Kennedy says, he and his colleagues expanded the class to two groups of 24.Drew Beattie, who taught the painting course coveted by Windsor Hanger, says winnowing his class is his least favorite part of teaching. “You try to extend the range of people in the class, because the opportunity for group discussion and critique is enormous.” But in the end, he says, classes are often filled with majors or underclassmen strongly leaning toward the concentration.“You can imagine the uproar if you’re a major and find out the professor has an interesting conversation with a physics major and lets that person in instead.”Julie Sue Auslander was initially peeved at the “narrow inflexibility” of Tufts when her son, Ryan, was not allowed to take the level of French class he wanted. Apparently, having lived in two French-speaking countries, his spoken skills were considered too strong relative to his less-than-stellar grammar.“I equate it to a five-star hotel,” she says. “If you’re paying five-star prices, you should get a five-star experience.” At a five-star hotel, she explains, if you ask for something outside the box, they get it for you. “He wasn’t asking for something special,” she says. “To me, the experience should be personalized to his needs.”But after conveying those sentiments to Ryan, he said she had it all wrong. In one of his computer courses, he told her, “the professor’s philosophy is to let everyone in.” He complained of “too many people with too many levels, and people weren’t doing the work.”Her son’s point led her to reconsider. She adds now: “Maybe being overly accommodating doesn’t end up accommodating anybody.”'"
"'10-11-07,'0','Women treated bodies and faces alike, independent of short- or long-term interest. Men, however, made a distinction between face and figure, depending on their intent. Among male participants, 25 percent of those who were told to consider the person as a long-term partner chose to see the figure, compared with 51 percent who chose the body if they were looking at a potential short-term partner.Here is how the authors explain it: a woman’s face and body signify different things, they say. To put it in clinical terms, facial features are cues of youth and health, and features like large eyes are feminine because “they are sensitive to the rise in levels that accompanies and persists through a woman’s reproductive lifespan.” This would indicate long-term reproductive value; that is, the time a woman has left to reproduce.The body, meanwhile, signifies fertility in the here and now. A young and comely pregnant woman, for example, would have a high reproductive value but zero current fertility potential — she is clearly already taken. Evolutionary psychology theory holds that men value current fertility (body) more in a short-term mate and reproductive value (face) in the long term.But there may be more to a pretty face. “The face is a signifier of emotion and character,” said Roy F. Baumeister, the author of a new book, “Is There Anything Good About Men?” (Oxford University Press). “Men who want a long-term relationship aren’t just interested in reproductive value; they’re also looking for emotional intimacy.”Does the study sell men’s sights short? “One of the biggest limitations is we didn’t ask participants why they chose face or body,” Ms. Confer said. “We just assumed they were looking to evaluate attractiveness, but it could have been many other things — personality type, whether there would be a connection. We didn’t even think of it afterward — it was an oversight.” Seems as if it’s not only what men look at in potential mates, but also how they view them that counts.'"

"'10-11-07,'0','It is generally agreed that humor is subjective. Looking across the recent crop of picture books that specialize in gently absurd comedy, one can imagine grown-ups wondering if kids will get the joke. But that would underestimate even very young children’s ability to appreciate the incongruous, the nonsensical, the flat-out eccentric.“A Sick Day for Amos McGee,” by Philip C. Stead, is a case in point. It delightfully takes its loony scenario for granted. We meet Amos, a stooped-shouldered older gentleman dressed in a moss-green three-piece suit, getting ready for his day as a zookeeper. With a sweet smile, Amos goes about his daily chores. He plays chess with the delicately shaded pink elephant, lets a tortoise win races and sits with one of the penguins, who is very shy.One day when Amos comes down with a cold, the animals travel to his home to care for their caregiver. Observant readers will notice tiny surprises hidden in plain sight: a red balloon, a tiny mouse and a sparrow popping up here and there in the story. Erin E. Stead, the illustrator, overlays her pencil sketches with gentle tones of pink, peach, blue and green, and bright red spots that belie the deceptive ordinariness of the text.With his new book, “How Rocket Learned to Read,” Tad Hills (“Duck & Goose”) brings a sweet but not saccharine touch to a common struggle of childhood. Rocket is a fuzzy spotted dog who loves to chase leaves, chew sticks, sniff around the neighborhood and nap. One day a small yellow bird disturbs him. “ ‘Aha! My first student! Wonderful!’ she sang. Rocket was confused. ‘Student? I’m not a —’ ‘But if I am your teacher,’ the bird interrupted, ‘then you must be my student.’ Rocket found it hard to argue with this bird.” She tempts him by reading aloud the story of an unlucky dog named Buster who lost his favorite bone — and thus begins Rocket’s growing desire to read for himself.We know that birds aren’t teachers and that dogs don’t read, but that doesn’t stop us from enjoying the process of Rocket’s learning how to write his letters, practicing the “wondrous, mighty, gorgeous alphabet” and sounding out the G and many Rs in Mr. Barker the dog’s growl: “GRRRRRRRRR!”What child hasn’t brought home a wild creature and asked — “Can I keep it?” — only to hear the parent say that this frog, spider or chipmunk would make a terrible pet. In “Children Make Terrible Pets,” Peter Brown turns the classic picture book imagery of animals who act like people (or “people in animal suits,” as it’s said in the field) on its head with Lucy, an over-the-top feminine bear cub who finds a boy and wants to keep him as a pet. “Oh! My! Gosh! You are the cutest critter in the whole forest!” she says when she discovers him. And since his language sounds to her like “squeak,” she names him Squeaker. Joyfully animated illustrations depict Lucy in a pink tutu and Squeaker as a typical boy in a striped shirt and sneakers. The way each page is framed in a faux wood finish gives the pictures the look of a vintage television console.'"

"'10-11-08,'0','Even before Buster Posey and Brian Wilson embraced on the mound at the end of the World Series last week, the free-agent season was upon us. More than 200 players are now free agents, free to negotiate and sign with teams of their choosing, most often the highest bidder. It may look chaotic from the outside, with one player signing for $8 million over two years and another for $80 million over five years, but spending has followed a fairly consistent pattern.There has never been a team composed only of minimum-salary (or replacement-level) players, but based on what we have seen from the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Detroit Tigers and the Florida Marlins over the years, it is believed you could win 50 to 55 games with such a roster (for the sake of argument, let’s assume it would go 52-110).From that assumption, we can estimate the number of wins up for grabs each year. The 30 teams average 81 wins, so there are 29 wins per team (870 total) to be had by signing better than replacement-level players. In 2010, teams spent about $2.4 billion above the league minimum on player salaries, or about $2.7 million per additional win.That gives us the cost of a win added, but how many wins can a player add? A number of statistics attempt to convert a player’s contribution into wins added. I’m going to use Wins Above Replacement (WAR). It takes a player’s batting, pitching, fielding and base running; estimates the number of runs added or subtracted from the team total; then converts those runs into a wins added total (typically a 10-run difference equals one win). The Most Valuable Player award winners are usually eight-win players, and most starters are two- to three-win players.In a truly open market, Evan Longoria, who added eight wins as the Rays’ third baseman last year, would probably make as much as anyone in the game. But because he is three years from free agency, the system dictates he will make $2 million next year. Certainly a good payday, but in a system in which all were free agents, he would probably be worth $20 million (eight wins at $2.7 million per win) or more per season.'"

"'10-11-08,'0','SAN DIEGO (AP) — With American troops in the thick of the fighting in Afghanistan, the new commandant of the Marines Corps says now is not the time to overturn the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy prohibiting gay men and women from openly serving in the military.“This is not a social thing,” said Gen. James F. Amos, the Marines commandant. “This is combat effectiveness.”Last month, the Pentagon was forced to lift its ban for eight days after a federal judge in California ordered the military to do so. The Justice Department has appealed, and a federal appeals court granted a temporary stay of the injunction.General Amos said repeal of the policy could have unique consequences for the Marines.“There’s risk involved,” he said. “I’m trying to determine how to measure that risk.”The corps is exempt from a Defense Department rule for troops to have private living quarters except at basic training or officer candidate schools. The Marines puts two people in each room to promote a sense of unity.'"
"'10-11-08,'0','“The ‘Millionaires Club’ is part of our strategy of investing in I.P. targeting children,” said Lifeng Wang, the 37-year-old president of Xing Xing, referring to intellectual property. “The danger of outsourcing effects is we get caught in a price war with other Chinese animation studios,” Mr. Wang said.A Squared and Xing Xing have struck similar deals for two other animated AOL Kids Web series. “Gigi and the Green Team” features the supermodel Gisele Bundchen as a superhero fighting for the environment, and “Martha and Friends” has a 10-year old Martha Stewart running an event-planning company from a tree house.”Gigi,” to which Ms. Bundchen has licensed rights but does not actively participate, started showing in Brazil last month, whereas “Martha,” to which Ms. Stewart has also licensed only rights to her character, is planned for a December premiere on AOL Kids.Xing Xing is also collaborating with the National Wildlife Federation on “Wild Animal Baby Explorers,” an animated series introducing preschoolers to nature that has run on some public television stations in the United States.Like many of its compatriots here, Xing Xing is getting help for its global ambitions with the same sort of government support that has propelled other Chinese industries like automobiles and clean energy. The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television last year announced a policy to set up financing for and give tax breaks to movie, television and animation projects.The government of Jiangsu Province, in southern China, is one of the largest stakeholders in a $45 million fund that has helped Xing Xing convert a gutted steel mill in the city of Wuxi into a futuristic studio. It is the company’s third site in China, which Mr. Wang says will eventually house 200 employees.Xing Xing already employs more than 300 computer graphics programmers, artists and producers in its Beijing headquarters, and an additional 30 employees in its branch in Anhui province.Despite its production deals and state backing, Xing Xing knows that global success is hardly assured.The industry’s cautionary example is the animated film “Thru the Moebius Strip,” about a young boy who travels to a distant galaxy to rescue his father. China’s first feature-length animation in 3-D, the effort cost the Institute of Digital Media Technology, a Shenzhen-based animation company, $20 million to produce. But when it was shown at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, international distributors showed no interest.“Moebius” flopped within China, too, taking in only $3 million domestically.China simply has too little experience catering to international audiences. While billions of dollars in government support for the industry has helped animation studios proliferate in China — to more than 10,000 last year, compared with only 120 in 2002 — most still churn out low-quality cartoons for domestic distribution.That is why Xing Xing is among a handful of next-generation animation studios that operate their own training schools. The Xing Xing Digital University, which enrolls over 1,500 students and aims to recruit its best graduates, offers accredited two-year certificates for full-time students and academic credit for students from other universities.Even so, Xing Xing “can’t approach world-class Western animation companies in terms of employing top-notch programmers,” said Steven D. Katz, executive producer at Xing Xing. “Our biggest problem is know-how.”Distribution within China presents its own challenges. Consider what steps “Secret Millionaires Club” must take before it can be shown on television in China, for example. In addition to being dubbed in Mandarin, it must first be approved by the state radio, film and television administration, which censors content deemed politically sensitive.But Mr. Wang, who hopes to begin showing the series here next year, anticipates the animated Mr. Buffett will have “no problem” getting past the censors to hundreds of millions of young Chinese.“Teaching the principles of making money,” he said, “is generally regarded as a healthy thing here.”'"
"'10-11-08,'0','DreamWorks Animation has another hit on its hands: “Megamind,” the story of a supervillain turned superhero, which reached No. 1 with an estimated $47.7 million in its opening weekend at the North American box office, according to Hollywood.com, a compiler of box-office statistics. That result is better than the opening for the studio’s hit “How to Train Your Dragon,” which sold $43.7 million in its first weekend, but lower than initial results for its pictures like “Kung Fu Panda” and “Monsters vs. Aliens.” In an unusual move “Megamind,” distributed by Paramount Pictures, saved a substantial part of its television marketing push to avoid competing with midterm election ads; 40 percent of the film’s TV advertising budget was spent over the past week. The comedy “Due Date” (Warner Brothers) was second, with a strong $33.5 million. The Lionsgate drama “For Colored Girls,” adapted by Tyler Perry from Ntozake Shange’s seminal play, “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf,” was third with a solid $20.1 million. The ensemble action film “RED” (Summit Entertainment) chugged away in fourth place with $8.9 million for a new total of $71.9 million. “Saw 3D” (Lionsgate) was fifth with about $8.2 million for a new total of $38.8 million.'"
"'10-11-08,'0','“There is a sense that this is the closing of a circle,” Mr. McKenzie said. “Alicia has closure. She is acknowledged worldwide as one of the great ballerinas of history.” Ballet Theater, which performed here twice last week as part of the 22nd International Ballet Festival, last visited Cuba as a company in 1960, shortly before the United States severed commercial and diplomatic ties with this Communist country.The visit was part of a recent spate of cultural exchanges, including a weeklong residency in October by the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. American officials say they favor more person-to-person contacts with Cuba, despite a lack of progress since President Obama took office toward ending decades of political animosity.Four Ballet Theater principals, including the Cuban-born dancer José Manuel Carreño, stayed on to dance in weekend gala performances after the rest of the 80-strong contingent left on Friday. Eight dancers from New York City Ballet, performing under the auspices of the Cuban Artists Fund, also performed during the festival, which ended on Sunday.Despite the embargo Ms. Alonso strove to ensure that the loop connecting Cuban and American ballet endured. Mr. McKenzie came to Cuba to dance Siegfried in “Swan Lake” in 1986 and was struck by the talent of a young Cuban dancer who, he discovered years later, was Mr. Carreño.Mr. Carreño joined American Ballet Theater in 1995 and is credited by colleagues with helping the company reach a new level.“He’s an incredible partner and amazingly coordinated,” Mr. McKenzie said, adding that he had helped the other dancers improve their skills at turns.Last week Mr. Carreño was back in his hometown, on the cusp of retiring from the company, signing autographs and enchanting the Cuban audience with a sexy, Latin-infused solo in Jerome Robbins’s “Fancy Free.”During a frenetic five days the American and Cuban dancers got a taste of each other’s worlds. Americans took class with Cuban teachers, compared notes on technique and musicality, worked with Cuban stage crews and donated shoes and other dance material.The Americans were impressed by the Cuban dancers’ spirit and athleticism and the judgment and diversity of their audience; the Cubans were fascinated by the range of choreography and the apparently effortless fluidity with which the Americans moved.“We’re just not used to seeing this kind of choreography and when we do, it makes a huge impression,” said Yonah Junior Acosta, a soloist with the Cuban National Ballet and a nephew of Carlos Acosta, a principal guest artist with the Royal Ballet in London.“We’d love to dance other things, like MacMillan,” he added, referring to the British choreographer Kenneth MacMillan.As the visit wore on, the question lingered of how to strengthen the bonds forged in Havana. Mr. McKenzie said he was pondering the possibility of choreographic workshops and other educational programs.“With every closing of a circle, you begin a new one,” he said. “It’s got to pass to the next generation.”The current generation of Cuban dancers has made its mark on the international stage, from Mr. Carreño and Xiomara Reyes, also a principal with Ballet Theater, to the sisters Lorena Feijóo of the San Francisco Ballet and Lorna Feijóo of the Boston Ballet.But the pride that comes with their international fame is bittersweet. Every dancer who goes overseas leaves behind a gap.“We lose so many wonderful dancers,” Mr. Acosta said. “It is such a shame.”Ms. Reyes, who left Cuba just shy of her 20th birthday in 1992, closed her own circle last week when she was reunited with a half sister and two nieces, as well as many people who had trained and worked with her as a young dancer. She said she was so nervous about seeing her city again and dancing before the expectant, and exigent, Cuban public that she had barely slept.Carlos Alberto, wardrobe designer for the National Ballet School, where Ms. Reyes studied, wept when she ducked into his cramped costume department on Thursday.“My girl, my girl, so many years,” he muttered, clasping her head.“She left, and she realized her goal,” Mr. Alberto said later. “And now she has come back.”Ms. Reyes took the stage of the Karl Marx Theater that night to a surge of applause and danced the Diana and Acteon pas de deux with the Argentine dancer Herman Cornejo.The two drew cheers from an audience of 4,400, thrilled to see a ballerina who left at the beginning of her career and had returned to dance for them at her zenith.As applause filled the vast theater, Ms. Reyes curtsied to receive a white bouquet. Then she flitted to the edge of the stage, bowed her head low and laid the flowers before her, a gesture of thanks to the public from whom she had, for so long, been parted.'"
"'10-11-08,'0','“The challenge facing the president,” Mr. Bacevich said, “will be to identify leaders who will provide him with disinterested advice, informed by a concern for the national interest, and, in doing so, to avoid either the appearance or the reality of politicizing the senior leadership.”At the top of the new pantheon of military power, the president needs a heavyweight to succeed Mr. Gates, an unexpected holdover from the Bush administration who stayed longer than many expected to become perhaps the most influential member of the Obama cabinet.White House officials say the president is not prepared to announce any decisions on his new slate of Pentagon and military leaders for next year.But speculation for the top Pentagon job in recent days has included two respected veterans on military matters, both with bipartisan credentials and hands-on experience: , a deputy defense secretary in the Clinton administration who now leads the while running the Defense Policy Board, an advisory panel to Mr. Gates; and Representative Ike Skelton of , who lost his seat last week and with it the chairmanship of the House Armed Services Committee.Another name certain to be on Mr. Obama’s list is Michele A. Flournoy, currently the Pentagon’s under secretary for policy and one of the foremost national security specialists of the up-and-coming generation. Her appointment would allow Mr. Obama to claim another first in naming a woman to become defense secretary, something he could also accomplish by moving into the job from secretary of state.Other possible candidates include , the Navy secretary who formerly served as governor of and ambassador to ; Senator of , an Army veteran; and , a former Navy secretary.It also is tricky to pick members of the Joint Chiefs, who are not only the president’s senior military advisers on questions of war but also the leaders of the individual military services, at the fulcrum of competing missions and constituencies that are never easy to balance.A thorough revamping of the high command is especially complex at a time of persistent challenges on so many fronts, like the wars in Afghanistan and , the threats from and and the challenges from and , all while facing the constant risk of a terrorist attack.The new military leadership, after years of war and economic crisis, also has to cope with strains on military budgets, while caring for the health and morale of a force that simultaneously must be modernized.There are lingering strains between top civilian aides to Mr. Obama and the military brass, over issues as diverse as how to fight and wind down the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and how to allow military service by openly gay troops.Any commander in chief is theoretically free to replace his top civilian and military subordinates whenever he chooses, but it rarely happens all at once.Traditionally, a new president appoints a new defense secretary and allows the chiefs to serve out their tours, which tend to fall more or less randomly across a president’s term in office. Mr. Obama was the first to carry over a defense secretary who had served a president of a different party, and Mr. Gates’s expected departure now falls coincidentally along with four members of the six-person Joint Chiefs. (The got a new commandant, Gen. James F. Amos, last month, and the chief, Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, retires in 2012 unless he is rotated into another senior position, which is possible.)The changes in 2011 are so unusual, and the national security risks today so significant, that General Cartwright, the vice chairman, offered to retire a year early, so that a new officer would be in place for some continuity, according to Pentagon and administration officials familiar with the discussions.But General Cartwright — known for his fluency in nuts-and-bolts issues like missile defense, cyberwarfare and procurement — has been described as one of the president’s favorite officers, and was asked to stay on. He is very likely on the list of those who would be considered for promotion to chairman.When Mr. Obama had opportunities in recent weeks to replace top members of his White House inner circle, including his chief of staff and his national security adviser, he opted to replace his inaugural “team of rivals,” populated by outsiders, by promoting trusted confidants and moving toward creating, in essence, a team of insiders.So the questions before Mr. Obama include trust and comfort and assurances that his policy decisions will be executed the way he wants.The expected candidates are all familiar to the White House, and all those on any list of suitable officers have blue-chip résumés but differing temperaments.One of the first questions the president will have to answer for himself is what to do with Gen. , the former Iraq commander asked to rush to Afghanistan when Mr. Obama relieved two commanders there in a row.Supporters say that General Petraeus has earned the chairman’s job by reason of experience, intellect and sacrifice, but that may not satisfy some political advisers around the president, who still resent the officers involved in the Afghanistan- review last year. General Petraeus also could remain longer in Afghanistan or could be offered the job of Army chief or that of supreme allied commander in , a post once held by and so hardly a dead end.In addition to Generals Cartwright and Petraeus, another potential candidate for chairman is Adm. , currently the commander and one of the Navy’s most intellectual officers; he likewise could be slotted into the job of chief of naval operations.Three other highly regarded Army officers remain in the hunt for any of the top jobs. They include Gen. , a three-time Iraq commander now in charge of the military’s Joint Forces Command; Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who had two tours in Iraq before serving as acting commander of American forces in the and who now oversees Army training and doctrine; and Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, a two-time Iraq commander who is the Army’s vice chief of staff, with a focus on improving care for wounded soldiers.'"
"'10-11-08,'0','But the government, and the austerity measures, are not out of the woods.Many Greeks are furious about the measures, which have raised taxes, lowered salaries and left them with a pervasive feeling that they are caught in the cogs of larger economic forces. Their anger has spilled over into waves of street protests, including one in May in which three people died.Last week, a series of letter bombs sent to embassies and European leaders by young guerrillas compounded the government’s troubles, renewing fears of a return of domestic terrorism.Above all, many Greeks do not think they should have to pay for what they consider the government’s mistakes.“We didn’t eat the money,” said Evi Simopoulou, 29, a computer programmer in Athens. “They ate the money.”Indeed, as the international-minded Mr. Papandreou struggles to convince the world that he has what it takes to push through changes to keep Greece competitive and the euro strong, the Greek people remain one main obstacle in his path.“It’s easier to satisfy the Greek public by slowing down on the bitter medicine that the Greek economy needs, but it will be much more difficult to satisfy the foreign markets,” said Theodore Couloumbis, the vice president of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy in Athens. “Because if he tries to satisfy the Greek public, potential voters, then he’s going to lose the international markets.”The elections on Sunday, while nominally about selecting leaders for new regional and municipal administrative districts, were the first political test of the austerity measures.But by early Monday, official projections based on 10 percent of the vote showed Socialist candidates ahead in 7 of 13 districts, though three of those races were extremely close. It was a far cry from Mr. Papandreou’s victory in the general election last year, which he won by a wide margin.The Interior Ministry estimated abstentions at around 40 percent. Many Greeks said they did not see the point of voting if the country’s fate was in the hands of the European Union and the monetary fund.“We owe so much, how are we ever going to manage to pay it back?” said a retired state pension fund manager, who gave her name only as Ekaterini. “The government is telling us they’re doing things, but they have to do more to convince me that these measures are going to have an outcome.”Both the center-right New Democracy opposition party and some harder-left parties campaigned against the austerity measures, although neither has offered a credible alternative.The main advocate for the reforms has been Mr. Papandreou. He is essentially trying to overhaul a welfare state and a political culture that his party helped create, largely under the leadership of his father, Andreas Papandreou, who served as prime minister three times between 1981 and 1996 and was founder of the Socialist party, Pasok.While critics blame the Socialists for building up a patronage system that has hindered Greece’s ability to stay competitive, others say that because Mr. Papandreou is a Socialist, this has given him more leverage over labor unions and other vested interests to carry out painful reforms.“At least this government has taken steps to deal with problems and start changing this society,” said Ilias Kastoriadis, 35, a bank clerk. “It took the rescue money, so it had to take the measures. There was no real choice.”'"

"'10-11-09,'0','Ashland, the owner of Valvoline, said it would sell its distribution business to the private equity firm TPG Capital for $930 million in cash. The news sent Ashland shares up more than 9 percent.By leaving the distribution business, Ashland will be able to focus solely on plans to grow in the high-margin specialty chemical sector. TPG, meanwhile, is gaining a highly lucrative asset that is likely to grow in value as the economy recovers.Ashland’s distribution business ships chemicals, plastics and other materials in North America and Europe for both Ashland and competitors.

"'10-11-09,'0','“Democrats would be in better shape, and would accomplish more, with a smaller and more ideologically cohesive caucus,” Ari Berman, a writer for The Nation, argued in a New York Times Op-Ed in October. In an e-mail after the election, Jim Dean, who now runs the liberal group Democracy for America, founded by his brother Howard, told supporters that the progressive candidates who lost had been victimized by “corporate Democrats who refused to stand up and fight for real change.”The theory here, embraced by a lot of the most prominent liberal bloggers and activists, is that centrist Democrats doomed the party when they blocked liberals in Congress from making good on President Obama’s promise of bold change. Specifically, they refused to adopt a more populist stance toward business and opposed greater stimulus spending and a government-run health care plan. As a result, the thinking goes, frustrated voters rejected the party for its timidity.There are a few strange things about this argument, even beyond the contention that American voters — 41 percent of whom described themselves as “conservative” this year, compared with 32 percent in 2006 — somehow deem Congress to be insufficiently liberal.For one thing, many of these same liberal activists were saying something very different in 2006, when Rahm Emanuel, who was then overseeing House campaigns for the party, recruited a slate of less ideological candidates to compete in more conservative districts. Some leading bloggers then — who are now proponents of the Blame the Blue Dogs theory — proclaimed themselves to be against ideological litmus tests, arguing that the most important thing was to choose candidates who could actually win.This was the same moment when Howard Dean, the unofficial leader of the progressive movement, was telling anyone who would listen that the Southern guy with a Confederate flag in his truck, as Mr. Dean invariably described him, should be a Democratic voter, too. The whole point of Mr. Dean’s “50-state strategy” as party chairman was to find candidates who could win everywhere.Apparently it was easier for liberal activists to countenance ideological diversity when they were out of power. Now that the party has had to make the requisite compromises in order to pass major legislation, such a “big tent” vision of governing no longer seems so appealing.Second, while House Republicans have now managed to cobble together a majority that is more or less ideologically cohesive, history would suggest that the same feat isn’t so easy for Democrats, who have actually never succeeded in pulling it off. Even during the great heyday of Democratic government in the 20th century, when the party enacted Social Security and Medicare and civil rights legislation, its dominance was possible only because Democrats had shaped a majority coalition made up of Northern liberals and Southern conservatives.Similarly, it’s hard to imagine how Democrats in this last Congress could have assembled a majority and passed the president’s agenda — including what is arguably the most consequential social legislation since the Great Society — without having fielded victorious candidates in a lot of conservative districts in 2006 and 2008. In a memo just before the election, titled “Why Liberals Need Heath Shuler,” Jon Cowan and Anne Kim of the centrist group Third Way summed it up this way: “Call them ‘fake Democrats,’ but they delivered a real majority.”In the end, perhaps this is why Ms. Pelosi won’t be so quick to marginalize the remaining Blue Dogs if she retains her role as leader — no matter what her liberal supporters would prefer. The departing speaker, as everyone knows, can count votes. And for Ms. Pelosi, now 70, to write off the conservative districts where Democrats just lost could well mean writing off her chance of becoming speaker again.'"
"'10-11-09,'0','Investors feel better when risky bonds come with flak jackets. Drive-by deals, so named for skipping the conventional road-show route in favor of a one-day turnaround, do not give investors much time to ensure they are protected. Shoddier bondholder provisions in several recent, often rushed, deals indicate many are not.MetroPCS is a case in point. The company, a cellphone service provider, secured itself considerably more leeway than other similar borrowers in a hastily arranged $500 million sale last week. To ensure they are paid back, bondholders like to restrict a heavily indebted company’s spending, investment and borrowing. As a general rule, high-yield issuers have been able to tap only about 5 percent of their available assets without violating bondholder rights, according to Moody’s Investors Service. MetroPCS has access to nearly 30 percent.It gets worse. MGM Resorts, the casino operator, and Tenet Healthcare, the hospital chain, represent the worst credit available. Both are rated junk — Ca1 from Moody’s. Deals light on covenants are nothing new, yet both still-recovering companies managed to arrange debt with the more lenient provisions reserved for those with far less risk of missing payments.Of course, most of the money is being used to refinance more expensive existing debt. And such balance sheet management is healthy, especially when rock-bottom interest rates make capital cheaper. Yet issuers are taking advantage of the fast and furious race for yield to weaken bondholder protections wherever possible.The Federal Reserve’s commitment to low interest rates means there will probably be more opportunities. With corporate defaults slowing and investors craving better returns than the shrunken yield on government debt, few will have the will to pass up high-yield bonds. Junk bonds have generated around 15 percent this year against barely 1 percent on a five-year Treasury note.Still, investors should beware how creative the bond engineers are getting. They have already wheeled out the “springing lien,” which sounds like it just might bounce right back into buyers’ faces. Momentive Performance Materials, a specialty chemicals maker, included the provision in a $635 million offering. Instead of providing collateral upfront, the company will provide it later, when it is finished being pledged to other debt holders. When promises replace secured holdings, it is surely time for better armor.'"

Anti-immigrant sentiment is on the rise in Europe and asylum policies are strained by an influx of refugees.After visa requirements for citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia were relaxed, asylum applications from those three Balkan countries grew significantly.Some European governments feel that because of corruption and weak institutions, Albania and Bosnia, which would like to join the union, cannot cope with issues likes illegal immigration and drug trafficking.'"
"'10-11-09,'0','Both planetary science and cosmology are ripe for big news in 2011, the former in its effort to find planets beyond the Earth and the solar system that could harbor water and thus life as we know it, and the latter in the unending effort to figure out what the universe is made of.Finding out how common habitable planets are around Sun-like stars is the mission of NASA’s Kepler satellite, which has been trailing the Earth’s orbit of the Sun ever since its launching in March 2009, staring at 156,000 stars in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra looking for telltale blips in starlight caused by planets passing in front of them. Last June, the Kepler team released a list of 350 stars thought to be harboring planets, but at the same time, and over the protests of some astronomers, they held back the data on 400 more stars that they wanted to check out over the summer.In February, the Kepler 400 are expected to be released. The smallest planet on the previous list was about one and a half times the diameter of the Earth. The Kepler scientists will not say anything about the stars on the withheld list or their candidate planets, but in an e-mail message Natalie Batalha, a co-investigator on Kepler, said it would not be unreasonable to suspect that there is a smattering of planet candidates smaller than that on the new list. More small planets could also show up as more data is analyzed, she said.The discovery of an Earth-size planet would be another step on a path that planet hunters have been following for the past 15 years, since the first exoplanet was discovered. About 500 exoplanets are now known, but most of these have been giant ones circling too close to their stars, because they are easiest to find. As techniques have been refined, smaller planets have come into view, and a recent survey by University of California astronomers, Andrew Howard and Geoffrey Marcy, concluded that about a quarter of all Sun-like stars should have Earth-size planets.If indeed there are Earth-size planets in the Kepler 400, however, Dr. Batalha and others hasten to point out, these would not quite be the planets of our dreams. An Earth-like planet — that is to say, one that is the right temperature for water and thus life as we know it — would take about a year to complete a circuit around a star like the Sun.Kepler would be lucky to have seen even one blip from a planet in such an orbit in the data analyzed so far and would need an additional year or two to record enough blips to determine that it was indeed in a habitable, water-friendly orbit around a star like our Sun.'"
"'10-11-09,'0','To some analysts, these mini flash crashes are a sign that another big one is possible, if not probable. Others say these abrupt reversals are simply the way modern, lightning-quick markets work, and that investors had better get used to it.The crashes continue even as Washington regulators investigate the structure of modern markets and as a report traced the main trigger of May’s big crash to a poorly timed trade by a mutual fund in Kansas. Regulators have put in place circuit breakers to halt trading and reset prices in case stocks plunge. But some analysts fear that one day, these mechanisms could be overwhelmed.And to corporate executives caught in the middle, it is all just plain hair-raising — and still puzzling.That September afternoon, with fearful investors on the phone from New York, Mark F. Mulhern, Progress Energy’s chief financial officer, was told by the exchanges that it was all a mistake. A wayward keystroke by a trader somewhere had unleashed a powerful computer algorithm that had devoured Progress Energy’s stock in moments.Progress Energy stock was trading at about $44.57 a share, and a dealer at an unidentified brokerage firm had entered a mistaken sell order into a computer that instantly drove the price to $4.57. Dozens of trades were declared void, and after a five-minute halt, normal trading resumed.Mr. Mulhern says he still does not really know what caused the sell-off — and worries what mini flash crashes like this one are doing to investors’ confidence in the stock market.“It is a little disconcerting when a trade like this could cause this kind of havoc,” he said. “It has got implications for the confidence in our markets. I don’t know what caused it, to tell the truth. The one hesitation all investors have about the market is the drift to so much electronic trading. It is so fast and real time, you have to wonder a little bit how these things happen, and can the regulatory procedures, the stop measures, can they really keep up with the technology?”Robert F. Drennan Jr., the vice president for investor relations at Progress Energy, said he had reviewed the trading records and had noticed unusual trading activity in the run-up to the plunge. He said Progress Energy was not a heavily traded stock; it may go for several seconds without a trade. But before the price fell, “There was a big ramp-up in the trades, hundreds of trades a second,” he said.Mr. Mulhern said he received calls from worried investors, including hedge funds: “When the hedge funds call up and start to complain, you know you have a problem.”The fall set off circuit breakers the exchanges had put in place after May 6. The circuit breakers are intended to halt trading of a stock for five minutes if its price changes by 10 percent within a five-minute period, and thus to stop panic from spreading.In the case of Progress Energy, the circuit breaker worked on the New York Exchange, Mr. Mulhern said, but trading happens so fast that before other exchanges could also halt trading, the company’s stock price continued to fall on the Nasdaq, all the way down to $4.57.On Oct. 26, a surge in the shares of Aaron’s, the furniture and appliance retailer, also set off the new circuit breaker. Gilbert L. Danielson, chief financial officer, said he did not know what had caused it. “I really have no answer for that, but it would be interesting to know,” he said.Some take heart in the fact that the circuit breakers often work well. “With all the millions of different trades out there, we have only a dozen of these,” said Patrick Healy, chief executive of the Issuer Advisory Group. “It’s actually pretty good.”But critics worry that the string of mini flash crashes points to deeper problems in the nation’s stock market.“It’s like seeing cracks in a dam,” said James J. Angel, professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. “One day, I don’t know when, there will be another earthquake.”Andrew W. Lo, director of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at M.I.T., said: “I am worried about the potential instability that these technologies create in market dynamics. The U.S. equity markets have become the Wild, Wild West.”In May, the stock market drop of more than 700 points wiped billions off share prices in minutes, before bouncing back just as quickly, leaving everyone grasping for answers. But even though regulators have identified the main source of the drop as a sale of a large block of futures contracts by a mutual fund in Kansas, some worry that today’s fractured electronic stock market has become so unstable that another large sale or a simple error could incite a broader crash.They also worry about the possibility for manipulation by high-speed traders, especially in a market where trading has proliferated over more than a dozen exchanges and where shares change hands in microseconds.“What we have today is a complete mess,” said Thomas Peterffy, chief executive of Interactive Brokers, one of the largest brokerage firms in the country. “Over the last 10 years, technology delivered great benefits, but in the last year or so, it is not so good. There is more room for the various games some people play.”This month, a software update at the New York Stock Exchange’s electronic Arca exchange brought a nearly 10 percent plunge in an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.In all the mini flash crashes, trades that took place after the plunge were canceled.Most of the mini crashes were blamed on computer malfunctions or human error. But in at least one case, markets behaved as they were supposed to.On Sept. 14, the stock of Nucor, a steel company based in Charlotte, N.C., was at $35.71 when it started falling. A trader had entered a large single order to sell without any price limit on the stock exchange of the Chicago Board Options Exchange. As would have happened on any electronic exchange, after the exchange, then known as the C.B.S.X., exhausted all the buyers on its own exchange, its computers looked to, or “swept” other markets for potential buyers before returning to the exchange’s own order books, eventually driving the price all the way down to a penny.“Before May 6, exchanges frequently had transactions like this that were canceled or adjusted because of an erroneous execution price,” said David Harris, the exchange’s chief executive. “Compared to the total number of trades executed on U.S. markets, canceling a single transaction like this is statistically insignificant.”Some in the industry think the use of unlimited orders should be controlled.The authorities are contemplating other ways to make trading safer and are considering refining circuit breakers to stop erroneous trades from taking place.A Securities and Exchange Commission official said the agency was closely watching the cases where individual stocks had set off circuit breakers, but had found that each case had “its own story.” The official added, “We are learning from them, and so far it is hard to extrapolate too much as to the general trends in the market.”On Monday, the S.E.C. banned stub quotes, which were singled out for blame in the May 6 flash crash. These were place-holding price quotes, far from the market price, put up by market makers that are required to post quotes, but do not really want to buy or sell shares.“While we continue to look at other potential obligations for market participants, this is an important step in our effort to improve the functioning of the U.S. markets and restore investor confidence following the events of May 6,” Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, said in a statement.The S.E.C. has also suggested imposing limits on high-frequency traders. Possibilities include requiring a minimum time for them to keep their orders in the markets, and obligations to offer buy and sell prices even when markets become volatile.Critics suspect some high-frequency firms of “quote stuffing,” or firing off and immediately canceling thousands of orders each second to deliberately clog an exchange.The sudden withdrawal from the markets by high-frequency traders during the market panic on May 6 worsened the decline.Some critics say ordinary investors are becoming wary of the stock market. In a market dominated by lightning-quick traders with immense computing power at their fingertips, the odds are stacked against them, they fear.Retail investors have pulled billions of dollars from stock market mutual funds this year.The Investment Company Institute, which represents investment companies like mutual funds, said it was concerned by the “market inefficiencies” revealed by May 6 and wanted regulators to look at what it called abusive practices, like using technology to detect trading of large blocks of shares by investors like mutual funds and trading ahead of them.Others are far more blunt. “I am very upset by the flash crash,” said George P. Schwartz, who manages the Ave Maria mutual funds. “I am upset by how high-speed traders have taken over the market. They make a mockery out of capitalism.”'"
"'10-11-09,'0','But just as index fund managers often go astray when they try to improve on the index’s performance by overweighting the stocks they favor, the government can go wrong when it tries to pick winners.This is why it was such a risk for California to earmark $3 billion specifically for stem cell research over the next 10 years. Stem cells are just one of many promising fields of biomedical research. They could yield great advances, or become an exercise in sustained failure, as gene therapy has so far been. By allocating so much money to a single field, California is placing an enormous bet on a single horse, and the chances are substantial that its taxpayers will lose their collective shirt.Stem cell researchers have created an illusion of progress by claiming regular advances in the 12 years since human embryonic stem cells were first developed. But a notable fraction of these claims have turned out to be wrong or fraudulent, and many others have amounted to yet another new way of getting to square one by finding better methods of deriving human embryonic stem cells.The major advances in stem cell biology have come from molecular biologists who study transcription factors, the master control switches that govern the cell’s operations. The Japanese biologist Shinya Yamanaka showed that with a mere four of these factors, which he cleverly guessed, he could force an ordinary cell to walk back to embryonic state.But the finding illustrates what stem cell research is really about. It’s not about therapies and quick cures, it’s about understanding the basic nature of human cells and what makes one type different from another even though all have the identical genome. In other words, it’s a basic research program with little likelihood of producing therapeutic gains in the near future. Stem cell scientists, while generally avoiding rash promises themselves, have allowed politicians to portray stem cells as a likely cure for all the major diseases.Strangely, for a project that is aimed at regenerative medicine, the arbiters of stem cell research have largely neglected the free lesson that nature is offering as to how regenerative medicine could actually work. Many little animals, like newts and zebra fish, do regenerate parts of their bodies. But their recipe is the reverse of that presented by the advocates of stem cell therapy. Instead of taking a stem cell and trying to convert it into a well-behaved adult tissue, animals like the zebra fish start with the adult cell at the wound site, and walk it backward into a stemlike state from which a new limb grows.For the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to invest its $3 billion in studying newts, rather than building new science buildings on every state campus, might seem the best way of understanding regeneration, but that would be hard to explain to California’s voters, who have been assured stem cell cures are just around the corner. Even if governments do better to avoid picking winners among basic research fields, they can play a necessary role in supporting specific scientific infrastructure that lies beyond the means of individual researchers or universities, like atom-smashers or the human genome project. But even these projects are not guaranteed success. More powerful atom-smashers let physicists explore new ranges of energy, but the expected new atomic particles are not always found there. The HapMap, a catalog of human genetic variation that grew out of the human genome project, was designed to uncover the genetic roots of common diseases and help develop new treatments. The project was well conceived and executed, but nature declined to provide many very useful answers. Still, there is nothing wrong with the National Institutes of Health having tried the experiment. The only shame would be in not having tried.The same goes for the HapMap’s successor, the 1000 Genomes Project, which is an attempt to construct an even larger genetic catalog. It’s well worth trying, but success cannot be assumed — and should be the more applauded if attained.To take scientific progress for granted is to underestimate the difficulties, professional and otherwise, that scientists must overcome. A researcher spends years in apprenticeship, mastering difficult techniques with a short useful life. He or she then has a few years to strike it lucky and become a lab chief, much of whose time is spent applying for grants and administering the work of the next generation of apprentice scientists.It’s amazing that the system works as well as it does. But its successes are hard won, not the inevitable victories that scientific spokesmen sometimes suggest when on the fund-raising trail.'"
"'10-11-09,'0','A street that has long been an incubator of financial hopes and aspirations for waves of immigrants has fallen victim to high rents and disappearing customers. But this strip also has a resilient streak, a history of newcomers arriving with an entrepreneurial spirit and a willingness to work hard and take a chance.Wall Street may be the economic lifeblood of New York City, but it is small businesses, places with 100 workers or less, that are the city’s backbone, accounting for 98 percent of its roughly 233,000 companies, according to the state’s Department of Labor.Even at the height of the recession in 2008, small businesses provided nearly half of all private-sector jobs available in the city, more than they did in 1990, a study to be released by the Center for an Urban Future, a research institute, found. “Small businesses are the only ones that have been taking chances,” said Jonathan Bowles, the center’s director.Still, the struggles of neighborhood businesses are underscored by persistently high retail vacancy rates. Nowhere is the problem more pronounced than in Queens, which logged a vacancy rate of 13 percent in the third quarter of this year, the highest in the city, according to Marcus & Millichap, a national brokerage firm. Manhattan had the lowest vacancy rate, about 7 percent. In the third quarter two years ago, the vacancy rates were 4 percent for Queens and 2.8 percent for Manhattan.A survey this summer by Representative Anthony D. Weiner painted a dismal picture in several shopping districts in Queens, finding more than one in 5 stores closed along a busy stretch of Jamaica Avenue that runs through Richmond Hill and Woodhaven, and one in 10 stores closed in Glendale. On Woodhaven Boulevard in Rego Park, almost 20 percent of storefronts were closed.“This is more than an economic indicator,” Mr. Weiner, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens and Brooklyn, said in an interview. “It’s a sort of psychic barometer of a community.”In Astoria, about 30 mom-and-pop stores along 30th Avenue have gone out of business in the past two years, in what has been of the most unforgiving financial times for a strip that has experienced booms and busts along with successive waves of immigrants.Greeks and Italians arrived at the turn of the last century and opened butcher shops and salumerias that sold prosciutto, pancetta and racks of lamb.Croatians followed, and then Czechs and other Eastern Europeans, who favored travel agencies and hair salons. More recently, Brazilians opened restaurants, and Arabs started jewelry stores. Now, in a reckless gamble or an act of faith, a fresh crop of business owners is trying to make it on the avenue.For Annie Zhu, 31, and Michelle Ho, 35, friends and partners in the optical shop, Vision Essential, failure would probably mean having to go back to working for someone else.For Al Lau, 39, and his wife, Michele Addeo, 38, the owners of the Louisiana-style restaurant, Sugarfreak, it would probably mean losing everything they have.Mr. Lau and Ms. Addeo signed the lease on the 1,000-square-foot space a year ago and have been paying rent ever since, though their landlord agreed to charge them $3,000 a month, half of what they will be paying once the restaurant opens. The discount is welcome, but it does little to lessen their problems.The couple applied for small-business loans, but banks turned them down, saying that restaurants were too risky, Mr. Lau said.They have run through their savings — Mr. Lau is a lawyer and Ms. Addeo is a physical therapist — and hit the limit on their credit cards to finance their restaurant, which is not yet finished. They spent $150,000 on kitchen equipment and $25,000 on lawyers after a neighborhood group opposed their application for a liquor license. (The restaurant has been granted a provisional license.)The store’s wood floor was rotten, and it took two months to get the necessary permit to replace it, then an additional five months and $20,000 to replace a pipe connecting a water main to the restaurant.They are now waiting for a final inspection while applying the finishing touches. On a recent morning, their contractor arrived with a big chandelier that will hang over the bar.“At this point, we’re too far into it to turn back,” Mr. Lau said. “But we’re going to give it a shot.”To open their eyewear shop on 30th Avenue, Ms. Zhu and Ms. Ho relied on a loan and a little luck. Because of the poor economy, Prada and Versace, which would ordinarily not do business with a small neighborhood store in Queens, were eager to sell to them. And though the two women quit their jobs to devote themselves full time to their business, their husbands did not.“Everybody needs eyeglasses,” said Ms. Ho, who was born in China, grew up in Hong Kong and moved to New York in 1997.Ms. Zhu, whose parents came from China, added, “The big question for us is, are people going to buy a $100 frame or a $300 frame?”Their landlord, George Georgiou, 70, who ran the carpet store for 30 years, had many good years. He bought the building that housed his store — ground-floor space with apartments above — and a similar one nearby. He also bought a home in the neighborhood, and he put both his children through law school.But business eventually slowed so much that it made no sense to stay open.“Economy hard,” Mr. Georgiou said. “More hard and more competition to do business today.”Mr. Marino, of the fish market, also owns the building where his store was, but for now he is trying to figure out what to do with all the equipment he still has there, while keeping going the wholesale fish business he has had on the side.The other day, Mr. Georgiou stopped by the grand opening for his tenants’ store and offered Ms. Zhu and Ms. Ho simple advice.“When I come to America, the way to make more money is the business way,” Mr. Georgiou told them. “Own your business still good; better than work for somebody else.”'"
"'10-11-09,'0','The degree of sticker shock varies significantly by region and by class of seat, with fares on some routes still at or below those of a year ago, despite some large increases in traffic.Average domestic and international fares worldwide are up by less than 4 percent from a year ago, according to figures from the transport association. And while fares may continue rising for some time, industry executives say the increases next year are likely to be smaller.Travelers in North America have experienced the steepest price gains, particularly for business travel. Average one-way fares for business- and first-class travel within North America have soared this year. They were up a staggering 140 percent from a year earlier, to $676 in August, a peak travel month and the most recent for which the transport association has data available. Economy fares rose 3.6 percent.Fares between the United States and Europe also rose sharply, especially for economy-class seats. The average one-way fare in August was $455, a rise of 20 percent from a year earlier, while the average premium-class fare was $2,087, an increase of 11 percent.“It’s really hard to find the $600 tickets anymore,” said Philip Guarino, 40, an American who runs a consulting business in Milan and Boston. “The basic fare from the East Coast to Europe is closer to $1,000, and most likely closer to $1,200.”A business-class ticket to Milan costs about $3,400, he said, compared with about $2,400 four years ago. “The pricing now in business is at my upper limit,” he said.Elsewhere, economy-class fares between Europe and Asia have risen 10 percent from 2009, according to the transport association, while those between North and South America have increased about 13 percent.“All of the airlines have done a good job, as demand has picked up, of not adding very many more seats,” said Christa Degnan Manning, head of research at American Express Business Travel. “I expect them to continue to manage that very closely.”Dan Hodgdon, 44, said he had given up trying to fly between the Bangkok offices of his spa-supply business, which is based in Los Angeles, and his vacation home in southern France because fares on the route had become “ridiculously” high.Referring to the Los Angeles airport, he said, “It is far less expensive now to fly from LAX to anywhere in Europe than from Bangkok.”“This was not always the case in early 2009,” he added.Travelers in other parts of the world can still find good deals. Within the Asia-Pacific region, for example, the average one-way economy-class fare was $318 in August, a decrease of 0.4 percent from August 2009, while premium-class tickets were nearly 2 percent less expensive, despite a 26 percent jump in traffic on those routes.But some of the biggest fare declines this year have been in Europe, where economic activity remains sluggish and consumer confidence is weak. Economy-class fares on European routes fell nearly 11 percent in August despite an 8 percent increase in demand. Business-class fares fell even further, dropping 16 percent as the bigger carriers scrambled to keep customers from defecting to low-cost rivals and high-speed trains.“An awful lot of passengers are trading down from the big carriers like British Airways and Air France to fly with us,” said Michael O’Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the largest European low-cost airline. “All across Europe, fares are still falling, and we are one of the main reasons for that.”Ryanair has taken advantage of that trend to raise its average one-way fare to 44 euros, or $62, in the April-September period, up 12 percent from a year earlier, the carrier, based in Dublin, said.Ms. Manning, of American Express Business Travel, said that in Europe, overall expenses for business travel, including hotels and car rentals, had fallen by about 1 percent in 2010 from a year earlier. But American Express predicted this month that this figure would jump 16 percent in 2011, as travel providers sought to recoup some of their losses of the last two years. Domestic and short-haul European economy-class airfares are likely to rise 4 to 9 percent next year, American Express said, with countries like Britain and Sweden in line for the biggest increases.Spain, with its economy still deep in crisis, was the only European market where continued declines in ticket prices were expected next year, of 1 to 3 percent.In other parts of the world, fares are expected to rise as well in 2011, but at a much slower pace than this year.Because of the increases experienced in 2010, North America is likely to have the smallest fare increases, in the range of 2 to 7 percent, according to American Express, while Latin American fares are likely to rise 3 to 8 percent. In the Middle East, fares should also climb 2 to 9 percent, American Express said.Fare increases in the fast-growing economies of Asia, meanwhile, are likely to accelerate, especially for premium travel. American Express predicted economy-class ticket prices would rise as much as 13 percent in 2011 in markets including China, India and Singapore, while business-class fares could rise as much as 15 percent. In Japan, where economic growth remains sluggish, prices are likely to be more stable, with increases expected in the low single digits.Still, many airline executives are expecting this year’s growth in yield — the price paid by one passenger to fly one mile — to slacken in 2011 as slowing economies combine with accelerating deliveries of new planes to increase the supply of available seats.A quarterly survey of airline chief financial officers that the transport association published this month showed that while nearly 60 percent expected their carriers to see continued improvements to their profitability during the next 12 months, only 26 percent said they expected yields to increase over the same period — down from nearly 75 percent from the previous survey in July.Barring another sharp economic downturn, analysts said, the longer-term trend toward rising fares is likely to continue apace. A wave of recent industry consolidation has given airlines greater visibility over a broader swath of the market, making it easier for them to manage the supply — and the prices — of available seats.“The degree of consolidation that is occurring — partly through alliances and partly through takeovers — has to start influencing the balance between supply and demand,” said Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend, an airline consulting firm in London.'"

"'10-11-10,'1','Rudolf Barshai, an orchestral conductor who built a prominent career in the West after defecting from the Soviet Union in the 1970s, died on Nov. 2 in Basel, Switzerland. He was 86 and lived nearby in Ramlinsburg.His death was announced by his management company, Askonas Holt, which said he had been ill for the past year.Originally an eminent violist, Mr. Barshai was an inaugural member of the Borodin Quartet, founded in 1945 and long considered one of the finest string quartets in the world. He performed extensively as a viola soloist early in his career.But he was best known as the founder and longtime conductor of the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, an ensemble he established in the mid-1950s.Besides playing the music of 20th-century composers like Stravinsky and Hindemith, the orchestra was noteworthy for performing works by Baroque composers, including Handel and J. S. Bach, rarely heard in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and ’60s.'"

A federal jury found Mr. Melvin guilty of extorting money from drug dealers in exchange for protection from investigation. Prosecutors played hours of taped conversations that they said proved his guilt. Mr. Melvin’s lawyer argued that he was trying to protect his confidential informants and was playing along during the taped conversations.'"
"'10-11-10,'1','A federal court convicted him in 1985 of crimes against humanity and sentenced him to life in prison. Then, in 1990, President Carlos Menem granted him and other coup leaders amnesty in what Mr. Menem called a gesture of reconciliation.Born in Buenos Aires in 1925, Mr. Massera was educated at Argentina’s elite naval academy and became a midshipman in 1946. He rose to the rank of full admiral and commander in chief under Mrs. Perón in 1974.In that post, he pressed Mrs. Perón to fight urban guerrilla groups, persuading her to push for laws to beef up security and to stop the insurgents at any cost. He was ruthless in enforcing measures to maintain public order.Mr. Massera ran the military arm of the dictatorship the first two years. As head of the navy, he was also in control of the prison camp at ESMA in Buenos Aires. The admiral visited the camp often, overseeing torture, which included rape. The military tortured most of its prisoners and dumped them, dead or alive, into the River Plate from airplanes.Mr. Massera studied philology as a young man and obsessed over the use of language. “He had a messianic oratory, a sonorous oratory,” said Marguerite Feitlowitz, a literature professor at Bennington College who has written a book about Argentina’s dictatorship. “His speeches were very evil and very polished.”In a speech in 1972 to officers who had been chosen to carry out the death flights, Mr. Massera said, “Death will not triumph here, because all of our dead, each and every one, died for the triumph of life.”After Mr. Massera was convicted of dozens of counts of murder, torture and robbery, he was unrepentant. “Nobody has to defend himself for having won a fair war,” Mr. Massera said after the trial. “The war against subversive terrorism was fair.”Despite Mr. Menem’s pardon, Mr. Massera was arrested in 1998 on charges of having stolen babies born to political prisoners, a crime not covered by the amnesty. His ill health kept him out of prison.In 2005, the Supreme Court, under the administration of President Néstor Kirchner (who died on Oct. 27), declared the amnesties unconstitutional. But the court, confirming Mr. Massera’s dementia, suspended all cases against him, as well as extradition requests from Germany, Spain, Italy and France. Those countries had sought him for the killings of their citizens during the dictatorship.'"
"'10-11-10,'1','A Boeing 787 jetliner on a test flight over Texas made an emergency landing Tuesday after smoke was detected in the main cabin.The plane landed safely in Laredo and the crew was evacuated, a Boeing spokeswoman, Loretta Gunter, said. Boeing is still gathering information about the incident, she said.The smoke appeared in the rear cabin of the plane, farthest from the cockpit, said Lynn Lunsford, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.“The pilot landed and advised he was declaring an emergency,” said Mr. Lunsford, who added that the airport fire department had been called to the scene. He said the F.A.A. would look into the incident.The 787, which Boeing calls the Dreamliner, is made of composite material intended to make it lighter and more fuel-efficient, but Boeing has run into a series of delays in developing the big, two-aisle passenger plane.Boeing has said it will deliver the first production models of the 787 to Japan’s All Nippon Airways in the middle of the first quarter of next year — about three years behind schedule.'"
"'10-11-10,'1','Shares of other natural gas producers also rose. The Range Resources Corporation, the EQT Corporation and the Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation increased at least 4 percent in heavy trading.For its part, Atlas Energy’s allure lies in its 486,000 net acres of Marcellus Shale, which extends from West Virginia through Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio and into New York State.Chevron will also get a 49 percent interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream, a venture with the Williams Companies that owns more than 1,000 miles of natural-gas gathering lines serving the shale.“We are acquiring a company that has one of the premier acreage positions in the prolific Marcellus,” Chevron’s vice chairman, George L. Kirkland, said in a statement.Exxon Mobil and Chevron are hardly the only energy giants that have swooned over the big shale formation, whose gas reserves have only recently become accessible because of improved recovery technology.Reliance Industries of India has invested more than $2 billion this year in Marcellus, including a $1.7 billion venture that it formed with Atlas in April. In that deal, Reliance agreed to pay $340 million in cash and another $1.4 billion in a drilling carry in return for a 40 percent stake in about 300,000 net acres of the shale holdings. (Chevron will assume Atlas’s role in the venture.)Also this year, Consol Energy spent $3.5 billion to acquire 500,000 net acres in Pennsylvania and West Virginia from Dominion Resources, and Royal Dutch Shell bought the assets of East Resources for $4.7 billion in cash, giving it 650,000 net acres of Marcellus Shale rights.Chevron is offering Atlas shareholders $38.25 a share in cash and a portion of more than 41 million units of Atlas Pipeline Holdings, worth about $5.09 an Atlas Energy share. The offer totals $43.34 a share.Chevron will also take on $1.1 billion in debt; the deal is contingent on several restructuring transactions on Atlas’s part.The deal must also be approved by Atlas shareholders, including the billionaire investor Leon G. Cooperman and his son Wayne. The elder Mr. Cooperman’s Omega Advisors held an 8.9 percent stake as of June 30, while his son’s fund, Cobalt Capital Management, owned 5.5 percent.Wayne Cooperman, who said in telephone interview that his fund had owned Atlas for about a decade, described Chevron’s offer as bittersweet. He characterized Atlas as “the little company that nobody was really paying attention to” — until the recent frenzy to get access to the Marcellus reserves, that is.“I would have liked more,” Mr. Cooperman said, referring to Chevron’s premium. “Unfortunately, gas prices have been so low that it’s depressing the whole industry.”Indeed, in no small part because of the newfound supplies coming from shale exploration, natural gas prices have hovered around $4 a million British thermal units, down about 70 percent from their peak in July 2008.But Chevron’s deal is a vote of confidence that prices will rebound, and most analysts agreed with the logic behind the deal.“It’s almost refreshing to see a company and a management team doing what they ought to be doing,” said Mark Gilman, an energy analyst with the Benchmark Company, “and that is, it ought to be a regimen where you try to buy low and sell high, and not the reverse.”Jefferies & Company is lead financial adviser to Atlas Energy and Deutsche Bank is co-financial adviser. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is the legal adviser. Chevron is being advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.'"
"'10-11-10,'1','Your article is a long-overdue indictment of the Department of Agriculture regarding obesity. Unfortunately, this conflict of interest is not news. The department has been propping up the dairy industry’s fat assembly line for at least the last 60 years through milk subsidies and the low-cost sale of surplus cheese to school lunch programs and poor people.Other industries have had to modify their products to remain competitive in the global economy. Why should the dairy industry and pizza joints get a pass at the expense of the healthy food choices of all Americans?Instead of a self-serving, free promotion campaign for Domino’s, the Department of Agriculture and Dairy Management should be engaged in developing a first-class public education campaign advising consumers how to eat fewer dairy products and suggesting healthier, low-fat food options.Kudos for pointing out the self-contradictory behavior of the federal government. But these inconsistencies aren’t limited to dairy marketing. Although the Agriculture Department has pushed low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets since the first dietary recommendations in 1977, these diets have not been proved by science to prevent disease or promote good health.While fat is demonized (as well as marketed), highly processed wheat, corn and soy products — subsidized and endorsed by the U.S.D.A. — make up the bulk of our diet. Yet science accumulated in the U.S.D.A.’s own Nutrition Evidence Library shows that diets that limit those foods lead to improved health — more so than diets that limit fat.Efforts to reverse the epidemics of diabetes and obesity will be an exercise in futility until we take a critical look at our dietary recommendations and question the science (or lack thereof) upon which they are based.The Department of Agriculture’s use of tax dollars to promote fat-filled dairy products that contribute to obesity, diabetes and heart disease is unconscionable. The agency repeatedly appears to see its role as an advocate and protector of the dairy, meat and egg industries.It needs to be recognized that dairy factory farms guarantee the proliferation of harm. Cows are severely confined and denied all that is natural to them. Male calves are separated from their mothers shortly after birth, raised for veal — a byproduct of the dairy industry — in tiny enclosures where they cannot turn around and slaughtered after a few months. The manure and gases from these animals will pollute the air, water and land and contribute to global warming.The U.S.D.A. may try to dictate food choices that ignore health and ethics, but consumers have the power to think about the health and moral aspects of what they eat.Europe is criticized for the “butter mountains” and “milk lakes” resulting from its agricultural subsidies. How very American that excess production here is marketed by the government to poor people (free market, anyone?), only adding to their nutritional challenges.'"
"'10-11-10,'1','Morgan Stanley offers another reminder: Its former co-president, Zoe Cruz, was one of the earliest casualties of the credit crisis.Any chief financial officer — male or female — would be facing challenges at Morgan Stanley at the moment. The firm, under its chief executive, James P. Gorman, is trying to transform itself into more of a steady producer than an investment bank susceptible to swings in the market. The transition has been rough sledding: Morgan Stanley had a net loss of $91 million in the third quarter.The stock has fallen 11 percent so far this year, compared with a flat performance for its chief rival, Goldman Sachs. Some shareholders have been grumbling that Morgan Stanley’s turnaround is taking too long. And there has been a noticeable turnover in the share base this year.For instance, the mutual fund giant Fidelity has recently reduced its stake in a number of firms, according to regulatory filings, but in percentage terms its selling in Morgan is larger than other reductions.A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman says that other big investors, including Fairholme Capital Management, have been buying the firm’s shares.Until her promotion to chief financial officer, Ms. Porat, 52, was best known as the banker who had been tapped to advise the Treasury Department on the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. She has kept an intentionally low profile since January and declined to be interviewed for this article.Ms. Porat is not an accountant and had never worked in the finance department. She has an economics degree from Stanford and a master’s degree in business administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. She joined Morgan Stanley in 1987.Six years later, however, she quit to follow the well-known Morgan Stanley banker Robert F. Greenhill to Smith Barney. In a 2009 book titled “How Remarkable Women Lead,” she said she regretted the move immediately.“Oh my God, I’ve completely messed up my career,” she said to herself upon landing there, according to the book. “I want to go back and I won’t have that option.”She did go back, in 1996, but was forced to take a demotion as part of the deal. In 2000, she went to London to lead Morgan Stanley’s technology banking team there. Ms. Porat helped take some of the era’s biggest names public, including Amazon and Priceline.During the tech bubble Ms. Porat aligned herself with Mary Meeker, the influential technology analyst. Morgan Stanley, largely through Ms. Porat and Ms. Meeker, vetted more than 750 Internet-related public offerings from 1995 to 2001. In that period, Morgan served as the primary manager on 50 of 597 Internet companies that eventually did go public.“She is the best banker I have worked with since Quattrone, and while Frank has the tech relationship edge, Ruth has the creative edge,” wrote Ms. Meeker in her 1999 performance review, released in 2003 as part of a regulatory inquiry.Mr. Quattrone is perhaps the dot-com era’s best-known deal maker, whose career stalled temporarily while he successfully fought civil and criminal charges. He has since started Qatalyst Partners, which has been a busy adviser in a number of tech deals this year.She soon faced another challenge: In 2001 she was given a diagnosis of breast cancer. She moved back to America for treatment.Colleagues say Ms. Porat is a tireless worker. In 1992, during the birth of her first son, she was on the phone in the delivery room making client calls. And in her spare time she, along with her husband, a lawyer, renovate and sell New York City apartments.Ms. Meeker, the godmother to each of Ms. Porat’s three sons, remembers one meeting with management at the media company Ziff Davis where Ms. Porat threw her back out. “Instead of leaving she laid on the boardroom table and continued on with the presentation,” Ms. Meeker said.She has been known to go out on a limb for clients; in 2004 she wrote a letter to the court in support of a client and friend, Martha Stewart. That year Ms. Stewart was sentenced to five months in prison after she was convicted of lying to authorities about her 2001 sale of about 4,000 shares of ImClone Systems.But at times Ms. Porat got caught up the euphoria of the Internet bubble, some co-workers say. In 1999, at a dinner with senior Morgan executives, she and Ms. Meeker tried to convince top brass to buy the brokerage house Charles Schwab; its stock had soared during the Internet boom.Ms. Meeker says there were a number of strategic ideas discussed at the meeting, including a possible acquisition of Schwab by Morgan, but no one “was pounding the table” for such a deal to take place. “However of the available options, it was the most interesting,” she added.After the tech wreck, Ms. Porat began banking more blue-chip companies, and assisted in the initial public offering of a General Electric subsidiary, Genworth Financial Inc. The next year she learned her cancer was back, and underwent treatment again. In 2006 she was tapped to run the financial institutions group, and help take public a number of companies, including the private equity firm Blackstone Group.Tony James, president of Blackstone, said Ms. Porat was available at all hours to handle issues. “She never makes you feel like you are disturbing her personal life; I don’t even know if she has one.”He said that unlike many bankers, she was able to quickly tap resources from all corners of Morgan. For instance, she arranged for Mr. Gorman, then head of strategy for Morgan, to speak to Blackstone executives about what it was like to be a public company. “I would never have even known to have asked for that,” he said.In 2008, she and a fellow Morgan banker, Robert Scully, landed one of the most prestigious assignments of the credit crisis, advising the Treasury Department on the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Lee Sachs, a former senior Treasury worker, dealt frequently with Ms. Porat, saying she had a “recognition and understanding of the public policy and political implications, positive and negative, of various courses of action.”Still, Mr. James of Blackstone said he was surprised when he heard that Ms. Porat had been appointed chief financial officer. “She went from a client-facing job into a job which is totally internal facing and is quite technical,” he said. “And beyond that she moved from a role that involved managing one or two people to thousands of people. It was a huge change, and I like Ruth so I wanted it to work out, but I wondered if it would, but so far it seems to be.”'"
"'10-11-10,'1','So long as investors are throwing money into the bond markets, private equity firms are taking advantage by cashing out of their investments in a hurry.The latest buyout firms to take advantage of the red-hot debt markets are the owners of HCA, the hospital giant that on Tuesday announced plans to pay $2 billion to its investors this quarter.The payments — the third in a series that HCA will make to its owners this year — will be financed in part by a $1.53 billion bond offering.So-called dividend recapitalizations have roared back in popularity this year, one of many signs that the debt markets are surging from the depths of the financial crisis.In dividend recaps, private equity-owned companies borrow money to pay their investors. About $40.3 billion in dividends have been announced so far this year, a level that has not been attained since the beginning of the buyout boom in 2005, according to Standard & Poor’s Leveraged Commentary and Data. By contrast, private equity-owned companies paid out about a total of $12 billion in dividends in 2008 and 2009.Such payments have sometimes been criticized as private equity excess, with buyout firms foisting billions of dollars of debt onto their portfolio companies to extract big paydays.'"
"'10-11-10,'1','Even the theme of the campaign, “Delicioso” (“Delicious”), is treated with mock grandeur. The responsibility messages in tiny type at the bottom of the print ads assert, “Drinking responsibly is muy delicioso.”The approach of the ads echoes the creative tacks of several current popular campaigns. Dos Equis features a character, named the Most Interesting Man in the World, whose outlandish accomplishments — “He speaks French in Russian,” “Alien abductors have asked him to probe them”— are described as if they were actually achievable.The Old Spice campaign, called “Smell like a man, man,” presents a character who offers his nutty patter — “Look at your man. Now back at me. Now back at your man” — as if it makes sense. In commercials for National, an announcer salutes the everyday business traveler as a superheroic “business pro.”And in the minivan campaigns from Toyota and Honda, drivers rave that their prosaic vehicles are “swagger wagons,” and the arrival of new models is heralded by fireworks as if they were hot sports cars.“It’s advertising that’s making the joke for you,” said Barbara Lippert, the ad critic for Adweek Media, “doing this dance of irony and sarcasm to make fun of the thing it’s selling” before the consumer can.Ms. Lippert praised the approach because “everyone who it is aimed at gets it.” She identified the target as the types of shoppers who send up their own ardor for the cheap-chic merchandise sold by Target by calling the store “Tar-zhay.”But “it seems like a delicate balance,” Ms. Lippert said, to succeed in delivering a pitch that pokes fun at its own purpose.Executives at TBWA/Chiat/Day and Pernod Ricard, which imports Kahlúa, acknowledge the pitfalls of the tactic.“It has a bit of a wink or a nudge, but it’s not outrageous or silly,” said Dan Lundberg, global marketing director for Kahlúa at the Absolut Company unit of Pernod Ricard. “It felt like a very natural way to tell the Kahlúa story instead of doing something more traditional.”“There are a lot of consumers who do not necessarily know what Kahlúa is, what’s in it, where it’s from, and they can learn in an entertaining way,” Mr. Lundberg said. “We’re proud of our heritage, but at the same time we want to have fun with it as well.”Lisa Topol, a creative director at TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York — part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group — traced the idea behind the campaign to the phrase “licor delicioso” (“delicious liqueur”), which appears on the labels on Kahlúa bottles.“There’s something playful and fun about the word ‘delicioso,’ ” Ms. Topol said, underlining that “Kahlúa is unpretentious, not a stodgy brand, a drink you want to have with friends.”When the agency was pursuing the Kahlúa creative assignment, said Adam Stagliano, chief international strategy officer at TBWA Worldwide, “we did go down the path of a more straight-on provenance story, but the brand seemed to be taking itself a little too seriously.”“The job from the client was, ‘You need to shake people up a little bit,’ ” Mr. Stagliano said, and the “Delicioso” campaign does that with a “magical realism: it’s rooted in reality, but it has this magical spirit.”The campaign, with a budget estimated at $15 million to $20 million, includes, in addition to the commercials, print advertisements, in magazines like Bon Appétit, Cosmopolitan, Esquire, GQ and InStyle; a presence in social media, led by a coming redesign of the brand’s Facebook page; and a Kahlúa application for mobile devices.The digital elements of the campaign are being handled by the New York office of Great Works, an interactive agency that also works on other Pernod Ricard brands like Absolut vodka.The Pernod Ricard USA unit of Pernod Ricard spent $14.3 million to advertise Kahlúa in major media last year, according to Kantar Media, part of WPP, up 42.4 percent from the $10 million spent in 2008.The increase may have been meant to counteract a decline in the brand’s sales volume in the United States, which fell to a million cases last year from almost 1.1 million cases in 2008. (That mirrored a decline globally, to 1.8 million cases last year from 1.9 million in 2008.)'"
"'10-11-10,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — Companies are still hesitating to increase hiring, even as more evidence emerges that the economy is slowly improving.Employers posted fewer job vacancies in September than in August, the second month of declines, according to a report Tuesday from the Labor Department. A survey of small-business owners showed they were more optimistic, but still reluctant to add many new workers.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday that wholesale inventories rose in September for the ninth straight month. Wholesalers and distributors are likely to build their stockpiles in anticipation of higher sales.Inventory restocking has been a crucial source of economic growth since the recession ended in June 2009. Increased orders to fill empty store and warehouse shelves have meant higher production at the nation’s factories.The National Federation of Independent Business, a leading small-business group, said on Tuesday that its optimism index rose to 91.7, up from 89 in September. It was the highest level in five months and second-highest in more than two years, behind 92.9 in September 2008. More small businesses plan to add workers than cut them in the next three months, the group said. And the average employment change per company is zero, the group said. That figure has been negative in all but two quarters since April 2007, the federation said.The reading “raises the odds that Main Street may contribute to private sector job growth for the first time in over a year,” the group said.'"
"'10-11-10,'1','WASHINGTON — President Obama ’s criticism of new Israeli housing plans for East Jerusalem, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s even sharper retort, have thrown the Middle East peace talks into jeopardy, with the dispute over Jewish settlements looming as a seemingly insuperable hurdle.The Obama administration is struggling to restart direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, which stalled last month after the expiration of a partial freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to meet Mr. Netanyahu in New York on Thursday, while Egypt sent two top officials to Washington to discuss ways to salvage the process.But the brusque exchange between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu reflected again the gulf between Israel and the United States over settlements — an issue Mr. Obama initially made the centerpiece of his Middle East diplomacy. Palestinian officials said Israel’s latest announcement threatened the talks and could prompt a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state.When asked in about Israel’s plans for 1,000 housing units for a contested part of East Jerusalem, Mr. Obama said, “This kind of activity is never helpful when it comes to peace negotiations.”“I’m concerned that we’re not seeing each side make the extra effort involved to get a breakthrough,” the president added during his visit to Indonesia. “Each of these incremental steps can end up breaking trust.”A few hours later, Mr. Netanyahu’s office responded with a statement, saying that “Jerusalem is not a settlement; Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Israel.”The United States and Israel have well-known differences over Jerusalem, Mr. Netanyahu’s office said in the statement, adding that building plans should have no effect on the peace talks.Despite their efforts to build mutual trust, Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu seem to keep talking past each other. On Tuesday, they were worlds apart in symbolism as well as substance: the president voiced his criticism of Israel while on a visit to Jakarta, capital of the world’s most populous Muslim country.Mr. Netanyahu was in New York, meeting business people, midway through a visit to the United States that included a speech to a Jewish group in New Orleans on Monday, in which he called on Washington to be more aggressive in threatening Iran with a military strike if it did not give up its nuclear program.Analysts said Mr. Netanyahu’s unyielding tone — a palpable contrast to his chagrined reaction after a similar housing dispute during a visit to Israel by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — testified to the altered political environment in the United States. The stinging Democratic defeat in the midterm elections, the analysts said, had emboldened Mr. Netanyahu to push back harder against the administration.“He is dealing with a president who is politically weakened,” said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Israel. “A lot of his friends in Washington are Republicans. He feels more comfortable with them, so he just feels that he’s got a freer hand here.”Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Michael B. Oren, rejected that view. “We’re not looking for a confrontation with the Obama administration,” he said.He said Mr. Netanyahu was eager to discuss with Mrs. Clinton “how we are going to move forward, once we get over this hump.”But Mr. Oren declined to say whether Mr. Netanyahu would offer new proposals for breaking the impasse. The United States has asked him to extend the settlement freeze for 60 days in return for security incentives.Israeli officials have said Mr. Netanyahu is hemmed in by his right-wing coalition, which opposes extending the freeze. Some officials said that by taking a hard line on Israel’s right to build in Jerusalem, Mr. Netanyahu might gain the political cover to compromise over the West Bank.On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton will meet with Egypt’s foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, and its intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman. Egypt is worried by the impasse, and American officials said they expected the Egyptians to advance their own ideas for resuscitating the talks, which could include an Israeli pledge to withdraw troops from parts of the West Bank.Whether that would be enough to satisfy the Palestinians without an extension of the settlement freeze is not clear. In another gesture to the Palestinians, Mrs. Clinton will announce the United States’ annual financial contribution to the Palestinian Authority on Wednesday, an administration official said.Mr. Netanyahu has supported Mr. Obama’s mix of engagement and sanctions against Iran. But in his speech to the Jewish Federations of North America in New Orleans, he called for a more aggressive approach.“If the international community, led by the United States, hopes to stop Iran’s nuclear program without resorting to military action,” he declared, “it will have to convince Iran that it is prepared to take such action.”Dan Diker, a senior foreign policy analyst at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, said the speech was calculated to “push the military option to the top paragraph of the policy from the third or fourth paragraph.”But Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said that the threat of military action was not the best way to deter Tehran. Mr. Gates said the recent United Nations sanctions against the Iranian government were starting to bite.Israel’s housing announcement came in the form of plans published for public review in local newspapers on Friday, just before Mr. Netanyahu headed to Washington. As with previous announcements, Israeli officials said the timing was determined bureaucratically, not politically.Still, the timing raised questions about what Mr. Netanyahu knew and when. After Mr. Biden’s visit to Israel was spoiled last March by a similar announcement that Mr. Netanyahu said was a surprise to him, American officials told the Israelis that they wanted no more surprises.At the time, Mr. Netanyahu’s aides said he sent out letters demanding lists of future settlement plans to avoid surprises while peace talks were under way. It was unclear whether Mr. Netanyahu knew about this one before it was published in newspapers last week. On Tuesday, it also became clear that some 800 units would be built in the West Bank settlement of Ariel.Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Israel’s action was “a call for immediate international recognition of the Palestinian state.”The Palestinian leadership has been talking about shifting its focus to getting international recognition of a Palestinian state if settlement building continued and the peace talks remained stalled. The Obama administration and Arab states have urged it not to go that route.'"
"'10-11-10,'1','“During the six months the ship was here, they spent a lot on qat,” a local stimulant, “women and drink,” said the pirate, who asked not to be identified. “Many just came home with $20,000.”Some of the bigger pirate bosses in this part of Somalia have been building mini armies from the millions they receive in ransoms, and it is widely believed that much of the money from the Samho Dream will go toward more weapons.At the same time, the Shabab, the powerful Islamist insurgent group that vows to enforce strict Islamic law across Somalia, seems to be getting more deeply involved in piracy. Pirates recently sailed a hijacked yacht with three South Africans on board to Barawa, a coastal town firmly in Shabab hands. The pirates would not be able to set foot in Barawa, let alone hold hostages there, without Shabab cooperation.According to European naval officials, the pirates in the yacht ran aground just off Barawa’s beach on Sunday morning and ordered the hostages to come ashore. The skipper refused and was left behind on the sailboat. He was rescued soon after by a European naval patrol that had been trailing the sailboat. The two other South Africans are now believed to be in Barawa.Somali pirates have said they prefer bigger ships, especially oil tankers, which usually pay the best, though they will opportunistically attack a sailboat that crosses their path. A British couple, Paul and Rachel Chandler, have been held hostage in Somalia since pirates hijacked their yacht in October 2009 near the Seychelles.Even when captured, many pirates have been set free. On Tuesday, a Kenyan court ordered the release of nine piracy suspects, saying the country could not prosecute them for crimes committed outside its territory, Reuters reported.But international warships are plying the seas trying to thwart new attacks, sometimes successfully. Somali pirates opened fire — apparently by mistake — on a Spanish warship in a bungled nighttime attack, maritime officials said Tuesday.According to Lt. Col. Per Klingvall, of the European Union Naval Force patrolling Somalia’s waters, pirates cruising around on a hijacked Japanese cargo ship started shooting at a Spanish frigate over the weekend while it was escorting a supply ship for African Union peacekeepers in Somalia.The warship promptly fired warning shots — it did not want to sink the pirates’ ship because of the possibility that hostages were still on board — and the pirates sailed away, Colonel Klingvall said. “The frigate is relatively small, and the pirates probably thought it was a merchant vessel,” he said.'"
"'10-11-10,'1','The most active stock in the sector was Exxon Mobil, which was up more than 1 percent during the day, at $70.63. Halliburton, which had risen about 0.7 percent, was down 0.6 percent to close at $33.22. Chevron was down 1.5 percent to $83.56 and Atlas was up 34 percent, to $42.50.The Chevron deal “shows that energy companies still see good value out there to make acquisitions,” Mr. Youngberg said.Materials and industrials stocks also did well in early trading. “Some of the more economically sensitive sectors continue to do well and I think that is a reflection that maybe our economy is kind of getting out of this soft patch,” said Hank Smith, the chief investment officer of equity at Haverford Investments. “Most of these industrials and basic materials have a great emerging market presence.”But there was little impetus of the kind that propelled the markets higher last week, when the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, announced a $600 billion bond-buying program and Congressional elections put Republicans in control of the House of Representatives. New economic indicators also gave shares a push higher last week, including stronger-than-expected manufacturing data and jobs report.“We had so much data and market moving news, and most of that is behind us now,” said Michael Church, the president of Addison Capital. “We are certainly overbought, so a correction would not be shocking.”On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that wholesale inventories rose in September for the ninth straight month.Financial stocks were down more than 2 percent. Citigroup was down more than 3 percent, to $4.30, and Bank of America fell 2.62 percent, to $12.27.“It looks like both yesterday and today the market is kind of pausing and digesting,” Mr. Smith said, referring to the big gains in the market since Sept. 1.In early September, analysts said, the markets generally began to price in expectations that the Fed would announce the plans to buy the additional government securities, a move intended to stimulate the economy, setting off a rally that has pushed indexes to their highest level this year.Gold, whose price has soared, edged higher through the day. The dollar was up slightly against a weighted basket of currencies. The euro traded slightly lower at $1.3830.Interest rates were higher. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 29/32, to 99 23/32, and the yield rose to 2.636 percent from 2.55 percent late Monday.'"
"'10-11-10,'1','BEIJING — Two prominent legal scholars and rights advocates bound for an international law conference in London were blocked from leaving China on Tuesday on vague charges that their departure might endanger national security, they said.The scholars, Mo Shaoping and He Weifang, said they suspected that the government feared that they would try to attend the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo next month honoring the jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo.Both men were on the list of 143 Chinese activists, academics and celebrities that Mr. Liu’s wife invited to the award ceremony in an Internet posting two weeks ago, noting that neither she nor her husband were likely to be allowed to attend.Mr. Mo and Mr. He said that officers who detained them said a superior had described their overseas journey as a threat to state security. “That’s the most imbecilic thing I’ve heard,” Mr. Mo said in an interview, adding that he had no intention of traveling to Oslo. “I don’t have a visa for Norway, and I have a ticket to return to Beijing on Nov. 15.”In recent weeks, the government has demonstrated its resolve to stop Chinese citizens from attending the ceremony on Dec. 10. It has kept Mr. Liu’s wife, Liu Xia, incommunicado in her Beijing apartment and subjected scores of other writers, academics and lawyers to varying degrees of detention or surveillance.Among those facing restrictions are Hua Ze, a Beijing-based filmmaker who was forcibly returned to her hometown in southern China; Liu Suli, a Beijing bookstore owner who says he was injured during an assault by security agents last month; and Yu Fangqiang, a human rights lawyer who was stopped at the Hong Kong border last Friday on his way to a United Nations training session in Geneva.'"
"'10-11-10,'1','Barclays, the British bank, said Tuesday that its profit fell 76 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, dragged down by an accounting charge at its investment banking unit that overshadowed a stable underlying picture.The bank, based in London, had a pretax profit of £327 million, or $528 million, compared to £1.4 billion a year earlier.Barclays Capital, the investment banking division, took a charge of £947 million, sending the unit to a loss of £182 million despite performing fairly well in a relatively weaker market. The business had a profit of £369 million in the period a year ago.The charge, which is not a cash item, resulted from marking-to-market the prices of debt the company itself had issued. The category is volatile; Barclays had reported a £953 million gain on its own debt in the second quarter. Without the charge, Barclays’ profit would still have been down on a year-to-year basis, but only slightly, at £1.3 billion.Barclays Capital revenue, at £2.8 billion, was in line with analyst expectations. The bank surprised analysts, however, with third-quarter loan impairments of £1.2 billion, smaller than many had anticipated, Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in London, wrote in a note. An impairment is money set aside for a loan that the bank thinks may not be repaid.'"

"'10-11-11,'0','Showing a willingness once again to open its checkbook to lure big names, the Fox Business Network said on Wednesday that it had hired Lou Dobbs, the former CNN anchor, to head a daily program.Fox Business, which is owned by the News Corporation, said the program would begin in the first quarter of 2011. It did not specify a time slot.Mr. Dobbs, 65, is an important addition for Fox Business, a three-year-old little brother of the Fox News Channel that has had only a small effect on the landscape of cable ratings. Bulking up on business journalists and commentators, the network has already hired two on-air personalities this year from CNBC, Charlie Gasparino and Dennis Kneale, and one from CNN, Gerri Willis. Last year, it hired the ABC News anchor John Stossel and added a simulcast of Don Imus’s radio show.The network did not respond to requests for interviews on Wednesday. In a news release, it said Mr. Dobbs had signed a multiyear deal and specified that along with the daily show, he would appear on other Fox Business programs to “provide analysis and commentary on business news of the day.” The news of Mr. Dobbs’s hiring was first reported by The Los Angeles Times.“Fox Business has always been about putting the smartest, most interesting people on television and the addition of Lou Dobbs will serve to strengthen the best lineup in business news,” Kevin Magee, an executive vice president at Fox Business, said in the news release. He said that teaming Mr. Dobbs with Neil Cavuto, the channel’s managing editor, would make Fox Business “a tough network to beat.”Fox Business has struggled to gain ground against the dominant business news network, CNBC. It is not fully rated by the Nielsen Company yet, a Nielsen spokesman said. Some ratings are available, however, and last week they showed that Fox Business beat CNBC on the night of the midterm election.'"

"'10-11-11,'0','Senator John McCain has long defended the rights of military servicemen and women. It is a particular disappointment that he is vowing to filibuster the Pentagon’s spending bill unless a measure repealing the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy is stripped out — or he is satisfied about its effects on morale and readiness.A Pentagon study is due on Dec. 1, and the House-approved bill delays implementation until after that report satisfactorily deals with such issues. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has called for repeal in the Senate’s lame-duck session, and many top military leaders have endorsed repeal as a matter of justice and military readiness. The policy, which bars gay men and lesbians from serving openly, has already driven out far too many talented and expensively trained service members.Mr. McCain, who previously expressed support for repeal providing that it had the military leadership’s approval, should listen. His clout could be decisive. Failure to enact repeal would be a personal rebuff to troops now serving in two wars. It would also fly in the face of the public’s overwhelming support of repeal.Republicans narrowly prevailed in filibustering “don’t ask” in September. A filibuster in the lame-duck session would run out the clock and send the issue to likely oblivion in the incoming Republican-controlled House. Justice demands a vote.Senator McCain has a chance to do right by the military and country he championed as a war hero. He should find a reasonable way to forgo a filibuster and end this grave injustice.'"
"'10-11-11,'0','Although if people had known he was going to tell that story about how his mother put the miscarried fetus in a jar and made him look at it, perhaps more viewers would have tuned in.Or maybe not.The whole interview was confusing. When the first George Bush was president, the White House seemed to go out of its way to drop hints that was pro-choice. Did they know about the fetus jar story?Also, didn’t it seem as if George W. was way more upset about calling him a racist during Katrina than the fact that he invaded the wrong country?And did you notice that Bush kept calling Kanye “Conway?”But I digress. To be honest, the interview did not get bad ratings because of the national . It got bad ratings because it was up against “Dancing With the Stars.”In which has made it to the final four. Once again, traditional Republicans were run over by the grizzly contingent. Bristol is not very good as a performer, but, as her mother put it, “She’s never danced before, and here she’s learning the steps really quickly.”Bristol is up against of fame, who’s been doing great even though she’s 50 with a bad knee and a plate and four screws in her neck. If Bristol wins I think we can take the whole thing as a metaphor for ’s Senate race in .Finally, when popular culture can’t explain what’s befallen us, there’s always historic reference.David Kennedy of theorized in a postelection Op-Ed in The Times that we’re reliving the late 19th-century Gilded Age, when all the presidents proved to be hapless, Congress switched back and forth madly as voters threw the bums out over and over again, and the country experienced a of critical problems and impending crises, combined with “abject political .”The Gilded Age also happened to be the time when the media was wildly fragmented, with thousands of small, underfinanced local newspapers all yapping frantically to try to make an impression. This produced a climate of semihysterical sensationalism, along with some of my all-time favorite headlines. One about Gov. Oliver Morton read: “A Few of the Hellish Liaisons of, and Attempted Seductions by, ’s Favorite Stud-Horse.”This sounds so familiar that I am pretty sure Professor Kennedy is right. So the message is that we should hunker down and wait for the next Teddy Roosevelt to come to our rescue. And then it will almost be time for Prohibition.On the other hand, the Gilded Age had and Eugene Debs and Lillian Russell, who exemplified a beauty standard that extolled fleshy women. A Virginia City man writing to a friend about a tightrope walker named Ella LaRue said admiringly: “Great ‘shape’ — more of it than I ever saw in any female. Immense across the hips — huge thighs.”Maybe it won’t be so bad after all.'"
"'10-11-11,'0','From this collection, I sniffed out a minimal black leather zip-up hoodie ($495) that connoted just the right level of sleaze. A helpful staffer tried to have one in my size shipped from the Los Angeles store, though a few days later, when I saw something similar on an actual sleazy person, I was relieved he hadn’t pulled it off.In supermarkets, the cheap staples are in the back of the store, forcing you to walk past, and possibly purchase, all manner of pricier and higher-margin products. Here, the most expensive items are deepest in the store — the piece farthest from the door was a gorgeous slate-blue fur-lined lambskin bomber ($4,900) — which means one can get in and out with little sweat or financial outlay. A gift shop, basically.Or rather, another gift shop, in addition to the one that sits cater-corner. There, Marc Jacobs flag key chains made of rubber ($8) spill out of a plexiglass box of the sort used to sell bulk candy: perhaps they should be priced by weight. The polo shirts have a rat emblem ($28). Very covetable cashmere ankle socks in an individual slipcase ($14) share space with very absurd T-shirts with Mr. Jacobs’s name spelled out in flaming font, a variation on the old Thrasher logo. Which one will “Sex and the City” tour-takers gravitate to?Or what if you’re not just visiting? On three different occasions, at three different stores, I was told that the item I was mulling over was final sale, which to my ears, sounded a lot like “souvenir.”I felt more at ease in the store devoted largely to handbags, which is not a sentence I expected to type, ever. Spacious, with a solicitous staff, it’s the one stroke of actual luxury in this array of shops, the one place where Mr. Jacobs’s designs feel loved and nurtured, not compressed and tossed off. In the window, each of these purses has room to breathe, the light reflecting off of the stunning, shimmering one covered in hand-stitched sequins in shades of beige and pink ($2,350) not getting in the way of the black-and-gray sequin clutch a few inches over.THE same can’t be said of the men’s or women’s stores, where all sorts of styles are crammed into crannies, with little regard for rhythm or hanger appeal — a byproduct of limited West Village square footage and the belief that much of it is best devoted to impulse buys. A women’s post-Pendleton, post-Santa Fe knit cardigan ($358), one of the store’s highlights, had to be fished out from among print dresses and slacks and more. In a walk-in closet at the back of the store, a pack of military coats ($498) looked dour, though not as dour as the weathered pink leather bench in the middle of the room, probably worn down from the derrières of those who sat to try on the signature Jacobs Wellingtons. In the back of the store, earthy sweaters with rows of jaunty sequins ($248) were slipped into a small cutout shelf on the wall, impossible to admire.The most respectful of the Jacobs stores emphasizing actual clothes was the one for children, which carried pieces chipper enough that most adults wouldn’t look sensible in them, and fantastic enough that one might legitimately get angry at a child for outgrowing them. The graffiti-strewn sneakers ($218) were cute, for the truant-to-be in your life, as was a blue sweater with what appeared to be a panda print ($95), for the girl who will someday pay the truant’s bail. Best were an austere navy and olive boy’s puffy vest — made by Moncler, as it happens — and a lavender corduroy dress with pink accents ($132), which has runway potential.The store was rounded out with a selection of books to stock the library of a future Jacobs, including a punk alphabet book, and one about influential female artists that thoughtfully included Cindy Sherman.Perhaps this is Mr. Jacobs’s destiny, as a curator of taste more than a creator of it. The potential is on display at Bookmarc, the latest stall in the Jacobs souk, where both “3DD: A 3-D Celebration of Breasts” and “Butt Book” are at home. In between, books about Warhol, Galella, Aretha and Pucci happily gaze upon one another, unsullied by the mass-market fiction they’d have to share space with in a Barnes & Noble.This would have been the easiest place to score a totem of my voyage, maybe a skeptical purchase of the n+1 nonhipster antihipster anthology ($10). Or maybe I should have doubled back for the small pen in the shape of a lipstick, or the surprisingly tasteful clip-on bow tie from the men’s store ($43)? In the end, it was a cashmere scarf, in smooth light gray with black and pink accents ($55). Just like the rest, I’m a customer.'"
"'10-11-11,'0','IT’S no secret that former soldiers often feel that their years of service go unsung — even today, on a day dedicated to veterans. But our men and women in uniform get an indirect homage every day of the year, given the undisputed sway the military holds in one realm: the wardrobe. From brass-buttoned blazers and A-2 leather bomber jackets to khaki trousers and camouflage cargo pants, it has bestowed more clothing styles on the civilian closet than any other walk of life.Most often, though, military styles hark back to days and wars gone by, when things like right and wrong were simpler and clearer, or so the romance goes. (Even the United States Armed Forces aren’t immune from regression: In 2007, the Navy revived the Service Dress Khaki uniform made famous in World War II; and this year the Army began bringing back old-fashioned buttons for closures on uniforms of Middle East troops, as all that dust clogs Velcro.)The latest civilian trend is no different: military jackets, which are everywhere now. More like interpretations of military style, they recombine elements of various archetypes (pea coats, double-breasted dress jackets, mess jackets) to create subtly masculine coats with a bit of brass-button flair that are anything but standard issue. Some, notably the stylishly old-fashioned ones at Burberry, look distinctive enough to prompt one to wonder what long-lost British regiment they came out of. Royal Gloucestershire Hussars? Shropshire Light Infantry? Fife and Forfar Yeomanry?They’re surprisingly modern, though. More casual than a suit jacket yet crackling with discipline and rectitude, they have a deft way of avoiding wardrobe pigeonholes like “overcoat” or “sport coat” that can limit a garment’s appeal and utility.“It’s a very easy jacket to wear,” said the designer Joseph Altuzarra, who wears a military jacket by Alessandro Dell’Aqua that he bought a few seasons back. “It’s a stand-in for a tailored jacket, and I can wear it over a white button-down shirt, but it’s also sporty. I can throw it over a T-shirt and jeans. And it’s wool, so it’s very warm.”Indeed, many of the jackets are lined or made of stout felted wool, so they better walk the line between overcoat, business jacket and weekend coat.'"
"'10-11-11,'0','Joe Moglia became the head coach of the expansion Virginia Destroyers of the two-year-old United Football League on Wednesday — his first coaching job in 27 years.He had been the linebackers coach at Dartmouth, and he spent the long detour on Wall Street and then in Omaha, as chief executive and chairman of TD Ameritrade, the online brokerage firm.For the last three years, his compensation totaled nearly $41 million, not bad for a coach.Moglia, 60, said he had not dreamed of returning to coaching but began to think about it when he stepped down as TD Ameritrade’s chief executive in 2008 to become chairman.“There were a lot of opportunities, but then a group of alumni from the Ivy League started talking to me about what would happen if I went back to coaching,” he said in a telephone interview.Instead of returning to his former conference, he met with Tom Osborne, the athletic director at Nebraska, which led to two years as the executive adviser to Coach Bo Pelini.The role has let him watch the team operate but not much else.“The N.C.A.A. doesn’t allow me to coach a position or contribute to the game plan,” Moglia said. “What I’ve gotten really was a private tutorial from Bo Pelini.”'"

"'10-11-11,'0','Susan Golomb, the agent to Jonathan Franzen and William T. Vollmann, moved her agency to Brooklyn in August after 20 years in Manhattan. “My clients don’t care where my office is,” she said. “At this point, if you’re established enough, it’s really about your list and your reputation.”These days Brooklyn has enough writers and publishing professionals to inspire a “Brooklyn Literary 100” list in The New York Observer, or to be called Manhattan’s Left Bank in The Economist.“There’s an inexorable drift toward Brooklyn,” said Elyse Cheney, a literary agent who, for now, is based in SoHo. “That’s where writers are and where so many publishers live. And as the profits of the business may change through the advent of e-books, the profit margins in this industry are becoming narrower, so I would imagine that it makes both financial and artistic sense to move there.”It used to be unthinkable that a decent literary agent would work anywhere but Manhattan. The publishing business was concentrated in fancy Midtown office towers until the 1980s, when many publishers moved to lofts and landmark buildings downtown, in SoHo, Chelsea and the Flatiron district. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, one of the publishing pioneers in Union Square, used to warn employees not to walk across the park after dark.)“When I first started out in this business, you had to be a Manhattan agent,” said Howard Morhaim, whose two-person agency works out of a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights. “It didn’t matter where. You just had to have a Manhattan office. Agents who were outside of Manhattan were considered second class.”When Mr. Black founded his agency in 1990, he found office space near Madison Square, then later moved a few blocks downtown, where even more publishers and agents had relocated.But last year, while out for a run in Red Hook, he was hit by a car, an accident that left him with a concussion, a broken thumb and a broken leg. While he was recovering, he traveled to work in a car instead of the usual subway.“In not taking trains for a month, I realized how much more relaxed I was,” Mr. Black said. “So I said, let’s look in Brooklyn. Let’s see if we can make this work.”The lease in his Manhattan office was up at the end of June, so he began hunting for office space in Brooklyn, a short walk from his home in Cobble Hill. The rent in a high-rise in downtown Brooklyn was slightly less expensive than in Manhattan. And the city offered him tax incentives: $3,000 per employee annually, for 12 years.Three of Mr. Black’s employees already lived in Brooklyn, so they were thrilled to make the move. A couple of others, who live in the Bronx and Jersey City, were not as happy. (Mr. Black usually takes a silver Razor scooter to work, an easy feat on uncrowded Brooklyn sidewalks.)So far the extra distance from Manhattan has not affected his clients, many of whom live outside of New York anyway.“I thought that ultimately, this would be a good thing for my business,” Mr. Black said. “It’s a little bit different. Hopefully some people look at it and say, ‘Hey, that’s kind of cool.’ ”'"
"'10-11-11,'0','“With the Girl Effect, we see the best of Nike” and the best of’ cause marketing, said Mike Swenson, president of Barkley, an agency in Kansas City, Mo., that is active in cause marketing but is not involved in the Nike effort.Nike is “using one of its greatest assets, global reach, to shine a light on a problem that nobody owns,” Mr. Swenson said.Likewise, Carol Cone, managing director for brand and corporate citizenship at the Edelman public relations agency, praises the Girl Effect. In the fourth annual global Good Purpose survey, which Edelman released last week, Nike was ranked third by Americans among companies they considered to be placing as much or more importance on supporting a good cause as they placed on profits — behind only Pepsi-Cola and the Newman’s Own line of food products.“The survey did not delve into specific brands with any further questions,” Ms. Cone said, “so we cannot comment explicitly on why this year’s respondents choose Nike in particular.”“However, Nike has always been a brand known for innovation and pushing the boundaries of design and performance,” she added. “Now, it’s applying this same expertise and pioneer attitude to the cause of women and girls around the world.”Ms. Cone, an expert in cause marketing, cited the “viral movement” created by the Girl Effect as evidence that it was “captivating consumers.” For instance, the video clips on the Web site have been watched more than 1.7 million times.One reason that the Girl Effect appears to resonate so strongly is that advertisements for Nike products have long portrayed the company as “a champion of human potential,” as the authors of the book “Good for Business: The Rise of the Conscious Corporation” (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009) describe the company.Tackling the problems of poor girls in countries like Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Liberia appears congruent with that image, particularly as Nike has continued to champion the cause of women’s athletics through ad campaigns and Web sites like nikewomen.com.It is the “Nike way” to “pick some really big issue” to work on, said Leslie Lane, vice president and managing director of the Nike Foundation in Beaverton, Ore., which has about 25 staff members and spends about $30 million a year.Maria Eitel, president and chief executive of the foundation, along with Phil Knight, chairman of Nike, chose as their “best investment,” Mr. Lane said, an effort to “break the cycle of intergenerational poverty” in poor countries by focusing on “the future mother of every child born into poverty.”“Everything that happens to her in adolescence” will have a profound effect on her and her family’s future, he added, which led to the decision to concentrate on adolescent girls “versus a sector like health or a disease like H.I.V.”The Girl Effect is purposely “not branded as Nike,” Mr. Lane said, which could quell skeptics of the initiative who claim it has commercial intent.Another reason “not having the swoosh” is beneficial, he added, referring to the brand’s familiar symbol, is that the effort can more directly address issues of public policy without seeming to be directed by Nike’s business needs.When it comes to the Girl Effect, “people do say, ‘What is in it for Nike?’ ” Mr. Lane acknowledged. “There’s obviously a benefit to the brand when people say Nike and the Nike Foundation is behind it.”“But we really do not have a commercial footprint in a significant way” in the countries at which the Girl Effect is aimed, he added.Nor is the initiative intended to “offset any issues” that come up between consumers and Nike in areas like labor, Mr. Lane said.“We don’t say, ‘It’s bad here, but look how good we are here,’ ” he added. “It’s just not the way we operate.”'"

You can do very basic video editing on the iPod Touch: trimming the beginning or end of your clip. In the Photos app, open the video you want to edit from the Camera Roll album, and then tap the screen to bring up the playback controls, including the frame-viewer bar at the top of the screen.With your finger, drag the end of the frame-viewer bar from either end of the clip until the part you want to keep is inside the yellow border. Next, tap the yellow Trim button at the top of the screen to cut the unselected frames. You can cut the original clip or make a new copy containing the selected video. Choosing to save the trimmed video as a new clip will leave the original file intact.If you want to do more with your mobile movie production, like adding text, music and scene transitions, visit the iTunes App Store and search for video-editing apps for the iPod Touch or iPhone. You can find several, and most cost less than $5. If you find the editing experience cramped or limited on the small screen, you can always import the clips to your computer and edit them in a desktop video program.Q.

Among those Ms. Hanson has invited from the East Coast are Barbara Byrne, who is a vice chairwoman of Barclays Capital and was vice chairwoman of Lehman Brothers; Maria Cirino, who was a successful serial entrepreneur before becoming a co-founder of .406 Ventures in Boston; and Pauline Brown, who recently resigned as a managing director at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, to pursue entrepreneurial and socially oriented projects. No men will be allowed in the room.“We’re bringing together some of the most successful, financially independent women in the world and asking them to calculate a solution for female entrepreneurs today,” Ms. Perry Piscione said. While women are starting businesses at unprecedented rates, she said, too few are high-growth businesses and too few attract venture capital. “Alley to the Valley” organizers want to increase access to investment funds for female entrepreneurs and introduce prominent East Coast women to what they believe is a huge money-making opportunity.“East Coast women will meet serious investors who will share their networks,” Ms. Perry Piscione said. “Maybe they’ll become angels or superangels. Maybe they’ll structure their own funds. We’re providing the entry point to learn about entrepreneurship and put their money to work in a different way.”The event will take place in the Rosewood ballroom, where all 50 women will sit facing one another around a U-shaped table. Attendees have paid $1,500, not including the cost of the hotel and airfare, to take part in discussions on topics like finding innovative ways to back entrepreneurs, managing multiple angel investments, and avoiding the biggest mistakes female entrepreneurs make. A few entrepreneurs — including Christina Brodbeck, who was a founding team member at YouTube before becoming co-founder of TheIceBreak, a coming Web and mobile game that helps users develop relationships — will recount their experiences and advise on how entrepreneurs and investors can collaborate.If Silicon Valley women will be the masters of this gathering, they say they believe it is because they understand intimately both the substantial risks and spectacular benefits of creating new enterprises. Their entrepreneurial ecosystem has enabled women to attain wealth and clout early in their careers, they believe, and consequently they are more willing than East Coasters to gamble on start-ups.“It’s a culture of risk-taking,” said Ms. Siegel, the venture capitalist. “Entrepreneurship is so embedded here. It’s what everyone talks about. If you don’t participate, you’re on the outside. When I did a counseling event at my son’s school, every single junior in his high school class knew what a venture capitalist was.”Conversely, many East Coast women are entrenched in the corporate realm and lack the networks and knowledge base to invest in new businesses, said Cindy Padnos, a former entrepreneur who is founding managing director of Illuminate Ventures, a venture capital firm in Oakland, Calif. Most Goldman Sachs partners are wildly successful, Ms. Padnos said, but they are rarely entrepreneurial. “Most people coming out of the corporate model, even in finance, have no understanding of the high-tech business model,” she said.In addition, Ms. Hanson said, women who have succeeded on the more corporate East Coast tend to be more fiscally conservative, perhaps because they have had to work longer, and sometimes harder, to make money. Many spent decades fighting for parity as the only woman in a particular department on Wall Street. “It takes longer to make it in finance,” Ms. Hanson said from her office in Greenwich, Conn. “Compensation is still reasonably obscene here, but it’s not a windfall, like if you were employee No. 5 or even 500 at Google. In that case, you’re willing to back other start-ups because you see the enormous potential.”East Coast women may be highly philanthropic, but otherwise “their money is managed by outsiders,” Ms. Hanson said. “There’s no passion around directing it. Instead of giving $100,000 to my favorite charities, maybe I should give $50,000 to charities and invest $50,000 in two start-ups I’m really excited about.”The event is scheduled to conclude Friday evening with a call to action in which participants set goals and action steps to integrate East Coast women into West Coast investing networks and to improve market conditions for female entrepreneurs. In the coming year, Ms. Perry Piscione and Ms. Hanson plan to track dollars invested and deals done as a result of these new connections.Despite the financial setbacks of the last three years, Ms. Hanson is betting that there are still many East Coast women with considerable capital who are ready to redeploy part of it. “Rather than licking our wounds and wondering how much our 401(k)s are down today,” she said, “we need to do something new. We need to partner with the West Coast. It’s a cultural, entrepreneurial revolution. It’s the gold rush, and we want in.”'"
"'10-11-11,'0','Boeing said Wednesday that it was evaluating what had gone wrong on the test flight and had suspended flights for its six test planes.Company officials said smoke entered the cabin from an electronics compartment in the rear of the plane, forcing an emergency landing in Laredo, Tex. Forty-two engineers and crew members were aboard. One suffered minor injuries in evacuating by slide.Boeing has been counting heavily on the Dreamliner, which has attracted more advance orders — 847 — than any plane in history. Its shares fell 3.2 percent, to $67.07 a share, in trading on Wednesday.Boeing said in a statement that it appeared that a power control panel in the electronics compartment would need to be replaced, and other repairs might be necessary. It said it would take several days to analyze data from the test flight to determine the severity of the problem. Boeing added that it “cannot determine the impact of this event on the overall program schedule until we have worked our way through the data.”The Federal Aviation Administration, which must certify new planes as safe, is also investigating what caused the fire.Hans J. Weber, an independent safety consultant, said if the fire stemmed from a flaw in basic electrical components, the problem could be relatively easy to fix. But if it were linked to more advanced electrical controls that help the Dreamliner save fuel, that could require more time-consuming changes. The plane’s development has been marred by persistent problems with Boeing’s far-flung supply network. Company executives have acknowledged that they farmed out too much design and production work and did not initially keep close enough tabs on suppliers.But even though they have made an all-out push to meet their latest delivery schedule, more problems have cropped up over the last several months.A Rolls-Royce engine meant to be used in one of the 787 test planes failed in a test plant in Britain in August, spewing out debris.Boeing cited that engine problem in saying it would push back delivery of the first Dreamliner for the fifth time, from late this year to February 2011. Rolls-Royce has said it is confident it can fix the engine by that date.Rolls-Royce also said this week that the problem on the engine for Boeing did not seem to be related to the failure last week of another Rolls-Royce engine on an Airbus A380 jumbo jet. That engine jettisoned debris while the plane, operated by Qantas Airways, was in flight.Boeing has had to tell suppliers around the world to halt parts deliveries three times this year because Alenia Aeronautica, a unit of Finmeccanica of Italy, could not deliver the 787’s horizontal tails on time. The latest parts delay occurred in late October. Boeing officials have said that poor workmanship by Alenia and other suppliers forced Boeing to rework many parts, further slowing its production line.Alenia agreed last week to fix the problems by year-end.Mr. Aboulafia, the Teal Group analyst, said he doubted that Boeing would be ready to deliver the first Dreamliner before the second quarter of 2011. Robert Spingarn, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said that before the fire broke out on the test plane, he had also concluded that the first delivery was not likely until April. With all the reworking of parts, he said, “the aircraft, at this point, is being hand-built.” He said Boeing knew there was “an important statement to be made” in delivering that first plane as soon as possible.But he said that Boeing still had so many fixes to make on the next 20 to 25 planes that it would be hard pressed to deliver more than 27 planes next year.Robert Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note earlier this week that Boeing executives told him on Monday that assembly of many of the first 30 aircraft would take longer than expected. Mr. Stallard said he now expected Boeing to deliver only 24 of the planes in 2011.He said Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., who was at the meeting, believed that the company would probably need to build 40 to 50 Dreamliners before overcoming all the potential problems.Still, investors have been patient with Boeing over the delays. It still has a two- to three-year edge over Airbus in building more fuel-efficient carbon planes, and the demand for new planes is strong as airlines emerge from the recession.'"
"'10-11-11,'0','Enthusiasm was kept in check ahead of a crucial meeting by world leaders. Members of the Group of 20 will be meeting on Thursday and Friday in South Korea.The gathering comes as countries like the United States and Japan try to stimulate economic growth, taking measures that have weakened their currencies. A global economic recovery has been slow, and many developed countries like the United States have struggled to expand at a pace that will cut high unemployment.Major European indexes all slid as worries grew about debt problems in Ireland. The euro slipped below $1.38 and the dollar rose against other major currencies. Concerns about mounting government debt in many European countries have occasionally dragged down stocks around the world throughout the year. Countries like Ireland and Greece are facing rising debt with little signs of growth.The dollar had been weakening against other currencies in recent weeks because of the program by the Federal Reserve to buy Treasury securities in an effort to drive interest rates lower and ignite spending and lending.A weaker currency makes a country’s exports cheaper and more attractive overseas. Japan has been especially active in trying to weaken its currency because its economy is so reliant on companies like Sony and Toyota that rely on exports.Bond yields were marginally lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ended at 2.63 percent, down from 2.64 Tuesday.The FTSE 100 in Britain closed 1 percent lower, as did the DAX index in Germany. The CAC 40 of France fell 1.5 percent.In Asia, China’s Shanghai composite index fell 0.6 percent, to 3,115.36, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slumped 0.85 percent, to 24,500.61.The declines in Asia and Europe came after China’s central bank announced it would raise the amount of cash that banks need to hold in reserve. Also, China’s leading credit rating agency lowered its view of United States debt in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s latest effort to revive the economy.The artificially low level of China’s currency, the renminbi, is likely to be one of the main topics of discussion during the two-day G-20 meeting.Investors are concerned that the decision by the People’s Bank of China to raise the reserve-ratio requirements of banks by half a percentage point — to cool lending, particularly in the overheated real estate market — beginning next Monday will be the first in a series of tightening measures.A day ahead of a report on inflation in China and the G-20 meeting, there were growing concerns in the markets that China is preparing to tighten policy further to dampen down on price pressures and rein in sky-high growth levels.“The timing may well be an indication of plans for more substantial tightening in an attempt to slow economic growth,” said Derek Halpenny, an analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average was the best performer in Asia, closing up 136.03, or 1.4 percent, at 9,830.52 as the dollar rose to near 82 yen, giving exporters some respite from a strong Japanese currency.'"
"'10-11-11,'0','Revenue increased 27 percent from the third quarter last year, to $34.1 billion.G.M. earned $2.1 billion in North America, the region that had been responsible for most of its losses in recent years. It lost $559 million in Europe. It had $33.5 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30, up from $31.5 billion as of June 30.“We know we have much more work to do,” G.M.’s chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, said in a conference call with analysts and reporters. “We still need to fix Europe. We continue to be vigilant in reducing costs in the enterprise, and we have just started doing a better job marketing our brands to consumers.”Company executives have been traveling this week to meet with potential investors to convince them that the new G.M., formed by discarding burdensome assets in bankruptcy protection last year, is positioned to consistently generate a profit.G.M. can earn about $11 billion to $13 billion a year under normal market conditions and as much as $19 billion in boom times, Mr. Liddell said in a video created for would-be investors and posted online.Three years ago, G.M. needed to sell nearly four million vehicles a year in the United States to break even, but today, it can be profitable at roughly half that sales volume, Mr. Liddell said in the video. Hourly labor costs have been cut by more than two-thirds, to $5 billion, from $16 billion in 2005, he said.Through October, G.M. was on pace to sell about 2.2 million vehicles this year in the United States, about half as many as it did in 2005, when it lost $10.6 billion.It shed four of its eight domestic brands, shutting down Pontiac, Saturn and Hummer, and selling Saab to a Dutch company, Spyker Cars. Over all, G.M.’s sales are up 6.6 percent this year, but sales by the brands that are still offered, Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC, are up 22.1 percent.New models, including redesigned versions of the Buick LaCrosse sedan and Chevrolet Equinox crossover vehicle, have been well received by critics and consumers, to the point that G.M. has struggled to keep up with demand. Early sales of a critical new small car, the Chevrolet Cruze, have been brisk, and G.M. is about a month away from introducing the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid car that it says represents the company’s future direction.G.M.’s public stock offering, expected to occur Nov. 18 and be worth at least $10.6 billion, will allow the federal government to begin recouping the bulk of its $49.5 billion investment in the automaker. The government plans initially to sell about a third of its 61 percent stake in G.M., in the hope that it can divest the remaining portion as the shares’ value increases.The automaker said last week that shares would be priced from $26 to $29, after a three-for-one split. Other G.M. stakeholders, including a trust that pays health care costs for union retirees, plan to participate in the offering.Ultimately, the government needs to sell its shares for an average of about $44 to break even. The Treasury Department already has recovered $7.4 billion from G.M., including interest and dividends, and is slated to get a $2.1 billion more after the offering, from a deal in which G.M. has agreed to repurchase preferred shares held by the Treasury.Separately, G.M. confirmed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had removed one of the underwriters for its public offering, because an employee of the bank distributed an “unauthorized e-mail” containing information about the offering. G.M. did not identify the bank, but UBS is no longer listed as an underwriter on G.M.’s amended registration forms. G.M. said that the e-mail might violate S.E.C. rules, but that nonetheless, “We do not believe that we will be subject to any material liability.”G.M.’s third-quarter profit surpasses the $1.7 billion earned in the same period by the Ford Motor Company, the only Detroit automaker to avoid bankruptcy. Ford has earned $6.3 billion so far this year.Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection a month sooner than G.M. and is 8 percent owned by the federal government, said on Monday that that it lost $84 million in the third quarter but posted a third consecutive operating profit. Chrysler expects to have a public stock offering in late 2011.'"
"'10-11-11,'0','The Argentine invasion of the Falklands in 1982, and the military operation that restored British control, was a major shock for the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.Over the succeeding years, Britain has reinforced its small military garrison on the islands, which are 8,000 miles from Britain, and repeatedly reaffirmed its intention to maintain control there in the face of continued Argentine claims to sovereignty.The discovery of significant reserves of oil in the chilly waters surrounding the islands has added a new edge to the dispute.Naval power, including the use of carrier-borne Harriers, was central to the recovery of the Falklands and added a new chapter to Britain’s historic reliance on the Royal Navy to project military power.But last month when the Cameron government announced deep cuts in the $60 billion annual military budget as part of a wider austerity program aimed at cutting its growing debt burden, one of the principal casualties was the navy’s carrier force.In a choice between competing claims by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, the government chose to immediately mothball the Ark Royal — which, after 25 years in service, is the only British carrier capable of launching fixed-wing jets — and to scrap all of the Harriers operated by the navy and the air force.The decision amounted to a reprieve for most but not all of the air force’s Tornado jets, which were chosen over the Harriers because, the Defense Ministry said, the Harriers alone could not have maintained the air support for Britain’s 10,000-strong military contingent in Afghanistan.The new defense configuration also involved another highly contentious move: the go-ahead for a $9 billion program to complete two new aircraft carriers already under construction in British shipyards, and to equip one of them with a new generation of aircraft, a naval version of the Joint Strike Fighter.The decision attracted widespread criticism, in part because the government said it was cheaper to finish building the carriers than to scrap them. It has said it intends to sell one of the two carriers within three years of its entering service, and does not expect the second to be operational, with aircraft, before 2020.That left Britain with the prospect of a 10-year gap without any carrier-borne strike aircraft, a prospect that the admirals seized upon in their letter to The Times.“The last treasury-driven ‘10-year rule’ in the 1930s nearly cost us our freedom, faced with Hitler,” they said, referring to a military strategy that assumed Britain would have a decade to prepare for war with Germany, with resulting weaknesses that Hitler exploited.The officers who signed the letter included two former heads of the Royal Navy, Lord Alan West and Sir Julian Oswald, as well as Vice Adm. Sir Jeremy Blackham and Vice Adm. John McAnally. They were joined by a former army commander, Maj. Gen. Julian Thompson.Defense Minister Liam Fox rejected the assertion that the cuts exposed the Falkland Islands to attack, telling The Times in a statement that Britain maintained four Eurofighter Typhoon warplanes on the islands, as well as a small unit of Royal Marines.“It is simply not the case that decommissioning the Harrier would impact on our ability to defend territories in the South Atlantic,” he said. “We maintain a wide range of assets, not least a well-defended airfield to ensure the defense of the Falkland Islands. We have a far greater presence than previously, able to respond to any and all threats.”'"

"'10-11-12,'0','The New York Philharmonic might want to be careful about this sort of thing. (Though you have to hope not.)Alan Gilbert conducted the orchestra and the New York Choral Artists in Mendelssohn’s grand oratorio “Elijah” at Avery Fisher Hall on Wednesday evening as part of a tribute to Dimitri Mitropoulos, its music director from 1951 to 1958 (after two years as co-conductor), on the 50th anniversary of his death. Mitropoulos conducted the work with the orchestra in April 1952 at Carnegie Hall, and it must have been quite an occasion.Mitropoulos devised a stylized dramatization of a sort that we might today call semistaged. The choristers, robed in red and perched on high risers, gestured broadly on cue. Archival materials on display in a Mitropoulos exhibition in the Bruno Walter Gallery include a newspaper clipping showing Mitropoulos rehearsing women of the chorus, all arms raised skyward. (The clipping is part of a slide show on the orchestra’s Web page for the tribute, nyphil.org/about/bio_mitropoulos.cfm.) The vocal soloists moved about the stage and up and down the risers.As for the musical values, the Philharmonic lets you hear them for yourself, presenting a broadcast recording of the entire performance in the Web tribute. And though far from perfect, it is a revelation of how thrilling much of this music can be. Had anyone onstage on Wednesday bothered to listen to it?That Mr. Gilbert applied only one theatrical touch — deploying the boy soprano on the lookout for desperately needed rain in the second balcony — is neither here nor there. Physical theatrics do not necessarily translate into musical excitement (though in Mitropoulos’s case, they surely didn’t hurt), nor are they necessary to achieve it. But the emotional engagement evident in, for example, the haranguing exchanges between Elijah and the idolatrous mob in the recording was scarcely to be found onstage except in individual numbers by vocal soloists.'"
"'10-11-12,'0','He planned to install a Skystream wind turbine in his front yard at a cost of $7,500, lowered from $20,000 after government subsidies for alternative energy.But the path to Mr. Miller’s dream of energy self-sufficiency took a turbulent turn after he filed the required permit application with the city’s building department. Acting on the advice of a city planner, Mr. Miller capped the windmill at 35 feet, the height limit for buildings in his low-density neighborhood.Mr. Miller’s neighbors caught wind of his plans through public notices. “We object to the windmill because it will make noise, create movement with odd shadows and be an eyesore to look at,” Jack Lawhon, who lives two doors from the Millers, wrote in a letter to the San Francisco Planning Department.Mr. Lawhon was not alone in his objections.The board of the Miraloma Park Improvement Club, a neighborhood group, voted unanimously to file an appeal seeking rejection of Mr. Miller’s permit application.In various documents, the club outlined a dizzying list of objections: The wind turbine would be ugly and noisy and create light pollution; it would distract drivers and kill birds; it would be ineffective; it could topple.“It has everything to do with how it looks, and they think it’s ugly,” Mr. Miller said. “If we want energy independence in this country, we’re going to have to change our idea of what’s aesthetically pleasing.”Mr. Miller now has to persuade the planning commission to dismiss the pleas of his neighbors. The commission’s ruling could be appealed to another city board.The turbine is not the only alternative-energy installation to have faced opposition in the city.In the Haight-Ashbury district, neighbors opposed Douglas and Karen Kitt’s proposed solar panel array on the grounds that it was unsightly and could fall off.The Kitts’ project was protected by the 32-year-old California Solar Rights Act, which limits officials’ ability to consider aesthetic issues on applications to install solar panels. But no such protection exists for wind power generators, according to Joshua Arce, an environmental lawyer who helped the Kitts and is working with Mr. Miller.“Wind power is not noisy. It’s not disruptive,” Mr. Arce said. “We have to find a way to promote all forms of renewable energy because the alternatives feature the possibility of 10 feet of sea level rise.”'"
"'10-11-12,'0','So how, exactly, did a deficit-cutting commission become a commission whose first priority is cutting tax rates, with deficit reduction literally at the bottom of the list?Actually, though, what the co-chairmen are proposing is a mixture of tax cuts and tax increases — tax cuts for the wealthy, tax increases for the middle class. They suggest eliminating tax breaks that, whatever you think of them, matter a lot to middle-class Americans — the deductibility of health benefits and interest — and using much of the revenue gained thereby, not to reduce the deficit, but to allow sharp reductions in both the top marginal tax rate and in the corporate tax rate.It will take time to crunch the numbers here, but this proposal clearly represents a major transfer of income upward, from the middle class to a small minority of wealthy Americans. And what does any of this have to do with deficit reduction?Let’s turn next to Social Security. There were rumors beforehand that the commission would recommend a rise in the age, and sure enough, that’s what Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson do. They want the age at which Social Security becomes available to rise along with average life expectancy. Is that reasonable?The answer is no, for a number of reasons — including the point that working until you’re 69, which may sound doable for people with desk jobs, is a lot harder for the many Americans who still do physical labor.But beyond that, the proposal seemingly ignores a crucial point: while average life expectancy is indeed rising, it’s doing so mainly for high earners, precisely the people who need Social Security least. Life expectancy in the bottom half of the income distribution has barely inched up over the past three decades. So the Bowles-Simpson proposal is basically saying that janitors should be forced to work longer because these days corporate lawyers live to a ripe old age.Still, can’t we say that for all its flaws, the Bowles-Simpson proposal is a serious effort to tackle the nation’s long-run fiscal problem? No, we can’t.It’s true that the PowerPoint contains nice-looking charts showing deficits falling and debt levels stabilizing. But it becomes clear, once you spend a little time trying to figure out what’s going on, that the main driver of those pretty charts is the assumption that the rate of growth in health-care costs will slow dramatically. And how is this to be achieved? By “establishing a process to regularly evaluate cost growth” and taking “additional steps as needed.” What does that mean? I have no idea.It’s no mystery what has happened on the deficit commission: as so often happens in modern Washington, a process meant to deal with real problems has been hijacked on behalf of an ideological agenda. Under the guise of facing our fiscal problems, Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson are trying to smuggle in the same old, same old — tax cuts for the rich and erosion of the social safety net.Can anything be salvaged from this wreck? I doubt it. The deficit commission should be told to fold its tents and go away.'"

"'10-11-12,'0','Mr. Stec, 67, has a traumatic brain injury, dementia and depression. Like the others, he’s either an illegal immigrant or somebody who otherwise can’t be identified. That means they’re not entitled to Medicaid or Medicare.Perhaps they were in an accident or a fight or became mentally ill and wound up in a hospital or psychiatric ward. Their family’s whereabouts may be unclear, or to no avail if family members want nothing to do with the patient — especially given the burden they represent.There’s a developmentally disabled man who goes by Witek Doe at a group home in Skokie. The state thinks he’s an illegal immigrant from Eastern Europe.Sanane Night is at Read Mental Health Center with psychiatric issues. He claims different identities and Social Security numbers. He has a police record and says he’s from California.Juan Ramirez has a brain injury and is in a persistent vegetative state at nonprofit Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital. He’s an illegal immigrant with a history of arrests and, officials believe, a family in Mexico who won’t come forward.On Friday, Mr. Ramirez will have been at Schwab for 745 days, with Schwab eating the cost of about $250,000. “If you were documented, you would not be here,” said Michelle Gittler, a Schwab attending physician. But more appropriate facilities won’t take him since he has no insurance.Zhen Ming Chen is an illegal Chinese immigrant and former restaurant worker who was left a quadriplegic after a car accident. He lies unconscious in the same Hillside home, with a wife in China and nieces and nephews here who all decline guardianship.“A lot of these people overstayed their visa and were flying under the radar screen,” said Helen Godlewski Brownfield, program director of the guardian’s office. “They clean houses, work in kitchens, do lawns and fall between the cracks.”They can’t stay forever in a hospital, like the county’s Stroger Hospital, so the guardian’s challenge is finding another place for them after they’re stabilized.Mr. Stec wound up at for-profit Renaissance due to a Stroger contract with the home. He was at Stroger after an accident of unclear origin. Mrs. Brownfield speaks Polish and extracted bits and pieces of his life.He told her he came here 20 years ago, worked odds jobs, including dry walling, and married an American who died 15 years ago. He couldn’t remember where they lived. Mrs. Brownfield learned independently that he’d apparently abandoned a wife and three children, who live in one-bedroom public housing in Poland.As Mr. Stec sat hunched around a circle with 12 others in the activities room, Danny and the Juniors’ “At the Hop” played on a radio. Mr. Chen was in his bed a floor below, getting oxygen through his trachea. Only his eyes moved slightly as televisions offered “I Love Lucy” and “America’s Next Top Model” to a benumbed audience of two patients.“He doesn’t respond; he just grimaces,” said Tam Tran Chavez, his diligent case worker and herself an immigrant oddity, namely a Vietnamese married to a Mexican, or a Vexican, as she jokes.As we left, a nurse was calling out, “I-30” and “B-13,” then asking Bingo players down the hall to clear their boards. Mr. Chen seemed oblivious to it all.But maybe not.'"
"'10-11-12,'0','Plumbing yuppie fears may not be your first choice of an evening’s entertainment, but “Helena From the Wedding” has a little more to offer than many films of its type. Among its achievements is the kind of comfortable, shaded acting we expect from seasoned professionals and a script (by the director, Joseph Infantolino) that almost scarily captures the cadences of whining white privilege.Working with general themes of romantic dissatisfaction and career frustration, Mr. Infantolino stuffs a selection of 30-something anxieties into a cabin in upstate New York where a recently married couple (Lee Tergesen and Melanie Lynskey) are hosting a New Year’s Eve party. Into their close-knit group comes Helena (Gillian Jacobs, flubbing an irrelevant English accent), a young hottie whose arrival is the signal for at least two of the male guests to make complete fools of themselves.As everyone eats, drinks, snorts cocaine and stares down 40, Stephen Kazmierski’s camera negotiates the cabin’s cozy interior and icy exterior with unhurried calm. The film’s gender conflicts are hardly new — guys fret over roads not traveled, and women worry about dwindling attractiveness — but the performers know how to sell them.In a particularly thankless role, Paul Fitzgerald is surprisingly touching as Nick, a newly separated lonely-heart desperately seeking a much younger partner. Compared with his friends’ pregnant silences and passive-aggressive jibes, Nick’s fake cheer is the least dysfunctional emotion on screen.Written and directed by Joseph Infantolino; director of photography, Stephen Kazmierski; edited by Jennifer Lilly; production design by John Bonafede; costumes by Natasha Noorvash; produced by Alexa L. Fogel and Brendan Mason; released by Film Movement. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 29 minutes. This film is not rated.'"

In short, he doesn’t seem the type to care much about political rhetoric, yet he repeats the line several times; his body ripples in spasms. Loosely cupping his hands as if they were holding marbles, he quivers back and forth: a boxer’s moves, deconstructed.Performed at Performance Space 122 and described in press notes as a “fake take” on Beckett (“Waiting for Godot”), Sartre (“No Exit”), Bukowski (“Barfly”) and Jean-Luc Godard (“Contempt”), “now and nowhere else” is an abrasive and indulgent contemporary tale using the usual contemporary tools — a mix of dance, music, theater and video. It’s an existential pastiche that feels familiar.Mr. Findlay, known for his work with the Collapsable Giraffe, Wooster Group and Radiohole theater companies, now lives in Norway with Ms. Sandsmark, his partner, a Norwegian choreographer and dancer. The most unusual thing about this work is the presence of Diane Madden, a veteran of the Trisha Brown Dance Company who seems winsomely out of place in this highly designed anarchic world.The music, composed by Pal Asle Pettersen, in which sound buzzes like amplified high-voltage electric wires, mirrors the mood of this chaotic world, in which passages of text, including lines from “Barfly,” trickle by. Brash and swilling beer, Mr. Truman, as loud as he is lanky, is an object of some desire here; he reads lines from “No Exit” while ripping out the pages and chewing them up.“You act like some weird blueblood, like royalty,” Ms. Madden later tells him, as Ms. Sandsmark whips from side to side, twisting her body as if she were wringing it out to dry. Her movement, while contorted and grotesque, is strung together with an unwitting fluidity. Ms. Madden, with her delicate power, glides through a chain of positions with silken agility, saying quietly: “This is my dance. I made it 27 years ago. Have you ever done something for 27 years?”It’s a strange notion, especially in a work mired in layers of references but with little potent to reveal. “Now and nowhere else” takes its wildness seriously yet isn’t wild — or specific — enough.'"
"'10-11-12,'0','The choreography of Eryc Taylor is sincere, well intentioned, earnest, inoffensive, old-fashioned, neat and forgettable. His hourlong program of five pieces on Wednesday at Joyce SoHo was called “Pushing Boundaries,” but it is hard to know what boundaries were being pushed here that were not pushed more memorably several decades ago.The dance vocabulary is far-from-virtuoso ballet delivered (like so much choreography from the 1960s and ’70s) with the expressionist stress and torso-heaving force of old-style modern dance. The program notes explain the specific intention or inspiration of each short dance — “DrownTown,” “Wraith,” “The Polarity,” “The Missing” and “Terminus.” (“Personal loss delineates the ghostly vocabulary of ‘Wraith,’ a duet for women evoking the emotions of an unfinished relationship.”)Boundaries here seem mostly accepted. Each piece parcels up a human situation into an orthodox study. Rhythms are regular; facial expressions show how each character is feeling and how we should too; costumes also show just what kind of person each is, and in what state of undress. Everyone is frightfully intense, of course, but along conventional lines.“The Polarity” is, as the program note says, a male duet that “explores the eroticism fueled by testosterone-driven energy during competition,” but it doesn’t explore far. Gierre Godley and Dillon Honiker, in suits and ties (but barefoot), vie with each other in macho ways that dimly suggest a mutual attraction, but it is fair to feel that the program note promises more eroticism than the choreography delivers.The most remarkable dancing occurs in “The Missing,” a solo in which Michelle Pellizzon’s arching spine makes several striking impressions. But as she tosses her mane of water-sprinkled hair around to cast little showers in one arc after another, we can’t help being aware how calculated the effect is. “DrownTown” depicts fleeting sexual liaisons and jealousies amid an urban context.I am sorry that despite careful attention on my part to “Terminus,” I missed the bit where, according to the program, a “post-apocalyptic survivor summons others to form a unit of strength to survive.” I saw a unit, but I had no notion that they intended to survive; I assumed they were all striking defiant poses in the hell to which these damned spirits had deservedly been sent. Each dance has its own shape and mood, but none have enough complexity to reward scrutiny.'"
"'10-11-12,'0','Cute, diligent and armed with highly sophisticated detection tools — their noses — these dogs are fast becoming the American equivalent of the St. Bernard rescuing the snowbound in the Alps. Commercials vaunt bedbug-sniffing dogs’ prowess and purport up to 98 percent accuracy. In New York, a bedbug-sniffing beagle named Roscoe has become so well known — he has a Facebook page and now an iPhone app — that fellow beagles often are mistaken for him on the street.But as the number of reported infestations rises and the demand for the dogs soars, complaints from people who say dogs have inaccurately detected bedbugs are also climbing. And in the bedbug industry, where some dog trainers and sellers have back orders until spring despite the dogs’ $11,000 price tag, there are fears that a rise in so-called false positives by dogs will harm their credibility and business.“Many pest control companies have the same frustration,” said Michael F. Potter, an entomology professor at the University of Kentucky, “that they often follow behind dogs that are indicating bedbugs, and they can’t find anything.”In a co-op near Union Square in New York, a dog indicated bedbugs in a third of the 50-odd apartments, though physical traces of bedbugs were found in only five, according to one resident. He resisted pressure from the co-op board to get a $1,500 treatment because his family had not been bitten by or seen traces of bugs.A designer on the Upper West Side said a dog brought in by her co-op to inspect every apartment had detected bedbugs in her home even though neither she nor her husband had been bitten. An inspection by a different exterminator revealed no bedbugs, but her building paid thousands of dollars for apartments to be treated, including those where bedbugs had not been found.Jessica Silver and her husband paid $3,500 in extermination fees after a dog indicated there were bedbugs throughout their row house in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. They got rid of 40 garbage bags full of clothes and baby toys that they feared were infested and their Pottery Barn queen-size bed. But Mrs. Silver continued to get bitten, and she called another exterminator, John Furman of Boot-a-Pest, based on Long Island, who spent two hours combing through her bedroom, where the biting was taking place, only to find no traces of bedbugs, alive or dead.The culprits, she eventually discovered, were rodent mites. Mr. Furman said the antibedbug treatment probably killed some mites but failed to eradicate their breeding grounds in the walls.Mrs. Silver did not want to name the bedbug-sniffing dog company she used. After she posted details of her case on an online bedbug forum, she said a company representative threatened to sue her for slander, and the moderator of the forum took her post down.“Everyone’s getting sucked into the whole bedbug pandemonium,” Mrs. Silver said.While many dog companies advertise an accuracy rate of 95 percent to 98 percent, that figure is taken from a 2008 clinical trial conducted under controlled conditions by an entomology team at the University of Florida. Their findings do not necessarily reflect the success rate of individual companies’ dogs, operating in the real world with a lot more variables.Dog experts say false positives can result from the poor training of a dog or its handler. The dog might detect a different type of insect. Or the dog could be reacting to a cue from its handler, be it accidental, like reaching for a treat to reward the dog, or, more ominously, on purpose. Pepe Peruyero, a trainer who runs the J&K Canine Academy near Gainesville, Fla., said if a dog’s company also offered extermination treatment, it was “financially advantageous” to have a dog alert.False alerts can also be made by well-trained, highly attuned dogs. Andrew Klein of Assured Environments, based in New York, said dogs might pick up on bedbug scents transmitted by clothes or wafting through ventilation from a neighboring apartment. “The dog can’t tell us gradations of intensity,” Mr. Klein said. “If there is no bug, if there is no bite, we monitor.”The apartment in Union Square had bedbugs a year earlier; though the bugs were eradicated, it was possible their scent remained. The owner of that apartment, as well as the Upper West Side designer, spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not want their names associated with bedbugs, but others in their buildings also said that dogs had indicated bedbugs even though no physical evidence of the bugs was found.'"
"'10-11-12,'0','And thus he traced a beverage frontier that is bound to get more attention over the next few years, as cocktail worship and coffee fetishism inevitably overlap.The Randolph unveiled its coffee cocktails — three of them iced, two of them hot — about four months ago. Just last month Fort Defiance, an 18-month-old bar and restaurant in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, brought back its two much-beloved coffee-alcohol amalgams, which it had introduced a year ago and then cycled off the menu last spring, as the weather warmed.At the moment these two establishments represent rare bars that take pride in, and promote, drinks incorporating coffee. But St. John Frizell, the principal owner of Fort Defiance, doesn’t think that will remain so for long. “Cocktail culture and coffee culture are so similar,” he said, noting that each presents would-be chemists with a less geeky, more sybaritic opportunity for gadgetry and potion making. “It’s a lot about machines and science.”I found myself calling him — and thinking about spiked coffee in general — on the heels of all those news reports about the caffeinated malt liquor Four Loko, which helps young revelers stay awake later, so they can drink longer.Caffeine with alcohol: how dangerous, how insidious, how ... Irish coffee. Indeed, there is a long if not entirely glorious history of caffeine and alcohol joining forces, of whiskey or liqueurs poured into after-dinner coffee by adults looking for the same sort of effect that Four Loko fans seek: an extension of the night without a surrender of the buzz.“You want to wake up but you don’t want to sober up — not yet,” Mr. Frizell said of the rationale behind spiked coffee. Fort Defiance sells most of its versions of these drinks around 10 or 11 p.m., not earlier and not during weekend brunch, when people craving the hair of the dog almost always opt for a bloody mary, he said.One of Fort Defiance’s offerings is the classic Irish coffee but prepared with a degree of care that the drink doesn’t typically receive. “Our Irish coffee might be the best thing we’ve ever served,” Mr. Frizell said.The coffee is really diluted espresso, made with Counter Culture beans in a La Marzocco espresso machine, and the cream that goes into it is chilled then shaken so that it thickens and gives the drink, which also includes Irish whiskey and sugar, more body.Fort Defiance also serves a variation on this called Koffie Van Brunt, named for the street that it is on. This drink uses eight-year-old rum, in place of whiskey, and cherry liqueur, with cinnamon and orange zest sprinkled on top.Mr. Frizell and Mr. Sidle said that most bars haven’t bothered with proper coffee drinks because of the headaches of proper coffee service: acquiring the equipment; carving out enough space for it; training bartenders to be baristas as well; asking them to take the time during busy hours to make fresh cups of coffee, which is the only way really to get things right.And many restaurants have begun paying truly serious attention to their cocktails and their coffee only in recent years. They haven’t yet integrated those two impulses.At Fort Defiance, whose identity is more bar than restaurant, Mr. Frizell determined early on that he wanted to serve respectable coffee, a decision befitting a borough that strives for the artisanal in all things. Mixing drinks with that coffee was a logical segue.The Randolph, which opened in 2007, didn’t begin serving its coffee cocktails until earlier this year. Looking for a way to bring in some extra revenue before 5 p.m., its operators decided to restyle the bar during the day partly as a coffee shop, with a full array of equipment, beans from top-tier roasters like Counter Culture and Intelligentsia, and a fully trained staff, who let customers choose between cups made through a slow-drip process, with individual filters, or French press.The operators also became familiar with Alchemy, a bar and restaurant consulting firm in which Mr. Sidle is a partner. They asked him, Toby Maloney and the other players in Alchemy to help them develop a menu of special coffee drinks both with and without alcohol. (Among those nonalcoholic ones, don’t miss the Fountainhead, made with sarsaparilla, orange peel and whipped cream, and get a few of the minuscule tartlets called pumpkin pie shots, from Dark Horse Baking, to go with it.)From Alchemy’s exertions the Cup o’ Jerry was born. It’s a hot drink, combining coffee with the Sailor Jerry rum and the Ramazzotti, which has orange notes. An orange-peel garnish seals the orangey deal, for a drink that’s equal parts fruity and feisty.Also intriguing, though a little on the sweet side, is the Slow Trip to New Orleans, an iced mix of coffee, bourbon and sloe gin. Like almost all of the drinks Mr. Sidle mixed for me, it manages to convey coffee flavor without letting the coffee eclipse everything else. Coffee is star but not diva, and the production is indeed a cocktail in the end.But when would one consume it? How many people are downing spiked coffee between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.? (For now, that is roughly the time span during which the Randolph serves coffee cocktails; as the bar turns more staffers into baristas, it will almost certainly extend that period.) The Randolph’s operators say they have plenty of takers.“There are a lot more people who don’t have jobs out there than you think,” said Dave Plate, a partner in the bar along with Hari Kalyan, adding that some of them can even afford not to work, along with the $13 that each coffee cocktail costs.Mr. Maloney added that the announced rate of 9.6 percent unemployment “may be lower than it actually is,” at least judging from the traffic through bars.For House Democrats, that helped close a chapter. But for coffee cocktails, it has apparently opened a door.THE RANDOLPH AT BROOME 349 Broome Street, between Bowery and Elizabeth, Little Italy; (212) 274-0667; randolphnyc.com.'"

"'10-11-13,'0','The privacy laws, enacted a generation ago to prevent Watergate-era abuses of confidential taxpayer information, have specific exceptions allowing the I.R.S. to turn over information in child support cases and to help federal agencies determine whether an applicant qualifies for income-based federal benefits.But because of guidelines in the handling of criminal cases, there are several obstacles for parents and investigators pursuing a child abductor — even when the taxpayer in question is a fugitive and the subject of a felony warrant.“It’s one of those areas where you would hope that common sense would prevail,” said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. “We are talking about people who are fugitives, who have criminal warrants against them. And children who are at risk.”About 200,000 family abductions are reported each year in the United States, most of which stem from custody disputes between estranged spouses. About 12,000 last longer than six months, according to Justice Department statistics, and involve parental abductors who assume false identities and travel the country to escape detection.But, counterintuitive as it may seem, a significant number file one of bureaucracy’s most invasive documents, a federal tax return. A study released by the Treasury Department in 2007 examined the numbers of 1,700 missing children and the relatives suspected of abducting them, and found that more than a third had been used in tax returns filed after the abductions took place.Criminologists say it is unclear what motivates a child abductor to file a tax return: confusion, financial desperation for a refund or an attempt to avoid compounding their criminal problems by failing to pay taxes. Whatever the reason, the details in a return on an abductor’s whereabouts, work history and mailing address can be crucial to detectives searching for a missing child.“It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense,” said Harold Copus, a retired agent who investigated missing child cases, of why abductors provide such information. “But if they were thinking clearly, they wouldn’t have abducted their child in the first place.”The law forbids the I.R.S. from turning over data from tax returns unless a parental abduction is being investigated as a federal crime and a United States district judge orders the information released. But the vast majority of parental abduction cases are investigated by state and local prosecutors, not as federal crimes, say investigators and missing children’s advocates. Even when the F.B.I. does intercede in parental abduction cases, requests for I.R.S. data are rarely granted.When the Treasury Department study identified hundreds of suspected abductors who had filed tax returns, for instance, a federal judge in refused to issue an order authorizing the I.R.S. to turn over their addresses to investigators. The judge, , declined to discuss her decision.Advocates for missing children say that federal judges often argue that parental abductions are better suited to family court than criminal court.“There’s this sense that because the child is with at least one of their parents, it’s not really a problem,” said Abby Potash, director of Team Hope, which counsels parents who are searching for a missing child. Ms. Potash’s son was abducted by a relative and kept for eight months before he was recovered. “But when you’re the parent who’s left behind, it is devastating. You’re being robbed of your son or daughter’s childhood.”In Ms. Lau’s case, her search for her missing son dragged on for two years after the I.R.S. refused investigators’ request for her ex-husband’s tax return. She actually got the tip from the I.R.S., which disallowed her request to claim the boy on her own tax return because someone else had. The boy was eventually found in , after his photo appeared in a flier distributed by missing children’s groups, and he was reunited with his mother at age 15 — five years after they were separated.I.R.S. officials are quick to point out that they have worked closely with missing children’s advocates in some areas. The I.R.S.’s “Picture Them Home” program has included photos of thousands of missing children with forms mailed to millions of taxpayers since 2001. More than 80 children were recovered with the help of that program.Still, attempts to change the law to give the tax agency more latitude have sputtered over the last decade. Dennis DeConcini, a former Democratic senator from , lobbied for the change in 2004 on behalf of a child advocacy group, but said that it never gained traction because some members of Congress feared that any release of I.R.S. data could lead to a gradual erosion of taxpayer privacy. In recent years, much of the legislation involving missing children has focused on international abductions.One problem missing children’s advocates have wrestled with in proposing legislation is determining how much information the I.R.S. should be asked to release from a suspected abductor’s tax return. Should disclosure be required only if a child’s Social Security number is listed on a return? Should child abduction investigators be given only the address where a tax return was mailed? Or the location of an employer who has withheld taxes on a suspected abductor?Griselda Gonzalez, who has not seen her children since 2007, holds fleeting hope that some type of information might reunite her family. Diego and Tammy Flores were just 2 and 3 years old when their father took them from their home in Victorville, Calif., for a weeklong visit and never returned. After Ms. Gonzalez reported their disappearance, a felony warrant for kidnapping was issued for the father, . His financial records suggest he meticulously planned his actions for months — withdrawing money from various accounts and taking out a second — so Ms. Gonzalez doubts he would claim the children as dependents on a tax return.But it gnaws at her that some federal laws seemed more concerned with the privacy of a fugitive than the safety of children.“When your kids are taken from you, the hardest part is at night, thinking about them going to sleep,” she said. “You wonder who’s tucking them in, who will hug them if they have a bad dream or taking them to the bathroom if they wake up. And you ask yourself whether you’ve done everything possible to find them.”“It would be good to know that you tried everything,” she said.Missing children’s advocates see the I.R.S. data as a potentially powerful resource.“There are hundreds of cases this could help solve,” said Cindy Rudometkin of the Polly Klaas Foundation. “And even if it helped solve one case — imagine if that child returned home was yours.”'"
"'10-11-13,'0','Speaking in a video for an ad campaign aimed at ending the bullying of gay teenagers, Cindy McCain, the wife of Senator John McCain of Arizona, broke with her husband and called for a repeal of the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.In a new public service announcement for NOH8, a group devoted to promoting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, Mrs. McCain faces the camera and says: “Our political and religious leaders tell L.G.B.T. youth that they have no future.”)“They can’t serve our country openly,” says Mrs. McCain, whose husband, a Republican and veteran of the Vietnam War, has described the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy as “imperfect but effective.” (His office did not return a phone call seeking comment.)In the video, Mrs. McCain joins a cast of celebrities — including Dr. Drew Pinsky, the actress Denise Richards , and the rockers Gene Simmons and Slash — who appear wearing all white.After other speakers say that “these laws that legislate discrimination teach bullies that what they’re doing is acceptable,” Mrs. McCain says, “Our government treats the L.G.B.T. community like second-class citizens — why shouldn’t they?”'"
"'10-11-13,'0','LONDON — Scotland Yard said Friday that it had sent a new file on allegations of phone hacking by the newspaper The News of the World to the Crown Prosecution Service, which reviews police files for possible criminal prosecutions. The newspaper, one of Britain’s most highly circulated publications, is owned by News International, part of Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire.The prosecution service issued a terse statement saying, “We will consider the file, and advise the police in due course.” Legal experts said it was impossible to say whether Scotland Yard’s action in forwarding the file was a routine administrative measure or a likely preliminary to criminal charges.The development came eight days after Scotland Yard investigators questioned Andy Coulson, a spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron. Mr. Coulson was editor of The News of the World in 2006, when the newspaper’s royal correspondent and a private investigator were arrested and jailed for involvement in accessing cellphone messages meant for members of Queen Elizabeth II’s family.The case was reopened by Scotland Yard in September after The New York Times Magazine published an article outlining how the phone hacking at the London tabloid was more extensive than The News of the World had admitted. The article quoted former employees of the paper as saying that the hacking, though illegal, had been condoned and encouraged by Mr. Coulson and other senior editors.The case has heavy political overtones in Britain, where Mr. Murdoch has broad influence because of his media holdings, which include The Times of London, The Sunday Times and Sky Broadcasting, in addition to The News of the World. With Mr. Coulson now at the heart of Mr. Cameron’s government as media director at 10 Downing Street, the political ramifications have been intensified.Mr. Coulson has said repeatedly that he had no knowledge of the hacking.Scotland Yard officers have also interviewed Sean Hoare, a former reporter for The News of the World, who was quoted in The Times article as saying that Mr. Coulson knew of the hacking. The News of the World dismissed those statements as unreliable, saying it had dismissed him over problems with drinking and drugs.'"

"'10-11-13,'0','“Bluntness,” Mr. Sarrazin said, “on the right subject at the right time is an element of success.”MR. SARRAZIN’S latest blunt assessment came in the form of his book, “Germany Does Away With Itself,” which was released in August and provoked a heated national debate that has still not cooled. The government hosted a so-called integration conference last week, and a group of 650 citizens of Turkish origin issued a public letter saying, “We all feel discredited through the current debate.”Mr. Sarrazin seems to be enjoying it all.“As an author who had something to say and who wanted to influence the public debate, I could not be happier.”What he does not enjoy is being shunned by the political elite, his longtime peers. He has put in writing what he says a lot of people here were thinking. Even Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested — indirectly — that she agreed with one of Mr. Sarrazin’s points, when she said that multiculturalism was dead.Mrs. Merkel said integration into German society was necessary, echoing another of Mr. Sarrazin’s claims.Mr. Sarrazin greeted a visitor to his home one morning, during a rare lull in his schedule of book readings and television and radio appearances. His living room has lots of books on shelves, a few paintings and prints on the wall and a large flat-screen television. There are no personal touches, no family photographs, though he says his hobby is photography.“Some have said I argue that the achievements of immigrants from Muslim countries are lower because of genetic reasons; this is quite wrong,” Mr. Sarrazin explained, as if to cast off any taint of prejudice. “It has to be a matter of culture, and Islam is that culture.”Mr. Sarrazin says his book can be boiled down to a few main ideas. To begin, ethnic Germans are having too few children, while Muslim immigrants are having too many. In a population of about 82 million, there are about four million Muslims (a number he said he calculated partly by looking at census figures for families with lots of children. Big families must be Muslim, he concluded). Within 80 years, he said, Muslims will make up a majority in Germany.Second, Mr. Sarrazin believes that intelligence is inherited, not nurtured, and since Muslims are less intelligent (his conclusion) than ethnic Germans, the population will be dumbed down (his conclusion).Third, to solve a growing demographic problem, Germany will require immigrants, but he says that bringing more Muslims into the country will only make matters worse. He says that after examining three indicators — success in education and employment, and welfare dependency — he concluded that Islam is by its nature a drag on individual success.“I came to a very astonishing conclusion, and this is important,” Mr. Sarrazin said, his voice invoking a bit of drama. “Immigrants from non-Islamic countries show no statistical difference to the German population at all. On the other hand, immigrants from Muslim countries pose much greater problems. Their language skills, academic skills and professional skills are much below average.”WHAT he did not discuss, his critics say, was how it has been well documented in Germany that prejudice and discrimination have made it difficult — nearly impossible — for Muslims to get jobs, find housing or advance in education. A government official in Berlin said recently that many immigrants and their children were given an inferior education that did not prepare them for the work force. Mr. Sarrazin dismisses those factors as secondary, or irrelevant.Still, it seems that what has made Mr. Sarrazin so popular, or notorious, is not just his attack on Muslims, which is certainly not the first. What he seems to have accomplished is blasting open a door many thought was sealed shut by Germany’s Nazi past. As a lifelong Social Democrat, and not some fringe far right extremist, Mr. Sarrazin has made it acceptable for the German everyman to criticize a specific minority group, and to make sweeping statements about that group’s intellectual capacity.His supporters say he is a defender of free speech, breaking taboos with passages like: “No other religion in Europe is so demanding, and no other migration group depends so much on the social welfare state and is so much connected to criminality.”His critics say he has allowed hate speech to go mainstream.“The fact that he scapegoats a religion and associates failure and inferiority with a faith, has ruined the integration discourse in Germany,” said Antje Scheidler, director of the Berlin office of the group Humanity in Action Deutschland. “We are hearing comments and a harshness and, I think, openly racist claims we haven’t seen before.”Mr. Sarrazin said he was gratified by public support and a bit surprised by the degree to which his peer group — the political leadership — has shunned him. He was saying he recently took up golf and hoped to get back to photography, as his doorbell rang. He greeted a man who had come by with two copies of Mr. Sarrazin’s book.He asked that they be signed.“I don’t regret anything I did or wrote,” Mr. Sarrazin said after returning to his chair. “I think I am right.”'"
"'10-11-13,'0','The inspector general with oversight of the federal government’s Corporation for National and Community Service is looking into the grant process of its Social Innovation Fund, a $50 million program meant to expand promising nonprofits.That process came under scrutiny last summer, when critics raised concerns about its accountability and potential conflicts of interest.William O.

"'10-11-13,'0','Television has been broadly feminized for so long now — from the catfight agendas of the reality universe to the women’s-magazine sensibility of the morning news shows — that any network marketed specifically to women has had to find new ways to patronize its audience.WE TV has been faring ably at condescension since 1997, when it began as a channel called Romance Classics. In the years since, it has become a destination for reality shows about the traumas of wedding planning. There have been seven such efforts so far. Another will soon arrive in the form of a series called “Jilted?” (WE’s summary: “So how do you convince a commitment-phobic guy that marriage is the answer? With an ultimatum, of course.”)The network’s most-watched series, though, is a calla-lily-free affair, a reality melodrama called “The Locator,” in which the specters of impetuously made marriages and doomed relationships loom. Now in its fifth season, the show feels like the union of “Stella Dallas” and “48 Hours.” Each week adult children seek to reunite with their birth mothers or vice versa. Wayward fathers search for sons and daughters long gone. Sisters go looking for the brothers no one had ever told them they had. Lies, memory lapses and baroque failures of psychological maturity frame narratives of deprivation in which people seem to lose track of their intimates as if they were umbrellas or car keys.Attempting to retrieve the misplaced is Troy Dunn, the locator, a man with the waxed-finish look of the Learning Annex speaker he becomes in his after-hours. Serving as more than personal detective, he is adjudicator, healer, soundboard, dispenser of platitudes (“Look, we’re really never going to fix the past”) and self-appointed mystic. Each call to a person newly found begins with his announcing: “This is Troy Dunn. I grant wishes for people.”With the help of his mother, who is holed up in a command center in Florida, digging through property deeds, vital statistics and whatnot, Mr. Dunn finds people quickly — all the while maintaining the pretense that each case will be uniquely difficult. Sometimes a Facebook search is all that is required. Hardly a receding presence, Mr. Dunn insinuates himself into the reunion moment, often having surprised the searcher with the news that the relevant missing parent, child or sibling is actually standing right there, just behind the garage.Where “The Locator” really seems to wallow is in the company of spectacularly neglectful mothers. And there it vacillates between tempered reproof and phony sympathy for the impossible domestic choices women are often forced to make. The show doesn’t coax our judgment of maternal incompetence so much as forklift it out of us. In the season premiere last week, Mr. Dunn went looking for two mothers, one who had abandoned her children 20 years earlier — leaving them with her abusive husband — and another who had given up her daughter for adoption at 11 months.Mr. Dunn finds the first mother, Anna, in Alaska, where she has a new family who doesn’t know about her old one, and right away he starts asking the tough questions: “I think your daughters don’t understand that if you knew he was such a monster — they don’t understand why you would leave them with him.” Mr. Dunn doesn’t understand, either, and just in case we might, he goes on to outline the horrors, informing Anna that one daughter was choked and thrown against a wall. But he manages to elicit virtually nothing of an explanation from a woman who has somehow, in her current life, managed to forge a career in day care.New episodes of “The Locator” make their debuts on Saturday nights at 10, an hour when exhausted mothers need palliatives, and dateless women need confirmation that the fantasies sold by series in the vein of “Amazing Wedding Cakes” are possibly specious. Like “Jon & Kate Plus 8,” and so much family-based reality television, “The Locator” appeals to a collective need to feel superior to the seriously problematic. Any mother home self-flagellating because she forgot to take her child for a flu shot can safely feel better than the woman who cannot even remember that years earlier she lied to the father of her child, telling him their daughter wasn’t his.And whoever you are, you will feel saintly when confronted with the image of someone, who, having married an alcoholic and given up her daughter for adoption at 11 months, has no photographs of her and cannot recall her birthday. “Did you love her?” Mr. Dunn asks. “Then?”This is reality television in the most literal sense of the term, counterprogramming to the depictions of perfectionist striving that characterize so much else on WE, where canapés take on the significance of a life quest. It isn’t “Bridezillas” that women want so much as grisly mamas.'"
"'10-11-13,'0','The vase dated from the period of the emperor Qianlong, who reigned from 1735 to 1796, at the height of the Qing dynasty. He vastly expanded China’s western territories and left a legacy as a great patron of Chinese arts, including ceramics. Experts who have examined the vase, which bore an imperial seal, have said it was likely to have been made for one of the imperial palaces.Ovoid in shape and predominantly pastel yellow and sky-blue in color, the vase has a narrow neck, four enameled circular motifs known as cartouches that show colorful fish and flowers, and elaborate perforations in the outer vase that give onto a smaller vase inside. It was believed to have been fired in the imperial potteries in Jingdezhen, in Jiangxi Province, west of modern-day Shanghai, which functioned for 1,000 years as the porcelain capital of China.Ms. Porter said the sellers had no knowledge of how the vase came to be in their parents’ possession, although they believed it had been in the family since the 1930s. One theory, according to Ivan Macquisten, the editor of Antiques Trade Gazette, a British magazine, was that it could have been among the treasures looted by British troops when they sacked the imperial palaces in Beijing during the second Opium War, from 1856 to 1860.It was one of Mr. Macquisten’s reporters who found out what little was known about the buyer.With China’s wealth rapidly rising, mainland Chinese buyers have been a major force in pushing up the prices of Chinese antiquities, reversing, at least in small measure, the flow of Chinese artworks to the West during the centuries before the Communist revolution in 1949 — and the loss of imperial treasures when the Chinese nationalists fled the Communist victory for Taiwan, taking huge quantities of antiquities with them.The vase’s price exceeded the record for Chinese antiquities set just last month in Hong Kong, when another Qianlong vase sold for $34.2 million.For Bainbridge’s, the sale price of the vase represented a huge leap, putting the auction house, at least momentarily, in a league with the blue-ribbon art houses like Sotheby’s and Christie’s, where sales running into the tens of millions of dollars have become almost routine in recent decades. Bainbridge’s biggest sale before Thursday was $160,000 for a Ming enamel piece it sold two years ago.The sale was held in the London suburb of Ruislip, neighboring Pinner, where the vase was found. Pinner is best known in modern times as the place where the singers Elton John and Simon Le Bon went to school.As the auction house was trying to establish a selling price, Ms. Porter said, the vase had been taken for viewing at the Arts Club in London, where it was deposited for some time on a “metal table next to the kitchen.”The auction house itself began to realize its rarity only when a consultant on Chinese ceramics, Luan Grocholski, was called in to evaluate it. “Luan took a long, hard look at it and could hardly believe his eyes,” Ms. Porter said.Still, Bainbridge’s had set its presale estimate between $1.3 million and $2 million.“We are absolutely stunned,” Ms. Porter said after the auction. “This must be one of the most important Chinese vases to be offered for sale this century. How it reached Ruislip is something we will never know, and that it is in such fine condition is amazing.“We’re just a very typical local auction house, so as you can imagine it was something of a surprise.”'"
"'10-11-13,'0','Mr. Smith declined to comment until the confirmation process was complete.The finance agency was created by Congress in 2008 as part of broader legislation to increase federal oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It also oversees the 12 federal home loan banks, institutions owned by private banks and chartered by the government that also provide financing for lenders.About a month after its creation, the agency placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship after deciding they could not survive on their own. The companies have since received $151 billion in federal aid.The arrangement has given the administration an important lever over private lenders, which depend on Fannie and Freddie to buy their loans. For example, the finance agency, through Fannie and Freddie, has pushed companies to address problems with foreclosure documentation.But it has also resisted some of the administration’s policies, like a program to support homeowner investments in energy-efficient technologies.The agency has also struggled to balance its responsibility to minimize losses at Fannie and Freddie with helping homeowners avoid foreclosure.It has navigated those challenges without a permanent director since August 2009, operating under the leadership of acting director Edward J. DeMarco.The chairman of the Senate banking committee, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, and the ranking member, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, sent a joint letter to President Obama this summer urging the appointment of a permanent director, which they described as long overdue. Mr. Dodd said Friday that he would seek to have the committee consider Mr. Smith’s nomination “as swiftly as possible.”Mr. Smith was appointed North Carolina banking commissioner in 2002, a job that entails oversight of state-chartered banks and other lending companies.North Carolina in 1999 became the first state to impose restrictions on mortgage lending at high interest rates. Under Mr. Smith, the state aggressively pursued enforcement of that law, clashing at times with federal regulators who prevented the state from investigating lenders owned by national banks.Mr. Smith also played a crucial role in the state’s response to the collapse of the housing market. He identified abuses by lenders as an important factor in the boom and bust, and pushed for new laws and regulations to curtail lending practices that resulted in high rates of foreclosure.His efforts won praise both from the state’s banks and from consumer protection groups.Mr. Smith has emerged as a national spokesman for state banking regulators, testifying before Congress on several occasions.He previously worked for almost a decade as general counsel of Centura Banks, a North Carolina company since absorbed by the Royal Bank of Canada.His nomination comes after the recent appointment of his deputy, Mark Pearce, to head a new consumer protection unit at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.'"
"'10-11-13,'0','EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The Giants’ potent offense will be without one of its most dangerous weapons Sunday, and possibly longer.Receiver Steve Smith partly tore his pectoral muscle while making a catch Thursday in practice and will be sidelined when the Giants (6-2) play the Dallas Cowboys (1-7) on Sunday at New Meadowlands Stadium. Coach Tom Coughlin said that Smith would be considered week to week but that the injury would not require surgery.“He has to go through a process of healing, so I’m not sure exactly how long,” Coughlin said, adding, “Obviously, it gives other people an opportunity to go.”In Smith’s place, Mario Manningham will most likely be the Giants’ slot receiver, who is typically employed for quick routes underneath coverage. Ramses Barden or Duke Calhoun will be the team’s third receiver.“I just go to play football,” Manningham said of filling in for Smith. “I have to do nothing less, nothing more. Don’t try to make this harder than it is.”'"

In two or three years, I think we will need to have members of the executive committee also located in Asia.”“Some of the main managers of the company have to be located in emerging countries,” he added. “That’s the only way to understand these countries.”EADS swung to a net profit of 13 million euros, or $17.7 million, in the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with a loss of 87 million euros a year earlier, the company said Friday. Revenue rose 18 percent, to 11.3 billion euros.Austerity programs across Europe are widely expected to shrink regional military budgets 10 to 15 percent through 2012 and to make them contract further until at least 2014. The $660 billion military budget in the United States — the world’s largest — will probably be cut about 7 percent over the same period, analysts say.Meanwhile, countries like China, India, Brazil, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have been posting double-digit growth in military and security spending in recent years. EADS has been pursuing lucrative deals in such markets to supply its Eurofighter jets, Eurocopter helicopters and border security and surveillance systems.Airlines in Asia, Latin America and the Persian Gulf region in the Middle East are also dominating demand for civil aircraft. When President Hu Jintao of China visited France this month, EADS announced an $8 billion order for 66 Airbus jets for China. It was the latest in a string of major emerging-market deals announced this year, including an $11 billion order by the airline Emirates, of Dubai, for 32 Airbus A380 jets, bringing that carrier’s commitment to 90 of the superjumbo planes.“These are the regions that are currently the most cash-rich,” said Saj Ahmad, an analyst at FBE Aerospace, a consulting firm in London. “They know there is liquidity there that their customers can tap into, which is less the case in Europe and North America.”Indeed, EADS said Friday that customer advance payments on new orders had helped to bolster its cash position. Its net cash is 10.3 billion euros, up from 9.8 billion euros at the end of 2009.But orders in emerging markets are increasingly coming with strings that oblige manufacturers to build design and assembly facilities in customer nations and to share critical aerospace technology.“I am requesting from everybody inside the company, wherever they are, to think of how to take into account that our growth will come from emerging countries,” Mr. Gallois said in the interview. “What kind of footprint do we need to have in these countries? I think it’s not only part of our manufacturing activities, not only part of our engineering capabilities.”Lakshmi N. Mittal, the Indian-born founder and chief executive of ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel maker, joined the EADS board as an independent director in 2007. Mr. Gallois said Mr. Mittal’s presence was helping the company to recalibrate its focus overseas. “He is helping us to change our mind-set, because he is not thinking locally,” Mr. Gallois said.Mr. Ahmad of FBE Aerospace cautioned that adding — or moving — production and design capabilities abroad, especially to lower-wage countries, was likely to raise hackles in Europe. Governments in Europe have invested heavily in infrastructure and provided significant research and development support to EADS over decades to ensure that highly skilled jobs remain there.“I would think there is a very big risk that jobs are going to move at the expense of jobs back in Europe,” Mr. Ahmad said.But Mr. Gallois stressed that EADS was committed to its home base of France, Germany, Britain and Spain.“I want to be clear that we are not on our way to leaving Europe,” he said. “But we need to build this third pillar in emerging countries. And for sure, in the not-too-distant future, it will be as important as the other two.”'"
"'10-11-13,'0','The Intel Corporation, the big chip maker, announced on Friday that it would raise its dividend by 14 percent as its chief executive said the company expected its “best year ever.”Intel said it would raise its quarterly payout for investors to 18 cents a share from 15.75 cents starting with the first quarter of 2011. With the latest move, Intel has raised its dividend 60 percent over the last three years.Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said the company “remains on track to have our best year ever and we continue to generate strong cash flows.”Intel shares rose 32 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $21.53.As a barometer for the technology sector, Intel has flashed some mixed signals over the last few months.In August, the company cut its quarterly sales forecast, citing “weaker-than-expected demand for consumer PCs in mature markets,” including the United States and Europe. Then last month it offered a more encouraging fourth-quarter forecast that met expectations.Intel’s move to raise its dividend Friday provided a positive counterpoint to Cisco Systems, which prompted a slide in stock prices this week by issuing a disappointing sales forecast.'"

"'10-11-14,'0','Mr. Barstow discovered as much only recently, when Mr. Martin — yes, that Steve Martin — wrote to him after seeing the film. Mr. Martin, in a pink shirt and top hat, can be glimpsed fleetingly in the lower right-hand corner of the image about 20 minutes 20 seconds into the film.Mr. Barstow, who got his first movie camera at 10, was an ardent public champion of home movie-making. He was also an ardent disseminator of his work, first through neighborhood screenings and later through public-access television. Several years ago, he posted his films on the Internet at archive.org, a digital repository of film, video and much else.Sixteen of his movies can be seen on the site, including “Disneyland Dream,” which has been downloaded more than 76,000 times. Another, “Tarzan and the Rocky Gorge” (1936), a stirring jungle drama he made at 16 in the Connecticut woods, has been downloaded more than 150,000 times.The mere thought of home movies is enough to send most people screaming into the street. But in the 1990s the films began to be rehabilitated, and today are prized by archivists, folklorists and historians as social documents.Mr. Barstow’s films are noteworthy for straddling the line between home movies and independent films. They chronicle the stuff of daily life, but they do so artfully, with strong narrative elements. He sometimes “directed” his family, as in a dramatic scene from “Disneyland Dream” in which, on learning they have won a trip to Anaheim, they swoon with theatrical joy on the front lawn.Though most of his films were silent, Mr. Barstow later added voice-over soundtracks. Before that, he recited live oral narration, carefully scripted and timed, whenever he showed a film.“It’s not raw footage,” Dwight Swanson, a board member of the Center for Home Movies, said on Thursday. “He very self-consciously created it and edited it and added special effects.” The center sponsors Home Movie Day, an annual celebration of amateur filmmaking in cities around the world, in which Mr. Barstow was an active participant.Mr. Barstow started out producing films for family consumption. But gradually, his son said, he realized he was putting posterity on celluloid. Though the family did not know it at the time, the entire Barstow household was inhabiting what may well have been the original reality show.Robbins Wolcott Barstow Jr. was born on Oct. 24, 1919, in Woodstock, Vt., and reared in Hartford. His father, a third-generation Congregational minister, was president of what is now the Hartford Seminary.The younger Mr. Barstow earned a bachelor’s degree in English and philosophy from Dartmouth, followed by a master’s in education and history from New York University and a Ph.D. in educational administration from the University of Connecticut.“Disneyland Dream” was born of a nationwide contest. In 1956, the 3M Company offered free trips to Disneyland to the 25 families who best expressed why they loved its signature product, Scotch Tape.All the Barstows — Mr. Barstow; his wife, Meg; and their three children, Mary, 11; David, 8; and Dan, 4 — entered. So confident were they of victory that Mr. Barstow filmed them composing their submissions round the dining-room table. Then he filmed the postman carrying them away.Before long, a prize is awarded to little Dan. (His winning entry: “I like ‘Scotch’ brand cellophane tape because when some things tear then I can just use it.”) Swooning ensues. The film goes on to record the family’s departure amid confetti-throwing neighbors; Southern California attractions like Knott’s Berry Farm; and, finally, Disneyland, then just a year old.Mr. Barstow was also an avid conservationist with a special interest in whales; he made several films about endangered species and helped found Cetacean Society International.His other movies include “Family Camping Through 48 States,” Parts 1 and 2 (1957-61).Mr. Barstow’s survivors include the original cast of “Disneyland Dream”: his wife, the former Margaret Vanderbeek, whom he married in 1942; his sons, David and Dan; and his daughter, now known as Cedar. He is also survived by both subjects of “Touring Paris With Two Grandchildren” (1992); and a great-grandchild.Originally, the pleasure in Mr. Barstow’s films lay in their wide-eyed enjoyment of the larger world — a world that many mid-century Americans would not otherwise have had the chance to see.Today, there is pleasure of a bittersweet kind. There is the tree-lined street and the white clapboard house. There is the happy family, dressed alike in Davy Crockett jackets. There are the neighbors, come to wish them godspeed.As it unfolds in faded color on the computer screen, the Barstows’ world is as distant and enchanted for modern viewers as Disneyland was for them.'"
"'10-11-14,'0','Police officials reported last week that overall crime in the city had dropped for the last 22 months, but a flare-up of violence — including the killings of three police officers — shook the city over the summer. Mr. Weis has been under pressure to undo the city’s bloody image, a task Chicago police chiefs have been burdened with since the days of Al Capone.Mr. Weis must navigate these challenges with an ever-leaner department. As of mid-October, there were 11,187 police officers, a drop of more than 400 since 2005, according to city records. Budget officials have said that police hiring will probably not keep up with retirements next year.Staffing is typically based on finding the right number of officers to respond to calls while maintaining a visible presence and sticking to a budget.It is not simple. One problem is measuring the relationship between police visibility and crime prevention, said William Stenzel, who led the Center for Public Safety at Northwestern University for 26 years and now consults on staffing for police agencies. “What you want to have happen is nothing,” Mr. Stenzel said, “but how do you prove later that it was because of police presence?”In addition, Mr. Stenzel said, it is prohibitively expensive to hire enough officers to respond to every call immediately. The Police Department still accounts for nearly a quarter of Chicago’s $6.2 billion annual budget.“If you want to lower your expense, which means lowering your staffing levels, you’re talking about less reactive policing, which means longer response times,” Mr. Stenzel said.Police officials said the department last made major alterations to its deployment strategy in 1978, when some beats were redrawn to reflect crime and demographic trends. In general, a beat is the area patrolled by one squad car. The beats were drawn smaller in higher-crime areas.Police officials have announced plans to redraw the beat map significantly at least six times since the late 1970s — most recently last year — but each time the plans were dropped.“We looked at beat realignment, and we decided it wasn’t worth the trouble,” said Phil Cline, the police superintendent from 2003 to 2007. “Beat realignment is just about politics.”Mr. Cline said the department had other ways to send officers to areas in need.“The best approach to urban policing,” he said, “is to layer your resources,” with the beat as the first layer. Additional cars patrol groups of beats as needed. Other officers work across beat boundaries in gang or tactical units. Still more are assigned to mobile teams that can flood “hot” areas.Mr. Cline said that the layering strategy worked and that homicides and other crimes dropped sharply on his watch. But he was forced to retire after officers in one of the mobile units — the Special Operations Section — were implicated in a series of crimes, including a murder plot. The unit was disbanded in 2007, though the next year Mr. Weis created a similar one with a new name, the Mobile Strike Force.The Police Department continues to rely on mobile units, and other officers are frequently moved from their regular assignments to help out elsewhere. For example, patrol cars are regularly sent from the Northwest Side to hot spots on the West Side.Mark Donahue, president of the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, said he was not sure what Mr. Weis meant by resource reallocation. “They don’t want to call it beat realignment because the aldermen will get their shorts in a knot,” Mr. Donahue said.Mr. Weis did not give the Council details last month, saying, “We anticipate in the very near future having a resource reallocation that will better balance the workload of our officers throughout the entire city.”Maureen Biggane, the superintendent’s spokeswoman, emphasized that Mr. Weis was not considering drawing new police beats. She said he hoped to announce specifics of the reallocation plan by the first of the year.Mr. Beale, the police committee chairman, said Mr. Weis had good reason for permanently shifting some officers. “In some areas,” he said, “officers are averaging one call in an eight-hour shift when you have officers responding to 25 calls in an eight-hour shift in other areas.”Still, the idea of reallocation troubles aldermen from lower-crime communities.“I can see a car or two being pulled to help for a special event — let’s say if the Cubs win the World Series and they need some extra police over at Wrigley Field,” said Alderman Pat Levar (45th Ward). “But our community pays taxes, and they deserve police protection, too.”Clouding the debate is the department’s reluctance to reveal even basic information about police deployment. Department officials denied a request for current data on the grounds that disclosure could pose a security risk. They also denied a request for deployment data from 2008, saying they do not keep such records because officers are shifted too often.Mayor Richard M. Daley and Mr. Weis have said they moved hundreds of officers to street duty from desk jobs in the past year after commissioning an efficiency study. But department officials will not say where the officers were assigned. They also declined a request for the study.Council members say their access to department information is not much better. “Everything is a secret, and I don’t understand it,” said Alderman Walter Burnett Jr. (27th Ward).Ms. Biggane said aldermen had not been kept in the dark.“The superintendent attends meetings regularly with aldermen to listen to their concerns and to keep them apprised of developments and strategies in the department,” she said. “Once a firm plan is outlined regarding resource allocation, it will be addressed with aldermen.”It is most likely to be a tough sell to members representing the North and Northwest Sides. Mr. Levar said he would not support any major change to deployments until he had current data.Until then, he will continue to use his own means of estimating staffing levels in his ward.“I drive around and see on a Sunday night, for instance, that there are a lot of squad cars in the parking lot of the police station,” he said. “That tells me we don’t have enough manpower here.”'"

"'10-11-14,'0','On a Friday in July 2008, for example, the F.D.I.C. kept IndyMac Bank alive when its survival was in doubt. The agency moved in swiftly to transform IndyMac into a bridge bank, called the IndyMac Federal Bank, and the changeover went so smoothly that many depositors might not have even noticed. The cash machines remained in operation over the weekend, and, on Monday, customers saw what seemed to be the same bank.Later, OneWest Bank took over IndyMac accounts and mortgages — but only after the F.D.I.C. promised to share the losses on the bad mortgages being acquired, according to a complicated agreement.When life is smooth, people tend to remain complacent, reflecting confidence in the economy. In times of crisis, such confidence is also vital, even if government can’t absolutely guarantee that it’s justified. In the future, extending such bridge operations to the likes of a Bear Stearns or a Lehman would hold risks as well as benefits for taxpayer money. That’s where the reframing comes in.The Dodd-Frank Act acknowledges that when the F.D.I.C. moves into deals like this with financial companies, it may need some assistance. So the law creates an Orderly Liquidation Fund at the Treasury, which can issue debt for it as needed. Of course, that could be interpreted as a bailout that uses taxpayers’ money, since the debt has to be repaid somehow.But here’s the reframing: The Dodd-Frank Act specifies that the F.D.I.C. will be paid back through “assessments” on financial companies. These assessments won’t be paid immediately — because such burdens on weakened financial institutions during a financial crisis would put the whole economy at risk. The Treasury can intervene first and be repaid later.This is a classic and potentially effective reframing. Why? The payments are called “assessments,” not taxes. And the context has changed, with the burden appearing to fall squarely on Wall Street, and not on taxpayers.Of course, reframing won’t convince everyone that the government’s interventions are benign. In fact, an assessment is much the same thing as a tax — but placed on businesses rather than on individuals. Ultimately, however, this tax is really paid by the public, because those financial companies are owned by thousands upon thousands of individuals, even though many may not know it. Many people of middle income hold their shares in pension plans or mutual fund accounts, or in the endowments of the churches or colleges to which they contribute.The government has been carefully framing its actions for years. The corporate profits tax, for example, is framed as a tax on “them” rather than “us,” but, in fact, the public owns corporations. And a good part of that tax is passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. (The same, of course, would happen with the Dodd-Frank assessments.)In another example, Keynesian economic stimulus through government deficit spending might be ineffective if it were subjected to rational analysis by consumers, as Robert Barro of Harvard has eloquently argued. People might hesitate to spend their tax rebates today, for instance, if it were clear that future tax increases would be needed to offset the resulting national debt.The general taxpaying public may never figure out the true effect of the corporate profits tax, or the present value of tax bills far in the future. But many people have acquired a sense of suspicion that anything that looks remotely like government largess will show up in higher taxes someday. That is part of the reason for the rise of the Tea Party movement, and was a factor in the recent midterm elections.STILL, well-thought-out framing packages can work. They can help sell crucial intervention packages to people who don’t fully understand the financial system’s complexities or how government interventions prevent disasters.Unemployment is near 10 percent, though it certainly would be much higher had the government not embarked on bailouts. We have to hope that the Dodd-Frank reframing succeeds — and that taxpayer anger doesn’t scare the government away from following the law’s intent aggressively. Such timidity could allow more Lehman-type failures.The framing of the Orderly Liquidation Authority might be regarded as a form of diplomacy, needed to avoid unwanted anxieties that could prevent the Treasury and the F.D.I.C. from taking strong action to support our financial system.This is vitally important. We avoided a depression in 2008 and 2009, and we need to do so again when the next crisis arrives.'"
"'10-11-14,'0','The Democrats’ achievements in the last Congress, Mr. Shuler said, are unpopular with the public because the party’s leadership has been too reflexively partisan. He says a more moderate approach is needed.“It’s my guys that worked probably harder than any group in Washington, did all the right things, voted the right way and still got beat for the simple fact that you’ve got the far edges running the Congress,” he said.His guys are the members of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of conservative Democrats who came together after the Republican sweep of 1994, and, boy, did they ever have a bad Election Day this year. Twenty-four of the bloc’s 58 members were defeated, including two of its four leaders (Mr. Shuler is the coalition’s whip). Four other Blue Dogs are retiring this year.In 2008, 50 Democratic House members were elected in districts that President Obama failed to carry. This month, voters in only 12 of those districts returned Democrats to Congress. Two of those districts are in North Carolina, including Mr. Shuler’s.“North Carolina is just kind of a different place,” said Jim Hunt, a Democrat who is the longest-serving governor — two tenures that totaled 16 years — in the state’s history. “It’s going to always be about the middle of the road.”The state has long nurtured a strand of progressivism, particularly on issues like education, and a Sunday school brand of social conservatism — sometimes in the same candidate. Its politically assorted lineup of senators has included Terry Sanford, John Edwards and Jesse Helms.North Carolina’s curious politics are on full display in Mr. Shuler’s district, which is wedged into the state’s mountainous western corner. It includes the heavily Democratic city of Asheville, home to yoga studios and holistic medicine centers, as well as staunchly conservative hamlets scattered throughout the Blue Ridge Mountains.This month, the district’s voters defeated two incumbent Democratic state senators, but chose, by a margin of nearly nine points, to keep Mr. Shuler. Other Congressional districts around North Carolina followed a similar pattern.At the state level, however, it was a historic day for Republicans. Fueled by an anti-Democratic mood, a high unemployment rate, scandals involving Democrats in Raleigh and an increase in spending by interest groups — much of it from one North Carolina businessman — Republicans gained control of the legislature for the first time since a brief period in the 1890s.Republicans said their candidates, with the help of conservative groups, were finally able to compete financially with Democrats, who have long held the advantage.“The biggest factor this year was money,” said Chris McClure, a former executive director of the state Republican Party. “Republicans and conservative groups really organized well and were able to put more races in play.”It also means that Republicans will hold the pencil when districts are redrawn next year.Gerrymandering, Republicans say, was the reason behind the defensive stand by North Carolina’s House Democrats, who were able to bear the national Republican tidal wave and keep seven of their eight seats and the majority among the state’s delegation. (In the other chamber, Senator Richard M. Burr, a Republican, easily won re-election.)When the new district lines are drawn, said Larry Ford, chairman of the Republican Party in Rutherford County, “Heath Shuler is toast.”The evidence does not suggest that gerrymandering plays such a decisive role in election results, said Andrew J. Taylor, a political science professor at North Carolina State University. He pointed to the results in 2008, when votes for Senator John McCain and Mr. Obama were spread fairly evenly among the state’s districts (Mr. Obama carried North Carolina by fewer than 15,000 votes).Some of Mr. Shuler’s supporters say he and some of the other Democrats won by demonstrating their independence from the national party; Mr. Shuler voted for the cap-and-trade climate change bill and the new financial regulations but against the health care overhaul and the stimulus package.But that explanation, too, falls short. After all, the same “I’m not Nancy Pelosi” argument was made by two dozen other Blue Dogs who will soon be packing up their offices.Echoing the debate among Democrats nationwide, some of the more liberal voters in North Carolina’s 11th District have been turned off by Mr. Shuler’s voting record, going so far as to support a primary challenger this year. Some local party officials said his vote against the health care overhaul dampened turnout, hurting other Democrats on the ballot.“There were a lot of progressive Democrats who were so disgusted with Shuler that they said they were not voting,” said Gina Williams, the treasurer for the Democratic Party in Transylvania County.While he defends his votes, Mr. Shuler, a formidable fund-raiser and campaigner, says a voting record is not as big a factor in elections as a strong presence in the district.Donald Fowler, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, agreed. The Democratic leadership did a terrible job selling its policies, he said, but ideology was not the deciding factor in the election results, including those in Mr. Shuler’s district.“It’s a combination of personality of the individuals involved as well as the population base,” Mr. Fowler said. “I would say in the total picture, being a football star is better than not being one.”'"
"'10-11-14,'0','Convinced that the election will not be fair, another former contra has gone further, taking up arms in the mountains near the Honduran border.“The government keeps violating the Constitution as much as it wants,” José Garmendia, also known as Comandante Yahob, recently told a local newspaper. Though his financial backing is limited to meager donations from a mayor in the north, Mr. Garmendia said he would hunker down until support grew, arguing that “only a rebellion can save us from the abuses of Daniel Ortega.”Nicaragua has spent the past two decades trying to heal from the civil war that tore the country apart and left 35,000 people dead. Mr. Ortega, elected in 2006 with a former contra as his running mate, has distributed roofing materials, pensions and property titles to families of contras who turned in weapons as part of a 1987 peace accord.While a reprise of the contra war is unlikely, Mr. Ortega’s re-election push is reopening old wounds and, critics contend, sending Nicaraguan democracy into a tailspin. Some opponents vow to boycott next year’s vote unless Mr. Ortega allows for an overhaul of the electoral council that oversaw a 2008 mayoral election in which fraud allegations set off weeks of violence.The political tension deepened when Mr. Ortega hinted that he would run for president again, despite a constitutional ban against consecutive terms or holding office more than twice.“The right to re-election should be for all,” he told supporters last year on the 30th anniversary of the Sandinista revolution. “And the people should decide whom to award and whom to punish.”Lacking the votes in Congress to amend the Constitution, Mr. Ortega turned to the Supreme Court. Six judges from the governing Sandinista party ruled that the constitutional ban did not apply to Mr. Ortega, but the ruling immediately caused an uproar because it was made when no opposition judges were present.Opponents in Congress dug in, refusing to vote on replacements for important posts, including Supreme Court judges and electoral magistrates. Mr. Ortega parried, issuing a decree in January that extended the officials’ terms.Two Sandinista Supreme Court judges put the decree to the test in April, refusing to hand in their gavels and leading a boisterous group of Sandinista supporters into the court. In a forceful takeover, the shouting crowd scared off opposition judges, who have since boycotted sessions.Mr. Ortega then had the Constitution reprinted in September to include an old — and, some argue, expired — clause that sanctioned the extensions. Sandinista judges have also replaced the Supreme Court president with one of their own, rounding out Mr. Ortega’s control of the court.Mr. Ortega frequently says there is a plot to overthrow him, especially since his ally, President Manuel Zelaya of Honduras, was ousted last year in a coup. Mr. Ortega said that by allowing a post-coup government in Honduras, the United States has encouraged plotters against leftist Latin American governments, including Mr. Garmendia, whom he called a “delinquent in the mountains.”“There isn’t the least possibility of a coup because of the nature of our armed forces,” Mr. Ortega said in a recent address, flanked by leaders of the military and the police. “The army and police were born with the revolution and formed by it.”Meanwhile, opposition candidates are competing to show that the United States is supporting them, despite Washington’s reluctance to engage in politics in the country that produced the Iran-contra affair. The American ambassador here, Robert J. Callahan, has cut back on public critiques of the political situation after Ortega supporters chased him from a university fair last year by hurling fireworks and attacked the embassy with rocks.Nonetheless, a spokesman for Arnoldo Alemán, a former president whose 20-year sentence on corruption charges was overturned last year, recently claimed that the United States was backing his new bid for office, while Mr. Gadea said an invitation to a recent dinner with embassy officials was an American stamp of approval on his campaign.“The U.S. supports my candidacy,” Mr. Gadea said in a recent interview at the home of an embassy official. “My discourse is in line with liberal thought and moral values that form the concept of American politics.”Ambassador Callahan said the United States had not taken sides in the election. He announced Friday that Nicaragua was again eligible for an American aid program canceled in 2008 on electoral concerns.The two candidates could keep the opposition divided. Though he and Mr. Alemán happen to be in-laws, Mr. Gadea broke from Mr. Alemán’s Liberal Constitutionalist Party to distance himself from Mr. Alemán, who was ranked among the world’s most corrupt leaders in 2004 by Transparency International.Mr. Ortega, who was president in the 1980s but lost an election in 1990 as Soviet support waned, has received at least $1.4 billion from Mr. Chávez in oil, aid and investment to fuel his fight against poverty and illiteracy, figures from the central bank show.The money has expanded Mr. Ortega’s political base and given him more of a stake in the economy through a network of companies that blur the lines between his Sandinista party, the state and the private sector, said Francisco Lainez, who founded Nicaragua’s central bank.“The people felt a great change with Daniel’s presidency,” said a senior Sandinista official, Nelson Artola. “We’re looking after that change, protecting it.”Mr. Artola’s work as director of the government’s reconciliation plan and poverty relief fund has helped appease former contras. He also leads the Sandinistas’ carrot-and-stick approach to building political support for Mr. Ortega’s re-election, distributing Venezuelan aid and government funds to mayors who publicly back Mr. Ortega. Less compliant mayors have been ousted, with the police dragging one from his office in June after an eight-day standoff.Mr. Gadea said he would refuse to include any Sandinistas in his government if elected. Vice President Jaime Morales Carazo said in an interview that the re-election of Mr. Ortega could lead to dictatorship or conflict, adding that he would step down if Mr. Ortega won again. Mr. Morales, a former negotiator for the contra rebels, joined Mr. Ortega’s 2006 campaign to create a reconciliation government.“All calculations pointed in his favor then,” Mr. Morales said. “Now there’s even more certainty Ortega will win.”'"
"'10-11-14,'0','Indeed, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 65, faced an immediate challenge of mending fences within the democratic opposition, which fractured over the question of participating in the election. But the election, which drew accusations of fraud from almost all opposition parties, has also opened a new area of discontent that her lawyers said she planned to exploit.The scene at the gates of her compound suggested that her popularity remained strong. When the police removed barricades from around her villa on Saturday afternoon, crowds flooded into the street.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi spoke only briefly, saying, “If we are united, we can get what we want.” The crowd then broke into the singing of the national anthem.“She is our mother, she is our mother!” a woman cried.After someone handed her a flower, the crowd pleaded, “Put it in your hair!”It was the kind of outpouring she had experienced twice before on earlier releases from house arrest, in 1995 and 2002. Both times she was detained again after testing the limits of her freedom.On Sunday, wearing a white garland, she addressed a cheering crowd of thousands of people in front of her party’s headquarters. The remarks began with a call for freedom of speech, which she said was the “basis of democratic freedom,” according to news services.A government broadcast Saturday said Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi had been freed without conditions. There appeared to be no other government statement on Saturday regarding her release.But one of her lawyers, U Kyi Win, said that even if no formal conditions were placed on her freedom, her movements could still be restricted, as they had been at times after her previous releases.Her most recent detention began in 2003 after she had drawn increasingly large and enthusiastic crowds as she toured the country. A band of organized thugs attacked her convoy in what some people believe was an assassination attempt, and she was sent first to prison and then back to house arrest.The immediate response from Western capitals to her release was one of celebration. Her freedom has been their first demand in calling for political freedoms and respect for human rights in the nation also known as Burma.“She is a hero of mine,” said, “and a source of inspiration for all who work to advance basic human rights in Burma and around the world.”But Western leaders also made it clear that they would continue to assess the actions of the ruling generals before they considered moderating a policy of isolation and economic sanctions against them.Saying was paying close attention, President said in a statement. “Any obstacle to her freedom of movement or expression would constitute a new and unacceptable denial of her rights.”And the secretary general, , said he expected “no further restrictions will be placed on her” and he urged the junta “to build on today’s action by releasing all remaining political prisoners.”The daughter of the nation’s founding hero, U Aung San, who was assassinated when she was 2 years old, she has embraced her fate of isolation and self-sacrifice. When her British husband, Michael Aris, was dying of in 1999, she refused to leave to visit him for fear that she would not be allowed to return to her country.As Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi resumes her struggle for democratic freedoms, several analysts said, she will be re-entering a battleground more complicated and difficult than the one she had faced in the past.“It’s certainly not going to be easy for her,” said Thant Myint-U, a historian and former United Nations official who has written widely on the country. “This is a very, very different political landscape than when she was released the last time. The country is facing a whole slew of new challenges and opportunities.”Her party, the National League for Democracy, won the previous election, in 1990, but the generals annulled the result and clung to power. The victory gave Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi the standing to speak as the nation’s disenfranchised leader. But that result has now been superseded by the new election, which the main military-backed party won overwhelmingly.The National League declined to take part in the election, calling it unfair and undemocratic, and was required to formally disband. But Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was assailed for that decision by party members who saw the vote, however flawed, as an opening.A faction of those critics broke away, creating a new party and a challenge to her leadership. National League leaders said the party would remain the platform for her activities, but it is no longer the only center for opposition or independent action.Though the newly elected Parliament is seen mainly as a mechanism for the military to try to legitimize its control — in what more than one analyst characterized as a charade, several generals resigned from the military so they could take the top jobs in the new civilian government — it nevertheless changes the political dynamic with new structures and new personalities.There will be new opposition parties, however small and weak; new political officeholders, however limited their scope for independent action; and the first generation of military leaders who have not been schooled at all in the West and who perceive the as their biggest strategic threat.A new world of charity and aid groups has also emerged during the past seven years of her house arrest, leading to a more diffuse public arena.“In many ways Myanmar is not the isolated, closed-off country that it was 10 or 20 years ago,” Mr. Thant Myint-U said. “It’s a very complex place. I think we could say for sure that this year, these couple of years, are without a doubt the country’s most important watershed in a generation.”Billions of dollars in have been pouring in from and other Asian nations, and although the people of Myanmar still struggle in abject poverty, the ruling class is better off than ever and the junta more self-confident.Given these complexities, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi’s new freedom may be a burden as much as it is a liberation.“She’ll be facing a mountain of expectation and challenges,” said Aung Zaw, editor of The Irrawaddy, a -based exile magazine.“She is just a private citizen, but a lot of people still believe that she is the leader of the democratic movement, not just a leader of the N.L.D.,” he said. “People want her to expand her leadership.”Those expectations were on display in the crowd outside her house on Saturday.“I’m happier than if I won the lottery,” one older woman exulted. “But this is just the beginning, not the end. The political prisoners are still in jail. Everyone needs to be released!”'"

"'10-11-14,'0','The bridegroom’s stepmother is a family and professional mediator, also in Granville, and his stepfather retired as the chairman of the California subsidiary of Fiduciary Trust International, an investment management company.As Ms. Ziff and Mr. Griffin tell it, a pair of designer gloves served as the talisman that drew them into each other’s orbits.Ms. Ziff recalled having spotted the gloves at a December 2007 charity sale at the designer Cynthia Rowley’s store. After telling Ms. Rowley how much she loved the gloves, Ms. Ziff recalled how the designer told her that a male friend had recently bought the same pair.“I want to date the guy who would buy those gloves for a girl,” Ms. Ziff said she exclaimed.At that, Ms. Rowley began telling her about the man who had purchased the gloves, Ms. Ziff remembered, and how he was no longer dating anyone. Ms. Rowley even showed her a photo of Mr. Griffin.Ms. Ziff said she was then told to expect an e-mail from Mr. Griffin the next day, and sure enough it arrived, setting in motion a flurry of other e-mails that culminated in a coffee-shop date in New York.Before their coffee got cold, Ms. Ziff and Mr. Griffin had dismissed the possibility of romance.“I liked her a lot, she was smart and pretty, there was a lot to like, but somehow, there was no chemistry,” Mr. Griffin said.Instead, over the next nine months a platonic friendship developed that included writing projects that they did together, spending weekends in Montauk, N.Y., and training for the New York City Marathon.“It was unlike other relationships I’d had,” Ms. Ziff recalled. “Instead of the initial excitement waning over time, every day just kept getting more beautiful.”About six months into their friendship, when Ms. Ziff was becoming increasingly frustrated that they had not become more than friends, she went out for a bike ride on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. While riding south, she suddenly spotted Mr. Griffin biking north. As they passed each other, she slowed down to call out his name, and taking her eyes off the road a bit, she promptly plowed her bike into two or three other riders in front of her.Mr. Griffin heard the crash and turned to see Ms. Ziff and her bike lying on the ground. She quickly got to her feet to assure him that she was all right.“I leapt up pretending to be unharmed, trying to play it cool, while in fact being mortified beyond belief,” she said.She took the subway home, where a message was waiting for her. It was from Mr. Griffin, who was inquiring about her physical condition.“I remember thinking he sounded genuinely concerned,” Ms. Ziff said. “I also remember thinking that this was a moment when my pride had been seriously wounded but that I trusted him enough not to run from the embarrassment.”She called him back immediately, her knee still bleeding, and made a joke about how the crash had felt like a scene out of a Ben Stiller movie.“We laughed about it, and I knew that there was something about this person that was different from other men I had known,” Ms. Ziff said.And on a July 2008 night in Montauk, their intense friendship finally turned to romance.“I often wonder what my life would be if I hadn’t fallen instantly in love with those gloves,” Ms. Ziff said.

"'10-11-14,'0','Citing “changes for the positive,” Mr. Griffin said, “My work is education, which is informing and hoping to make a place better. That can be in any community, but in this community I feel like I’m part of that.”When they move into their $160,000 two-bedroom, the Griffins will be able to look out from their terrace and from the plant-covered roof to see some of the changes that have Mr. Griffin feeling so optimistic.Because his 3-year-old daughter is something of a swing fanatic, the Fox Playground across the street, which reopened last month after a $2.5 million renovation, is a welcome improvement on what Mr. Griffin called the “ugly feel” created by the men who drink in another nearby park. And Barretto Point Park, opened in 2006 on the heavily industrial shoreline of Hunts Point, typifies the improved waterfront access that the community has pushed for.Such rejuvenation was all but unimaginable in the 1970s, when the area was beset by arson and abandonment and nearly 60,000 residents, roughly two-thirds of the population, either fled or were forced out.By 1981, Longwood had an almost post-apocalyptic character, according to Marin, the chairman of Bronx Community Board 2, which covers Hunts Point and Longwood. That year, he recalled, when a young woman asked him to pick her up at her home on Kelly Street, she cautioned that “when you get off the train you have to walk in the middle of the street; there are no lights, no sidewalks, the buildings are abandoned, and someone might drag you into a building and do something to you.” Sure enough, Longwood Avenue was pitch-black; Mr. Marin found the area so frightening and chaotic that he turned tail and left.He returned in 1992 to buy a multifamily town house in the Longwood Historic District, and in the ensuing years witnessed a slow-motion renaissance.Debris-littered lots on Longwood’s western edge had already been redeveloped with two-family homes, and by 1994 blighted stretches of Longwood Avenue were handsomely filled in with rows of government-subsidized two-story red-brick dwellings. Crowned with green dentil cornices, today they still look as impregnable as the no-nonsense home built by the third little pig.Reconstruction has accelerated in the last decade, as the city has sought to restore population by shifting its emphasis from promoting ownership of small houses to subsidizing income-restricted rental apartment buildings. Under its housing plan, 26 new buildings have been financed in the area since 2003.Although developers say that tight has put the brakes on additional co-op construction, and although prostitution is a problem in Hunts Point, the area has nonetheless stabilized.“This is a growing, vibrant community that is rebuilding itself,” Mr. Marin said. “Yeah, we’re Fort Apache, but Fort Apache is no longer a war zone. It’s a neighborhood where people are proud to live.”Hunts Point and Longwood are joined by a community board but separated by the thundering equator of the Bruckner Expressway. Although not firmly delineated and at times a subject of disagreement, the overall boundaries of the roughly two-square-mile area are: Avenue on the north; the Bronx River on the east; the East River on the south; and East 149th Street and Prospect Avenue on the west.The Longwood Historic District, southwest of Longwood Avenue, has a cohesive collection of high-stooped, semidetached two- and three-family neo-Renaissance town houses. Villa Maria, on Longwood’s western fringe, is a pleasant development of two-family homes built around 1990. Elsewhere, rows of tired-looking prewar apartment buildings are interspersed with shinier, government-subsidized rental buildings and row houses. A crowded shopping corridor runs along Southern Boulevard.The residential district of the Hunts Point peninsula is concentrated to the north. Along the Bronx and East Rivers, the peninsula is dense with commercial and industrial facilities including a 329-acre wholesale food distribution center, a vast wastewater treatment plant, a freight-rail terminal, a gas pipeline and about 18 waste-processing sites. More than 10,000 trucks a day visit the peninsula; the childhood rate has been found to be many times the national average.The extraordinary environmental challenges heaped on Hunts Point have helped galvanize local groups.“I do think this is a fiery community with a lot of resilience,” said Kellie Terry-Sepulveda, the executive director of the Point Community Development Corporation. Along with Sustainable South Bronx, the Point has worked with the city’s Economic Development Corporation to plan the South Bronx Greenway, intended to link new and older parks through a “green necklace” of waterfront and street routes. Work has already begun on some proposed improvements, including a landscaped median on Hunts Point Avenue.Allison Jaffe, the broker-owner of Key Real Estate Services, said that two town houses in the Longwood Historic District had sold this year for around $475,000 each. Over all, the median sale price of two-family homes in the past year was $335,000 in Longwood and $320,000 in Hunts Point. There are 14 homes on the market. Applications are being accepted for income-restricted units in the Prospect Macy Cooperative Apartments, a government-subsidized co-op under construction on Macy Place. The e-mail contact for the Blue Sea Development Company is .Area schools include the Vida Bogart School for All Children on Bryant Avenue, which serves kindergarten through eighth grade, and Public School 62 on Fox Street. Each received a B on its most recent city progress report. Among nearby middle schools are the School of Performing Arts on Fox Street, which received an A on its progress report, and the Hunts Point School, which earned a B.Banana Kelly High School and the Holcombe L. Rucker School of Community Research, also a high school, share a building on Longwood Avenue. SAT averages at Banana Kelly in 2010 were 377 in reading, 382 in math, and 368 in writing. Rucker’s were 374, 362 and 366. Citywide the averages were 439, 462 and 434.WHAT TO DOThe social outreach program of conducts circus workshops for children at the Point.

"'10-11-14,'0','New York City was home to nearly 1.28 million people in their 20s last year, up from 1.21 million in 1980. In many respects, Mr. Cavin Quezada’s situation mirrors the way large numbers in that age group are living, three years after the Great Recession began.To be sure, earlier generations had their share of hard-luck housing stories. But statistical evidence suggests that today’s new arrivals have a tougher struggle to live well, or even adequately, compared with their counterparts of just a decade ago. Battered by the one-two punch of persistent unemployment and the city’s high housing costs, they are squeezing into ever smaller spaces and living in neighborhoods once considered dicey and remote.They are doubling, tripling, quadrupling and even quintupling up. According to the New York City Planning Department, 46 percent of New Yorkers in their 20s who moved to the city from out of state between 2006 and 2008 lived with people to whom they were not related, up from 36 percent in 2000.Moving back in with parents is fast becoming the new normal. Those who do fly the family nest are paying an ever larger percentage of their often meager income for rent. Between 2006 and 2008, according to the Planning Department, the portion of New Yorkers in their 20s who moved to the city from other states and who paid at least 35 percent of their income for rent was 42 percent, up from 39 percent in 2000.Even young people in high-paying fields like finance have to make sacrifices. There’s the investment banker who can afford only a 450-square-foot studio, and the financial analyst who lives in a third-floor walk-up studio illegally divided into two rooms.In the words of Allison Gumbel, a 28-year-old photographer who lives in a third-floor walk-up in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn: “There’s always a compromise. And when I say compromise, I don’t just mean that you don’t have nice floors or good light.”Still young adults swarm to the city, especially those eager to pursue careers in finance, the arts, media and other fields for which New York has long served as the nation’s heart. They come to find work, to find one another and to hang out in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and the Lower East Side that have become almost geographic extensions of college dorm life. Here are some tales from the front lines.Stefan Rurak, 26, a furniture maker, has lived for two years in a former furniture store in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. His roommate has the front room; Mr. Rurak has the 9-by-12-foot windowless space in the rear, for which he pays $325 a month. The arrangement isn’t legal, but it allows Mr. Rurak, an Oberlin graduate who moved to New York five years ago, to pursue work he loves.“I really lucked out,” he said. “Without a doubt, I couldn’t be doing what I’m doing now without this space.”“Like every artist,” he added, “I came to New York after college. I never planned on staying this long, but I did various things. I worked in construction, I worked as an art handler. Opportunities came up.“It’s not that I like New York so much. But things happen here that wouldn’t happen in other places.”And he has only good things to say about his neighborhood. “It’s not like Williamsburg, at least not yet,” he said. “You don’t see all those college kids in tight pants. It’s not quote unquote hot.”Sam Tolman, a 21-year-old with a passion for cinema, lives with his brother, Henry, 23, in a two-story house on 246th Street in Riverdale, in the far northwestern Bronx. The house is owned by the grandmother of a family friend, who still lives there, and the brothers split the $500 rent for their first-floor space.“We’re very lucky,” said Sam Tolman, who earned enough working as a waiter last summer to cover three months of his share of the rent. “We have a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom.” Each brother has his own bedroom. Visiting friends from Providence, R.I., where the Tolmans grew up, marvel at how much space they have.Sam Tolman has two internships. He edits video for the Web site of the magazine published by Frank151, and he is part of the video team of BreakThru Radio, an Internet radio station. The first job is unpaid; the second provides a weekly stipend of $50.But the commute is punishing. To get to his Frank151 job, which starts at 11 a.m., Mr. Tolman leaves the house at 9:30 and walks 15 minutes to catch the No. 7 bus. That takes him to the No. 1 train, from which he switches to the 2, the L and the R before arriving at his office.The commute also crimps his social life.“I’m really grateful to have a nice place for such a low cost,” Mr. Tolman said. “But I don’t feel as if I’m part of the city. Most of my friends are in Manhattan, and going out is a pain.”Still, he added cheerfully, the arrangement suits him for now. “I love my jobs,” he said. “This is the price you pay to live in New York. To have what I want, you have to suffer a bit.”Sarah Walsh, a 24-year-old from Rye, N.Y., lives in what she describes as a “crummy little apartment,” a third-floor walk-up on Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side. She has two roommates, and her share of the rent is $800.“I was extraordinarily lucky to find it,” said Ms. Walsh, who earns about $40,000 a year as a fund-raiser for Birthright Israel Foundation, a nonprofit organization. “I felt like I looked at a thousand apartments.”The downside is that her room is just 6 1/2 by 8 1/2 feet. Because there’s no closet, she keeps her clothes in an armoire in the living room.“I could have lived at home, in a giant room with a closet,” Ms. Walsh said. “But it’s so much fun to live in the city, to buy your own groceries. You make sacrifices to live here. If you want to be in Manhattan, it means a smaller apartment.”For Andrea Fisher, who is one of Ms. Walsh’s roommates and also grew up in Rye, it means an even tinier room, one with space for no more than a twin bed, a foot-square night table, a bookshelf and a laundry hamper. She has a small closet, but puts most of her clothes in the drawers under the bed, which she calls “a lifesaver.” Her rent, because she has the smallest bedroom, is $700 a month.“It is small,” admitted Ms. Fisher, who is 24 and works for the Artists Rights Society, a group that represents artists dealing with copyright issues. But the appeal of the neighborhood compensates for the tight quarters.“Besides,” she said, “you’re not looking to just hang out in your room.”Ms. Fisher, who has outfitted her space with posters from art fairs and a rug she made when she worked for a textile designer, is completing work for a graduate degree at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Writing a thesis in a cubbyhole, she has discovered, can be a challenge.“If you don’t have a desk,” she said, “it’s not as conducive to working. There’s no room to work in the living room, so I work and eat at the kitchen table.“But I’m so proud I can support myself, and have an apartment on the Lower East Side that I can afford,” she said. Again and again she returned to the appeal of living in this part of the city.“The neighborhood is definitely the best part,” she said. “There are tons of bars and restaurants, and the F train is right there, so it’s easy to get anywhere. Plus, as a girl, you never feel like you’re not safe. You can come home at 4 in the morning and the streets are filled with people.“We had a mouse,” she acknowledged. “But if you live on the Lower East Side, you’ll always have a mouse.”Ms. Gumbel, the 28-year-old photographer, pays $1,200 a month for her one-bedroom apartment in a renovated brownstone in Clinton Hill.“It’s a nice apartment,” said Ms. Gumbel, who works as an office manager at Meyer Davis Studio, an interior design firm. But her subway trains, the G and the C, are routinely rated as among the city’s worst, and her commute to her office in SoHo, “which should be easy,” she said, takes 45 minutes. Still, she has no desire to leave New York.“I studied fine arts,” said Ms. Gumbel, who graduated from Pratt Institute and has held many photo-related jobs. “I’m here for the art scene.”Ben Craw, a friend of Ms. Gumbel’s, lives with two friends in a four-story walk-up on Lorimer Street in Williamsburg. Mr. Craw, who is also 28, earns about $40,000 a year as a video editor for The Huffington Post. He chose the smallest of the three bedrooms, just 6 by 8 feet, because at just $534 a month it was the cheapest.“I have a bed, a desk wedged between the bed and the wall, a folding chair, a window with a great view of the skyline,” he said. “That’s really all I need. I don’t have a lot of worldly possessions.”For three young men with strong legs and simple needs, the apartment suffices. Mr. Craw uses his quarters mostly for sleeping and working on his laptop. And he can’t imagine being anyplace but the city.“Ever since I was a little kid,” said Mr. Craw, who grew up in Fairfield County in Connecticut, “I always loved New York. I couldn’t wait to get out of my house. In terms of the jobs I wanted, the social life I wanted, I didn’t care where I lived as long as it was in the city. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do, but I knew that whatever it was, it would be most possible here.”'"
"'10-11-14,'0','One of the most refreshing scenes in the movie “The Kids Are All Right” comes when 15-year-old Laser has it out with his jerky pal, Clay. They trade a barbed sentence or two, shove each other, and then bam! With a punch to the face, the friendship is over.Had the pair been girls, this exchange would have involved at least six other participants and weeks of anguished e-mails, phone calls and tête-à-têtes. Such are the convoluted trials Kelly Valen examines in “The Twisted Sisterhood,” the follow-up to her 2007 lamentation, in a contribution to the Modern Love column in this newspaper, over an unhappy sorority past. Like many who bare their souls publicly in personal essays, Valen subsequently fell victim to the blogosphere pile-on; the Tri Delts and Pi Phis of the world did not take well to her airing of the dirty sisterly laundry.So Valen wondered: “Hadn’t the very concept of sisterhood become downright twisted?” Why was her story of female viciousness taboo? “Any suggestion that women are co-architects of their unhappiness or failure to prosper,” she writes, “shall be deemed tantamount to misogyny, horizontal hostility and internal sexism.”Keen to avoid another round of “cyber-beatings,” Valen maintains a tone of measured affability throughout her book. She is careful not to call herself a feminist, careful to credit feminists, careful not to bash anti-feminists. Although she protests the cruelty of women, she is optimistic about our capacity for change.And oh my, things need changing — at least according to Valen’s research, which, in the Gladwellian tradition of pop social science, dips into recent neuroscience as well as studies on social anxiety and loneliness. But most of her argument rests on a survey she circulated among a random sampling of womankind: 3,020 women, ages 15 to 86, “from rural towns in Washington and New Mexico, to Florida leisure communities, to Manhattan’s Upper West Side.” The results yield some startling statistics. Eighty-four percent of respondents said they had “suffered terribly” at the hands of other women; 88 percent had felt “currents of meanness and negativity emanating from other females.” Nearly 1,000 women said they had struggled with depression or sought counseling as a result of “intrafemale trouble.”Yet, Valen writes, 96 percent of those surveyed said they want “something better for girls and women.” Who wouldn’t?Not to stomp on the sisterhood (or deny its aptitude for malice), but these numbers aren’t all that meaningful. First, what woman toils over a 50-question survey unless she has a beef with the sisters to begin with? It’s impossible to say for sure, but a selectivity bias may be at work. And there are other structural problems. Rather than setting a time frame, Valen asks if women have ever suffered because of jealousy, manipulation or ridicule. A more useful measure would have been to ask who had suffered in the previous three to six months. Mean-girl behavior exists, but it has its seasons, from “girly girl” squabbles to junior high “slut lists” to mommy wars on the adult playground (and Valen has an incisive chapter on the maternal role in schoolyard meanness). But most of us took our abuse as fifth graders or sophomores, followed by a 20­-something fallout or two. At some point, people largely grow out of it. And do women differ so much from men in their inability to get along? Men unleash their fury, too, if not in such byzantine fashion.Even some of Valen’s respondents took issue with the survey’s structure. Several, she notes, had trouble with its wording: “pain, distress, trauma, scars” seemed “too strong, dramatic, intimidating or clinical” for them to adopt. She mentions that more than 100 respondents said they were “highly discerning about who they’ll pass time with, reveal limited personal information, don protective layers of cynicism and sarcasm, and project bravada, defensiveness or aloofness,” all as ways to keep other women at a distance. Color me cold­hearted, but this sounds fairly normal.Many of Valen’s points are valid, but she seems caught between the polar positions of “It’s a trend!” and “Nothing new here.” This leads to caveat-laden passages like the following: “Does every woman feel this way about the world of women’s relationships? Of course not. But the frequency with which these stories and sentiments have rolled in troubles me and implicates us all.” Well, certainly it implicates schoolyard bullies, online trolls and office meanies. But casting blame gender-wide is a stretch.'"
"'10-11-14,'0','THE Shah of Iran, who ruled from 1941 until he was overthrown in a 1979 revolution, was an auto aficionado with a taste for European classics and exotics. During his authoritarian reign, he assembled a large collection — how large is anybody’s guess — that included vehicles specially built for him.“Unfortunately, we have not been able to gain access to records that can verify the actual number there were in the collection at any one time,” Ramin Salehkhou, president of the Classic Car Committee of the Motorcycle and Automobile Federation of Iran, said in an e-mail.“After the country’s 1979 revolution, the government expropriated the cars of the shah and his associates,” Mr. Salehkhou wrote. “Over the years, many of the cars were sold off in auctions and taken out of Iran.”Some 100 cars that belonged to the shah are now in the National Auto Museum, which occupies a warehouse on the outskirts of Tehran. Mr. Salehkhou and a group of volunteers maintain the cars and are restoring them at their own expense. The group has completed work on a 1965 Bizzarrini 5300 GT Strada, a Corvette-powered Italian sports car. Winston Goodfellow, an American author and photographer who is also a Bizzarrini expert, helped to authenticate the car.The gem of the museum collection is a 1934 Mercedes-Benz 540K Autobahn-Kurier, one of two in the world, Mr. Salehkhou said. Other notable cars include a 1958 Chrysler Ghia show car and a one-off Pierce-Arrow with gold-plated trim used by the shah’s father, Reza Shah Pahlavi, for state occasions.The collection also includes a 1965 Ferrari 500 Superfast (one of 36 built), a bevy of Rolls-Royces from the 1920s to the 1970s — and, according to Mr. Salehkhou, one of the largest collections of Mercedes 600 models in the world, including an ultrarare Landaulet model.He described a single-seat car built jointly by Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen and styled like the Mercedes-Benz C111 prototype. “This car was presented by the German government to the crown prince on his 12th birthday,” Mr. Salehkhou said, referring to a son of the shah.'"
"'10-11-14,'0','Re “A Climate of Unease for Artists in Syria” by Michael Kimmelman [Nov. 7]:I was disturbed and surprised to read Mr. Kimmelman’s article. It is laden with contradictions and biases, and he was clearly not interested in the reality of Syrian art. Rather, he wanted to portray a conspicuous political message. He ignores the vibrant and serious artistic movement in Syria that has captured the imagination of all Syrians, and indeed that of the entire region.Instead, he focuses on “commercial art,” neglecting paintings and sculpture selling at the most sophisticated galleries around the region and the world. Syria has two philharmonic orchestras, more than most countries in the region, an annual jazz festival, a Music in the Street festival that spans the country, and several art shows held daily in all major cities. Even the soap operas the author mocks have been the Arab street’s favorites year in, year out. Imad MoustaphaThe writer is the Syrian ambassador to the United States.'"
"'10-11-14,'0','TOURISM officials in Turkey like to make the claim that winemaking was invented in their country, some thousands of years ago. Yet Turkish wine lovers, long resigned to buying locally made wine that ranged from uninspired to undrinkable, could not be faulted for thinking that the quality of their country’s wine hadn’t improved much in the ensuing millenniums.In recent years, though, Turkish winemaking has started to take off, with new boutique wineries and established winemakers producing top-quality wines, often using native grape varieties that are being lovingly revived. And fortunately for oenophiles, a handful of wine bars and shops have recently opened in Istanbul, offering a chance to sample a wide range of these new blends.On a pedestrianized street just off bustling Taksim Square, Rouge (11/2 Lamartin Caddesi; 90-212-237-0190) offers a slick bistro upstairs and a cozy shop in the cellar that sells both Turkish and imported wines. The restaurant has an extensive wine list that includes several up-and-coming Turkish wines by the glass.“People were always saying to me, ‘Where are the good wine shops, the good wine bars?’ ” said Mehmet Yalcin, a co-owner. “Wine production was rising, but there was no place to try it, no serious wine bars.”He should know: Before opening Rouge this past April, Mr. Yalcin was best known as the founder and editor of Gusta, a magazine devoted to wine and food. “Turkey’s modern wine story is only about 80 years old,” he continued. “But I am very optimistic about the future of wine here.”'"

Gruber, the paper’s senior author and director of the cognitive and clinical neuroimaging section of the neuroimaging center at McLean, a Harvard-affiliated hospital in Belmont, Mass.The study, done in conjunction with brain scans, was small, consisting of 35 chronic marijuana smokers who were 22 years old on average. Twenty had started smoking marijuana regularly before age 16, while 15 started smoking regularly at age 16 or later. All had similar levels of education and income.The subjects were asked to complete an assessment of executive function — the brain processes responsible for planning and abstract thinking, as well as understanding rules and inhibiting inappropriate actions. The test — in which participants were asked to sort cards with different shapes, numbers and colors — is a measure of cognitive flexibility, the ability to stay focused, stick to rules and control impulsive responses. The participants who started smoking marijuana at younger ages scored significantly lower on the test than those who started smoking later in their teen years, Dr. Gruber said. They got fewer of the card-sorting categories correct and made more mistakes. They were also much more likely to repeat their mistakes, continuing to give incorrect answers even after being told that they were wrong.'"

"'10-11-15,'1','Two of the questions posed by Susan Dominus at the end of her article about the suicide of Joseph Jefferson — “Why, exactly, did Mr. Jefferson decide to end his life? What was at the bottom of his sense of despair?” — have the same likely answer: His depression bullied him into killing himself. Depression has an extraordinary ability to warp its sufferers’ perception of reality.When I am free of depression’s embrace, I recognize my worth and my accomplishments. When it is in the ascendant, I am pathetically lacking and without friends because I am unlikable, unlovable and lacking in merit. Both views are equally convincing.What protects me from suicide when I am down is my understanding of depression’s tactics and the ability to defeat its arguments.Why didn’t Joseph Jefferson seek help for his depression? Despite a decade of “anti-stigma” efforts, depression remains stigmatized as a sign of weakness rather a no-fault medical illness with solutions.The writer is the author of three books about depression.'"
"'10-11-15,'1','Four Loko, which has an alcohol content of 12 percent and as much caffeine as a cup of coffee, came under scrutiny this fall after students who drank it at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Wash., and Ramapo College in New Jersey ended up in emergency rooms, some with high levels of alcohol poisoning.Earlier this month, both Washington State and Michigan banned the sale of energy drinks that contain alcohol and caffeine.Jaisen Freeman, a founder and the managing partner of Phusion Projects, said in a statement that the company was the first to voluntarily halt shipments.“And we think it shows that we are not turning a deaf ear to what’s going on,” he said, “that a select few have chosen to abuse our products, drink them while under age or break the law and sell them to minors.”Kirk Leslie, 28, a Harlem resident who happened to be passing the news conference where there was a display of Four Loko and other beverages, said that the alcoholic energy drink “tasted nice” and that “they got worse stuff out there.”In some uptown bodegas, where Four Loko is often found between the beer and the juices, owners and clerks did not seem particularly concerned.“It’s not that popular,” said Ali Basem, a 22-year-old clerk at a store on West 135th Street.Mr. Basem added that that he had sold only about 100 cans in two months. He reinforced Senator Klein’s concerns when he said that he had a pretty good idea of who was attracted to the drink.“The kids get wild when they ask for it,” he said. “When they drink too much of it, they start acting crazy.” Mr. Basem said many customers turned to Four Loko after liquor stores close.“So they come here, and they get it because it gets them twisted,” he said.At the Lenox U.S. Deli, on Malcolm X Boulevard, Nabil Nasher, who said he was the store’s president, sounded equally unperturbed, if not pleased, by the coming disappearance of Four Loko.“If something’s wrong, you have to stop it,” said Mr. Nasher, 49. “We can sell something else.”One of his customers, Kena Marcell, a 32-year-old party promoter, said everyone she knew who had drank Four Loko had “not had a very good experience with it.”“Nobody needs that much caffeine in one drink,” she said, “and making it pretty with different colorful cans is just not necessary.”In his statement, Mr. Freeman said his company still believed “that combining caffeine and alcohol is safe — if that weren’t the case, Irish coffees and rum and colas would be under scrutiny as well.”'"
"'10-11-15,'1','G.M. has set aside 5 percent of the 365 million shares in the offering, which is expected as early as Wednesday, for current and former personnel. An average investor would not be able to buy in at the stock offering price.Even if some retirees balk at buying shares, overall demand for the offering is expected to be strong among big institutional investors in the United States and overseas. G.M. has been courting sovereign wealth funds, or state-owned investment funds, from Asia and the Middle East to invest in the stock, and is negotiating to sell a 1 percent stake in the company to its Chinese partner, the SAIC Motor Corporation. The Treasury Department has said it is not opposed to the stock’s being sold internationally, but it wants it to be sold “with a focus on North American investors.”It is hardly an easy call for many retirees who had banked on the benefits they earned while working at a company once called “Generous Motors,” only to see their medical plans, life insurance and retirement contributions slashed in recent years.Then, when the government forced G.M. into bankruptcy in exchange for federal aid, many retirees saw the value of their stock basically evaporate. “I have a lot of friends that were planning to live on G.M. dividends,” said Neil Millar, who retired in 1998 as a salaried employee at the company’s assembly plant in Wilmington, Del., which has been closed. “They’re very disappointed.”At a meeting of about 500 retired assembly plant workers last month in Lordstown, Ohio, the crowd was divided and very vocal about it, said Bill Bowers, head of the retiree group at United Auto Workers Local 1112.“There were a lot of sour notes in the audience,” Mr. Bowers said. “A lot of them had put a lot of money into the old stock and ended up with nothing.”Those who want to participate in the stock offering had to formally express interest last month, but will not really have to decide until G.M. executives conclude their roadshow to institutional investors and set a final price for the offering. The preliminary range is $26 to $29 a share, but that could change depending on the broader interest in the stock.A G.M. spokesman, Peter Ternes, declined to comment on how many retirees and workers had shown interest, or how many shares each of them could be eligible to buy. The initial paperwork indicated the minimum investment would be $1,000.Many of the retirees interviewed fell into two camps: those who see the stock as a chance to make up for losses in benefits, and those who want no part of the stock in a company that failed to deliver on its promises in the past.“I can’t thank G.M. enough for the wages they provided me and my family,” said Jim Kane, a retiree who was a labor relations representative at the Wilmington plant before retiring in 2005. “But the way they dumped on us with the health care didn’t sit well with a lot of people.”Another Wilmington retiree, Palmie Maccari, said that the company was in much better shape than before and that he hoped to buy 300 shares. “If it’s doing well, I’ll keep it,” he said. “If it’s not, I’ll sell it.”It was the retirees association, which acts as a watchdog on G.M.’s pension investments and benefits policies, that suggested last summer to the company that it allow retirees and workers to participate in the stock sale.In a letter to Edward E. Whitacre Jr., then G.M.’s chief executive, Mr. Christie, the association president, said the gesture could help “rebuild relationships” with retirees who had lost benefits.“So many retirees have been hurt by the bankruptcy,” he said. “This was a chance for G.M. to show they weren’t totally throwing them under the bus.”Mr. Christie has cautioned fellow retirees to set aside their emotions about G.M. — pro and con — in their deliberations about investing. “There are some people who say G.M. will take care of us again,” he said. “Well, those days of G.M. are gone.”Ed Lynch, a financial adviser with the Edward Jones investment firm in the Detroit area, said his clients were understandably wary about the stock, particularly if they owned it before.“They can’t afford to be wrong twice,” he said. “They’re rooting for them, but they’re not ready to put their money there just yet.”Some retirees remain unconvinced that G.M. is a better-run company under the ownership of the federal government, which has a 61 percent stake. G.M.’s current chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, is a former partner in the Carlyle Group private equity firm who was recruited to the board by the Treasury. On Jan. 1, Mr. Akerson will take over from Mr. Whitacre as chairman of the board as well.“If it was a car guy running the business, I’d feel much better,” said Steve Quindlen, who retired in 2003 after 41 years at the Wilmington plant.G.M.’s most famous car guy in recent years, Robert A. Lutz, is one retiree who is unabashedly bullish on the stock.“I’m going to buy every share I can get my hands on,” said Mr. Lutz, who retired May 1 as G.M.’s vice chairman. “We are making more competitive products now than we ever did.”Even though the new G.M. has a better shot at success than the old one, the retirees know well that its improvements came at a cost.“I’m planning to buy some stock because the earnings are looking very good,” said David Daniels of Overland Park, Kan., who retired in 1998 after 39 years with G.M. “But I had to see an awful lot of people get put out of work to get it to this point.”'"
"'10-11-15,'1','New Yorkers almost expect unintelligible announcements in the subway, with phrases like “the next Brooklyn-bound train” sounding like “2qliun-sojn uaine.” Jay H. Walder, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the parent of New York City Transit, remembers a “Saturday Night Live” skit about garbled announcements. “In this day and age, there has to be a better way to know a train is coming than by leaning over the edge,” he said.Mrs. Hopkins works from her house, in a windowless room. A tapestry hangs like a painting over sound-absorbing foam on the wall. The microphone and recording equipment came from Innovative Electronic Designs of Louisville, Ky., which developed the system that plays her voice in the subway.What you hear, standing on the platform, is a series of short takes, each no more than a few words, strung together by the computer. “Ladies and gentlemen” — one take. “There is a Brooklyn-bound” — one take. “Local train” — one take. “Two” — one take. “Stations away” — one take. The longest take is 16 words: “Please stand away from the platform edge, especially when trains are entering and leaving the station.”You can hear her saying much the same thing in Chicago and even in Paris (where she is the voice that speaks what little English is spoken in the Métro). But subway riders are not the only passengers she talks to. She has recorded announcements for the Staten Island Ferry and most of the major airports in this country, including La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark Liberty.“Plus Incheon in Korea; Charles de Gaulle in Paris; Beirut, Lebanon; and I’m forgetting some in China,” she said. “Once we walked into the John Wayne-Orange County Airport in California. I had completely forgotten that I’d done the announcements there, and it hit me like, ‘Oh, O.K.’ I was telling myself to watch unattended bags. That’s always a good one.”On the telephone, her voice does not have quite as much oomph as it does on the subway. “My husband says he doesn’t hear the nice voice as often as he’d like,” she said.But the nice voice cannot be disobeyed. The way she tells it, before 9/11, when they lived in Louisville, he drove to the airport to pick her up. He was early. He parked right in front of the terminal. He could hear her on the public-address system, saying no one was supposed to park there.A traffic officer came along and said he had to follow the voice’s orders.Her husband said, “I don’t listen to that voice at home; I’m not going to listen to it here.”The officer looked puzzled. Mr. Hopkins explained that he was married to the voice. Then he complied, driving around until she came out of the terminal.Mrs. Hopkins grew up in Louisville and worked at a video-audio production company that was connected to Innovative Electronic Designs. “I could do the voice they wanted,” she said. “I had done commercials and things like that.” She is 62 — “I’m not a young chick anymore,” she said, “but I try to keep my voice from sounding like it’s aged.”New York City Transit plays Mrs. Hopkins dozens of times an hour, far more often than the guy on the radio who says, “You give us 22 minutes, we’ll give you the world.” Guess what? He does not live here, either.'"
"'10-11-15,'1','Snagging an added bonus from states like Louisiana and Michigan, which offer generous subsidies for local film production, the new players — who mind the old saw “cash is king” — are typically risking just a few million dollars to get a substantial ownership position in films that are cheap enough to yield a profit even in an era of diminished home-video revenues.“If you have capital, you’re positioned well,” said Brian Oliver, a producer who joined Mr. Thompson and others in starting Cross Creek. Among its first ventures, the company provided backing for “Black Swan,” which is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Natalie Portman. It will be released by Fox Searchlight Pictures on Dec. 3.Hollywood has played host to a succession of outside investors, some of whom fared better than others. Marvin Davis, the oil entrepreneur, made a tidy profit buying and then selling 20th Century Fox, while Crédit Lyonnais, the French bank, became mired in failed loans to a string of film companies. Waves of investment came from doctors and lawyers who were dabbling with film partnerships, Japanese conglomerates, the German stock market, Internet entrepreneurs and cash-laden hedge funds.Even a few years ago, the industry took a toll on investors as savvy as the garment magnate Sidney Kimmel, whose long-established film company was burned by disappointments like “Charlie Bartlett” and “Synecdoche, New York.”But only lately have falling salaries, rising subsidies and a thinning of competition turned the financial equation in favor of the investor.The current crop of equity investors includes Joe Ricketts, the Chicago Cubs co-owner whose American Film Company recently backed “The Conspirator,” directed by Robert Redford; Steven M. Rales, who is chairman of the Danaher Corporation, and whose Indian Paintbrush company was a co-financier of “The Fantastic Mr. Fox,” directed by Wes Anderson; and Sarah Siegel-Magness and Gary Magness, the Colorado investors whose Smokewood Entertainment Group backed “Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire,” which had six Oscar nominations, winning two, this year.Among those who seek to build a large-scale enterprise is Tim Headington, the oil entrepreneur based in Dallas who recently joined the producer Graham King in starting FilmDistrict, a company that plans to distribute as many as eight films a year, in an alliance with Sony Pictures Entertainment.“We’re taking advantage of the extra capacity at Sony, to bring them theatrical product,” Peter Schlessel, FilmDistrict’s chief executive, said of a situation in which Sony has the ability to put more films in theaters and into home entertainment outlets than it currently chooses to finance.More often, however, Hollywood’s newer investors resemble Michael Benaroya, a 29-year-old whose family built a real estate fortune in Seattle. “So far, we’ve been doing very well,” said Mr. Benaroya, who spoke by telephone last week from the American Film Market, where he, like many of his peers, were courting foreign buyers.Benaroya Pictures is currently offering rights to “Margin Call,” a film about 24 hours among a group of investment bank employees during the 2008 financial crisis, with performances by Kevin Spacey, Demi Moore, Stanley Tucci, Paul Bettany and Jeremy Irons, among others.The budget, said Mr. Benaroya, was less than $4 million, only about a quarter of which was paid to the cast. The film was shot in New York, where government incentives help cover the cost — so even modest sales in video, foreign or theatrical markets assure a profit.Alcon Entertainment, which has been in the business since 1997, had a major hit in “The Blind Side,” which took in about $256 million at the domestic box office and had a budget of only about $35 million. The State of Georgia covered $5.5 million of that cost, and Sandra Bullock, the film’s star, in keeping with the new economics, worked for a sharply reduced upfront salary.“It has been great,” said Andrew Kosove, who joined Broderick Johnson in starting Alcon with backing from the FedEx founder, Frederick W. Smith. “But if you had asked me that question not long ago, the response would have been more measured,” he added.A flood of new investors, cautions Mr. Kosove, might easily expand the number of films being made, once again pushing up costs and making it difficult to find distributors. For the moment, however, “it’s a great time” for those with ready capital, said Rick Schwartz, a producer who has been aligned with Alan Bernon, a Texas dairy executive and investor.Among their projects is “Machete,” an over-the-top action caper that was directed by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis, and took in about $26.6 million at the domestic box office after 20th Century Fox released it in September.Mr. Schwartz reckons that the film cost $10.5 million, after some help from a Texas subsidy program. Domestic rights went to Fox for about $9 million, and foreign rights, he said, brought nearly $12 million — so the film’s revenue to the producer and partners was roughly double its cost.And that, he said, “is a pretty good model.”'"

"'10-11-15,'1','Concerns have proliferated so much that Senator , a New York Democrat, sent a letter on Sunday to the , urging the agency to investigate the issue.Reusable bags have maintained their popularity even amid charges that they become hothouses for bacteria. The recent studies, none of which were conducted by the government, found that the lead in some bags would pose a long-term risk of seeping into groundwater after disposal; over time, however, paint from the bag could flake off and come into contact with food.Climate-change-conscious shoppers at one of ’s culinary meccas on Sunday said they were chagrined that yet another good intention had gone awry.“Bummer! We’re still not doing the right thing,” said Shelley Kempner of , who was looking over the produce at Fairway on Broadway at West 74th Street. She prefers a reusable bag, she said, because she “likes the idea of not putting more plastic into the environment.”Told of the recent lead findings, Ms. Kempner sighed — “It’s still not good enough” — and wondered if she would have to switch to something else. “Are we going to have to start using string?” she asked.“There’s always something wrong with everything,” said Barry Lebost, standing outside the Trader Joe’s on West 72nd Street with four reusable bags filled with groceries.But Mr. Lebost, an alternative energy consultant, did not appear fazed by the revelations of lead. He said his home, in Gardiner, N.Y., had been outfitted with a plant that saved the energy equivalent of 200 plastic bags a day. “It may not be a total solution, but this is a step in the right direction,” he said of the suddenly suspect bags at his feet. “The fluorescent bulbs we have now, they’re no good because they have mercury in them. You look at it as a transition.”But many shoppers said they would continue relying on the bags until more information came out. The bags are usable for years, they said, and any long-term effects of lead may be offset by the environmental benefits gained by not using regular plastic bags.“I wasn’t planning on throwing it out, so that’s a positive thing,” said Catherine Paykin, standing by the meat counter at Fairway. “As long as I use it and don’t throw it away, that will be my plan.”Mr. Schumer’s family also shops at Fairway. A spokesman for the senator said the family planned to bring the issue to the attention of the store to see if the bags there were affected.'"

"'10-11-15,'1','To do it, they will listen for the sounds of silence. Naturally, the free agents attracting early attention will have several appealing choices. The ones who struggle to get phone calls returned are ignored for a reason, but could be much better bargains.“The problem is, it requires patience, and it definitely requires luck,” said Jim Duquette, the former general manager of the Mets and the Baltimore Orioles, who now hosts a show on Sirius XM Radio. “It’s inexact, and there are a lot of different factors.”One factor can be matching a player to a ballpark that suits him. San Diego signed Jon Garland last season for one year and $5.3 million, and he revived his career at spacious Petco Park. Beltre’s power suffered in Seattle, but he signed for one year and $10 million to play at friendly Fenway Park, and seemed revitalized on the road, too. Garland and Beltre now look like prizes in free agency, not puzzles.Familiarity helps, too. Houston Astros General Manager Ed Wade knew Brett Myers from their time in Philadelphia. In 2008, Myers had been the Phillies’ Game 2 starter in the World Series, but by 2009 was an afterthought in their bullpen. Wade signed him for one year and $5.1 million, and Myers had the best year of his career.Probably the best bargain in recent years was Frank Thomas, who led Oakland to its last playoff appearance in 2006. Thomas was 37 and coming off two seasons filled with injuries.Healthy and motivated, he hit 39 home runs with 114 R.B.I. — for $500,000.Players like Thomas, coming off down years but with a long history of production, can often be the best bargains. Last winter, Texas signed Vladimir Guerrero for $6.5 million and Minnesota signed Jim Thome for $1.5 million.Both helped their teams to the playoffs, but neither was a sure thing.“You can look at Vlady, and there were probably two or three other guys in that same boat, like Jermaine Dye or Miguel Tejada,” Duquette said. “They had a track record, but they were coming off down years and big contracts. You could predict that one of them would have a bounce-back year, but you couldn’t predict all three.”Now, of course, the secret is out, and the chance of Guerrero or Thome repeating his 2010 success is lower, if only because of age. Consider what happened to Thomas after that 2006 season. The Toronto Blue Jays rewarded him with a two-year, $18 million deal, and after one strong season, they released him the next April.Who could be the Guerrero or Thome of this free-agent class — a veteran, designated-hitter type with power who may just have another big season left? Think Lance Berkman, Hideki Matsui or Manny Ramirez.What about the next Huff? In 2008, the year before his lonely free agency, Huff hit .302 with 32 home runs and 108 R.B.I. for Baltimore.His dismal follow-up in 2009, which included a trade to Detroit, made general managers forget how good he could be.At least three players in this class profile similarly to Huff: they have just had disappointing seasons that included a trade. Jorge Cantu wound up on the Rangers’ bench, Brad Hawpe was left off Tampa Bay’s postseason roster, and Derrek Lee managed only two singles in Atlanta’s division-series loss.But Cantu was highly productive for Florida in 2008 and 2009. Lee ranked fourth in the National League in on base plus slugging for the Cubs in 2009. Hawpe was an All-Star for Colorado in 2009 but carries the stigma of having played nearly half his games at Coors Field.“The question with a guy like Hawpe is, is he closer to Huff or closer to Garrett Atkins?” Duquette said, referring to the former Rockies third baseman who flopped on a one-year, $4.5 million deal with Baltimore last year. “How does he translate outside Colorado?”Hawpe, 31, actually has just as many career homers on the road (60) as he has at home, with comparable on-base and slugging numbers. According to baseball-reference.com, the player in baseball history who most closely resembles him is Werth, who is also 31.Werth is a stronger defender with better speed. But the biggest difference between the players is that Werth had a fine season last year, and Hawpe did not. How much that means will be reflected in their contracts. Werth will cash in, and Hawpe could struggle for work. In free agency, timing is everything.'"
"'10-11-15,'1','Other states where Republicans seized control of all reins of government in this election are Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin and Wyoming.In Oklahoma, many conservative Democrats from rural areas lost, sounding a death knell for the state’s famous Blue Dogs, who have wielded power since the 1930s, pollsters and some Democrats say.Politicians on all sides here predict that a raft of conservative bills that had been vetoed by Gov. Brad Henry, a moderate Democrat, will sail through next year, along with a few new ones.The Republican governor-elect, Mary Fallin, a former member of Congress, is not only the first woman to be elected to the office, but also an archconservative allied with right-wing Republican lawmakers who call themselves the Liberty Caucus.Voters also passed ballot initiatives on hot conservative issues, measures that had had little chance of becoming law under Mr. Henry.Those initiatives show the extent of the conservative triumph here and how the anxiety among some voters about illegal immigrants and Muslims has become a potent political weapon.For instance, voters overwhelmingly approved measures making English the state’s official language and requiring picture identification at the polls. Democrats maintain that both measures make it harder for Hispanic immigrants to vote or go to school, and they had succeeded in stopping them in the past.But nowhere was the culture clash more stark than on the amendment regarding Shariah law, which put Democrats of a secular bent at odds with the conservative Christians who make up the backbone of the Republican Party.Supporters of the amendment acknowledge that there is no evidence Islamic law had ever been brought up as a defense in the state courts. But they point to a recent case in New Jersey in which a judge had considered Shariah law in denying a restraining order to a Moroccan woman who said her former husband had raped her while they were married. The decision was overturned.They also note that Shariah courts have been set up in England, where they have the power under a 1996 law to act as arbitration tribunals in Muslim civil disputes, provided all parties agree to abide by the ruling.“This is a pre-emptive strike,” said the bill’s main author, State Representative Rex Duncan, a Republican from Sand Springs.Before the vote, Mr. Duncan described the Shariah tribunals in England as “a cancer” and predicted that Muslims would come to America to take away “liberties and freedom from our children.” In an interview on MSNBC, he said: “This is a war for the survival of America. It’s a cultural war.” (In 2007, Mr. Duncan rejected a gift of a Koran from a council Mr. Henry created, saying, “Most Oklahomans do not endorse the idea of killing innocent women and children in the name of ideology.”)Mr. Duncan, who had to step down because of term limits, won a close race for district attorney in Osage and Pawnee Counties. His sponsorship of the amendment helped him win there, local pollsters and politicians say. Across the state, the ballot initiative pulled conservatives to the polls.“It was inflammatory, and it got people to turn out,” said State Representative Wallace Collins, a Democrat from Norman who lost a close race. “It worked for them.”The day after the election, Muneer Awad, executive director of the local Council on American-Islamic Relations, filed a lawsuit. Mr. Awad argued that the amendment violated the freedom of religion clause of the United States Constitution, because it singled out Shariah law and Islam for special treatment rather than banning consideration of all religious codes. That amounts to state disapproval of Islam, he argued.Last Monday, Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange of Federal District Court agreed that Mr. Awad’s complaint had merit, finding that the amendment’s “primary purpose inhibits religion.” She temporarily halted the certification of the election results and scheduled a hearing for next week.Outside the courthouse, Mr. Duncan said the restraining order “thwarts the will of the people.” He said the amendment was never intended as an attack on Muslims, but as an effort to prevent what he called “activist judges” from using Islamic law in deciding cases.Law professors have begun to raise questions about the unintended consequences of the amendment. Because it also “forbids courts from using or considering international law,” it could complicate contractual arrangements between Oklahoma companies and those with headquarters abroad. The amendment might also prevent judges from referring to the Ten Commandments or exploring English common law in their decisions.“You throw a series of ambiguous ill-conceived words into the State Constitution and you don’t know what will happen,” said Harry F. Tepker Jr., a law professor at the University of Oklahoma. “It’s a mess.”Ms. Fallin, who has strong support from business, has begun to back away from the amendment, even though she supported it. “It’s something that she will have to meet with the attorney general on and look at the legal specifics,” said Alex Weintz, a spokesman.Muslim leaders in Oklahoma said the amendment felt like a slap in the face. They worry that marriages, wills, divorces and contracts — often drawn up between parties under Islamic principles then submitted to a court for approval — will no longer be valid. Jews and Roman Catholics often follow the same procedure in civil matters.But many Muslims said they were more worried about the anti-Muslim mood that fueled the amendment’s passage. The vote here follows the controversy over a Christian pastor’s aborted plan to burn Korans in Florida and the opposition to an Islamic community center near ground zero in Manhattan.Large mosques in Oklahoma City and Tulsa have been flooded with hateful e-mail since the suit was filed, including a video of a man destroying a mosque, Muslim leaders said.“Islamophobia is really popular,” said Mr. Awad, of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “With fear and hate, you really rally up a lot of supporters.”The politicians backing the amendment, however, deny the accusations of fearmongering.“America was founded on Judeo-Christian principles — that’s the basis of our laws, and people try to deny it,” said State Representative Mike Reynolds, a Republican who was an author of the bill. “I believe there is an awakening of people concerned about Christian values in our nation, and they are starting to express themselves.”'"

"'10-11-15,'1','On Friday, the storm in the markets was briefly calmed when five European ministers at the Group of 20 summit in Seoul issued supportive statements and Ireland’s finance minister, Brian Lenihan, reaffirmed the country’s resolve. But European officials are concerned that more needs to be done before Ireland presents its next budget, scheduled for Dec. 7.The reaction of the bond markets on Monday is the next test for Ireland. Officials said they were preparing a contingency plan in case the markets moved sharply against the country.Preliminary talks on a rescue package had already taken place. Discussions involving European Union ministers and senior officials continued on Sunday, said one official involved in the debate. But by early Sunday evening, diplomats said, there were still no plans for any formal teleconference between the finance ministers of the 16 countries that use the euro.Officials in Brussels and Dublin said that Ireland had not made any formal application for a loan and that without such an application, no bailout could be approved or executed.According to a report by Barclays Capital, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund would need to loan 80 billion to 85 billion euros, or $109 billion to $116 billion, to satisfy Ireland’s sovereign funding needs and to create an added buffer to help recapitalize its failed banks.The “extreme tension that has been prevailing in the financial markets, especially concerning the ability of Ireland to achieve a sustainable fiscal path by going it alone,” meant that recourse to European Union loans “would, in our view, represent a sensible outturn,” Julian Callow and Antonio Garcia Pascual of Barclays Capital wrote in a research note on Friday evening.Finance officials are scheduled to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the Irish situation.Any Irish bailout would be a delicate matter for Germany, which strongly resisted the bailout of Greece and has been pushing to overhaul the current mechanism for European rescues to ensure that private investors help foot the bill of any sovereign defaults. German officials, however, may be hoping that Ireland accepts the bailout sooner rather than later to soothe jittery debt markets and ensure stability of the euro and, in the longer term, the growth prospects of the European Union.The first of any such payments to Ireland would come from a pot of money totaling 60 billion euros that is guaranteed by the union’s budget and set up to provide rapid assistance, one European official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were in progress and could change. The official would not speculate on how much money Ireland might need over all.Any additional loans would have to come from a much larger pool of money guaranteed by the euro zone nations. That pool totals 440 billion euros, the official said. Reaching such an agreement on using those funds might prove harder, as governments still are debating how a permanent loan system should work. It also could take up to four weeks to draw up a support program using that pool and could require more scrutiny from the International Monetary Fund.The two pools of funding were set up in May after the bailout of Greece. But the official stressed that Ireland was very different.Whereas Greece’s rescue came after years of concealing the true state of its finances, Ireland has a much stronger track record in economic management. That means it was still possible that Ireland could steady the markets by imposing tough austerity measures.While Ireland must submit its budget by Dec. 7, it is rushing to prepare a four-year plan that will show how it plans to cut its current deficit from 32 percent of gross domestic product to 3 percent by 2014.That strategy will include another round of spending cuts and is likely to spark further unrest from a citizenry that is suffering from a third consecutive year of negative growth in the economy.As the speculation over a bailout has mounted, driving bond yields to a high of 9 percent last week, the government continued to insist that it has the funds to keep going through spring of next year.“There are no talks on an application for emergency funding from the European Union,” Eoin Dorgan, a spokesman for the Irish finance ministry, said Sunday.The Irish government is extremely reluctant to seek a bailout, analysts say, because of the stigma associated with aid and the risk to its political standing.The Fianna Fail Party leads a shaky coalition that holds only a thin majority in Parliament and could be forced to call early elections next year.Dublin is also hoping to reassure markets that it can avoid a bailout by winning approval from the European Union for its bailout of Anglo Irish Bank.The European Commission, the executive arm of the union, still needs to determine whether the bank bailout falls within European state aid rules. The commission is considering whether to approve a 6.4 billion euro portion of the bailout of Anglo Irish and to agree to the overall restructuring plan.'"
"'10-11-15,'1','“I’m going to work for national reconciliation. That is a very important thing,” she said, adding: “There is nobody I cannot talk to. I am prepared to talk with anyone. I have no personal grudge toward anybody.”Nevertheless, she began the new relationship with a flat refusal to cooperate, according to a person close to the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In arranging for her release, that person said, the military had asked her to agree not to leave Yangon and not to give public speeches. When she refused, she was asked at least to wait awhile before speaking. She refused again and proceeded with her address on Sunday.She spoke with the buoyancy and infectious joy that have characterized her addresses in the past, and her exchanges with the crowd were sometimes emotional.“I need to know what you want first,” she said to the crowd. “Do you know what you want?”She pointed to a middle-age man and her aides handed him a microphone. “We love you very much!” the man said. “And we need democracy!”The microphone was passed to another man in the crowd who shouted wildly, “Today the entire country has been released from military slavery!”Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi did not respond or even smile, but only gestured that the microphone be passed to a woman nearby. The woman wept and cried, “I love you more than I love myself.”The release of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 65, came just six days after an election engineered by the military to give it control over a civilian Parliament and government. Though the military will still hold power, there will be new political institutions and new officeholders who could alter the dynamics of her interactions with the government.Her lawyers said she had been released without conditions, but it remained unclear what role the government expected her to play, what long-term limits it intended to set on her activities or whether it intended to open a dialogue with her.She said she would be willing to meet with anybody, even the leader of the junta, Senior Gen. Than Shwe, saying at a news conference after the rally, “It will be very good if I can discuss with him the issues I care about.”In what seemed a gesture of conciliation, the main government newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar, reported her release in positive terms Sunday morning, saying that she had been granted a pardon because of good behavior and that the police “stand ready to give her whatever help she needs.”It said she was being treated with leniency because she is the daughter of the nation’s founding hero, U Aung San, a general who was assassinated in 1947, and “viewing that peace, tranquillity and stability will prevail and that no malice be held against each other.”It appeared that even divisions in her party, the National League for Democracy, were beginning to melt away as party members and former party members rallied around her.“She belongs to the entire nation,” said U Khin Maung Swe, the leader of an opposition party that split with the National League over its decision to boycott the election. “We consider her a national leader and she does not belong to any single group or party.”For Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the moment seemed to be one of reassessment and recalculation as she explored issues that might have evolved during her seven-year absence.At the news conference, she said she would consider changing her position on economic sanctions against the country formerly called Burma, which she has supported and which have been at the center of a policy of isolation and punishment of the junta by Western nations. “If the people really want sanctions to be lifted, I will consider it,” she said. “This is the time that Burma needs help.”She said she had been listening to radio broadcasts up to six hours a day during her arrest in the hope of understanding the people, and told her supporters she wanted to hear from them.“Please let us know what you are thinking, what is on your mind,” she said at the rally. “I would like to know over the last six years what changes have taken place.”She also asked her supporters to join her campaign for change.“I’m not going to be able to do it alone,” she said at the news conference. “One person alone can’t do anything as important as bringing genuine democracy to a country.”'"

"'10-11-16,'0','“The implications here are enormous,” said Rob Carey, Keller’s lawyer. “I don’t think we anticipated such a drastic, far-reaching defense, and then when EA Sports did that, that’s when everybody started to cover their own turf.”In a class-action lawsuit filed in 2009, Keller sued Electronic Arts, the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Collegiate Licensing Company, claiming that they illegally profited from the images of college players portrayed in the games NCAA Football and NCAA Basketball. Because N.C.A.A. amateurism rules prohibit the endorsement of products by college athletes, the players’ names are not used in the video games. But in most cases, the virtual players have the same jersey number, height, weight, home state — even playing style — as the real college athletes.In February, Claudia A. Wilken, a United States District Court judge, rejected a request to dismiss the case, arguing that Electronic Arts did not sufficiently “transform” the images into a work that would qualify as free speech.Since Electronic Arts filed its opening brief in the appeal in August, more than three dozen parties have signed their names to briefs supporting each side. Those who support Electronic Arts claim that free speech rights permit the use of the athletes’ images. But Keller and his supporters argue that the video games in question are not protected by the First Amendment because the company was using the likenesses of college athletes for purely commercial gain. The Motion Picture Association of America, the Gannett Company, ESPN, Viacom, video game publishers and reality-television production companies have aligned themselves with Electronic Arts, as have two advocacy groups, the First Amendment Coalition and the First Amendment Project. But Keller has powerful allies of his own: the players unions for professional baseball, basketball, football, hockey and soccer filed a brief supporting Keller. Also backing Keller are the Screen Actors Guild, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the company that owns the rights to Bob Marley’s work and heirs of John Steinbeck. In an odd twist, one of the groups that has sided against Electronic Arts — the N.F.L. Players Association — has a multimillion-dollar licensing deal allowing the company to use its members’ names and likenesses in the video game Madden NFL.The next step in the appeal is for Electronic Arts to file a reply to Keller’s brief. Several courts have ruled that video games should count as protected speech. Earlier this month the Supreme Court heard arguments about whether a law banning the sale of violent video games to minors violated the First Amendment. Keller and his supporters have said that sports video games should not be protected because they are simply trying to replicate real life and are not creative in nature.“We have a new medium that didn’t exist 20 or 30 years ago, and I think we’re starting to see these issues sort out,” said Alonzo Wickers, a lawyer for Electronic Arts.In its appeal, Electronic Arts argues that Wilken mistakenly considered only Keller’s image and not the entire game, which qualifies as a creative work. The court should treat the case no differently than if “Keller had sued a filmmaker who used his photograph in a documentary about college football,” lawyers for Electronic Arts wrote in their appeal. Famous people have long been incorporated into artistic works, they argue: Paul Simon mentions Joe DiMaggio in the song “Mrs. Robinson,” for example, and the makers of the movie “Forrest Gump” inserted the title character into old footage to simulate conversations with historical figures.“Treating the right of publicity as if it were a copyright — as if you could copyright your name and face — goes too far, and it would give people too much power to control the First Amendment speech of others,” said Nathan Siegel, who represents the media companies.But representatives of athletes, actors and other famous figures say they deserve to be compensated for use of personas they have worked hard to develop, and say Electronic Arts goes too far. If Electronic Arts were to prevail, “the real-life consequence would be that anybody making anything other than a television commercial or a print ad — what is very clearly commercial speech — would essentially have the right to use people’s names and likenesses in those projects without any consultation,” said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the general counsel of the Screen Actors Guild.'"
"'10-11-16,'0','“Judge Herrick’s decision is a get-out-of-jail-free card for every criminal defendant in New York State,” said Heather Orth, a spokeswoman for Mr. Soares. “His message to defendants is, ‘If your D.A. is being too tough on you, sue him, and you can get a new one.’ ”Mr. Soares’s statewide profile has grown as a result of his investigations of top New York public officials, most recently on the question of whether to prosecute Gov. David A. Paterson on perjury charges.The criminal case dismissed on Monday and the subsequent civil lawsuit centered on an investigation that Mr. Soares opened several years ago that resulted in a highly publicized raid on Signature Pharmacy in Orlando, Fla., which prosecutors had accused of being the supplier of at least $10 million of controlled substances sold to customers in New York.The raid, in February 2007, led to the arrests of five people associated with Signature: Naomi and Robert Loomis, the couple that owns the pharmacy; Kenneth Michael Loomis, Mr. Loomis’s brother and a pharmacist at the company; and two former employees, Kirk Calvert and Tony Palladino.Over the summer, a federal judge in Florida denied Mr. Soares’s motion to dismiss the civil suit, a fact noted in the ruling on Monday. The judge, Gregory A. Presnell, said Mr. Soares led a criminal case riddled with flaws, including arrests that potentially were illegal. The judge also accused Mr. Soares of taking steps to attract the maximum amount of attention from the media.Judge Presnell also said he did not understand why Mr. Soares believed he had a legal basis to pursue the investigation, noting that Signature had no offices in New York and that the people charged had never set foot in the state.In 2008, Judge Herrick threw out criminal indictments against the five Signature defendants, citing a series of blunders and missteps by Albany County prosecutors that he said had prejudiced the case. But Mr. Soares charged the five again over the summer.Mr. Soares has said that Signature was at the center of a nationwide ring of shady Web sites and unethical doctors who had made steroids and other controlled substances easy to obtain over the Internet.Prosecutors charged that the Web sites enabled doctors to provide prescriptions to numerous people, including professional baseball and football players seeking to improve performance, whom they had neither met nor diagnosed. Signature Pharmacy, prosecutors said, filled the prescriptions.Mr. Soares has been at the center of several high-profile cases involving New York political figures in the last few years.Most recently, Judith S. Kaye, the former chief judge of the State Court of Appeals, issued a report saying Governor Paterson misled state ethics regulators while testifying under oath about tickets he had obtained to a Yankees World Series game last year. But she left it to Mr. Soares to decide whether to pursue perjury charges against the governor; he has not yet made that decision.Mr. Soares also led an investigation into the way former Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s administration handled the politically sensitive travel records of a Republican rival, Joseph L. Bruno during Mr. Bruno’s time as the Senate majority leader.Mr. Soares drew criticism for his handling of that investigation after issuing conflicting assessments of the case and after interviewing Mr. Spitzer and other officials informally, rather than under oath. He ultimately filed no charges.'"
"'10-11-16,'0','LONDON — In its latest effort to cut public spending, Prime Minister David Cameron’s government took aim on Monday at Britain’s system of state-financed legal aid for litigants in civil cases — and, indirectly, at the country’s 150,000 lawyers.Declaring the 60-year-old legal aid system unaffordable, the government set out plans to cut by $560 million the program’s current annual cost of $3.4 billion, a figure that has nearly doubled in 10 years. In paying for some or all of the legal costs in two and a half million criminal and civil cases a year, the government spends almost as much as it does on the country’s prisons, and about 10 times as much, per capita, as the Netherlands, which has a similarly generous system of state social aid.“At the moment, no other country in the world has to pay for so much litigation over such a wide variety of areas,” said the justice minister, Kenneth Clarke.While the changes would leave the state’s role in financing the defense in criminal cases largely untouched, Mr. Clarke said, the government was concentrating on the costs of state-backed civil litigation and family legal disputes to “discourage people from resorting to lawyers whenever they face a problem.”In setting out the changes in Parliament, where the government will introduce legislation early next year, Mr. Clarke was meeting the government’s target of a cut of nearly a quarter in the Justice Ministry’s annual budget of nearly $15 billion by 2015. The proposed reductions follow similarly steep cuts that have been announced in recent weeks for defense, higher education and welfare, among other areas, as the government seeks a four-year, $130 billion cut in its annual spending.'"
"'10-11-16,'0','“In a business with huge fixed costs, once you cover those costs, things start flowing pretty quickly to the bottom line,” said William Clay Ford Jr., Ford’s executive chairman.Ford executives are reluctant to declare that all of Detroit’s problems have been solved, but Wall Street is enthusiastically jumping on the bandwagon. Last week, a Morgan Stanley analyst said Ford’s share price could hit $30 if overall demand grew and the company continued to increase its market share.“It’s clear now that the offering is going to be a huge success,” Steven L. Rattner, the former head of President Obama’s auto task force and the architect of the government bailouts of G.M. and Chrysler, told the Automotive Press Association in Detroit on Monday. “The demand is enormous, and the price will be higher than lower.”The decision to increase the price range was made on Monday afternoon, said a person close to the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly.The higher the price for the G.M. stock, the more money the American taxpayers will recoup on their first opportunity to cash in on the 61 percent stake the federal government holds in the company.Orders for the stock from institutional investors are expected to close on Tuesday, with the offering formally priced on Wednesday.G.M.’s underwriters expect to make use of the overallotment option, expanding the size of the offering by nearly 54.8 million shares if exercised in full, these people said. If this so-called greenshoe option is fully exercised, the proceeds from the stock sale could hit more than $17.6 billion using the midpoint of the price range, which would include $4 billion from the preferred shares, up from $3 billion.The high level of investor interest underscores how extraordinarily Detroit has changed since its senior executives went to Washington for emergency aid in the fall of 2008. The Rust Belt manufacturing sector has a new sheen for investors impressed by how much Detroit has slashed costs and improved the quality of its vehicles.“There is definitely a greater level of confidence in the ability of the carmakers to perform,” Mr. Rattner said. “That’s because of the profit numbers.”Ford earned $6.37 billion in the first nine months of this year, and G.M. earned about $4.2 billion. The results are even more impressive given that United States vehicle sales will total about 12 million this year, a far cry from the 16 million average recorded for most of the last decade.The rebound in the auto sector is extending to its major suppliers as well.Five of the largest publicly traded suppliers — Johnson Controls, Federal Mogul, Lear, BorgWarner and American Axle — reported combined third-quarter earnings that were double the size of a year earlier. Their stock prices have also increased an average of 50 percent in the last year.“Investors have short memories,” said Neil M. Schloss, Ford’s treasurer. “What they are looking at now is our ability to sustain this business model.”Mr. Schloss said that many large investors wanted to own both Ford and G.M. shares to take full advantage of the domestic industry’s turnaround.“I don’t think there are constraints that are forcing them to choose one or the other,” he said.G.M. has attracted heavy interest from potential investors during its roadshow by executives, including big orders from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East and Asia.The company has already secured one major cornerstone investor, its Chinese partner SAIC Motor, which will buy a 1 percent stake, according to people briefed on the matter.'"
"'10-11-16,'0','The news reported in Science magazine last week of the exquisite timing and elegant physics displayed by cats in their drinking habits has reinforced once again the obvious truth that cats are superior to sloppy-go-lucky dogs, and no doubt to people as well, at least the ones with whom I drink water (and I include myself). And that very superiority and elegance is yet another reason to have a dog as a pet — if, that is, there is anything wanting in your personal eating or housekeeping habits.A cat it seems, draws up a column of water with the tip of its tongue and bites off the top of the column just before it drops back (neatly, of course) into the dish. Dogs, well, dogs slurp. I don’t slurp, but I do spill. Water, soup, ham sandwiches — I can spill anything.Once, in a business meeting I knocked over a full glass of diet soda. My colleague and friend, sitting right next to me, a man with whom I worked closely every day, a cat owner, said with a very audible whisper, “I would be sooo embarrassed.” As for general neatness of the sort that leads to respectable housekeeping, I will say only that once, in the office, after desperately searching various nooks and crannies for what smelled like a dead mouse, I gave up and decided to clean off the piles of paper on my desk. Halfway down one of the tumbling stacks was a dead mouse, apparently caught in a data avalanche.It is true that if I had a cat in the office, the mouse would not have been foolish enough to risk trekking across the paper mountain. But I would have had to put up with the cat’s disdain. I won’t venture into the argument over the extent of animal consciousness except to say that I wouldn’t trust anyone who doubts that cats are capable of disdain.I’m not anti-cat. I don’t share the view of another colleague that cats are “agents of Satan.” (He requested notoriety, not anonymity, but I feel I should protect him from himself.) But I do prefer dogs because they are more tolerant of my personal failings. If I spill soup, or a sandwich, or, in a kind of lunch-special combo, soup and a sandwich, on my tie or all over my lap, my dog looks at me and says (I am going to translate her looks and tail wags), “Don’t worry about it. I spill half my bowl every time I drink.”If you have any doubts about which sort of pet is right for you, watch the researcher’s video of his cat drinking water. Observe the neatness and precision. Drink a glass of water yourself. How do you compare? How does that make you feel?Then watch my dog, or any other, slurp water and then look up at you with a big happy smile as water cascades from her jowls to the floor. Take a sip of water yourself. How do you feel now?'"

"'10-11-16,'0','Mississippi had set up a variety of programs to address housing problems after the storm, and state officials argued that these were adequate. But in a series of meetings starting in April, housing advocates and HUD officials began to convince state officials that there were many Mississippians, especially poor ones, who had been left out.“The assumption was that all of these unique programs were taking care of everything, including the hard cases,” said Gerald Blessey, a former mayor of Biloxi who was appointed by Gov. Haley Barbour to oversee post-hurricane housing issues. “When we started to look under the hood, we found that there was a number of hard cases that were not being taken care of.”Over the summer, Mr. Morse worked with state officials to design a program around a list of 4,400 such hard cases in Mississippi. People in need of help had to fall below a certain income level and the problem had to be directly caused by the hurricane. In all the cases, some kind of adjustment needed to be made to the rules governing hurricane assistance.Taking a random sample of these cases, estimators visited houses to assess damage. Based on those figures, they calculated that $93 million would be needed to close the financing gaps in the case list.“Once the governor was convinced of that point by research and analysis, he was willing to make that move,” said Fred Tombar, a senior HUD official who oversees Gulf Coast recovery.Mr. Morse and HUD officials also insisted that there were an unknown number of Mississippians who had been overlooked or had not applied for assistance, many of whom lived inland but nonetheless suffered severe damage from the storm. The governor agreed to set up an aggressive outreach program to find people who might qualify for assistance, and to set aside $40 million in a reserve fund for these cases.All of the money in the new program comes from existing Hurricane Katrina assistance programs; any money left over in the reserve fund will join the nearly $600 million now dedicated to port expansion.Some of the recipients will be poor residents whose homes were damaged or destroyed by hurricane winds, but who did not have homeowner’s insurance. This marks a departure from the assistance plan that Mr. Barbour put before Congress in 2005, which excluded people who did not have homeowners’ insurance. (The federal grants in this program were mainly directed to people whose homes were swamped by the storm surge, but who lived outside the federally designated flood plain and thus were not required to carry federal flood insurance.)In a news conference on Monday, Mr. Barbour said this new program came about largely because HUD was willing to show flexibility on that point.“This administration made the decision that they felt like people who were damaged by wind, even though we had made that agreement with Congress, should be covered if they were poor,” he said. “That is why there’s a change.”Mr. Morse, however, said that the state had been reluctant to show flexibility and that it was the lawsuit that, to a large degree, had moved the discussions forward.The appeal of the lawsuit was dropped when officials agreed to the creation of the new program at the end of October. Arguments were to have started last Friday in federal appeals court.'"
"'10-11-16,'0','The pro-Democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released over the weekend after 7 ½ years in detention, began consulting with lawyers on Monday about winning official recognition for her party, and her lawyer said the High Court would hold a hearing on Thursday on whether to accept the case. The party, the National League for Democracy, has continued to operate despite the ban, leaving it vulnerable to government crackdowns. The military junta is unlikely to restore the party’s legal status without something in return from Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, like dropping her support for Western sanctions. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 65, told the BBC on Monday that she sought “a nonviolent revolution,” and she offered reassuring words for the military: “I don’t want to see the military falling. I want to see the military rising to dignified heights of professionalism and true patriotism.”'"
"'10-11-16,'0','WASHINGTON — People convicted of possessing a gun while selling drugs are subject to five-year mandatory minimum sentences on top of most of other sentences, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.The ruling was the first signed decision of the term, and it was unanimous. But the court’s newest member, Justice Elena Kagan, did not participate, having disqualified herself in light of her work as United States solicitor general.The decision involved two defendants whose cases had been consolidated. One of them, Kevin Abbott of Philadelphia, was convicted of drug trafficking, of a related gun charge with the 5-year minimum and under a law requiring a 15-year minimum sentence for career criminals. Only the latter two charges figured in his sentence, and the trial judge added them together for a total of 20 years.The second defendant, Carlos R. Gould of Wichita Falls, Tex., pleaded guilty to a drug charge involving cocaine with a 10-year minimum sentence and the related gun charge with a 5-year minimum. The trial court gave him a little more than the minimum on the drug charge — 11 years and 5 months — and then added five years for the gun charge.The question in the case was what Congress meant when it revised a 1968 federal gun control law in 1998 by, among other things, adding a new preface saying the five-year minimum for having or using guns while selling drugs applied “except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided.”'"
"'10-11-16,'0','Goldman Sachs’s shareholders have little to grumble about. Sure, the bank’s plan to buy back $5 billion in expensive preferred stock held by Warren E. Buffett appears to have been delayed because of an industrywide debate with the Federal Reserve over how to manage capital. That includes deciding when dividends can go up. But investors in Goldman’s common stock already have an advantage over the competition.That’s because Goldman is the only major American bank that did not slash its dividend during the crisis. Morgan Stanley, for example, trimmed its quarterly payout to 5 cents a share, as did JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. And because of the huge taxpayer bailouts, Bank of America hands over a nominal 1 cent a share every three months, while Citi pays nothing.Goldman, meanwhile, has kept its quarterly payments steady at 35 cents a share. Because it had to improve its balance sheet during the crisis by selling more common shares, the firm actually pays out more over all in dividends now than it did before the crisis. It is on course to hand out some $760 million to shareholders this year, about 25 percent more than in 2007.Look at this unique advantage another way. While its peers contemplate if and how they will be able to take their dividends back up to boom-time levels, Goldman is in the odd position where it actually would have to reduce its payouts to get there. If, for example, banks were to align dividends this year to the same percentage of net income they paid out in 2007, based on the consensus estimates of earnings, Goldman’s payout would be cut by 43 percent.Of course, that’s unlikely to happen. Even at current levels, Goldman’s dividend equates to less than 10 percent of expected earnings. Its larger commercial bank rivals, which have been public for far longer and built up dividends over time, generally pay out 30 to 50 percent when times are good. Goldman’s path to that rate may have been delayed by the crisis. But compared to the competition, its shareholders are still sitting pretty.'"
"'10-11-16,'0','The great Brooklyn-born tenor Richard Tucker died in 1975, and by the end of that year a foundation bearing his name was up and running. Since then the foundation, which fosters the careers of emerging singers, has earned the good will of major artists, who contribute their services to an annual gala concert.Sometimes these galas have been marathons, a little much of a good thing. But the 35th-anniversary Richard Tucker Gala on Sunday night at Avery Fisher Hall, though offering 18 selections performed by 16 singers, was quick paced, just under two hours without intermission. Among the stars taking part were Anna Netrebko, Deborah Voigt, Elina Garanca, Marcello Giordani and Simon Keenlyside. Marco Armiliato conducted members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and the New York Choral Society, bringing style and stamina to diverse works from opera, operetta and Spanish zarzuela.The foundation’s major prize is the annual Richard Tucker Award: $30,000 given to an artist judged to be on the threshold of an international career. The 2010 winner is the American tenor James Valenti, who made an impressive Met debut early this year as Alfredo in Verdi’s “Traviata,” holding his own against the intense Violetta of Angela Gheorghiu. Mr. Valenti opened the Sunday program with “È la storia solita del pastore,” the lover’s lament from “L’Arlesiana” by Cilea. He shaped the poignant opening phrases with tenderness, building inexorably to the aria’s impassioned final outbursts. He was also strong in two quartets later in the evening: from Act IV of Verdi’s “Rigoletto” (joined by the soprano Lisette Oropesa, the mezzo-soprano Jennifer Johnson and Mr. Keenlyside), and from Puccini’s “Rondine” (with Ms. Oropesa, the soprano Angela Meade and the tenor Paul Appleby).The Tucker gala is not an occasion to offer detailed vocal critiques of the artists who participate. Coming out to sing an aria cold is not easy. And many performers use the occasion to try something unusual or to have fun. Ms. Netrebko, for one, performed an aria from Emmerich Kalman’s German operetta “The Gypsy Princess.” Looking glamorous in a bright blue gown, Ms. Netrebko threw herself into this song of farewell from a cabaret singer to her fans in Budapest as she embarks on an American tour. Her voice soared over the chorus as she sang, shimmied and twirled in circles. She was just as uninhibited in a richly expressive duet from Massenet’s “Manon” with Mr. Giordani. When the frantic lovers embraced at the end, Ms. Netrebko, in character, planted a long kiss on her willing tenor.Also stepping outside his comfort zone was the Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto, now in rehearsal at the Met (along with Mr. Keenlyside) for the new production of Verdi’s “Don Carlo” that is to open on Monday. His second offering here was “This Nearly Was Mine” from “South Pacific.” He gave a movingly restrained performance, the expression of a character more defeated than embittered by the loss of a dream romance. Ms. Voigt, gearing up for the Met centennial production of Puccini’s “Fanciulla del West” next month, brought burnished sound and despair to “Sola, perduta, abbandonata” from Puccini’s “Manon Lescaut.”Ms. Oropesa was exquisite in “Caro nome” from Verdi’s “Rigoletto.” And Ms. Meade, the powerhouse young singer for whom the Met has notable plans down the road, stopped the show with an aria from Donizetti’s “Lucrezia Borgia,” tossing off the coloratura runs and slicing through the chorus and orchestra with her gleaming phrases.Ms. Garanca and the tenor Brandon Jovanovich, currently in Bizet’s “Carmen” at the Met, sang the extended final scene from that opera, in which the unhinged, jilted Don José kills the defiant, belittling Carmen. They sounded and looked great. Pavol Breslik, now in Mozart’s “Così Fan Tutte” at the Met, brought his appealing lyric tenor to “Una furtiva lagrima“ from Donizetti’s “Elisir d’Amore.”Introducing the program, Barry Tucker, the tenor’s son and president of the foundation, asked, “What would a Richard Tucker Gala be without cancellations?” This one had two: the baritones Mariusz Kwiecien and Zeljko Lucic withdrew because of illness.'"
"'10-11-16,'0','For women with a high risk of breast cancer because of genetic mutations or family history, yearly M.R.I. scans in addition to mammograms and breast exams may save lives, a new study finds.The study, the first to measure survival in a large number of high-risk women receiving M.R.I.’s, found that after six years of follow-up, 93 percent of mutation carriers with cancer were still alive, compared with 74 percent alive at five years in earlier studies. In the new study, all of the women at high risk because of family history were still alive after six years.Experts began several years ago to recommend yearly M.R.I. scans in addition to mammograms for high-risk women, because M.R.I. is better at finding tumors. Mammograms still detect some cancers that M.R.I.’s miss, so high-risk women are generally advised to have both tests. But until now, researchers did not know whether the combined testing saved lives.“We have always assumed that if you find the cancer early, the patients will do better,” said Dr. Maxine Jochelson, director of imaging at the breast and imaging center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan (she was not involved in the study). “This is the first paper that really has taken a large number of women and shown that if you find disease earlier it does translate into some improved outcomes.”The findings may offer a reprieve to some women with very high risk who thought that having their breasts removed preventively was the only way to avoid cancer and save their lives. More women may also become willing to be tested for mutations, since there could be a less drastic way to deal with them.'"

"'10-11-17,'0','Paul Calello, the chairman of the investment bank at Credit Suisse Group in Manhattan who helped navigate the Swiss bank through the financial crisis, died on Tuesday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 49.The cause was non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, the bank said.Brady W. Dougan, the bank’s chief executive, and Mr. Calello joined Credit Suisse together in 1990 as part of a team of derivatives traders from Bankers Trust. Mr. Calello held numerous leadership roles at the bank, including a stint as chief executive of its Asian business. He led the firm’s expansion in China, where he helped arrange a $22 billion initial public offering in 2006 by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, then the largest offering in history.Credit Suisse named him chief executive of the investment bank in 2007 just as the markets were peaking. He helped steer the bank through the financial crisis, including spearheading in late 2008 a substantial reduction of risk on the firm’s balance sheet and cutting costs across the firm.Some of those moves presaged the financial regulations that investment banks across Wall Street are scrambling to meet.“Paul reshaped what an investment bank is supposed to look like,” said Wilson Ervin, a senior adviser to Mr. Dougan at Credit Suisse, which has emerged from the crisis in better shape than many of its peers.Mr. Calello also helped devise a novel plan of paying bankers’ bonuses with the firm’s toxic assets that were clogging the bank’s balance sheet. The plan, which was controversial when it was announced, has been largely successful as assets, like mortgage-backed securities and corporate loans, have increased in value.'"

Thus, there has to be an infrastructure that can halt breakneck-speed trading when a program goes wild.Also, whatever mechanisms are put in place, they have to be consistent across all markets.

"'10-11-17,'0','The year-end financial statements, released along with the auditors’ report, capture the Treasury’s losses on paper, and the ultimate cost to the government will depend on many factors. Since the close of the fiscal year, for instance, the insurance giant has begun taking some of the first steps of exiting from its bailout, selling two important subsidiaries to raise cash. More transactions will follow; A.I.G.’s own corporate structure was complex before it was bailed out, and the rescue money came in several different forms, some from the Fed and some from the Treasury. All of that must be disentangled as A.I.G. and the federal government start going their separate ways.After the Treasury issued its projection of a $5.1 billion loss, it was criticized by the special inspector general for the bailout, Neil M. Barofsky. He said the Treasury had failed to explain that it had used a new method in calculating the smaller loss.“This conduct has left Treasury vulnerable to charges that it has manipulated its methodology” in order to show a more favorable number “in early October as part of a multifaceted publicity campaign,” Mr. Barofsky said. For example, he said the Treasury had used the price of A.I.G.’s common stock as of early October to reflect stock-based transactions that would occur many months in the future, without properly explaining that by that time the stock price could very well have moved up or down.He said that adding an explanatory footnote would have gone a long way toward correcting the problem as he saw it. He predicted that when the Treasury’s audited financial statements appeared in November, they would revert to the usual accounting method and show a different number for the loss on A.I.G.The Treasury rejected Mr. Barofsky’s criticism when he made it, saying it believed it had been using appropriate methods all along. It said that audited financial statements by their nature look back at events in the past, while projections look forward, and the $5.1 billion measurement was the result of a projection.Treasury officials also said they believed that using a common stock price as a measuring tool was preferable, because the Treasury’s investment in A.I.G. would soon be converted into common stock. It is now held in preferred stock that does not trade, so it has to be measured according to a model, which is less transparent, they said.In its new annual report, the Treasury provided what appears to be the footnote that Mr. Barofsky was looking for. It appears beneath a table showing the $5.1 billion loss on A.I.G. and explains that it assumes positive values on transactions that have not yet happened.The year-end loss of $22.8 billion is shown in a separate table, with accompanying text making clear that the cost of all the bailout programs will be changing over time. The Treasury’s acting assistant secretary for the Office of Financial Stability, Timothy G. Massad, said the fact that there was now an unqualified audit for the bailout transactions should resolve the dispute.“The fact is, the G.A.O. has blessed our numbers,” he said. “And now we’ve put it side by side, so it’s very clear.”The auditor who signed the opinion of Treasury’s numbers, Gary T. Engel, said that the deficiencies the G.A.O. found did not rise to a level that might cloud the audited financial statements. His opinion letter said his audit had found no noncompliance with laws or rules, and that the financial statements were a fair depiction of what had happened over the last year.The G.A.O. called the problems it found “significant deficiencies.” In standard auditing language, a significant deficiency is less serious than a “material weakness,” which can cloud the accuracy of the financial statements. The G.A.O. said it did not find any of those.Its audit did not include the “Two Year Retrospective” report, and the auditors made no comments on it.The auditors also pointed out that many of the assumptions underlying the Treasury’s numbers were “inherently subject to substantial uncertainty” because the bailout transactions had no precedent, and accountants could not look to history for answers.'"
"'10-11-17,'0','Mr. McHenry would not characterize Ms. Black’s views on the topic, and she has declined interview requests since she was tapped. A spokesman for Coca-Cola and a spokesman for the city both declined to discuss Ms. Black’s role in the debate over how to handle the issue of sodas in schools.Ms. Black resigned from the Coke board this week, citing potential conflicts of interest, but her time at the company is especially striking because the man who chose her for the schools job has declared soda an urgent public health menace and has plastered the city’s subway cars with advertisements that liken drinking it to ingesting goopy liquid fat.“Normally, I would think that somebody who served for 18 years on the board of this junk-food producer is tainted,” said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.“If you’re judged by the people with whom you hang out, it’s not a good sign,” said Dr. Jacobson, whom Mr. Bloomberg recently nominated for a national health “hero award” and who received it last month. “But I wouldn’t say it’s disqualifying. I don’t know what role she played on the board. It could be she was pushing them to cut the sugar or sell fruits and vegetables. It’s hard to know.”He added, “I don’t want to be naïve, because I don’t know what she pushed for, if anything — or was it easy money?”Asked about the apparent conflict between Mr. Bloomberg’s views and the work of his nominee, a spokeswoman for the mayor reiterated his opposition to the sale of sugary drinks in schools and his support of Ms. Black, saying the policy would continue under her chancellorship.In nominating Ms. Black, Mr. Bloomberg said she would bring corporate innovation and management savvy to the sprawling system. But her record at Coca-Cola shows she will bring corporate baggage as well.Ms. Black had been on the board since 1990, except for a brief leave, earning well over $2.1 million in cash and stock over the years, according to Equilar, which studies corporate pay. (Her current stock holdings in Coca-Cola are worth $3.3 million.)During Ms. Black’s tenure, pressure intensified on soda companies to limit sales in schools after Dr. David Satcher, the surgeon general, in 2001 declared obesity a national crisis with “tragic results.” He urged local communities to lead the fight. And much to the beverage industry’s chagrin, they did.In 2003, California and New York City banned the sale of soft drinks in elementary and middle schools. At the same time, a coalition of lawyers who had successfully sued tobacco companies began developing strategies for taking on food companies, threatening a barrage of lawsuits.By 2006, when Connecticut tried for the second year in a row to join the wave of local governments barring sugary drinks at schools, Coke and other companies pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into a bare-knuckle battle to stop the legislation.According to Connecticut state officials, Coke lobbyists warned school districts that if the legislation passed, Coke would stop providing money for after-school programs, which it had done in exchange for the right to put vending machines on campus.State Senator Donald E. Williams Jr., who sponsored the legislation, recalled that company representatives “targeted urban legislators and reminded them that the soda companies often contributed significant amounts of money to schools to buy scoreboards and to supplement their needs.” (At the time, Coke denied making any threats.)The fight in Connecticut put a harsh spotlight on Coke’s longstanding practice of rewarding school districts for exclusive contracts to sell its beverages. Lawmakers revealed that Coke paid a higher commission to schools for the sale of carbonated drinks than for juice or water. And they showed that the company dispensed “marketing bonuses ” to districts that signed on, including free supplies of sports drinks and Coke-branded coolers to be placed on the sidelines at athletic fields.Connecticut’s attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, called the strategies “unconscionable.” The state law was enacted by a slim margin.About the same time, under pressure from the growing tide of state legislation and the intensifying threat of lawsuits, Coke eventually agreed to not sell sugary soda in American schools (the agreement allowed diet sodas and sports drinks to still be available in high schools).But it was not long before Coke once again pushed the envelope. This March, the leading soda makers seemed to reached a milestone agreement to stop selling sugar-laden drinks to schools around the world, bowing to critics who argued that the companies were still exploiting children in emerging markets like India and China.But while Pepsi said it would keep the drinks out of all schools, Coke carved a loophole, conspicuously reserving the right to sell them depending on local demand. “Shame on Coca-Cola,” proclaimed the Center for Science in the Public Interest.“High school students everywhere deserve the same help as American high schoolers,” the group said.In New York, where Ms. Black is the chancellor in waiting, her likely new boss, Mr. Bloomberg went well beyond school grounds, trying to curtail soda consumption with a new statewide tax on sugary drinks.Coca-Cola and Pepsi bottlers, joined by the American Beverage Association, a trade group, spent heavily on an elaborate television campaign featuring hard-up mothers and children stocking the family refrigerator with beverages. The proposal was defeated.Mr. McHenry, the Coke board member, said he opposed the efforts, like those in New York City, to single out individual products and companies as an unfair overreaction. “The ads in New York City and the approach in New York City is not fact-based,” he said. “It’s good publicity, but I just think it’s poor science.”Asked how Ms. Black might handle the issue as chancellor, he said, “I am sure Cathie’s effort is the same as mine would be: to make sure that people make policy on the basis of science and facts, and let those things guide you.”'"
"'10-11-17,'0','Asked in Brussels if assistance for Ireland was now inevitable, Brian Lenihan, the Irish finance minister, said: “It is not inevitable. I would not agree with that analysis.”Still he added, referring to the intensified discussions, “I am not going to put a timeline on this, but this is urgent.”In Dublin, the Irish prime minister, Brian Cowen, hinted at a possible deal, telling Parliament that his government had not asked for help but was “working with others to see in what way we can ameliorate market risks.”The European Union’s commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Ollie Rehn, was more explicit, however, saying that the commission was discussing aid to Ireland with both the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund “and of course the Irish.”The pressure on Ireland grew as officials feared that market jitters could spread rapidly if nothing was done, putting the squeeze on other fiscally weakened countries, like Portugal and Spain, the fourth-largest economy in the euro zone.But officials in the more fiscally sound nations, like Germany and Finland, raised concerns about turning over money to nations without a coherent plan.The European Union cannot “throw money from helicopters,” Germany’s economy minister, Rainer Brüderle, said during a visit to Rome. “You have to create confidence in institutions, in the state, in public authorities.”Buttressing the Finnish view that governments are not eager to hand over their cash, the Austrian finance minister, Josef Pröll, said on Tuesday that his country had not yet submitted its contribution for December of funds to Greece for the bailout negotiated in the spring. “If Greece doesn’t fulfill certain things, we have the need for discussion,” Mr. Pröll said. Greece was “not 100 percent on track,” he said.Dublin has for weeks resisted market and now political pressure to sign up for a bailout that would save its banks. Some European nations, like Portugal and Spain, want a deal to take bond market pressure off themselves. But other European leaders, like the Germans, are mindful of needing support from constituents who do not want to spend their earnings to bail out one country after another.Most analysts expect the European Union to muddle through, adjusting its institutions as necessary. But the cost may mean new financial commitments by already strapped governments that need to cut their own budgets, and a further loss of credibility in global financial markets.Mr. Cowen, the Irish prime minister, tried to put the emphasis on problems with Ireland’s banks, not its government.But Mr. Rehn, the European Union’s economic commissioner, noted that “these are connected,” since the government guaranteed the bank liabilities two years ago.Brian Lucey, a professor of finance at Trinity College Dublin and a former economist for the Irish central bank, concurred, saying that the distinction between the government and the banks was politically useful for Mr. Cowen, who can say that Europe is helping the banks, not the state, but it is meaningless. “It’s right to say that it’s not a state bailout but a bank bailout, but they’re the same,” he said in an interview. “We’re not in a position to dictate. The banks are in deep, deep trouble, and we can’t pull them out ourselves.”Mr. Lucey said that Mr. Cowen was correct “in playing coy and cautious until absolutely certain what the situation is and what’s on the table, to get the strongest deal he can.” But “pride cometh before a fall,” Mr. Lucey said. “We’re in serious danger of falling off a cliff.”In his speech, Mr. Cowen blamed the markets as abnormal and overreacting, saying that Ireland should not be “enslaved” to them. But as Greece discovered, the markets will press on vulnerabilities, and having moved too slowly to bail out Greece, the European Union is eager to move more quickly this time. The first concern of European officials is to prevent a larger bailout that has to cover Portugal, which is manageable, or Spain, which would be much harder.Irish pride is an important factor, given how long the country and its currency were tied to Britain and the pound. While both countries joined the European Union only in 1973, Ireland embraced the euro, which Britain has not, as an important sign of its independence and economic sovereignty.As a result, the deal will be politically sensitive for Mr. Cowen, who has a very fragile majority and has been hoping to put off any bailout until next year.Any rescue plan will come with conditions negotiated by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, as was the case in Greece.Germany in particular is pushing Ireland to raise its corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent, one of the lowest in the euro zone, to reduce its deficits. But Dublin is resisting this sort of intrusion in its affairs, Mr. Lucey said. A tax rate that Germany and other European nations see as unfair competition is viewed in Dublin as a critical element in its economic success, past and future.A significant part of the pressure has also come quietly from the European Central Bank, which has been buying sovereign bonds and supporting the banks with billions in liquidity. The bank would prefer that the states take on the burden through the $81 billion financial stability mechanism and the nearly $600 billion stability fund they set up to try to prevent further crises like the one in Greece.'"
"'10-11-17,'0','“If you can do this for one of the largest companies in the U.S., what happens when the next big crisis approaches,” said Hirotaka Takeuchi, a professor at Harvard Business School. “It may send the wrong signal to the rest of the world.”What is more, though a boom on Wall Street has enabled the government to actually make a profit on many of the stakes it took in financial companies, Washington will probably never recover all of the money handed out to other beneficiaries, like the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And in some cases, billions more may still have to be shelled out.Even in the best case, the government will have to pour an extra $6 billion into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose implicit public guarantees suddenly became explicit when the housing market deteriorated in 2008. A more likely projection calls for a $19 billion injection, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency.And though most of the big banks have repaid the money the government provided at the height of the financial crisis, Washington still owns nearly all of the American International Group, the insurance giant that has swallowed more than $130 billion in government aid.In fact, the government’s stake in A.I.G. is going up, not down, rising to 92.1 percent from 79.8 percent under a complex restructuring plan that will be completed early next year.Then there is GMAC, now known as Ally Financial. Washington anted up about $17 billion to keep it afloat in 2009, but the aid came with fewer strings attached than the financial support for General Motors and Chrysler. The government will not recoup that money any time soon, and it retains a 55 percent stake in the lender.Indeed, the government’s involvement in a broad swath of industries will continue to linger.The boards of G.M. and GMAC include several members that the Treasury helped hand-pick, while regulators are swarming the trading floors and mortgage collection operations at the nation’s biggest banks to try to avert a replay of the financial crisis. And the government is still on the hook for tens of billions in guarantees it provided on debt issues by banks during the financial crisis.Jonathan Koppell, director of Arizona State University’s School of Public Affairs, said that although the General Motors offering was a step in the right direction, “it doesn’t mean this strange period of government ownership is in our rear-view mirror.”“Once you introduce the possibility of state intervention in support of failing firms,” he said, “the marketplace is fundamentally altered, even after government relinquishes its ownership.”To be sure, the government has reaped a $28 billion profit on what has been repaid so far. But bailout beneficiaries still owe $180 billion to Washington, or just under half of the $384 billion of federal money laid out during the crisis. Even the $25 billion the government will earn in the coming months as it sells its remaining stakes in G.M. and Citigroup will not make much of a dent in paying it all back.Before that happens, both companies have to follow through with exit strategies.At G.M., the government injected about $49 billion to stabilize the company and help it through bankruptcy.G.M. has repaid $7 billion, and the government will receive $12 billion more this week from its share of the stock offering, assuming the shares are priced in the upper range of expectations, from $31 to $33. Even then, the Treasury Department could be sitting on a $7 billion to $9 billion loss. The investment in Citigroup is expected to fare better, yielding a profit of more than $11 billion.All told, the government estimates that its other bank investments will yield a lifetime gain of over $9 billion. Most of that comes from the dividend payments and other income it took when the big institutions, like Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, paid back their bailout money. About 590 smaller lenders have yet to repay roughly $38 billion.After its controversial rescue of A.I.G., the government is now on track to realize a $17 billion gain from that investment when it eventually sells its 92 percent stake. The Federal Reserve is also on track to reap an $11 billion windfall from the assets it took when it made an enormous loan to A.I.G. at the height of the crisis.The path to profitability from the government’s investments in Chrysler and GMAC is less clear. For now, the government retains a 10 percent stake in Chrysler, as well as a large loan backed by the company’s assets. It also owns a 55 percent stake in GMAC and could ultimately wind up owning more than 80 percent of that company. Exit plans have not been completed, but they could involve an initial public stock offering or another stock sale.But the real money pits are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage finance giants. So far, they have been kept alive with $150 billion in taxpayer money. Even after the dividends it will receive from the two companies over the next decade, the government could ultimately sustain a $55 billion loss, according to administration data for the 2010 budget. Some of that money could be recouped from income from the assets in the companies’ portfolios.'"
"'10-11-17,'0','BEVERLY HILLS — It was like a scene out of a Hollywood thriller: Gunshots rang out in the middle of the night in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Los Angeles County, leaving a Hollywood publicist dead inside her Mercedes-Benz with no witnesses, suspects or obvious motive.Early Tuesday morning, Ronni Chasen, a well-known Hollywood publicist, was shot several times in the chest while driving through Beverly Hills, and her car then hit a lightpost.Paramedics took Ms. Chasen, 64, to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead.Ms. Chasen had worked as a Hollywood publicist since the 1970s, and was best known recently for representing Hans Zimmer, an Oscar-winning composer, and the songwriter Diane Warren.On Monday night, she had attended the premiere of “Burlesque” in Hollywood, along with the film’s leading ladies, Cher and Christina Aguilera. Steve Elzer, a spokesman for Sony Pictures, could not say when Ms. Chasen left the after-party.Indeed, very little is known about the circumstances of Ms. Chasen’s death.

"'10-11-17,'0','“When you talk to him, he’s got a little bit of edge about himself, and he’s got a lot of confidence in himself,” Dubee said. “You watch his workouts, this guy just doesn’t sit still. There’s always something that he’s trying to do to get better, and that’s the amazing thing. Cy Youngs in both leagues, and he’s always trying to improve.”Halladay last won the award in 2003 for the Toronto Blue Jays; he finished in the top five of the voting four times in between. He is the fifth pitcher to be honored in both leagues, joining Gaylord Perry (Cleveland and San Diego), Randy Johnson (Seattle and Arizona), Pedro Martinez (Montreal and Boston) and Roger Clemens (Boston, Toronto, the Yankees and Houston).He also won much more emphatically than the last Phillies winner, Steve Bedrosian, who took just 9 of 24 first-place votes in 1987. That was a year of explosive offense, when no N.L. pitcher stood out. This year, Halladay beat a dazzling field.Josh Johnson and Wainwright had a lower earned run average. Jimenez had a better winning percentage. Halladay’s teammate Roy Oswalt allowed fewer hits-plus-walks per inning. And San Francisco’s Tim Lincecum, who won the previous two N.L. Cy Young awards, had more strikeouts.But Halladay’s durability and dependability made him the easy choice. He was 21-10 with a 2.44 E.R.A., leading the league in victories, innings (250 2/3), complete games (9) and shutouts (4). He faced 993 batters and walked only 30; the last pitcher to face that many while walking so few was Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1923.Halladay has led the league in innings four times, and said that statistic made him most proud.“As a starter, the games you finish are always nice, but to be able to go as deep as you can as consistently as possible is something all starting pitchers strive to do,” Halladay said.“Innings pitched, for me, is definitely something I take a lot of pride in, and it’s one of the stats I have a little bit of control over, by going out there and being aggressive. That’s always one that, going into the season, is a goal for me.”Halladay, who had never played in the postseason in 12 years with Toronto, just missed his ultimate goal of winning a championship. The Phillies fell two victories short of the World Series, losing to the Giants in the N.L. Championship Series. Halladay lost Game 1 and won Game 5, matched against Lincecum both times.Still, he said, the journey was more important than the result, and he raved about the experience in his new city. Halladay accepted a trade to the Phillies last December and immediately signed a three-year, $60 million contract extension through 2013, forgoing free agency.The ace he replaced, Cliff Lee, will probably sign a richer deal this winter, with Texas, the Yankees and others scrambling to outbid one another. But Halladay seems content in Philadelphia.“It’s a city that is very aware of what their team’s doing,” Halladay said. “I’m telling you, it’s one of the greatest places I ever could have played. The people are always great to you.”Of course, when a player performs the way Halladay did, he can win over even the most hardened sports fans.'"
"'10-11-17,'0','Also, the new debt costs more than the original package. Back then, Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan Chase engineered a cheap securitization of franchise royalty fees that was backed by Ambac, the long-since-hobbled bond insurer that finally filed for bankruptcy last week. Dunkin’s interest bill looks sure to be several times higher than it was. That will leave the company less financial room to maneuver if performance softens.Of course, in an ultralow interest rate environment, debt investors and lenders are chasing yield, and riskier credits like Dunkin’ Brands provide more of that than safer instruments. But longer term, these particulars could present a health risk to creditors.When Ireland and Greece run big budget deficits, debt investors get angry. But when California says it will need more than $20 billion to balance its budget, bond buyers stay cool. The state is marketing $10 billion of short-term paper to big and small investors at interest rates that would make Dublin or Athens green with envy.Despite a municipal bond market that has suffered in recent days from heavy supply, California hopes to pay a yield of 1.5 percent or less on its new notes, roughly matching what it paid on similar debt last year. Demand is not as robust as it was then.But considering that the state legislature’s dithering over the last budget after lawmakers blew the deadline by 100 days, it is remarkable that investors haven’t been more demanding. After all, California’s fiscal woes are far from over. The state’s Legislative Analysts Office projects a $25.4 billion shortfall this year and next and chronic $20 billion gaps through 2016.Rising borrowing costs can snap legislators out of any complacency, but investors in California debt aren’t showing any sign of forcing yields sharply higher. That is partly because there is little reason to believe that the state will default.The state’s constitution mandates that investors in its long-term debt be paid before almost everyone else, the exception being the education system. It also has built-in flexibility to honor its short-term commitments. With debt service costs expected to peak below 10 percent of revenue, California should not have to stretch to stay current on its interest payments.That means buy-and-hold investors — a good portion of municipal bond buyers — can feel comfortable donning their earplugs when talk of bankruptcy and default inevitably re-emerges around California’s budget negotiations. Investors in local municipal debt, however, cannot afford to be so sanguine. Counties, for example, are heavily dependent on state financing. Any cuts from Sacramento could put them on shakier ground.There are limits to investors’ patience. If California were to lose its top-notch ratings for short-term debt, for example, money market funds — big buyers of such debt — would have to stop loading up. For now, though, voters and taxpayers will have to whip state government into shape. The bond market isn’t likely to help them much.'"

"'10-11-17,'0','What’s more, said Mr. Kappenman, while the power industry has spent billions of dollars to “harden” systems against hurricanes, blizzards and other Earth-based storms, “from the standpoint of space weather, I would argue that we have just not understood the threat.”While grids in higher latitudes are especially vulnerable, the growth of the transmission network in the United States, which now includes about 200,000 miles of high-voltage lines, has increased the risk that a severe storm here will cause crippling damage. “The larger you make the grid, the larger it acts like an antenna to disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field,” said Mr. Kappenman, who served on a committee that produced a report on the risks for the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.Higher-transmission voltages — favored by utilities because they result in lower energy losses — have also made grids more susceptible to damage from solar storms, said Sean Eagleton, a section manager for engineering with Con Edison, the New York-area utility company. “Engineers are involved in tradeoffs,” he said. “In the process of making the system more efficient, they make it more vulnerable.”But given the social and economic havoc that a blackout of months could wreak, engineers and scientists are starting to look more closely at the threat from a severe geomagnetic storm. Efforts are under way to improve forecasting, to give utilities more precise information about when and where a solar storm will hit and how severe the impact will be, so that grid operators can take defensive measures. And utilities and researchers are working to devise equipment and procedures to better enable transmission systems to ride out a major event.Economics are a big issue, Mr. van der Zel said, and the costs of retrofitting hundreds or thousands of high-voltage transformers, for example, would need to be analyzed.“The end goal is to have a risk assessment and a mitigation methodology,” he added. “It’s a complex issue. It’s not like many other risks that utilities deal with.”A geomagnetic storm begins with an enormous burst of electrically charged gas, or plasma, from the sun. The gas travels very quickly — on the order of a million miles an hour or faster — and if it happens to be aimed at Earth, can reach the planet in as little as a day.Then, strange things happen to the Earth’s orderly magnetic field. It begins to fluctuate, creating differing electric potentials on the Earth’s surface. From this point, a simple law of electricity follows: If the potential at one end of a transmission line is higher than the potential at the other end, dozens or even hundreds of miles away, a current will flow through the line.It is these currents that can cause problems. They are so different from the normal currents in high-voltage lines that they interfere with the operation of the transformers — the voltage boosters or reducers — that are an essential part of the grid. Transformers can overheat and become damaged, or develop other problems that can cause switches within the system to trip automatically. Voltage throughout the grid can begin to drop, and unless more power can be quickly brought online — either by starting up more generators or shunting it from another system — the grid can collapse.That’s what happened in Quebec in 1989, and it took only 92 seconds. Fortunately most of the transformers were not permanently affected.But in a much more severe storm — similar to one that occurred in 1859, when other than telegraphs there was little electrical equipment to be damaged — transformers may be destroyed or become otherwise inoperable. These are not off-the-shelf products: a typical high-voltage transformer can weigh several hundred tons and is designed and built (at a cost of up to $10 million or more) for a particular installation. So it may take months to replace them.That’s why Mr. Kappenman and others are working on ways to keep geomagnetically induced currents out of transmission lines to begin with. A device called a capacitor could be installed near each vulnerable transformer to effectively block currents from entering the transmission lines.Capacitors are usually fairly small — the ones on the circuit board inside a typical radio are usually smaller than a fingertip. But in transmission systems, the equipment would be roughly the size of a washing machine, and the capacitors would need to be able to be bypassed in a fraction of a second to allow conventional currents through.“That makes for an active device, one that looks at what current is flowing and makes decisions in real time,” Mr. van der Zel said. “That’s a lot more expensive than a passive device.”Mr. Kappenman estimated that in the United States alone, about 5,000 vulnerable transformers would have to be retrofitted, at a cost of perhaps $100,000 each, plus installation. It would make little sense to retrofit only a few transformers; the rogue currents created by an extreme solar storm could flow here and there throughout the grid, damaging unprotected equipment.Mr. Eagleton said Con Edison had been working with Mr. Kappenman and others and planned to test blocking devices on a few transformers. The utility already has some current-blocking experience, he said: it has to keep the current used in New York’s subways, which is in some ways similar to those created by a solar storm, out of the regular transmission lines.Mr. Eagleton said Con Edison had also worked with transformer manufacturers on design issues. With the difficulties of transporting and installing equipment in the New York City area, the utility at one time had ordered shorter transformers, so that they would fit under bridges and be otherwise easier to handle. “But now we’ve moved to a design that’s a little taller, and a little less vulnerable to geomagnetic disturbance,” he said.No one is really certain, however, how a redesigned or retrofitted transformer will perform in a severe storm. “Unfortunately, the only way to know is to experience it,” Mr. Eagleton said.But more thorough research can help, Mr. van der Zel said. “If we had a very, very large storm, would the entire grid collapse? The answer is we don’t really know, because we don’t have a very accurate complete network analysis. That is something that’s desirable.”More immediate, and less costly, help can come in the form of better forecasting. At NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., Antti Pulkkinen and other researchers are working to do that, running data from sun-sensing satellites in simulations that are more and more sophisticated. The project, called Solar Shield, is still experimental, but as the models are refined, Mr. Pulkkinen said, it should become fully operational within the next few years.With it, he said, “we can calculate exactly when this thing is going to happen and what is going to happen.” Extremely precise information about a storm that is about to hit would give grid operators time to take measures to add redundancy to their systems — like putting transmission lines that had been shut down for maintenance back on line, or preparing idle generators to start up again.In the worst case, Mr. Pulkkinen said, operators might even decide to power down their systems completely, thinking that a brief, deliberate shutdown was a far better outcome than a long blackout.Mr. Pulkkinen said two developments were helping to improve the forecasts: more and better data from satellites, and improved processing ability. “To run these large-scale space simulations, you need a lot of horsepower from your computers,” he said, adding that “we are now for the first time applying physics-based models to forecast the impact of solar activities on the power grid.”Mr. Eagleton, of Con Edison, said forecasting had something else going for it as well. “One thing about the sun being 93 million miles away,” he said, “it gives you some time.”'"
"'10-11-17,'0','United States monetary policy has already caused the dollar to drop in value this year against most other major currencies. But the dollar’s value has fallen only modestly against the renminbi. That is because Beijing has kept the renminbi artificially low by pegging it to the dollar — instead of letting it float to its market level, as most other global currencies do.Beijing’s critics say the artificially low renminbi, by making Chinese exports cheaper than they otherwise might be, has helped China run up its huge trade surplus with the United States and much of the rest of the world.At the Group of 20 summit meeting in Seoul, South Korea, last week, President Obama chided China on its currency policy, calling for Beijing to “act in a responsible fashion internationally” and saying the undervalued renminbi was “an irritant to a lot of China’s trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world.”Beijing countered that between 2005 and 2008, when the value of the renminbi rose by about 20 percent against the dollar, it had little braking effect on the soaring United States trade deficit with China. Chinese officials say Washington is simply searching for a scapegoat.“China will do its best to manage its economy, and never blame others for its own problems,” China’s president, Hu Jintao, said on his way to the Seoul meeting.Big American multinational manufacturing companies can feel the pinch of dollar-renminbi fluctuations. In many cases, though, they have set up operations in China and elsewhere that let them hedge by doing business in local currencies.But currency exchange rates are a much bigger factor for the many small and midsize American companies that still manufacture on shore, like Staco. They tend to embrace a dollar policy that would make their export prices lower.Meanwhile, the American companies most likely to oppose Washington’s currency fight with Beijing are businesses like PS Brands — Wal-Mart would be another good example — that get their goods from China and sell them in the United States. Those companies’ balance sheets are likely to suffer, and American consumers more likely to feel the effect, when the cost goes up on Chinese imports — whether socks, sofas or smartphones.What often gets lost in the heated rhetoric, though, is that American and Chinese officials actually agree in principle that more balanced trade is healthier for the global economy. Where they diverge is on how fast to get there.The Obama administration wants fast action because it worries that the growing United States trade deficit will continue to threaten jobs and economic growth. But Chinese officials worry that letting the renminbi rise too quickly would bankrupt coastal factories that price their goods in dollars and that already operate on thin profit margins, destroying tens of millions of jobs.As a result, Beijing has allowed the renminbi to rise against the dollar only moderately, by about 3 percent this year. China’s critics say it needs to rise by as much as 20 percent more.The challenges to both sides are evident here in the city of Zhuji, two hours south of Shanghai, where Mr. Levy arrived recently to negotiate the purchase of about $1 million worth of socks.PS Brand, which had $58 million in revenue last year, is a private company with 35 employees. Its Chinese supplier is Shuangjin Knitting and Textile, which operates a 300,000-square-foot factory here that will produce about 43 million pairs of socks this year. Dealers like PS Brands distribute those socks to customers like Wal-Mart, Adidas and Disney.On the crisp, autumn day of Mr. Levy’s visit, about 75 workers were busy stitching, sorting and packaging thousands of socks headed for America, including labels featuring the cartoon character Dora the Explorer.The factory’s boss, a friendly, 41-year-old entrepreneur named Yang Tiefeng, boasts that he has sock manufacturing down to a science. His facility can churn out 5,000 pairs of socks every hour at a cost of about 25 cents a pair, he says, which at current exchange rates still leaves him a tiny profit.Analysts say those socks retail in the United States for about $2.99, with the difference divided among shippers, middlemen, marketers and the retailer.But even without the currency fight, the economics of sock-making here are shifting. This year, labor shortages in China’s booming coastal factory towns have pushed up factory wages. And skyrocketing cotton prices, propelled by bad weather in cotton-producing regions, have been an even sharper blow.During a tour of his factory last week, Mr. Yang said the prospect of a strengthening renminbi and a weakening dollar would create more hardship. Most Chinese factories sign long-term contracts in dollars; and if the dollar slides, factories here lose.Not surprisingly, Shuangjin’s recent negotiation with PS Brands, its biggest American customer, was tense. Mr. Levy warned that big retailers back home were pressing him to hold down costs in China because of weak spending by American consumers. Mr. Yang countered that he was strained by the soaring cotton prices.After the talks ended, Mr. Yang walked into a conference room and exhaled. He declined to divulge details, saying only that a deal had been struck.“That was tough,” he said, noting that currency was a major sticking point. “I told my clients today, ‘If you want to order, do it today, because if you wait the price will be different.’ ”One thing Mr. Levy and Mr. Yang agree about: it is only a matter of time before pricing pressures in factories like Shuangjin’s result in higher consumer prices for Americans.The mood is distinctly different at Staco Systems’ factory in Irvine, where Staco is building airplane cockpit gear for a state-owned Chinese company named Avic.The United States long ago surrendered most low-skill manufacturing and assembly to China. But many higher-technology components, like microchips and specialized tools, are still made in the United States.At Staco’s factory, workers blend precious metals, like gold and silver, with complex plastics to create buttons and switches for plane makers like Boeing and Airbus. The switches, which must be durable enough to withstand military demands and have special optics for all types of lighting conditions, are often priced as high as $500 each.In the last two years Staco has expanded its payroll, to about 100 employees now, and it is selling to China’s fast-growing aviation industry. And with the dollar’s value declining against other currencies, Chinese buyers can afford more of Staco’s gear, as its prices are increasingly competitive with European companies’ products. “China will be our fastest-growing market over the next few years,” said Jason Childs, vice president for sales and marketing at Staco Systems, which is privately held and had revenue of about $20 million last year.That, in microcosm, is what American officials want from a stronger renminbi relative to the dollar: more exports and job creation.But Mr. Levy at PS Brands says the rise of the renminbi is going to have cruel side effects: job losses in America’s retail sector and higher prices for consumers.“This is hurting the U.S. consumer who can afford it the least,” Mr. Levy said. “If people are struggling, how are they going to pay more for socks?”'"
"'10-11-17,'0','A new Constitution, passed last year, sets up a bicameral national Parliament, 14 regional parliaments, a president, a cabinet and new government institutions that will give military rule a much more complex form.All but the very senior members of the military junta were required to resign to run for office as civilians and were replaced by a younger generation of officers in their 50s whose personal agendas could conflict with those of the senior officers.“It’s not the same environment that existed when she was taken into detention seven years ago,” said Priscilla Clapp, the former chief of mission in the American Embassy in Myanmar and a principal adviser to the Asia Society task force on United States policy toward Burma/Myanmar.“She has come out into a different world, and I think she is trying to feel her way into it,” Ms. Clapp said.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi’s mandate is precarious, built purely on the gauge of an applause meter, without an organized base or formal platform to ground her. Her party, the National League for Democracy, was forced to disband when it declined to contest the elections.On Tuesday, she made her first trip into downtown Yangon, formerly Rangoon, to file papers with the country’s High Court asking to have her party reinstated, but analysts said the court was unlikely to rule in her favor.While Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has moved cautiously so far, some analysts said they did not expect this spirit of compromise to last. “She’s always been confrontational, every time she has gotten out,” said David I. Steinberg, a professor of Asian studies at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, in an interview. “She has always tested the limits of how far she can go. I feel sure she’ll try to quietly test the limits of what she can do.”She had been released twice before, in 1995 and in 2002, and both times she reached that limit. The outpouring of support for her was too much for the generals, and she was arrested and returned to detention.Now 65, she has been under house arrest for 15 of the past 21 years.Some people are asking not only what she might be able to accomplish now that she is free, but also how long she might remain free. She was returned to house arrest in 2003 after an attack by organized thugs on her motorcade that some people say was an assassination attempt.“This is not an ordinary military dictatorship we are talking about,” said Bertil Lintner, the author of seven books on Myanmar. “This is a military that has become expert at staying in power.”The liberation of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi says nothing about the broader motives of the military junta, Mr. Lintner said. “It’s a public relations exercise for foreign opinion after a totally fraudulent election, rather than part of political reform, which it’s not.”The generals may see this as a moment of national redefinition, within the boundaries they set.Along with establishing the new Parliament, they have moved into a new capital and decreed a new flag, a new national anthem and a new name for their nation: the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (formerly the Union of Myanmar).“I don’t think there’s a place for Aung San Suu Kyi in that new state that the military has created,” Mr. Lintner said.Although the bottom line of military control remains unchanged, this is a nation in some flux as it sets up its first civilian government since a 1962 coup and as the military enters a period of generational change.“She has to maneuver among all of these difficult transitional questions,” Ms. Clapp said. “The country is in the middle of a transition the likes of which it has not seen for a long time. There are many different outcomes, so I think she’s going to be very careful.”'"
"'10-11-17,'0','Airbus officials said their top executives were divided about what to do and planned to decide soon. Most analysts say they think Airbus will install the new engines and streamline the A320 by 2015 to take sales from Boeing while it is working out its new design.But with oil prices back above $80 a barrel, airline executives say that they had hoped to hear cheerier news about faster solutions.The 737s and A320s, which each typically seat 150 to 180 people, have formed the backbone of the air travel system for decades. More than 10,000 of them shuttle passengers between major airports within the United States and other continents.But in terms of fuel economy, “we haven’t seen substantial improvements since the 1990s,” said Michael G. Van de Ven, the chief operating officer of Southwest Airlines, one of Boeing’s biggest customers.And with ticket prices rising, he said, “If there is one single thing that you can do to improve the economics in this industry, that is to introduce a new airplane.”Boeing and Airbus say they are under too much financial strain from delays on the larger planes to jump right into designing a new jet, which could cost $7 billion to $10 billion.Mr. Albaugh, the Boeing executive, said that given the choice of new engines in five years or a whole new plane in 10, most airlines would prefer to wait.While the engines could help cut the operating costs for a new plane by 15 percent, he said, modifications and other costs in adding them to the 737s could reduce the total savings to less than 5 percent.“A lot of people will say, ‘Yeah, go re-engine the plane,’ ” Mr. Albaugh said. “But the second question is, Would you buy it?”Airbus could save even more in a plane’s total operating costs — analysts estimate 7 to 10 percent — by using the new engines and taking other steps to streamline the A320.But top Airbus officials said last month that they were concerned about whether they had enough engineers to handle all the work in front of them.The companies’ ambivalence about installing new engines on the existing planes — which is essentially a stopgap measure — also illustrates how “the great Airbus-Boeing game is changing,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group, an aviation consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.While dominating the market for large commercial planes over the last two decades, the two companies have loved nothing more than to leapfrog each other with bold technological advances.But even as the demand for new planes bounces back from the recession, both are finding themselves hamstrung by the need to solve their production problems, Mr. Aboulafia said.Boeing is nearly three years late in delivering its most important plane, the 787 Dreamliner, the first jetliner made substantially of lightweight carbon composites that are also supposed to slash fuel costs. A fire on a test flight last week reinforced expectations among analysts for further delays in its first deliveries next year.Airbus said last week that it was pushing the delivery date for the A350 XWB, its answer to the Dreamliner, to late 2013 from mid-2013. Airbus might have to make more changes in its A380 jumbo jet after debris spewed from an engine during a Qantas Airways flight on Nov. 4.Boeing and Airbus also have to worry about new competitors from Canada, China and Russia. They are taking advantage of the new engine technologies to design planes that could cut into the sales of 737s and A320s over the next few years.The new engines are being developed by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, and CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and Snecma of France. Pratt & Whitney’s would have a huge fan and an advanced gear box to provide thrust with less fuel. CFM’s rival engine would have improvements in its core to provide similar gains.The first plane maker to offer Pratt & Whitney’s engine will be Bombardier of Canada, which is designing jets that could carry 100 to 130 passengers. It estimates that by combining the new engines with lightweight composite wings, it could cut operating costs by 15 percent from today’s levels.Chinese and Russian companies are designing planes that can seat at least 160 people. The Chinese firm, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, announced on Tuesday that it had received the first orders for its plane, which would use CFM’s engine.Bombardier hopes to have its first jet ready by 2013, while the Chinese and Russian ventures are aiming for 2016.But given the problems that Boeing and Airbus have had in building new planes, analysts say, those delivery dates could easily slip. And some of the newcomers may find that it is harder than they think to build quality planes.“I don’t think that all the people who have aspirations will be successful,” Mr. Albaugh, the Boeing executive, said. “But I think that one or two of them possibly could.”Boeing and Airbus recently stepped up production of the 737s and the A320s, both to generate cash and to meet as much of the demand as they can.Southwest Airlines, Ryanair and Delta Air Lines have all spoken publicly in favor of re-engined aircraft. But unless a consensus emerges behind that option, Mr. Albaugh said, Boeing plans to continue with more incremental changes that could save an extra 2 percent in operating the 737.Airbus officials said their marketing executives wanted to go ahead with the new engine if the questions about engineering resources could be resolved. Mr. Aboulafia, the Teal Group analyst, said Airbus “could be losing an opportunity” if it did not install the new engines on the A320.He said the A320 was not as fuel-efficient now as the 737, and the new engines could tilt that equation in Airbus’s favor. Airbus, he said, could then take a significant number of sales from Boeing before Boeing’s new single-aisle plane entered the market by the end of the decade.Mr. Aboulafia added that Airbus also faced a slightly bigger threat in the short run from the new firms entering the market, with both Bombardier and the Chinese company aiming mostly at Airbus customers for their initial orders.“They have a carrot and a stick,” Mr. Aboulafia said, referring to Airbus officials. “And they’re just sitting there, not grabbing the carrot and being hit by the stick.”'"
"'10-11-17,'0','On Tuesday, seven and a half years and 10 billion downloads after Apple opened its iTunes store, the Beatles’ 13 original albums, along with three compilations and a box set, went on sale: individual tracks cost $1.29, single albums $12.99, doubles (like the White Album) $19.99, and the box set $149.99. Each package includes video documentaries, and the box adds “Live at the Washington Coliseum, 1964,” a film of the band’s first concert in the United States.“We’re really excited to bring the Beatles’ music to iTunes,” Paul McCartney said in a news release. “It’s fantastic to see the songs we originally released on vinyl receive as much love in the digital world as they did the first time around.”Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but in standard agreements with Apple a label collects about 70 percent of the sale price, and pays royalties out of that share. One beneficiary of Beatles sales would be the estate of Michael Jackson, which owns half of the Sony/ATV catalog, the publisher of most Beatles songs; the publisher would most likely collect about 9 cents on each song.After the announcement, the music industry was buzzing with theories of what took so long. Apple Corps had settled its latest trademark suit against Apple Inc. only in 2007, for example, and only last year did iTunes begin selling songs for more than 99 cents.But the simplest explanation might just be new management at EMI and Apple Corps.Mr. Faxon, 62, had been head of EMI’s profitable publishing unit before taking command of the recording division, as well, in a company reorganization in June. A digital deal for the Beatles was one of his first orders of business.“It may seem serendipitous,” Mr. Faxon said of the timing of the iTunes deal, “but I think the time had come for the Beatles to go digital.” However, Mr. Faxon strongly denied the theory that EMI’s debt situation motivated it to cut a deal.Mr. Jones, 54, is also somewhat new to the Beatles table. He took over Apple Corps in 2007, replacing Neil Aspinall, a childhood friend of Paul McCartney and George Harrison who had been a Beatles principal for decades and was sometimes blamed for the slow pace of Beatles projects. (Mr. Aspinall died in 2008.)As the longtime head of Sony’s reissue imprint, Legacy, Mr. Jones worked on major reissue campaigns of music by Bob Dylan, Miles Davis and others. People who have worked with Mr. Jones describe him as a talented executive who understands how to tastefully and profitably exploit valuable music catalogs.“Jeff is expert at blending pragmatism with a creative and marketing flow,” said Paul DeGooyer, a senior vice president at MTV Networks who was an executive producer of The Beatles: Rock Band. “He just knows instinctively how it should look, how it should be presented to the consumer.”Within hours of their release, the Beatles’ digital albums began to shoot up the iTunes sales charts. By late afternoon “Abbey Road” was No. 12. But many analysts and industry observers were already asking whether the Beatles’ entry into downloading had simply come too late to cause a revolution.“I wonder if it’s just so late to the party that it becomes kind of a nonevent,” said Russ Crupnick, an analyst with the marketing research company NPD Group. “It you’re a real Beatles fan, would you have lost patience a couple of years ago and simply ripped your albums to your iPod?”'"
"'10-11-17,'0','Then late last month, Mr. Christie, a Republican, withdrew his state’s support for the project. While transportation advocates wrung their hands over a decision that they called short-sighted, Ms. Moore and the operators of dozens of other small businesses rejoiced. The budget crises caused by the recession had spared them from the wrecking balls of progress. (A new proposal to extend the No. 7 subway line to New Jersey would not displace Ms. Moore and the other tenants in the area.)“It was complete elation, not only on my part, but on the part of my customers,” said Tom Dwyer, whose family has run the Blarney Rock pub on West 33rd Street for four decades. “It was as if I’d won the lottery.”Mr. Dwyer said he doubted he could find another spot that would be convenient to his clientele, a mix of commuters, blue-collar workers and fans on their way to Madison Square Garden. Plus, he said, the Port Authority was offering to pay only the value of the fixtures in the bar, not for his lost business or the cost of outfitting a 21st-century tavern.“Can you imagine trying to move a 41-year-old bar piece by piece?” Mr. Dwyer said.The thought of it had left him thinking unkind thoughts about the state officials across the river. But that is all water under the George Washington Bridge now that the tunnel is dead. Governor Christie, he said, is welcome to elbow his way into the Blarney Rock any time.“He hasn’t stopped in yet,” Mr. Dwyer said, “but there’s a pint waiting for him.”Ms. Moore said the tunnel’s end prompted her first-ever hug with the manager of her building, who had been advising tenants not to cooperate with the Port Authority. She said she had been trying to prepare for the uprooting of her business and found herself throwing away supplies that she otherwise might have kept.“I’d think, well, I’m going to be moving anyway,” she said.Another tenant in the building, Mina Mann, who designs silk wraps for women, moved out at the end of September after being told that eviction was inevitable. She found space she likes better on 38th Street but said she was paying much more for it and had not fully recovered from the move. “Moving is a nightmare,” Ms. Mann said, sounding a bit wistful.For Ms. Moore, timing was an essential worry. She makes hats that women wear to the Kentucky Derby and other prestigious horse races, which keeps her running without a break from January through June.“Who wants to be forced to make a decision on somebody else’s time frame?” she said. Beyond that, she added, “I wanted to milk the great rent as long as possible.”As for more silver lining, Ms. Moore has already identified another benefit that emerged from the anxiety about being pushed out. Now, she said, there is more of a community feel among her neighbors and the people who work around them.“All the U.P.S. guys, they know me when I walk down the street,” she said. “It’s a recognition of the fact that you’ve been here for a long time.”'"
"'10-11-17,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — Wholesale prices rose in October for the fourth consecutive month because of higher gasoline costs, but there was little sign of inflation as the cost of food, cars and computers all fell.The Labor Department said Tuesday that the Producer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month, the same increase as in September and August. Wall Street analysts had expected a larger increase. The index is up by 4.3 percent in the past 12 months.But excluding the volatile food and energy categories, the so-called core index fell by 0.6 percent, the most in more than four years. That decline was driven by falling prices for new cars and trucks.The report, which measures prices on goods before they reach the consumer, showed that companies have little ability to pass on the higher costs they are paying for grains and other commodities. Food prices fell slightly, confounding economists’ expectations that they would rise due to higher costs for corn, soybeans and sugar.The drop in the core index was largely a result of lower prices for new cars and pickup trucks. Car prices fell by a seasonally adjusted 3 percent, the department said, and pickup truck prices fell by 4.3 percent. Both were the biggest drops in about four years.The department incorporates the price impact of the new model cars that automakers introduce each year in the October index. New car prices rose last month, but by less than in previous years. Under the department’s seasonal adjustment process, that translates into a lower price.Consumers responded by purchasing carsat the healthiest pace since the cash-for-clunkers program in August 2009. Sales at auto dealerships rose by 5 percent in October, the Commerce Department said Monday.'"

On both occasions, the documents were provided in advance to The New York Times, The Guardian of Britain and the German magazine Der Spiegel, which all published extensive articles on the insights the documents provided into the United States’ conduct of the two wars.The Obama administration condemned both leaks, and demanded that WikiLeaks return all secret American documents and commit to not publishing any more. The Pentagon and the Justice Department are investigating the leaks.The investigation into the rape accusations, which began in August, has been marked by a baffling on-again-off-again process that featured disagreements among the prosecutors, who issued an initial arrest warrant for Mr. Assange and then quickly withdrew it. From an undisclosed hideaway in northern Sweden, Mr. Assange rejected the accusations against him in newspaper interviews, e-mails and statements on Facebook and Twitter, but he delayed returning to Stockholm to meet with investigators.Mr. Assange described the accusations as “dirty tricks” and implied that he had been caught in a politically motivated conspiracy to discredit him and WikiLeaks. The two women who made the accusations had initially been strong supporters of Mr. Assange. They joined the prosecutors in saying that politics had nothing to do with it.According to accounts the women gave to the police and friends, they each had consensual sexual encounters with Mr. Assange that became nonconsensual. One woman said that Mr. Assange had ignored her appeals to stop after a condom broke. The other woman said that she and Mr. Assange had begun a sexual encounter using a condom, but that Mr. Assange did not comply with her appeals to stop when it was no longer in use. Mr. Assange has questioned the veracity of those accounts.He had traveled to Sweden in search of a secure base under the country’s broad press freedom laws, but that effort faltered amid the sexual accusations, and Sweden’s immigration board announced last month that it had rejected his request for residence. After six weeks, he left the country, saying he had the prosecutors’ permission to do so, and flew via Berlin to London.Mr. Stephens, Mr. Assange’s lawyer, said his client was in London as of Thursday morning. A woman who screens Mr. Assange’s cellphone calls said reporters should direct their inquiries on the case to Mr. Stephens.In a statement issued before the court ruling on Thursday, Ms. Ny, the prosecutor, said her office had been “unable to interrogate” Mr. Assange since the accusations became public.But that was denied at least obliquely by Mr. Stephens, who said in a statement that “over the last three months, despite numerous demands, neither Mr. Assange, nor his legal counsel, has received a single word in writing from the Swedish authorities relating to the allegations.”“Our client has always maintained his innocence,” he said. “The allegations against him are false and without basis. As a result of these false allegations and bizarre legal interpretations, our client now has his name and reputation besmirched.”Mr. Stephens, who has represented The Times in British libel cases, said Mr. Assange had offered repeatedly to make himself available to the prosecutors, “first in Sweden, and then in Britain (including at the Swedish Embassy), either in person or by telephone, videoconferencing or e-mail, and he has also offered to make a sworn statement on affidavit.”But Mr. Stephens said none of these offers had been taken up by the prosecutors. Speaking of Ms. Ny, he added: “What is her genuine concern? What is motivating her?”'"

"'10-11-18,'1','The Knicks (4-8) had not won a game since a Nov. 5 victory over Washington. The swoon spawned discontent among fans and a lot of ire directed at Coach Mike D’Antoni. The win provided a pressure release before the Knicks close out the trip with games against the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Clippes.“We’re finding our sea legs a little bit,” D’Antoni said. “This is just one little inch forward.”Tyreke Evans, the reigning rookie of the year, led the Kings with 23 points. Cousins, the fifth pick in the June draft, had 15 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. Carl Landry had 21 points and 9 rebounds.But the Knicks used a revived shooting performance (52 percent) and gritty defense to turn back several rallies and control the last three quarters.Danilo Gallinari had his most complete game of the season, scoring 27 points, including a career-high 16 free throws (on 17 attempts).Gallinari seemed to find himself in the Rockies late Tuesday night, when he followed perhaps his worst first half with an electric second half against the Denver Nuggets. The performance seemed to boost his confidence and calm his nerves.Gallinari hit a pair of 3-pointers in a critical second-quarter run, but he also diversified his game, finding driving lanes and chances to get to the line. Twice, he pump-faked near the arc to draw fouls, earning five free throws from those two plays alone.“I was just trying to be aggressive and smart at the same time,” said Gallinari, who went 4 for 8 from the field (3 for 5 at the arc).In some ways, the Knicks’ resurgence began with a strong second half in Denver the night before, when they turned a potential rout into a tight game. They showed a similar resilience Wednesday night, after falling behind by 15 points in the first quarter.“We know that it’s not easy,” Gallinari said. “When you lose all these games, it’s not easy to get out of these kind of moments. The only way to get out is to stay together and try to play our game and be concerned in our game.”Despite the six-game losing streak, there was no sign of despair, or any sense that the Knicks were ready to let the season slip away. They pushed the pace as consistently as they have in any game this season. They dove for loose balls. They did not settle for long jumpers.It was a steady offensive performance against one of the league’s weaker teams. The night started out much more ominously.The Knicks missed their first six shots and 18 of 23 in the first quarter and fell behind by 15 points. That inexplicable start (14 points in the first quarter) was followed by an equally astounding recovery (40 points in the second).The Knicks hit 9 of their first 12 shots in the second quarter, including 3-pointers from Gallinari, Bill Walker and Toney Douglas. Within minutes, the 15-point deficit had become a 5-point lead.After some hideous recent shooting performances, the Knicks found their 3-point strokes, and more of a conscience in taking them. They went 4 for 10 in the half, a marked improvement over the 3-for-19 first half that sank them in Denver a night earlier.D’Antoni also started a new center, inserting Ronny Turiaf in place of Timofey Mozgov. Turiaf is probably the Knicks’ best interior defender and certainly their most active big man. His presence kept the Knicks’ energy level high.Gradually, the rotation is taking shape and an identity is emerging.“They’re tough kids,” D’Antoni said, “and they’re not going to quit. I don’t think they’ll quit any games. There’ll be some bad games, there’ll be some low moments, as we’ve already had. But it’s not because they don’t care or they’re not going to battle. They’ll grind it.”Anthony Randolph did not play and appears to have fallen out of the rotation for now. With the Knicks struggling, Randolph’s mistake-prone play was deemed too great a risk. “I just told him right now this is all about the team, and I’ve got to go with my gut,” Mike D’Antoni said. “We’ll worry about individuals after we can get out of a hole a little bit.” The benching means that Randolph might not play against his former team, the Golden State Warriors, on Friday. “Things happen,” Randolph said. “It’s a long season, so you never know. I can become a part of it. We got a long way to go. But we got the win tonight, that’s all that matters.” ... Landry Fields’s 21-point, 17-rebound performance in Denver marked the most points and rebounds by a Knicks rookie since Patrick Ewing had 28 points and 20 rebounds against Atlanta on Nov. 16, 1985, exactly 25 years earlier.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','The State Senate president, Russell Pearce, a Republican who sponsored the law to encourage illegal immigrants to leave the state, dismissed the report as a fiction and said illegal immigrants were costing the state billions.“I get tired of this,” he said. “Arizona is not the bad guy. Arizona didn’t make illegal illegal. We’re enforcing the law.”The study focused only on the decline in convention bookings, not on the law’s effects on leisure travel, economic development or other areas. Up until now, the only estimate of how the law known as Senate Bill 1070 had affected conventions came from the Arizona Hotel and Lodging Association, which said in August that the state had lost at least 40 conventions and $15 million in lodging revenue.That was considered a lowball estimate, which the new study says was about a third of the actual losses so far. Other effects from conventions already canceled include 2,761 lost jobs, $86.5 million in lost earnings, $253 million in lost economic output and $9.4 million in lost tax revenues, the study found.The study estimates that the losses will only grow because large convention bookings typically occur several years in advance. The decline in business came at an awful time for Arizona’s hospitality industry, which endured a devastating year in 2009, with the economic downturn and the so-called A.I.G. effect, or controversy surrounding luxury corporate retreats.But the hotel association is cautiously optimistic that the controversy is ebbing. “The rhetoric has started to die down and some of the boycotts have been rescinded,” said Kristen Jarnagin, the hotel association’s vice president for communications. “We’re approaching peak season, and we’re beginning to hire a little bit.”Those hurt most of all by the boycotts and canceled business, Ms. Jarnagin said, have been hotel workers, many of them Hispanic, who have been laid off during the slow times.The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which represents 3,000 Hispanic-owned businesses across the country, opposed Arizona’s immigration approach but did not favor a boycott because of the disproportionate effect such sanctions would have on Latinos.“Not only are they insulted and abandoned by their state, but they could end up unemployed,” said Javier Palomarez, the chamber’s president and chief executive.But Mr. Palomarez did not agree that Arizona’s economic woes are behind it, despite the fact that a federal judge has blocked some of the law’s most controversial portions. “I don’t think anybody in the Hispanic community has forgotten this,” he said. “We’re very mindful of this legislation.”The National Minority Supplier Development Council said it had moved its fall conference, which was expected to bring 7,000 attendees to Phoenix last month, to Miami Beach. Similarly, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., the oldest black fraternity, relocated its July convention to Las Vegas.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','It has been dubbed “The War of the Misses” by the country’s tabloids and local newspapers, which cover the pageant world and Ms. de Fontenay with a reverent assiduousness. The conflict has been good for business, too; both pageants have been attracting record numbers to their regional contests.Half the country’s regional Miss committees have rallied to Ms. de Fontenay, and 28 regional “Miss Nationale” pageants are under way under her banner. A national winner will be crowned in December, one day after Endemol’s finale. (A plan to broadcast Ms. de Fontenay’s pageant on a regional television channel fell through; Endemol’s event is broadcast on TF1, the country’s most popular national station.)In some respects, Ms. de Fontenay’s crusade is a measure of the changes in French society since her arrival at Miss France in the 1950s. But, the thousands who have turned out at her pageants this year also reflect a moral conservatism and regional pride that remain stronger in the French “provinces” — a term widely employed here to mean “everywhere but Paris” — than is often recognized.“This is our France,” Ms. de Fontenay said of her pageants. “The France of the ‘terroir,’ of regional customs, of traditions. The one that, we say, still has values. It’s not the glitzy France of St.-Tropez, where there are half-naked girls being sprayed with Champagne at 10,000 euros a bottle! That’s not our France.”In Segré, the contestants were soberly attired — they wore one-piece swimsuits — and spectators uncorked a local bubbly, Saumur Brut, none of which was sprayed on anyone.Contestants sashayed onstage to offer their names, ages and interests. One young woman seemed to forget her lines; the audience filled the pause with cheers of encouragement.“I always wanted to be a princess,” announced Stéphanie Berthelet, an enthusiastic contestant. Ms. Berthelet, 20, is studying business management.Contestants and spectators said they were particularly thrilled to be in the presence of Ms. de Fontenay. “For me, Miss France means Geneviève de Fontenay,” said Marie Ballu, 19, another contestant. “We need to hold on to these kinds of things,” she said of Ms. de Fontenay’s contests. “They’re part of our heritage, and it would be a shame if they were lost over the years.”Ms. Ballu, like many others at the pageant, said Endemol had disgraced Miss France. But Endemol’s events are hardly carnivals of sin. They are, in fact, all but indistinguishable from Ms. de Fontenay’s (though bikinis are the swimwear of choice). The head of the Endemol competition, Sylvie Tellier, Miss France 2002, is herself Ms. de Fontenay’s former protégée and biographer.Though Ms. Tellier, 32, described Endemol’s contest as “about not allowing this young generation to forget what France is and the French values to which we’re attached,” she said that Ms. de Fontenay had been trying to “fight progress.”“I wouldn’t say she’s outdated, Geneviève, it’s a generational question,” Ms. Tellier said. She defended Endemol’s decision to hire Miss France contestants for reality shows, saying, “If it can let them make a bit of money, fill up their fridges, and have a bit more popularity, I don’t see what’s problematic about it.”The Endemol contest remains remarkably successful, organizers say. The televised finale, carried on TF1 since 1995, attracts among the channel’s largest audiences each year. Last year, for example, about 9.5 million people, or 15 percent of France’s population, watched the crowning of Miss France, more than twice the number of viewers for the Miss America pageant.“We know what the French like; this is easy,” Ms. Tellier said. “They love to eat. They love their country. They like seeing beautiful girls, well dressed, well made-up, well coiffed.”Ms. de Fontenay begged to differ. “One can’t imagine Miss France without Geneviève de Fontenay,” she said. “You know, no one asks Sylvie Tellier for her autograph; no one asks her for anything in the street. Me, I can’t take one step without people coming to ask to take photos with me, without people telling me: ‘Keep going! Don’t change anything! You’re right! We adore you!’ ”Georges Peltier, 77, had come to the Segré pageant in the company of his wife, Josette, 74. “We came because Geneviève de Fontenay represents decorum, she represents the French society of yesterday, a bit,” he said.Are her pageants perhaps a relic? “Things are always outdated for some people; for others they aren’t,” Mr. Peltier said.“This is France, it’s simple things,” he mused, but added, “The girls are pretty, one must admit; we’re also here for that.”'"
"'10-11-18,'1','WASHINGTON — In a divided vote, the panel created by Congress to investigate the causes of the financial crisis said on Wednesday that it would delay its report until the end of January because it had not completed its work. Its report was due by Dec. 15.“We want to make sure we can appropriately complete our ongoing investigations,” Phil Angelides, the chairman of the panel, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, said in an interview. “Our central mission is to get as many facts in front of the American people as possible. I will stand firm for that, and not let it be cut short.”Mr. Angelides said that the commission had already arranged for the report to be published by PublicAffairs, part of the Perseus Books Group, in print and electronic form. The commission also plans to publish the report and accompanying investigative materials on the Web.Since January, the commission has organized six hearings in Washington, four hearings in communities hard-hit by the economic downturn and an academic forum with finance experts. But the commission has been hobbled by staff turnover, internal clashes among commission members and limited resources. It has about 40 employees and was given an extra $1.8 million on top of its original $8 million budget.Of the 10 commissioners, the four who were appointed by Republicans voted against the delay.The four dissenters were Bill Thomas, a former congressman from California who is vice chairman of the commission; Keith Hennessey, a former aide to President George W. Bush; Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office; and Peter J. Wallison, who served in the Reagan administration.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','The administration had argued that saving G.M. was not just about one company, but about an entire web of businesses connected to its fortunes. On Wednesday, the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research released a study saying that government aid to G.M. and Chrysler saved more than 1.1 million jobs in 2009 and 314,000 jobs this year — the highest figure yet reported.Indeed, 17 months after G.M. entered bankruptcy protection, there has been a broader revival in the American car industry. People involved in the offering process, which was intended to be private, credited recent gains in Ford Motor’s share price as a boon to their own efforts. Largely seen as bloated and incapable of competing with nimbler foreign competitors as recently as last year, automakers like G.M. and Ford have turned around their operations by wringing greater efficiency and lower costs out of their work forces and operations.Investor demand during the company’s two-week global roadshow to promote the offering had proved so strong that administration officials and another major stakeholder, the United Automobile Workers union, elected to sell significantly more shares than planned. G.M. has raised $18.1 billion from selling common shares and $5 billion from preferred shares.The stock sale follows months of sometimes tough discussions between the company and the Treasury Department, led by officials like the former investment banker Ron Bloom, over how much stock to sell and at what price. For G.M., it has long been an important goal to rid itself of the “Government Motors” moniker it insists is hurting car sales.For the government, more complicated demands are in play. Its bailout of the automaker was premised not on making money, but on preserving jobs. Still, it is under pressure to minimize losses — or even to eke out a profit — by selling its shares at high enough prices. The government has already recovered more than $7.4 billion from G.M., including interest and dividends.Senior administration officials said on Wednesday evening that they had worked closely with G.M. and its underwriters in settling on the $33 price. The Treasury Department must now wait six months before it can sell more shares. People with direct knowledge of the matter, who were not authorized to discuss it, estimated that the government would make another significant sale of its holdings next year.There are reasons for both company and government officials to be confident. G.M., freed from much of its debt and overhead costs, became profitable this year and has earned $4.2 billion through the first three quarters. And although it jettisoned four of its eight brands in bankruptcy, the company managed to stabilize its United States market share at 19 percent and continue to invest in new vehicles.“Many of the critics believed it would never come out at all or it would come out wounded,” one senior administration official said on a conference call on Wednesday evening.Last summer, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., General Motors chief executive, said that he would prefer that the government sell off its stake in one shot. But the sheer size of the Treasury’s holdings made that impossible, according to the people involved in the process. Still, the administration’s viewpoint on how much to sell evolved, as it began to see an opportunity to exit its G.M. investment quickly while maximizing the profits from its stock sales.“The government began thinking more like a private equity firm,” said one banker involved in the process. (The current chief executive of G.M., Daniel F. Akerson, is a former executive of the private equity firm the Carlyle Group.)When the new G.M. begins trading on Thursday — under its old “GM” ticker on the New York Stock Exchange and “GMM” on the Toronto Stock Exchange — its shares will initially be held by a wide array of investors. (Shares of the old G.M. — the bad assets that were split off in bankruptcy as the Motors Liquidation Company — still trade for pennies, essentially worthless.)G.M. has also agreed to sell a 1 percent stake to SAIC Motor, a major partner of the company in China, according to some of the people with direct knowledge of the matter.The largest allocation of G.M. shares has been made to institutions representing American retail investors, these people said. The move was meant in part to blunt criticism that taxpayers would be cut off from what company and government officials insist was a potentially big rise in G.M. shares. (Several of the people involved in the offering said they expect to see a potential 10 to 20 percent jump in the share price on Thursday, typical for an initial offering.)Led by G.M.’s relatively new management team — Mr. Akerson has been chief executive for only three months — the company embarked on a two-week dash around the world to drum up interest in the company. Initially priced at $26 to $29 a share, G.M. stock got a rosier forecast as underwriters were overwhelmed with order requests, prompting the decision on Monday to raise the target to $32 to $33 a share, these people said.The offering’s unexpectedly high price may bolster the public standing of the underwriting banks, which have at times been at odds with the government in other matters. The underwriters, a huge group led by Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, with Bank of America and Citigroup also playing major roles, will not receive a big payday from the offering. The lead underwriters are set to receive roughly a fee of 0.75 percent, low by bankers’ standards, according to people with knowledge of the matter.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','At a time of such stunning inequality, should Congress put priority on spending $700 billion on extending the to those with incomes above $250,000 a year? Or should it extend unemployment benefits for Americans who otherwise will lose them beginning next month?One way to examine that decision is to put aside all ethical considerations and simply look at where dollars will do more to stimulate the economy. There the conclusion is clear: You get much more bang for the buck putting money in the hands of unemployed people because they will promptly spend it.In contrast, tax cuts for the wealthy are partly saved — that’s both basic economic theory and recent history — so they are much less effective in creating jobs. For example, Republicans would give the richest 0.1 percent of Americans an average tax cut of $370,000. Does anybody really think that those taxpayers are going to rush out and buy Porsches and yachts, start new businesses, and hire more groundskeepers and chauffeurs?In contrast, a study commissioned by the Labor Department during the Bush administration makes clear the job-creation power of unemployment benefits because that money is immediately spent. The study suggested that the current would have been 18 percent worse without unemployment and that this spending preserved 1.6 million jobs in each quarter.But there is also a larger question: What kind of a country do we aspire to be? Would we really want to be the kind of plutocracy where the richest 1 percent possesses more net worth than the bottom 90 percent?Oops! That’s already us. The top 1 percent of Americans owns 34 percent of America’s private net worth, according to figures compiled by the in Washington. The bottom 90 percent owns just 29 percent.That also means that the top 10 percent controls more than 70 percent of Americans’ total net worth.Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the who is one of the world’s leading experts on inequality, notes that for most of American history, income distribution was significantly more equal than today. And other capitalist countries do not suffer disparities as great as ours.“There has been an increase in inequality in most industrialized countries, but not as extreme as in the U.S.,” Professor Saez said.One of America’s greatest features has been its economic mobility, in contrast to ’s class system. This mobility may explain why many working-class Americans oppose inheritance taxes and high marginal tax rates. But researchers find that today this rags-to-riches intergenerational mobility is no more common in America than in Europe — and possibly less common.I’m appalled by our growing wealth gaps because in my travels I see what happens in dysfunctional countries where the rich just don’t care about those below the decks. The result is nations without a social fabric or sense of national unity. Huge concentrations of wealth corrode the soul of any nation.And then I see members of Congress in my own country who argue that it would be financially reckless to extend unemployment benefits during a terrible recession, yet they insist on granting $370,000 tax breaks to the richest Americans. I don’t know if that makes us a banana republic or a hedge fund republic, but it’s not healthy in any republic.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','Mrs. Clinton told Senate and House leaders on Wednesday that the administration was determined to get New Start approved, despite the surprise announcement Tuesday by Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the Republican point man on the issue, that he could not foresee a vote in the lame-duck session.She said she planned to contact Mr. Kyl in coming days.“I understand the concerns my former colleagues have about this treaty,” Mrs. Clinton said. “There’s a lot more outreach that needs to be done.”She has already lobbied Mr. Kyl twice, once in person and once by phone, teaming with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And it is not clear what else the White House can do to cajole him.The administration has pledged an additional $4.1 billion to modernize the nation’s nuclear weapons complex, on top of an existing $80 billion over 10 years. Mr. Kyl had sought the financing in return for not blocking the treaty, which reduces nuclear stockpiles in the United States and Russia.The senator ducked at least one chance to hear from Mrs. Clinton: he was a no-show at the breakfast, which drew Arizona’s other Republican senator, John McCain, and Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Both men spoke in favor of New Start.“We’ve all been schooled on what unanimous consent means in the Senate, and it’s been a painful lesson,” said Ellen O. Tauscher, the under secretary of state for arms control who was a seven-term representative from Northern California.Ms. Tauscher said that Mrs. Clinton, as a former elected official, had an inherent advantage in lobbying members of Congress. Her relationships, particularly with influential Republicans like Mr. McCain, are deep and genuine, and she has distanced herself from partisan battles in her nearly two years at the State Department.“Even in the last 20 months, when we were in the majority, I reached out to Republicans all the time,” Mrs. Clinton said.Certainly, she has lavished attention on former colleagues in both parties, calling to congratulate them on election victories, inviting them on trips and having lunches and dinners for them.She phoned Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, to congratulate him on his presumptive ascension to House speaker and Representative Mark Steven Kirk after his election as a Republican senator from Illinois. Each new member of Congress will receive a welcome kit from her office, with a letter from Mrs. Clinton and a copy of a new National Geographic documentary about her diplomacy.Of course, having held elective office is not a prerequisite for a secretary of state to be an effective lobbyist. James A. Baker III, the first President George Bush’s secretary of state, was a skilled operator on Capitol Hill, despite having no previous experience there.Mrs. Clinton also has help from Mr. Biden, a 36-year Senate veteran who still works his former colleagues assiduously, not to mention Mr. Obama himself. But her profile is bound to increase, analysts said, if only because of recent turnover among national-security officials and the likely departure next year of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates.“She has certainly got to play a more central role, simply because she is the most senior foreign policy person in the administration,” said David Rothkopf, a national-security expert who worked in the administration of President Bill Clinton.Mrs. Clinton has had a few notable victories. She brokered a last-minute compromise with House leaders on the Iran sanctions bill, which gives Mr. Obama a waiver to avoid penalizing companies in countries the United States believes are cooperating with United Nations sanctions against Iran.At a time of straitened finances, she won a modest budget increase for the United States Agency for International Development to send more civilians to Afghanistan and Pakistan. She used Wednesday’s breakfast to brief lawmakers about a soon-to-be-released State Department review of development policy.Persuading a Republican-controlled House to spend more on development will not be easy, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged.“There’s no doubt that despite Bob Gates’s and my best efforts, people are much more willing to go along with defense spending,” she said, recalling that the defense secretary had also called for the State Department to get more money.For the next few weeks, saving New Start will consume much of Mrs. Clinton’s time. On Thursday, she and Mr. Biden will keep the spotlight on the treaty, meeting Mr. Lugar, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a phalanx of former secretaries of state and defense, all supporters of the pact. Mr. Obama is expected to make a cameo appearance.Mrs. Clinton plans to delay a trip to a NATO summit meeting, and she scrapped plans to attend a conference afterward in St. Petersburg, Russia, on saving tigers, hosted by Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin.Any misgivings Mrs. Clinton may have about letting down Mr. Putin are likely to be outweighed by the administration’s fears about souring relations with all of Russia if the treaty is not ratified.Noting that the Russian government has cooperated with the United States on Iran and Afghanistan, she said, “This is also a treaty that is critical to our bilateral relationship with Russia.”'"
"'10-11-18,'1','Scavolini, the Italian kitchen manufacturer, chose New York City as the place to open its first American retail showroom, although homes here generally are not known for their large kitchens. “That’s true,” said Francesco Farina, chief executive officer of Scavolini USA. “But our products are very modular, so we can offer big kitchens for big houses, like the ones in Long Island, the Hamptons or New Jersey, and we can also offer urban kitchens.”The company, based in Pesaro, Italy, on the Adriatic, offers 40 different styles of kitchens, with 350 finish options for 500 cabinet doors (most are clean and modern, but there are a few traditional designs). Fifteen kitchen styles, such as Flux, above, by Giugiaro Design, are on display in the 10,000-square-foot SoHo showroom, designed by SpaCe Architects. There is also one fully functional kitchen: Crystal, by Karim Rashid, which will be used for cooking demonstrations. The showroom will also carry countertops and appliances from Miele, Wolf, Gaggenau, Smeg, Faber and Elica.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','Still, the latest tests could help calm the financial markets, which have been unsettled lately by concerns over the financial health of some European countries and the fragile United States economy. If the Fed is confident enough to allow banks to return capital to shareholders that they had been hoarding, it could be another sign of the financial industry’s rapid recovery.Assuming the tests go well, analysts expect lenders that are flush with capital to start raising their dividend payments or buying back large blocks of their shares in the first quarter. Bank of New York Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, and US Bancorp were among the big companies to express a preference for moving quickly on investor conference calls during the third quarter.But weaker banks might be sidelined from doing so for months, if not longer.Citigroup said that it would be in a position to consider raising its dividend, or more likely institute a stock repurchase program, in 2012; Bank of America remained vague about its timetable. The Federal Reserve said it expected any capital plans that imply a dividend ratio above 30 percent of after-tax net income to receive particularly close scrutiny.Several regional lenders — including Fifth Third Bank, KeyCorp, SunTrust Banks and Regions Financial — would be barred from raising their dividends. None of them has fully repaid their bailout money.As a result, the stress test could prompt those smaller institutions to pay back the government so they would not be disadvantaged by larger rivals. It may also cause other small banks to return the money quicker.“One of the hidden messages is that the government wants to get its money back as fast as it can,” said Gerard Cassidy, a veteran banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “This is a subtle way of telling the banks, ‘If you want to start paying dividends, pay us back first.’ ”The market for raising equity has not been as strong as in the spring of 2009. That could pose significant challenges for banks seeking to raise capital and return bailout money quickly.Fed officials appear to be using the stress tests to address a wide range of concerns. Regulators plan to test whether the banks can fully absorb losses over the next two years under a set of unspecified mild and adverse economic conditions. They also are expecting the banks to have sound estimates of additional risks, like exposure to mortgages they might be required to buy back. Also, the banks must outline how they plan to adapt to the new financial overhaul rules.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','But the real impact of anacetrapib on heart health will not be known until researchers conduct a much larger study looking into whether the drug can reduce the risk of heart attacks, coronary deaths and other heart problems, said Dr. Luciano Rossetti, the head of global scientific strategy at Merck Research Laboratories.The results “are promising and reassuring, but not conclusive,” Dr. Rossetti said in a phone interview. “That is why we are going forward with 30,000 patients in a very large outcomes trial.”Merck is spending £96 million — roughly $150 million — to sponsor the larger study, which is being coordinated by researchers at Oxford University and will not conclude before 2015, he said.Merck needs such outcomes data before it seeks approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market the drug, cardiologists said, because a similar experimental drug from Pfizer turned out to be problematic.In 2004, an early study of people taking that Pfizer drug, a CETP inhibitor called torcetrapib, reported that it could lower bad cholesterol and improve good cholesterol.But a large outcomes study later indicated that the drug increased the risk of death by 59 percent and of heart attacks by 25 percent. After spending more than $800 million to develop the drug, Pfizer ended development in 2006.Dr. Rossetti said Merck researchers closely examined the Pfizer drug to make sure there were no similar problems. Torcetrapib, for example, can increase levels of aldosterone, a hormone that can increase blood pressure, he said.But the new study reported no significant differences in change in blood pressure or in aldosterone levels between the anacetrapib and placebo groups.The study also reported that there were 16 major cardiac events — among them four deaths from cardiovascular causes — in the anacetrapib group compared to 21 major heart problems, including one cardiovascular-related death, in the placebo group. But the difference was not statistically significant, the study said. The anacetrapib group also underwent fewer operations, called revascularizations, to open an artery.Dr. Howard Weintraub, a cardiologist who is the clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at the NYU Langone Medical Center, said anacetrapib’s ability to increase good cholesterol was impressive. But he said cardiologists did not yet know whether artificially increasing good cholesterol levels automatically had a protective effect on the heart.Good cholesterol, Dr. Weintraub said, functions like a garbage truck, taking out the trash that is bad cholesterol. The quality, not just the amount, of that good cholesterol may be important for reducing the risk of heart problems, he said.But artificially increasing that good cholesterol with a drug may not have the same impact on the heart as naturally increasing it. Only the larger outcomes study on anacetrapib can answer the heart health question, he said.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','The Federal Trade Commission also took action against the four companies, warning that their marketing tactics might violate federal law and urging them to “take swift and appropriate steps to protect consumers.” This year, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether the drinks, with colorful packaging and flavors like watermelon, blue raspberry and lemon-lime, were intended to attract under-age drinkers.While the F.D.A. review dealt with more than two dozen makers of caffeinated alcoholic drinks, officials with the agency said they were taking action against only four for now because their products seemed to pose the biggest threat.The popularity of the drinks has exploded over the last few months, and there have been numerous reports of young people falling ill after drinking them. Four Loko came under particular scrutiny after students who drank it this fall at Ramapo College in Mahwah, N.J., and Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Wash., ended up in emergency rooms, some with high levels of alcohol poisoning. The drink has also been blamed for several deaths in the past several months.The F.D.A. announcement came a day after Phusion Projects, a five-year-old Chicago company, said it would stop putting caffeine in its drinks. The company’s founders said in a statement that they still believed it was safe to blend caffeine and alcohol, but wanted to cooperate with regulators.Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, the F.D.A.’s principal deputy commissioner, said he viewed that announcement as a positive step but needed more details about how and when the company would reformulate the drinks.Several states — including Michigan and Washington — banned the drinks on their own in recent weeks, and many more were considering similar action.The F.D.A. began reviewing the drinks a year ago, at the urging of 18 attorneys general. At issue was whether adding caffeine to alcoholic beverages was “generally regarded as safe,” an agency designation that requires accepted scientific evidence.The agency has never officially allowed manufacturers to add caffeine to alcohol. Under its regulations, soft drinks are the only beverages to which caffeine can be added, and only in concentrations of 200 parts per million or less.Although there is little research on the effects of mixing caffeine and alcohol, several studies have suggested that people get more intoxicated and engage in riskier behavior when they drink the combination beverages than when they drink alcohol alone.Ricardo Carvajal, a lawyer at Hyman, Phelps & McNamara in Washington and a former associate chief counsel at the F.D.A., said it was unusual for the F.D.A. and the F.T.C. to take joint action.“The liability risk goes up considerably once you have not one, but two federal agencies either stating or suggesting there are violations of federal law at work,” Mr. Carvajal said.The crackdown does not apply to caffeinated alcoholic drinks that do not come premixed, like a cocktail of Red Bull and vodka, but Mr. Carvajal said bars that served them could face heightened liability, too.“If I’m a bartender and I have been serving essentially concocted versions of this,” he said, “am I going to think a little more carefully about that now?”'"
"'10-11-18,'1','The 1,000-square-meter property is on a dead-end street that abuts a protected forest. It has a lawn with a decorative pond, as well as gardens.After a minor setback during the global financial crisis, the property market has seen a slight rebound recently, said Claude Lamboray, a research fellow at the Central Service for Statistics and Economic Studies, the national statistical institute of Luxembourg. According to the data, the average price of an apartment fell to 282,507 euros in 2009, a nearly 3 percent decrease from the prior year, when the average was 290,284 euros. As of the second quarter of 2010, however, the average apartment price rose to 294,644 euros.Because Luxembourg has limited land for developing, as well as a relatively strong economy, the market has been able to weather financial woes relatively well, says Sylvie Jacques, owner and director of Re/Max Luxembourg.In addition, many buyers are rushing to take advantage of a universal tax credit that is set to expire at the end of the year, said Pascal Feller, director of Immofocus, a Luxembourg real estate agency. Available since 2004, it applies in first-time-buyer transactions, offering tax credits of 20,000 euros for individuals and 40,000 for couples. As of next year, Mr. Feller said, it will most likely be available only to lower-income buyers.Despite the price rebound, however, the volume of transactions is down, said Guy Hanten, chief executive of ERA Luxembourg. “Many buyers are afraid to buy,” he said. “They are still scared that the market might drop once more.”In and near the city of Luxembourg, which has higher prices than the rest of the country, older two-bedroom apartments start at 290,000 euros, new construction at 410,000 euros, Mr. Hanten said. For a typical house — three to four bedrooms on a smaller plot — prices start at 650,000 euros, he said, adding that high-end houses in prime areas can sell for well over 1 million euros.This house is priced at 3.9 million euros because of its size and location one kilometer from the city center, Mr. Feller said.Forty percent of Luxembourg’s population is foreign, and that number rises to 66 percent within the city, Ms. Jacques said. As the headquarters for many European institutions, it has a large population of well-paid civil servants, she said. Buyers come from all over the world and from Europe, in particular, with French, German and Portuguese buyers among the most common.There are no restrictions on foreign ownership of property, Mr. Feller said. Buyers should estimate nearly 9 percent of the purchase price in closing costs; this includes a 6 percent registration tax, a 1.2 percent transcription tax, and notary fees of around 1.5 percent, he said.Mortgages are available to foreigners, though Luxembourg’s banks rarely offer fixed rates, Ms. Jacques said. At present, variable-rate mortgages cost around 2 percent, and financing of up to 80 percent is possible, she said.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','Q. Companies have been overwhelmed or even destroyed by running a Groupon special. How do you feel about that?A. I find it almost absurd that the biggest complaint people have been able to levy against Groupon is that it actually delivers too many customers. More than 95 percent of all Groupon merchants want to run another Groupon discount. There is no greater evidence of value than that.Q. There’s a study that indicates 42 percent of your customers wouldn’t run another promotion. What do you make of that?A. The study is flawed. They chose an absurdly small and incomplete sample set and their thesis is largely inaccurate. First of all, we conduct regular surveys and our merchants are overwhelmingly happy. Secondly, we have featured about 5,000 merchants more than once, which would never occur if they weren’t making money off Groupon.Q. Why have you decided to focus on social media with your investment fund?A. We think that the most disruptive business models will take advantage of that social graph over the next five to 10 years. Take travel as an example. You should be able to plan your entire trip online, invite your friends to come with you and even interact with other friends who have already been to that location. Those people will provide you with content that will augment your experience.Q. In what industries are you seeing similar changes?A. Think about the way most companies currently hire. You post a job and then get blind résumés in response. This should be a social experience. If you took everyone and asked them to list everyone they knew, you could create an enormous social graph of several million people. There’s no reason to hire people that we can’t learn something about through some connection of our personal network. There’s no site today that takes advantage of the social graph in this way, yet.A. LinkedIn does part of it. It’s a great example of a company that is leveraging the social graph to grow and deliver value.Q. What is it missing?A. The site is missing some of the key social features that make Facebook so compelling. The ability to quickly understand someone based on whom they know, what they share and what others think of them, for example. To me, no one has fully cracked the code on social recruiting yet.Q. Now that Lightbank exists, do you get inundated with business plans from entrepreneurs pitching ideas?A. Absolutely. We have already invested in seven companies and we have a goal of doing a new one about once a month. For example, we invested in Watermelon Express, which is a test-preparation company. Studying doesn’t have to happen in a silo. It can be a social experience. You can engage with your friends and family to find out the answer to a tough question or have someone explain it to you. You can also study anywhere you happen to be and on any device.Q. How is that a business?A. They sell test-preparation applications for devices like the iPhone.Q. What exactly do you want from a company with an idea to pitch?A. That’s a tough question. Typically we want passionate entrepreneurs who have a great idea. Beyond that, there is no exact formula that guides us to invest or not. Part of this is gut instinct and part of it is based on experience.Q. Do you think that every business needs to rethink what social media means to its future?A. Today, I think that every business is again in serious flux because of the rise of all these social tools. Take telemarketing sales, for example. Why would your business ever make a cold call again?A. Certainly businesses are using Facebook and Twitter to reach thousands of customers that historically they might have had to call or e-mail to reach. I think everything will begin with a person’s individual connection to the graph. That’s how small businesses will get customers, promote products and get feedback from their customers.A. Yes. Any business that is looking for new customers needs to understand the Internet and how to market their goods or services through it.Q. Do you understand why a lot of business owners get the willies when they hear the term social media? Do you have any advice for them?A. We just invested in a company called SproutSocial. If someone gets the willies, they should buy their product, which is designed to help people that don’t fully understand the social Web.Q. What does it do?A. SproutSocial creates a social media dashboard for businesses. It allows them to monitor their brand on the Web by monitoring things like tweets, reviews, blog posts and news. It helps businesses find their perfect customers by targeting the right buyers and those with influence while allowing them to manage their social contacts and connections. In essence, it’s a complete social customer relationship management tool for any business.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','BEFORE Duane Reade landed on Williamsburg’s shore, the trucker-hatted and ironically T-shirted drank cheap beer in cavernous spaces along North Eighth Street.One of those dives, Supreme Trading, reopened last month as the Brooklyn Winery, a woodsy winery with an even woodsier wine bar. Mesh hats and T-shirts have been replaced by Steven Alan shirts and talk of “mouth feel.”On a recent Friday night, the place was a sea of reclaimed wood, plaid shirts and jeggings. Upstairs, a group of women celebrated a birthday (“early 30s”) in comfortable armchairs, surrounded by vintage photographs. Downstairs, bearded men alternated between sips of Long Island chardonnay and crusty bread from the restaurant Radish. There wasn’t a PBR in sight. Not even a Pork Slap.THE PLACE In the heart of Williamsburg, about a minute from the Bedford Avenue subway station. Designed by WRK, Brooklyn Winery hits nearly every hipster industrial design trope: The wood is reclaimed from church pews, schools and World War II ammo boxes. The ceilings are tin and treated with saltwater. The wallpaper is 1940s. The tables are long and communal. Through a glass door, the winemaking equipment — four monumental shiny steel tanks — gives a comfortable working-chateau feel.THE CROWD Brooklynites on the tail end of youth, joined by freelancers-cum-oenophiles too old for dive bars, but not employed enough for yuppie-hood. Under low lights, women in cute Built by Wendy dresses flirt with men with artfully disheveled hair.GETTING IN This being Williamsburg, there’s neither doormen nor an explicit dress code. But as a rule, spread collars and khakis will get you dirty looks. Plaid and selvage denim will get you nods of recognition.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','Lincoln Center could have been forgiven if it had gone a little crazy in celebrating the reinstallation of the lovable Kuhn organ in the renovated Alice Tully Hall, now the only pipe organ in a major concert hall in New York. From the time of the instrument’s removal in 2006 until it was finally put back in place in recent months, fearful, not to say paranoid, organ fanciers greeted the center’s repeated assurances that the instrument would return in all its glory, and then some, with unalloyed skepticism.Now here it was, on Tuesday evening, restored and fitted out with the latest technology to make it more user friendly and give it greater sonic heft. But from the moment the inaugural concert was announced, with the young wizard Paul Jacobs playing the third book of Bach’s “Clavierübung” (“Keyboard Exercise”) as part of Lincoln Center’s new White Light Festival, it was clear that this would be a dignified affair. And if the choice of repertory — a single, daunting 100-minute work familiar in its entirety only to organ buffs and Bach devotees — was not an obvious one, it was in some ways ideal.As one of Bach’s great late compendiums, ranking alongside the B minor Mass, “The Art of Fugue” and “A Musical Offering” (and part of a larger compendium, the other books of the “Clavierübung” encompassing the six keyboard partitas, the “Italian Concerto” and “French Overture,” and the “Goldberg” Variations), the work merits broader exposure. And written, in Bach’s words, “for the refreshment of the spirit,” it meshed perfectly with the White Light Festival’s cause, spirituality in music.But as Bach also said, it was composed “for music lovers and for connoisseurs, in particular,” and it makes strenuous demands on both listener and performer. Written in 1739, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Luther’s visit to Leipzig (and Bach’s home church, St. Thomas), it consists mainly of chorale preludes, richly polyphonic elaborations on hymn tunes associated with the Lutheran catechism: 10 pairs of variations — one larger, using pedals; one smaller — with a lone additional variation thrown in. There are also four duets, today sometimes heard on piano. And all of this is framed by a grand Prelude and Fugue in E flat, a pairing that has independently achieved wide recognition (the fugue often being called the “St. Anne”).The chorale tunes would have been well known to Bach’s listeners. In a nice touch here the Lincoln Center programmers gave their motley modern congregation at least something to hang onto and varied the pacing and texture of a long evening by having the Clarion Choir, directed by Steven Fox, sing the appropriate chorale, most in Bach harmonizations, before each pair of variations.But the show was chiefly Mr. Jacobs’s, and he rose magnificently to the occasion. Nerves were inevitable, and playing from memory he ran off the track a couple of times in the heavy going of the opening prelude. Further slips were smaller and few, and Mr. Jacobs — who performed all of Bach’s organ works in a single marathon session of 18 hours to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the composer’s death in 2000 — seemed to gather strength and concentration as he proceeded.'"
"'10-11-18,'1','The Fed says the plan is to stimulate the economy, but it has encountered criticismthat it is setting the stage for future inflation.Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist with Miller Tabak & Company, said that the October data show that price declines are the main concern, and that despite intervention, Fed policy makers “have accomplished almost nothing in arresting the decline in prices throughout the economy.”But, he added, the criticism that the Fed could be “laying the groundwork” for inflation “may eventually be correct.”Economists for Goldman Sachs said in a research note that the latest consumer price data showed “broad-based disinflation” among the index’s components.“Today’s report underscores the reasons why the F.O.M.C. has decided to do large-scale asset purchases, as year-to-year core consumer inflation hit an all-time low while housing activity continued to languish,” the research note said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s policy makers.Many economists have said the Fed was correct to take such measures as long as the country was dealing with high unemployment of 9.6 percent and as the housing market was still weak. The slow pace of sales, an uncertain job market, difficulties obtaining financing and a glut of existing homes have added to bleak prospects for the housing sector.The Labor Department said gasoline prices rose 4.6 percent in October and accounted for almost 90 percent of the overall consumer price increase. It was the fourth consecutive month that gasoline prices have risen. The food index rose slightly, up 0.1 percent.Shelter and medical care costs also increased, but they were offset by declines in prices for a range of other items, including new vehicles, used cars and trucks, tobacco and clothing, the department said.On the housing front, the Commerce Department said new construction starts fell 11.7 percent to an annualized rate of 519,000 units, compared with a revised annual rate of 588,000 in September. The October pace was the weakest since April of last year, when the rate was 477,000 units.Kevin Logan, the chief United States economist for HSBC, noted that after federal tax subsidies for new home purchases ended six months ago, the pace of sales and starts has remained roughly unchanged.“The housing market continues to stagnate,” Mr. Logan said. “Low interest rates and quantitative easing have yet to give a significant boost to the housing sector,” he added.Another economist said the implications for the housing market were not as bad as the October numbers suggested, noting that new permits for building were a better gauge because they were less affected by seasons and better reflected the intentions and hopes of builders.Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight’s United States economist, noted that permits rose 0.5 percent in October after declining the previous month to a 17-month low. Permits for single-family homes in particular rose 1 percent, the first increase in that category in seven months.“Assuming credit markets continue to improve, the key for housing going forward is employment growth,” Mr. Newport said in a statement. “New jobs will require that new homes be built nearby.”'"
"'10-11-18,'1','But China’s leaders are now clearly worried about the inflationary side effects of those financial policies. The premier, Wen Jiabao, has toured southern China over the last week and was shown on national television late Tuesday night expressing concern about rising food prices and promising that the government would take action.Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, had said earlier on Tuesday that the amount of money racing through the global economy was putting pressure on emerging economies that want to control inflation. And Yao Jian, a commerce ministry spokesman, said at a press conference on Tuesday that the government would tighten scrutiny of foreign investment so as to prevent too much money from pouring into China as foreign investors seek higher returns than are currently available in the West.Imposing price controls and other administrative controls on the Chinese economy runs counter to the steps recommended by many Western experts. They have suggested that China should further deregulate its economy, let the renminbi appreciate and otherwise rely on market forces to tame inflation.The standard policy prescription from Washington has been that China should raise interest rates, as a way to slow investment and prevent the economy from overheating. And American policy makers from President Obama down have argued that if China would let the renminbi rise against the dollar, oil and other commodities would be less expensive in China, helping to tame inflation. But Beijing has resisted, in large part because Washington’s prescribed medicine would reduce the price competitiveness of Chinese exports to the United States and elsewhere.Still, even as China is zigging when Washington would rather it zag, some corporate economists are cautiously optimistic that China may be able to tame inflation with its approach — for now, at least.“Given that food prices are spearheading immediate inflationary pressures, supply-side measures should be more effective than rate hikes,” Qu Hongbin, the co-head of Asian economics research at the international bank HSBC, wrote in a research note on Wednesday night. “There’s no need to panic, as Beijing has more than enough effective policy options to combat inflation.”And yet, while there may be limits to China’s ability to keep a lid on inflation, it is better prepared than many countries to cope with rising world commodity prices. That is because China is self-sufficient in most foods, has an enormous trade surplus and has accumulated copious foreign reserves that reached $2.65 trillion at the end of September.In contrast, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization warned on Wednesday that food import bills were up 10 percent this year for the world’s poorest countries.But many economists were surprised by the accelerated inflation in China that the National Bureau of Statistics disclosed in Beijing last week. Overall consumer prices were 4.4 percent higher last month than a year earlier.Chinese leaders have repeatedly made clear over the years that fighting inflation is a top priority, because it could fuel social unrest. And they have publicly set a target of not allowing the annual increase in consumer prices to reach 5 percent again. It peaked at 8.5 percent in the spring of 2008.If food and energy prices are removed from the consumer price index, the prices for everything else are up only 1.3 percent from a year earlier, according to the government. But that is not necessarily a reassuring measure, some economists suggest.Chinese and Western economists worry that the Chinese price index may underestimate inflation separate from food and energy. The Chinese index has longstanding methodological problems — like measuring apartment rents but not the cost of buying and living in an apartment, which has soared in recent years.While climbing food and energy prices are a global problem, they particularly affect lower-income countries like China, where such necessities claim a far larger share of household incomes than in more affluent nations. China’s consumer price index, which is based mainly on urban spending patterns, assumes that groceries represent a third of a family’s spending.That is extremely high by Western standards. And it shows how far China must still go to create the kind of broad-based consumer society that American officials recommend and that Chinese leaders say they want to adopt in the long term in place of their current export-led model. In the United States, groceries represent only 8 percent of the Consumer Price Index.The State Council, China’s cabinet of ministers, decided on Wednesday that it would stabilize prices for grain, oil, sugar and cotton in particular, according to a statement on a government Web site. The State Council also said that the government would make sure that more diesel reached filling stations, to fuel trucks, and that utility power stations had ample supplies of coal.The high prices and relative scarcity of diesel fuel have resulted in part from its use by factories, which have been burning it in backyard generators as power companies have cut back electricity generation to meet national targets for limiting energy consumption.Meanwhile, utilities have struggled to buy enough coal because the government requires coal mines to sell it to power companies at low, regulated prices. The mines, of course, prefer to sell their coal at higher prices on the open market.Last week, in another move against inflation, Beijing ordered commercial banks to put more of their assets in low-yield accounts at the central bank. The measure, an increase in the so-called reserve requirement, was meant to cool a frenzy of lending over the last two years that has priced urban real estate beyond the reach of most working-class families.Liang Huoqiao, a 22-year-old plastics worker, said in an interview earlier this year in Guangzhou in southern China that his pay was rising 10 percent a year, to around $300 a month. But his entire annual pay would be enough to buy only about two square meters of an apartment, or 21.5 square feet.So he planned to buy a car as soon as possible, and worry about a home later.'"

"'10-11-19,'1','It’s no mystery why China and Germany are on the warpath against the Fed. Both nations are accustomed to running huge trade surpluses. But for some countries to run trade surpluses, others must run trade deficits — and, for years, that has meant us. The Fed’s expansionary policies, however, have the side effect of somewhat weakening , making U.S. goods more competitive, and paving the way for a smaller U.S. deficit. And the Chinese and Germans don’t want to see that happen.For the Chinese government, by the way, attacking the Fed has the additional benefit of shifting attention away from its own currency manipulation, which keeps China’s currency artificially weak — precisely the sin China falsely accuses America of committing.But why are Republicans joining in this attack?Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues seem stunned to find themselves in the cross hairs. They thought they were acting in the spirit of none other than , who blamed the Fed for not acting more forcefully during the Great Depression — and who, in 1998, called on the to “buy government on the open market,” exactly what the Fed is now doing.Republicans, however, will have none of it, raising objections that range from the odd to the incoherent.The odd: on Monday, a somewhat strange group of Republican figures — who knew that was an expert on monetary policy? — released an open letter to the Fed warning that its policies “risk currency debasement and inflation.” These concerns were echoed in a letter the top four Republicans in Congress sent Mr. Bernanke on Wednesday. Neither letter explained why we should fear inflation when the reality is that inflation keeps hitting record lows.And about dollar debasement: leaving aside the fact that a weaker dollar actually helps U.S. manufacturing, where were these people during the previous administration? The dollar slid steadily through most of the Bush years, a decline that dwarfs the recent downtick. Why weren’t there similar letters demanding that , the Fed chairman at the time, tighten policy?Meanwhile, the incoherent: Two Republicans, in the House and Bob Corker in the Senate, have called on the Fed to abandon all efforts to achieve full employment and focus solely on price stability. Why? Because unemployment remains so high. No, I don’t understand the logic either.So what’s really motivating the G.O.P. attack on the Fed? Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues were clearly caught by surprise, but the budget expert Stan Collender predicted it all. Back in August, he warned Mr. Bernanke that “with Republican policy makers seeing economic hardship as the path to election glory,” they would be “opposed to any actions taken by the Federal Reserve that would make the economy better.” In short, their real fear is not that Fed actions will be harmful, it is that they might succeed.Hence the axis of depression. No doubt some of Mr. Bernanke’s critics are motivated by sincere intellectual conviction, but the core reason for the attack on the Fed is self-interest, pure and simple. China and Germany want America to stay uncompetitive; Republicans want the economy to stay weak as long as there’s a Democrat in the White House.And if Mr. Bernanke gives in to their bullying, they may all get their wish.'"
"'10-11-19,'1','Two men pleaded guilty to conspiring to evade computer security by buying and reselling more than a million seats for events like the Rose Bowl football game.The men, Kenneth Lowson, 41, and Kristofer Kirsch, 37, admitted in federal court in Newark that they made more than $25 million in profits by cutting ahead of the public to buy through Ticketmaster and other vendors.Wiseguy Tickets sidestepped technology known as Captcha, which required users to read, then retype, distorted images of letters and numbers to buy tickets. By doing so, the defendants sped up the purchasing process, prosecutors said. Among the premium tickets they bought included almost half of the 440 best general admission floor seats to a July 2008 concert by Bruce Springsteen at Giants Stadium.Mr. Lowson and Mr. Kirsch, both of Los Angeles, were co-owners of Wiseguy Tickets. A computer programmer for the company, Joel Stevenson, 37, of Alameda, Calif., also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.Under a plea deal, Mr. Lowson and Mr. Kirsch face up to two years in prison. Mr. Stevenson faces up to a year in prison. United States District Judge Katharine Hayden set sentencing for March 15.'"
"'10-11-19,'1','Police officials said that while some points in the report “may bear some merit,” they strongly disputed the findings that the department was out of compliance. In a 17-page response to the civil rights office in October, the department said the reviewers relied on anecdotal information “to make broad conclusions regarding our language-access practices and the ability to provide meaningful access that are based on little, if any, factual data to support such conclusions.”“We do this better than anyone else, in far greater numbers than anyone else,” Paul J. Browne, the department’s chief spokesman, said in a statement on Thursday. “That’s the forest the Justice Department missed for the trees. They don’t get New York.”The Police Department has made strides in its efforts to increase the number of foreign-language speakers in its ranks, stressing that those skills are integral to counterterrorism efforts and in responding to day-to-day street crime in a city where more than a fifth of its inhabitants speak limited or no English. It also boasts of interpretation services that are intended to leave no foreign speakers isolated from getting help from officers on the street, over the phone or in any of the department’s precincts across the five boroughs.Yet the Justice Department’s review found an array of shortcomings in the department’s linguistic services. Among these deficiencies is a significant lack of certified interpreters for some of the city’s most commonly spoken foreign languages like Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Italian.Even when trained interpreters are available, officers and supervisors in the field often failed to call on them. Instead, officers “frequently rely on bystanders to interpret for them,” the report noted. One commanding officer explained to federal reviewers that he used his fiancée to interpret for him with a non-English speaking prisoner because “it was quicker and easier to rely on her than to ask Operations to send a certified interpreter.”The review found that in domestic violence cases, officers sometimes relied on family members and even children to help interpret, despite department guidelines stating that “all steps should be taken to avoid using a child as an interpreter.”Compliance is necessary under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to receive federal grants.The Justice Department began reviewing the Police Department in January as part of a routine audit to measure its interactions with New Yorkers who do not speak English, whether they are being arrested, stopped on the street or trying to get help in cases of domestic violence. Mr. Alston said in an interview on Thursday that though the steps needed to address the shortcomings “may look like a lot,” they were not overwhelming, and that the department was already undertaking many.The department’s use of Language Line, a multilingual interpretation service, was one of the things reviewers raised questions about. Every precinct has access to the service, and the department said sergeants in the field are equipped with cellphones linked to it. But several police employees, including one commanding officer, told Justice officials that their patrol supervisors “do not, in fact, have Language Line-equipped cellphones,” the report said.Police officials have said they have 14,000 employees with foreign-language skills who provide interpretative services through the department’s Volunteer Language Program. But in the vast majority of cases, the department does not verify whether these individuals are in fact qualified to provide language assistance. Only a small fraction are sent to training programs like Berlitz to be certified interpreters.For example, the department only has 12 certified Spanish interpreters, one for every 76,748 Spanish-speaking residents, the report said.For many of the commonly spoken foreign languages in New York City, the number of certified interpreters “appears to fall significantly short of the need,” the report said.The department said it was unaware of any federal regulation requiring certified interpreters and that the reviewers failed to find a single case where “one of our noncertified interpreters failed to translate properly.” Mr. Browne also noted that while they may not be certified, the department has more than 10,000 Spanish speakers.The reviewers also found inconsistent procedures in the department’s handling of domestic violence complaints from non-English speakers. In three meetings with community groups in April, victims’ advocates reported that officers in the field sometimes relied on the male suspect to translate, rather than interviewing the victim through an interpreter. Then, based on the statement of the accused, the officers sometimes concluded that a report was unwarranted.Police officers told the reviewers they did not rely on the accused to interpret for a victim. But the officers did tell them they sometimes relied on other family members or children to interpret, against department guidelines.The reviewers also found varying accounts about how officers complete and file domestic violence reports, which include a section for victims to write their allegations in their primary language. The review found that officers, however, sometimes prepared the statements in English and discouraged victims from submitting statements in their own language.Victims’ advocates have complained that the reports were often left blank or improperly translated, hampering their cases in court.Ms. Jimenez was recently separated and involved in a bitter custody battle when her life intersected with the police. She said her husband had flown into a rage at her apartment in Staten Island when she tried to photograph him with the children to prove she was complying with his visitation rights.She called 911 and reported that he had shoved and hurt her. The operator, who spoke Spanish, said police officers were on their way. They arrived about 30 minutes later but stayed only about five minutes as she tried to explain her plight, she recalled.“They did not write anything down,” Ms. Jimenez said.Mr. Browne said he was unfamiliar with the case, and said that out of millions of police contacts with non-English speakers every year, not all were perfect. “But our foreign-language outreach is better than any in the U.S. and possibly the world.”'"
"'10-11-19,'1','WASHINGTON — The House Intelligence Committee said Thursday that it had found 16 cases since the 1990s in which the intelligence agencies failed to provide Congress with “complete, timely and accurate information” about their activities, as the law requires.The report found that Congress was not properly informed about a Central Intelligence Agency program that explored dispatching teams to kill terrorists overseas; the destruction of videotapes of interrogations at the C.I.A.’s secret prisons; the agency’s involvement in the shooting down of a missionary flight in Peru; the National Security Agency’s compliance with laws and rules governing its eavesdropping; and the F.B.I.’s surveillance of a Russian spy ring that was exposed last summer. The committee did not disclose the other cases in which the classified report found shortcomings.The report included recommendations for the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and asked him to report back to Congress within 30 days on plans to put them in place. The recommendations are classified.The inquiry began in July 2009, shortly after members of the House and Senate intelligence committees learned they had never been informed of the C.I.A. program that developed plans to send small teams overseas to hunt and kill terrorists.That program, which involved a contract with the company then known as Blackwater, studied how such missions could be carried out but never attempted an actual killing, current and former intelligence officials said last year. The officials said Vice President Dick Cheney had advised the agency that there was no need to inform Congress about the program.'"
"'10-11-19,'1','Sears Holdings said Thursday that its third-quarter loss nearly doubled, dragged down by weak sales of appliances and clothing at its Sears stores.Separately, Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret, Bath and Body Works and other chains, said on Wednesday that it had a strong third quarter.Sears Holdings posted a loss of $218 million, or $1.98 a share, compared with a loss of $127 million, or $1.09 a share, in the period last year. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a loss of $1.08 a share.Revenue fell 5 percent, to $9.68 billion, short of analysts’ expectations of $9.89 billion.Revenue at company stores open at least a year dropped 4.8 percent in the quarter, driven mostly by an 8.2 percent decline at Sears. The figure fell 0.7 percent at Kmart stores.The company said the weakness in home appliances at Sears resulted from soft demand, lower prices and a delay in introducing new Kenmore products during the quarter. Over all, demand for appliances has declined as home-buyer tax credits have expired.'"
"'10-11-19,'1','For years Marlene McCarty’s mural-size ballpoint-pen drawings of parricidal teenagers have been some of the chilliest hot stuff around, though they haven’t been all that visible. It’s about time someone put a good amount of this work under one roof, and New York University’s 80WSE gallery has.In the late 1980s, as part of Gran Fury, an activist group, she and the artist Donald Moffett designed graphically sophisticated and effective AIDS protest art, posters slick enough to pass as ordinary advertising before landing their polemical punch. The image of heterosexual and gay couples kissing under the words “Kissing Doesn’t Kill: Greed And Indifference Do” was theirs, and it put a neat twist in everyday city life wherever it appeared.During and after this time, Ms. McCarty also made text paintings, using a labor-intensive heat-transfer method, of single words and phrases, most of them taken from sexual street slang directed at women. There are several, dating back to 1991, in the show. You have to struggle to puzzle out words done in blocky or flamelike letters, but as with the posters, the sentiments are that much more effective for the delay in delivery.In the mid-1990s, she did the first in her series of big, figurative ballpoint-and-pencil drawings on paper, each superbly executed, with a tabloid back story. The subjects were young women or girls who had murdered family members. In 1984 in Illinois, Pamela Knuckles strangled her overbearingly moralistic mother. Four years earlier in Ohio, Teresa Bickerstaff shot her mother and two younger brothers, then torched the house. Both killers were 17.In her sleek, line-perfect portraits, Ms. McCarty draws the faces from news photographs and the bodies from magazine advertisements. The fashion-ad poses register first, and then the details of clothing, much of it semitransparent, revealing breasts and genitals and suggesting an erotics of violence.Later she used the same approach in ambitious group portraits, sometimes produced as paired sets. In one pair, five teenage girls smile as they tussle. They could be posing for a larky class picture except that one girl is clearly at the center of the action, and the play is getting rough. Both pictures were inspired by a real incident: the 1992 murder by classmates of 12-year-old Shanda Sharer in Madison, Ind.'"
"'10-11-19,'1','The man arrested, Kiyoshi Takayama, 63, had been seen as the syndicate’s de facto leader after its official boss was imprisoned in 2005 for possessing firearms, which are illegal in Japan.“Organized crime is threatening Japan’s entire economy,” Kohei Kishi, director of the organized crime division of Japan’s National Police Agency, said in recent interview. “And they have deep roots in construction.”The National Police Agency and other government departments are pressuring businesses of various sorts to stamp out mafia links, which police officials describe as more entrenched in corporate Japan than in the United States.The country’s finance ministry, for example, has directed banks to step up safeguards to prevent money laundering, cut off loans to mob-related companies and deny bank accounts to individuals with known gangster ties.The big target, though, is Japan’s 30 trillion yen ($362 billion) construction industry, where the yakuza have long run rampant. In the 1990s, at the peak of yakuza involvement with construction, police estimate that gangs pocketed at least 2 to 3 percent of all construction spending in Japan.Many experts say Japan’s crackdown efforts are long overdue. The crime syndicates now operate with such sophistication that Jake Adelstein, who has written extensively about Japanese organized crime, calls the yakuza “Goldman Sachs with guns.”Across Japan, almost 83,000 gangsters operate in 22 crime syndicates, according to police data, that contribute to a mob-controlled economy worth an estimated 20 trillion yen ($242 billion) a year.In the construction industry, the yakuza’s influence dates back to at least Japan’s extensive rebuilding after the devastation of World War II, when the mob helped supply cheap labor to contractors, aiding in the breakup of worker strikes and the enforcement of labor compliance.A modern-day yakuza boss pressures developers to pay “protection money” to cover construction projects — as in the case in Kyoto — or use front companies to win lucrative construction or procurement contracts, police say.In a 2007 police survey of 3,000 construction companies in Japan, 34 percent of respondents said they had been approached by the yakuza with requests for payments or business in the last year.Sometimes it is the developers that reach out to the yakuza — to muscle reluctant owners into selling their land, for example. In 2008, the president of a big real estate company, Suruga, resigned after police arrested members of a front company that Suruga had hired to evict occupants from a Tokyo building. Banks quickly recalled their loans from Suruga, and the company went bankrupt.“The construction industry was once tolerant of yakuza involvement,” said Hiroshi Inuzuka, a lawyer and adviser to the nationwide Federation of Construction Contractors, a trade group. “A good project manager was expected to smooth over ‘local relations,’ which involved working with the yakuza so there would be no trouble,” he said.The industry’s anti-yakuza effort, which began in 2008, has shifted away from the past focus on going after the crime gangs themselves. Now the emphasis is on monitoring companies and imposing tougher penalties on ones that do business with the mob.In April, the federation advised its members to adapt a clause in all contracts that would void obligations if a contractor was found to have links with the yakuza.The new Tokyo tower — which is called the Tokyo Sky Tree — has become a prominent symbol of the crackdown. Companies involved include the railroad operator Tobu Railway and the Obayashi Corporation, one of Japan’s biggest contractors.In late 2008, the companies working on the Sky Tree teamed up with local businesses to form an anti-yakuza committee. It is one of more than 100 similar committees that have been formed here in the past few years.Mr. Hironaka, the tower’s anti-mob lawyer, says movement to and from the construction site is closely monitored by guards and with closed-circuit video. Contracts are scrutinized to make sure that no construction equipment or materials — not even boxed lunches or gloves for workers — come from companies with mob affiliations.“The site is water-tight,” Mr. Hironaka said. “It will take a lot to get past all that.”Local governments, whose public works projects account for the bulk of construction spending in Japan, have also joined the campaign to extract the yakuza from the building business. Next month, Tokyo is set to ban any company or individual affiliated with the yakuza from city contracts — from office supplies to public works — along with threats of penalties and public disclosure for companies found to have mafia ties.Morio Umeda, who runs a public anti-yakuza advice center in Tokyo and runs seminars for companies on dealing with the yakuza, says inquiries are rising as more companies try to sever ties with the mob. In 2009, similar advice centers across the country received more than 4,200 consultations about organized crime from companies in construction or real estate, about 12 percent of total consultations.“I tell them that they should not be afraid, that they should go to the police even if they are warned not to,” said Mr. Umeda, a former anti-yakuza officer with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. “But especially at busy construction sites, it can sometimes be difficult to be aware of who’s coming and going.”And the mob is threatening to fight back. Last month, police say, a gunshot was fired into the wall of a construction site linked to Takenaka Corporation, one of Japan’s biggest general contractors, the fourth shooting at construction sites in Tokyo this year. Although no one has been hurt, the shootings have resonated in a country where guns are almost unobtainable for everyone except gangsters.Those close to the yakuza call the attacks a sign of desperation.“It’s the ice age” for organized crime, said Yukio Yamanouchi, a former legal adviser to the Yamaguchi-gumi, who still defends members of organized crime.“They looked for new earnings in the mainstream economy, but that’s triggered a backlash,” Mr. Yamanouchi said. “Now, some yakuza are worrying where their next meal will come from.”'"
"'10-11-19,'1','“We have clearly had an execution problem, which has eroded the reputation of the government and confidence in its ability to deliver the commitments undertaken, both with foreign and domestic partners,” said António Nogueira Leite, a former secretary of the treasury and a professor at the Nova School of Economics and Business in Lisbon.Ireland’s government has money, but its banks are drowning in debt, and the government has vowed to guarantee debts, making the state itself vulnerable. Portugal’s problem is different. Its banks are not especially troubled, but the state itself has high debts and low growth, and the mound of both public and private debt is considerable. The total debt is larger than the annual gross domestic product, some $275 billion of debt in an economy of $232 billion a year, one of the highest ratios in the developed world.Mr. Sócrates has blamed the financial markets in interviews as “very unfair.” But Mr. Nogueira Leite, who has been an economic adviser to the opposition Social Democrats, said the markets saw “a total failure to control public spending.”“There’s a perception that this government may not be up to the task, though it should be capable of doing it,” he said.So the interest rates Portugal would have to pay on the markets, should it have to borrow money now, would be much too high, forcing it to seek money from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The government here, as in Dublin, hopes the markets will calm down. But other European Union governments are concerned that unless the markets are appeased now, by protecting Ireland and Portugal, the contagion will spread to huge Spain, the fourth largest economy among the countries that use the euro.The government’s failure to rein in spending — and its decision to spend on yet more highways and toll roads instead of investments that could produce direly needed economic and export growth — has soured relations with the opposition Social Democrats. Six months ago, Portugal was praised for its unity in the face of economic adversity, as opposed to neighboring Spain, when the main parties agreed on austerity measures.But the government was forced by market anxieties and consequently higher borrowing costs to bring in a new round of cuts in September, and the Social Democrats, who have a new leader, balked at higher taxes. The government nearly collapsed, and while Mr. Costa believes that national solidarity will prevail and the budget will pass before too long, it may be too late for the markets.“We’re walking on a razor’s edge here,” said Mr. Nogueira Leite. “The more the Irish have trouble, the bigger the likelihood we will need help. But if we had done what we should have done four months ago, we would have been separated from the Irish problem” and interest rates for new bonds would be smaller.The budget will pass, he said. “But we have a reputation problem, a credibility problem, an execution problem.”Another source of concern is a possible rise in social unrest, with Portugal facing a stiff test next Wednesday, when the country’s main labor unions have called a general strike to protest the latest austerity measures. The government has called on unions to avoid further crippling the economy.Portugal remains committed, in principle, to reducing its budget deficit from 9.3 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 to 7.3 percent this year and 4.6 percent in 2011.“It’s now clear to everybody that 2011 is going to be a very, very tough year for the Portuguese people, but as a country, as long as we see a clear purpose and target, typically we accept making sacrifices,” said Vasco d’Orey, an independent economist. “I would be very much surprised if what you see in Lisbon next week gets out of control.”In a sign of the difficulties, the head of Portugal’s intelligence service, Jorge Silva Carvalho, resigned to protest budget cuts. The newspaper Publico said the resignation was a “direct consequence” of cuts in the 2011 budget that would force the closing of seven of the agency’s 11 offices abroad.In the longer run, said Antonio Garcia Pascual, chief southern Europe economist at Barclays Capital in London, “Portugal needs to grow out of its problem. It must make the labor market more flexible, make the state less heavy and increase competitiveness. The government is aware of it, but it has relatively weak political capital now and a small mandate.”But Portugal “needs these reforms, which is why the market is testing Portugal, even after fiscal austerity measures,” Mr. Garcia Pascual said. “The markets smell the political stalemate, so they are pushing them quite hard to make necessary changes.”Cristina Casalinho, chief economist for BPI, one of Portugal’s largest banks, thinks that borrowing costs for Portugal will continue to rise, because the government has used up its margin, its benefit of the doubt.“The main question mark for the Portuguese economy is now whether the government can deliver its 2011 budget objectives, and I’m really not sure that the markets are willing to wait for the answer and give the government more time to show whether it can or not,” Ms. Casalinho said. “That window of opportunity is now probably closed for the government.”'"
"'10-11-19,'1','Target, not used to being confined, escaped Friday afternoon from Sergeant Young’s home in the San Tan Valley area in central Arizona. After being spotted on the loose, she was reported to Pinal County’s animal control. Target was brought to the county animal shelter in Florence, where she was held just like any other run-of-the-mill stray. Because she had no tag, microchip or license with the county, her photo went up on the shelter’s Web site on Friday in hopes that her owner might respond.Sergeant Young spotted Target’s photo online on Friday and paid the fee by computer to recover her. He mistakenly thought the shelter was closed for the weekend.By the time Sergeant Young arrived at the pound on Monday, the shelter employee in charge of euthanizing animals that day had apparently picked the wrong dog out of the pen and administered a lethal injection, performing what the shelter referred to as “P.T.S.,” or put to sleep.“I am heartsick over this,” Ruth Stalter, the county’s animal care and control director, said in a statement. “I had to personally deliver the news to the dog’s owner, and he and his family are understandably distraught.”Barraged with criticism, the county ordered an investigation and placed the unidentified woman who euthanized Target on administrative leave. “This is unacceptable,” Ms. Stalter said, “and no family should be deprived of their companion because procedures were not followed.”The county offered the Young family the services of a grief counselor who specializes in pet issues and agreed to refund the recovery fee and waive any fines, said Heather Murphy, a county spokeswoman. “We are not shying away from this,” she said. “We screwed up, and we’re acknowledging that.”But Target’s fate has mushroomed into more than a family tragedy. Because of the dog’s fame and her heroics in battle, there has been an outpouring of grief.A candlelight vigil is planned for Dec. 3 to honor Target. Sergeant Young said he might spread the dog’s ashes, which were provided by the animal shelter, at a memorial service, perhaps at the park where Target used to frolic off leash.A lawyer specializing in animal issues has also contacted Sergeant Young, who said a lawsuit was possible.Recalling those difficult days in Afghanistan, Sergeant Young said that perhaps because he and the other soldiers were living like dogs themselves, they bonded with the strays that found their way onto the base. “Our rooms could be mistaken for kennels with the cement floors, smell of urine and feces, razor wire and chain-linked fence all around the compound,” he wrote for his hometown paper in Nebraska, The McCook Daily Gazette, just days after Target joined him in August.Target had her own Facebook page for those who wanted to follow her new life in the United States. Since word of her death has spread, fans have written of their shock and outrage.“Nooooooooooo!!! So so sad :-( Thank you for all you did Target! Amazing that you survived a war, but not an American shelter ... something is wrong here, baby,” read one posting.The page has been used to organize a write-in campaign to Pinal County officials to express outrage at what happened. The No Kill Advocacy Center has used Target’s death to raise the profile of its campaign to end the euthanizing of millions of cats and dogs at shelters every year.And the Puppy Rescue Mission, the organization that raised the several thousand dollars to bring Target to the United States, has expanded its mission to encourage pet owners to install microchips in their animals so they can be easily traced.At the shelter where Target died, there is significant despair as well, county officials said. “On Monday, I spoke with the director and if she was not openly crying, she was fighting back tears,” Ms. Murphy said. “You don’t do this work if you don’t care about animals.”“They love when someone adopts an animal or an animal is returned to its owner. That’s the best part of the job,” Ms. Murphy said. “But there is roadkill to pick up, and we recently had to pick up 154 cats from a trailer with no running water. These jobs are thankless even on a good day.”The official investigation into what happened will go beyond one employee’s error and look into the policies of the shelter, officials said. Already, one former employee has come forward to say that he almost euthanized the wrong animal on several occasions.“They said, ‘Ah, don’t worry about it, mistakes happen,’ and we went on,” the former employee, Jason Melroy, told local television station KTAR. “I sedated a dog that wasn’t supposed to be put to sleep. Thank God another officer found it.”'"
"'10-11-19,'1','The automaker’s shares surged nearly 8 percent after the market opened. They ended the day up $1.19, or 3.61 percent, to $34.19. The stock had been priced at $33 on Wednesday evening.Investors were reassured about the economic situation in Europe. Irish officials acknowledged for the first time Thursday that the country was seeking aid from international lenders to end its debt crisis. A team from the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank were in Dublin for talks on the country’s tottering finances.“I think there is probably a sense that the sovereign issues in Europe, especially in Ireland, are being addressed,” Mr. Lee said. “I think these are reasons for investors to put capital to work.”Ireland has moved more aggressively than many countries to address problems brought on by the financial crisis, but investors have been losing confidence in its banks in recent months, and a Greek-style rescue now appears imminent. On Wednesday, the British government signaled that it could offer Ireland direct financial aid as well.Ireland had resisted asking for help, however, because of a reluctance to accept the strings attached to any bailout.But on Thursday, Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told the Irish Parliament that it would be a “very desirable outcome” if a contingency capital fund could be established with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.The FTSE 100 index in London rose 1.34 percent, or 76.15 points to 5,768.71.

The euro rose to $1.3644 from $1.3529 late Wednesday in New York.The energy sector was up more than 2 percent.Brian M. Youngberg, an energy analyst for Edward Jones, said a major factor in the sector’s rise was the price of oil, which climbed about 2 percent on the positive economic data and on relief over the Irish crisis.“The market is obviously up in general, but oil is up with the dollar down, and the dollar is down with the expectation of a bailout of the Irish banking sector forthcoming,” he said. Halliburton, an oil services giant, rose $2.06, or 5.80 percent, to $37.56, while Cameron International, also a provider of oil services and equipment, rose 5.30 percent, to $47.07.Other commodities benefited, including metals. Alcoa had one of the largest increases on the Dow, rising 3.40 percent to $13.38.Shares of other aluminum companies also rose. Century Aluminum Company was up 60 cents, or 4.48 percent, at $14, and Kaiser Aluminum was up $1.72, or 3.87 percent, to $46.12. They helped lift the materials sector by nearly 2 percent.The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 5/32, to 97 21/32. The yield rose to 2.90 percent, from 2.88 percent late Wednesday.'"

The firing was announced Friday.The dog, named Target, belonged to Sgt. Terry Young, an Army medic.

"'10-11-20,'0','Maybe that’s the whole point. Our horror movies are mirroring the world around us. The increasingly passé vampire story is about a society full of normal people threatened by a few bloodsuckers, some of whom are maybe just like you and me, except way older. It was fine for the age of Obama. But we’ve entered the era of zombie politics: a small cadre of uninfected humans have to band together and do whatever it takes to protect themselves against the irrational undead.The new incoming Republicans are lurking in the halls of the Capitol, hiding behind the statuary and hoping to leap out and behead a Democratic zombie spendthrift. ( ’s boy Ben promised to “knock the hell out of Washington” and now he’s there, ready for action.)Bipartisanship is so ... Twilight novel. Give them an inch and they’ll take a liver. In an interview with Robert Draper for The Times Magazine on Sunday, Sarah Palin said she had been “innocent and naïve” when she began her political career in believing that the two parties could work together. “I learned my lesson. Once bitten, twice shy.”Well, for sure you do not want to be bitten.On the other side, the Democrats are waking from an election night coma to find that the country is overrun with zombie Republicans who are demanding to be allowed to shut down the government even before their swearing-in. And when invited their leadership to break bread and talk about working together, and said a pre-Thanksgiving sit-down didn’t fit into their schedules.Wouldn’t want to be there when the meal finally comes off. “Bless us, oh Lord, and these, thy gifts, which ... aaauuurrgghchompchompchomp.”In private, the Democratic senators complained bitterly about the old Obama let-us-reason-together strategy. Zombies aren’t going to make a deal on the or pass the arms treaty! All they care about is plump, tasty Democratic thighs and calves and kidneys.Obviously there are some big problems here. One is that both parties think they’re playing the small-town sheriff. The other is that this story line never really ends all that well. Zombies are impossible to eradicate. They’re worse than .

"'10-11-20,'0','Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday first reproved then effectively dismissed a prominent economic adviser who gave an interview in which he said “the vast majority of people” in Britain “have never had it so good since this recession — this so-called recession — started.” The remarks by Lord David Young, 78, a multimillionaire businessman, were in an interview published on Friday in The Daily Telegraph in which he discussed Britain’s effort to impose 20 percent across-the-board cuts in government spending, its biggest peacetime cuts ever. Lord Young said many Britons had gained from historically low mortgage rates, allowing them to spend more freely on other things, thus buoying the economy through the banking crisis.His words echoed those of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, a former Conservative prime minister, who was accused of insensitivity to hard-pressed Britons when he said in 1957 that “most of our people have never had it so good.” They were also seen as undermining Mr. Cameron’s efforts to present his government as keenly attuned to the hardships experienced by Britain’s 60 million people, including 2.5 million unemployed. The prime minister first described Lord Young’s statement as “unacceptable” and said he would be doing “a bit less speaking in the future,” but as the political storm over the remarks continued to build, 10 Downing Street announced within hours that Mr. Cameron had accepted Lord Young’s resignation.'"
"'10-11-20,'0','And just what would 1 percent of equity in a highly profitable network like YES be worth? About $15 million, substantial enough to help bridge the gap between what Jeter presumably seeks in a new deal and what the Yankees want to give him.Jeter could then add to his stake by investing his own money if shares become available, or sell it, cashing in on the value of the nation’s leading regional sport network.In exchange for the Yankees’ generosity, Jeter, while still playing, could lend his presence during YES’s renewal talks with cable operators, talk to existing or prospective advertisers and promote the network in the era of Hal, the quiet Steinbrenner. Such things actually matter. Would a cable operator prefer to watch a game with Jeter or a YES executive trying to wring more money out of him?All the while, Jeter would be making YES, already worth $3 billion, worth even more.Who would give Jeter YES stock? Ownership is shared by the Yankees and Goldman Sachs, which have about 33 percent apiece; the rest is in the hands of some former owners of the Nets (a legacy of the old YankeeNets entity) and another investment bank, Providence Equity. Any one of them who thinks that Jeter’s iconic status boosts its investment could give him that 1 percent.This would be unusual, if not unique. Magic Johnson bought a stake in the Los Angeles Lakers after he retired and recently sold it. Mario Lemieux turned the deferred salary owed him by the bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins into ownership of the team. Michael Jordan was given a minority share of the Washington Wizards when he joined them as head of basketball operations in 2000 but surrendered it when he resumed playing.But Jordan was not a Wizard-for-life. Jeter has never been anything but a Yankee, like Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, Thurman Munson and Don Mattingly before him. But until now, no past great Yankee played for the team when it had spun its brand into YES and Legends.So the options are there if the Yankees want to use these spinoffs to provide compensation to Jeter that is not payroll-related and that goes beyond the type of personal-services contracts that retired players sometimes get from team owners.That’s not to say the Yankees would necessarily be intrigued by Jeter the shareholder. They can argue that they have built their business on paying great players enormous sums and don’t need to share equity in their ventures with the talented hired help. Although he would not comment for this article, Randy Levine, the Yankees’ president, signaled the other day that the talks with Jeter were about salary only and that Jeter was even free to test the free-agent market, although no one believes he would.The Yankees could also reject the stock idea because other Yankee stars, like Mariano Rivera, might line up to demand their shares in YES or Legends.But the Yankees can simply tell them, “No offense, but you’re not Derek Jeter.”'"
"'10-11-20,'0','Merck on Friday won a signature jury trial against Judith Graves, a Florida woman who had sued the company and claimed that its osteoporosis drug, Fosamax, caused her jawbone to disintegrate.A Manhattan civil court jury issued its verdict several hours after lawyers had presented their closing arguments in the case.The decision represents the second of three bellwether jury trials on this issue to end in Merck’s favor. They and other cases are among litigation involving about 1,400 people across the country who have claimed they developed jawbone ailments after taking Fosamax, according to Timothy M. O’Brien, Mrs. Graves’s lawyer. In a third trial, a judge reduced the jury’s award to $1.5 million from $8 million, but both sides want to appeal. Another signature case is set to go to trial in March.Friday’s verdict comes at a time when many physicians are rethinking the long-term use of Fosamax and other osteoporosis drugs known as oral bisphosphonates. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration issued a public advisory saying the drugs had been linked with — although not definitively as the cause of — rare thigh fractures. The agency will now require the labels of oral bisphosphonates to state that the optimum duration of taking the drugs is not known.In Mrs. Graves’s case, Merck argued that Fosamax did not cause Mrs. Graves’s jawbone disintegration, a condition that led to several operations to replace her jawbone. Mrs. Graves, Merck argued, was taking other prescription drugs, including steroids for rheumatoid arthritis, that can weaken the immune system, and she had other health issues that can lead to jaw and dental problems.“We believe the evidence showed the company acted properly, and that Fosamax did not cause the plaintiff’s dental and jaw problems,” Mike Brock, outside counsel for Merck, said in a statement.'"
"'10-11-20,'0','Since 1988, deep in the pocket of California’s old gold-mining country, Larry Copello has been laboring at what he loves: manufacturing devices that resemble bombs, that are used to test the alertness of security personnel around the world.There are a couple of other companies that make such products, Mr. Copello said in an interview on Friday, and on any given day, the devices make thousands of trips through X-ray machines awaiting detection, without the public’s ever knowing.But it just so happened that the one that was found in an untagged laptop bag in Namibia on Wednesday came from his tiny four-person factory in Sonora, Calif., and not from a competitor’s shop. And it just so happened that the person who assembled the device about four years ago was Mr. Copello’s mother-in-law.F.B.I. agents visited his company, Larry Copello Inc., on Thursday to ask about the device, which was detected before being loaded onto an Air Berlin plane bound for Munich. On Friday, Mr. Copello said that security concerns prevented him from saying much about the episode, though he did effectively confirm that such devices could be tracked: he said he told the F.B.I. that “somebody had purchased it from me a few years ago.”Still, he said, he “had no clue” who owned the device now, or why it nearly made it onto the Air Berlin plane.

"'10-11-20,'0','Speaking to the French daily newspaper Le Monde, a senior European official, Klaus Regling, said that the mission would need about two weeks to identify financing needs in the banking industry and identify reforms. Mr. Regling, head of the European Financial Stability Facility, the euro zone’s temporary safety net, said there would be no problem raising money.Amadeu Altafaj, a spokesman for the European Commission, declined to comment on the state of the talks.Anticipation of a rescue brought some relief to financial markets. The yield on benchmark 10-year Irish bonds fell 9 basis points, to 7.8 percent, on Friday, and the Irish Overall Index of stocks rose 0.8 percent.But analysts cautioned that a bailout of Ireland might not necessarily spell an end to the debt crisis in the euro zone.Alfred Steinherr, a former chief economist at the European Investment Bank, said that whatever the outcome of the Dublin talks, the issue of a restructuring of sovereign debt would have to be broached by the wider euro area.“Once we find a solution to Ireland, then we can turn to Portugal,” he said. “How many guarantees will the E.U. be able to provide?”Such a restructuring — sometimes referred to more starkly as default — would probably involve the negotiated or forced lengthening of government bond maturities and possibly changes to interest rates paid by governments to bondholders, Mr. Steinherr said.European officials have acknowledged that such issues are forming part of discussions now under way — driven by Germany — on the creation of a permanent fund to replace the temporary ones, which expire in 2013.The negotiators in Dublin appear to be focusing on the banks — the winding down of nonviable lenders and, potentially, the revamping and recapitalization of viable institutions — rather than Ireland’s fiscal situation.Any rescue package “would likely have fiscal conditions, but we would not expect something similar to the heavy reform agenda set for Greece,” Antonio Garcia Pascual and Piero Ghezzi, analysts at Barclays Capital, said in a note. For two years now, “Ireland has been implementing fiscal and financial policy measures broadly in line with what an E.U.-I.M.F. program would have recommended.”The Irish community minister, Pat Carey, said Friday that a fiscal plan for saving 15 billion euros from 2011 to 2014 would be published early next week, according to Reuters.Still, one issue surrounding austerity conditions remains to be resolved: differences between Ireland and its European partners over whether to raise Dublin’s corporate tax rate, which is 12.5 percent.France and Germany consider this rate to be a distortion, while Dublin remains convinced that is crucial to attracting investment and restarting the growth needed to fill state coffers.Another issue that will have to addressed — perhaps after any aid agreement — is financing for Ireland’s lenders by the European Central Bank, which is expected to wind down liquidity assistance early next year.Barclays said Irish banks were the biggest borrowers at the central bank and have borrowed about 130 billion euros.Speaking Friday at the Dublin airport, Prime Minister Brian Cowen vowed to reach the “best possible outcome” for the Irish people in the talks, according to Reuters.'"
"'10-11-20,'0','Shares of Reliance Communications, a phone company implicated in the scandal, whose chairman is the billionaire businessman Anil D. Ambani, dropped 3.8 percent.Reliance Communications said in a statement that it had “always been in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.”The telecommunications minister, A. Raja, stepped down Sunday just ahead of the release of the auditor’s report. Mr. Raja, who has said he has done nothing wrong, was the third high-ranking Indian politician to step down this month amid allegations of corruption.The string of departures seems to have prompted soul-searching at the highest levels of government.“Our economy may be increasingly dynamic, but our moral universe seems to be shrinking,” Sonia Gandhi, the president of the Congress Party, said Friday at a conference in New Delhi, according to multiple news reports.“Graft and greed are on the rise,” she said. “The principles on which independent India was founded, for which a generation of great leaders fought and sacrificed their all, are in danger of being negated.”Ultimately, India’s ruling political alliance, headed by the Congress Party, could be weakened, and the country’s image as an attractive and open place to invest could be damaged, analysts say.“This is a very serious crisis of credibility” for the Indian government, said Mahesh Rangarajan, a political analyst and history professor at Delhi University. “When you are deregulating an economy, you can’t do away with regulation.”The Indian economy is projected to grow 8.5 percent this year, and Western companies and governments are looking to the country to lift their own weak growth rates. Last week, President Obama visited India, along with an entourage of more than 200 American executives, in an effort to strengthen economic ties.Telecommunications is often held up as the most successful example of the Indian government’s ability to free industry from the stifling effects of the so-called License Raj, the traditional practice of doling out permits to make goods or deliver services, often to well-connected families who paid bribes.That practice nominally ended as the government yielded control over many industries to private companies, mostly in the early 1990s, and allowed market forces to dictate which companies survived and failed.But the recent investigation found that India’s telecommunication minister, Mr. Raja, awarded licenses for new spectrum in a way that “lacked transparency and fairness,” according to the report, which also implied that Mr. Raja favored some companies.On Thursday, in criticizing Mr. Singh’s handling of the scandal, the Supreme Court gave him until Saturday to respond in writing. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Tuesday. The hearing promises to be complicated and threatens to pit several of the government’s political appointees against one another.On Friday, the Ministry of Law said that the attorney general would represent Mr. Singh in the Supreme Court case, while the country’s solicitor general would represent the Department of Telecommunications. An additional solicitor general will represent the Central Bureau of Investigation, the agency responsible for monitoring internal corruption.With nearly 700 million customers, India’s booming mobile phone market is the world’s largest after China, and it has attracted foreign investment from individuals and companies in Europe, America and the Middle East.The country’s telecommunications regulator said Thursday that 69 of the 130 telecommunications licenses issued since 2006 should be revoked. Kapil Sibal, who is serving as temporary minister of telecommunications, said Friday that he would not do anything that would disrupt service to customers but implied that some operators might need to pay more to keep their licenses.Mr. Raja is a leading lower-caste politician in a major southern Indian political party that is a key ally of the Congress Party and provides a crucial 18 seats to the coalition government.Tax evasion, crime and corruption have cost India $462 billion since 1948, according to a report released this week by Global Financial Integrity, an anticorruption group in Washington. Faster growth after the opening up of the economy has led to even more illicit money flowing out of the country, the report said.Within India, many hope the recent tide of investigations and political departures is a sign that corruption’s long grip on the country is lessening, not increasing.“If you want to damn India you say ‘They are full of corruption,’ but you have to see there is also a live democracy at work that is as free as the United States,” said N. Vittal, a retired Central Vigilance Commissioner, another anticorruption agency.“We are witnessing a type of catharsis,” Mr. Vittal said, and “out of this something good may come.”'"
"'10-11-20,'0','LISBON — NATO leaders agreed on Friday evening to establish a missile defense shield that would cover all NATO member states, and on Saturday they expect Russia to agree to discuss the possibility of cooperating on the system’s development.President Obama, who has promoted a less costly, more flexible missile defense system that will have components in Europe and at sea, praised the day’s work, saying that for the first time “we’ve agreed to develop a missile defense capability that is strong enough to cover all NATO European territory and populations as well as the United States.”Turkey, which had seemed to present a potential sticking point, dropped its objections to a common missile defense system when it was satisfied that no country, particularly Iran, would be named as a principal threat. Turkey also wanted money to buy antimissile components.Missile defense has long created tensions between NATO and Russia, but American officials were optimistic that the meeting on Saturday would prove more productive than earlier ones with the Russian president at the time, Vladimir V. Putin, who made no secret of his mistrust of the alliance.In general, senior NATO officials note a welcoming Russian tone under President Dmitri A. Medvedev to the idea of cooperation with NATO on missile defense and European security, and they also note the general silence of Mr. Putin, now prime minister.On Saturday, Russia will be formally invited to take part in the missile defense system, especially with intelligence and radar sharing. Moscow has indicated that it is interested but has questions, and wants to ensure that the system is not aimed at countering Russian missiles.The missile defense system approved Friday is different from the fixed-missile defense that President George W. Bush initiated and that proved controversial. The idea is to have a phased system of radars and antimissile missiles that would be less expensive than the Bush system. The NATO spokesman, James Appathurai, said the nearly $1.5 billion cost could be managed over 10 years.American officials hailed the agreements as a victory for Mr. Obama and his efforts to strengthen the alliance and improve relations with Moscow. They said the agreements showed that Mr. Obama retained influence and credibility among the allies despite his party’s drubbing in the recent midterm elections and his inability so far to overcome Senate Republican objections to a revised nuclear arms treaty with Russia.Mr. Obama has been seeking support among the allies here for the treaty, known as New Start, both to reassure Senate Republicans and to increase pressure on them.The snag for the treaty clouds the broader efforts to “reset” relations with the Kremlin. Russian officials have said that they understand the domestic political situation, but that a failure to ratify the treaty would have some impact, at least, on the warmth of future relations.The White House distributed remarks by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the secretary general of NATO, supporting ratification of the treaty. Mrs. Merkel said no one was so naïve as to believe immediately in a world without nuclear weapons. The White House distributed a column by the Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, who wrote that “the senators’ decision will inevitably have an impact beyond their country’s borders. It will be particularly significant for Poland, a staunch ally.”Mr. Obama told American reporters, “Just as this is a national security priority for the United States, the message that I’ve received since I arrived from my fellow leaders here at NATO could not be clearer: New Start will strengthen our alliance, and it will strengthen European security.”The NATO leaders also signed off on a broad new strategic doctrine, the first since 1999, intended to explain to their citizens why the alliance still matters after the cold war. The accord ends weeks of negotiations among the 28-member alliance over how to deal with Russia and to decide what role disarmament and nuclear weapons will play in the alliance.Mr. Rasmussen said the strategic concept, a sort of mission statement, meant that NATO would “continue to play its unique and essential role in ensuring our common defense and security.”The document is an effort to define the broader threats to NATO and its populations, which now include terrorism, cyberwarfare and failed states, while reconfirming the idea of collective defense. It promises to work to “prevent crises, manage conflicts and stabilize postconflict situations,” and pledges closer cooperation with the United Nations and the European Union.The document also commits the alliance, for the first time, “to the goal of creating the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons,” while reconfirming the centrality of nuclear deterrence “as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world.”Saturday will mark the beginning of NATO’s own reset with Russia. Although some countries, particularly the Baltic states, are skeptical about warming relations between NATO and Russia, Mr. Rasmussen said the alliance and Russia shared many common threats, like terrorism and drug trafficking.Mr. Medvedev was invited to the NATO summit meeting Friday night, a major change from two years ago, when Mr. Putin crashed the NATO dinner in Bucharest, Romania, to lecture Mr. Bush about the dangers of NATO expansion to Georgia and Ukraine.Russian and Georgia fought a small war later that year, and Russian troops still occupy two provinces of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. NATO officials contend that a closer relationship with Moscow is the best way to make progress on Georgia.But Mr. Obama made a point on Friday of meeting the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, to show American support for Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity.On Afghanistan, there is general agreement that NATO will begin next year to hand over responsibility for security to the Afghan government and its troops and police officers, a process that is supposed to be finished by the end of 2014. European nations that have troops in Afghanistan are eager to shift to noncombat roles, so there will be much discussion down the line about which provinces are handed over first.While the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, has annoyed American and European officials with criticism of American military tactics there, he met on Friday for an hour with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in a discussion American officials called “candid and friendly.” The Americans and other NATO allies are hopeful that Mr. Karzai will be careful in his comments here.Mr. Obama told the Spanish daily newspaper El País that he expected the allies to pledge additional trainers for Afghan security forces. “This effort is going to take time, and our commitment to Afghanistan and the Afghan people is for the long-term,” he said. “We cannot turn our backs on the Afghan people.”'"

"'10-11-21,'0','Those agencies are writing regulations to govern the new entities, known as accountable care organizations. They face a delicate task: balancing the potential benefits of clinical cooperation with the need to enforce fraud, abuse and antitrust laws.“If accountable care organizations end up stifling rather than unleashing competition,” said Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the trade commission, “we will have let one of the great opportunities for slip away.”Congress’s purpose was to foster cooperation in a health care system that is notoriously fragmented. The hope was that the new law would push doctors, hospitals and other health care providers to come together and jointly take responsibility for the cost and quality of care of patients, especially Medicare beneficiaries.Experts say patients can benefit from a network of care and greater coordination between doctors and hospitals.On Tuesday, the Obama administration established a Center for Medicare and Innovation, to test new ways of coordinating and paying for services, in addition to the accountable care organizations.Hospitals have taken the lead in forming these new entities.Johns Hopkins Medicine, which operates a hospital in and 25 clinics in , has just acquired Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, 16 months after acquiring Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md.“This is being driven largely by health care reform, which demands an integrated regional network,” said Gary M. Stephenson, a Johns Hopkins spokesman.In , three of the largest hospital networks are negotiating a merger, prompted in part by the new law. In upstate New York, three regional health care systems are seeking federal permission to merge their operations, which include hospitals, clinics and in and surrounding counties.With potential efficiencies come incentives for doctors and hospitals to control costs, and a potential for abuse. Judith A. Stein, director of the nonprofit Center for Medicare Advocacy, said she was concerned that some care organizations would try to hold down costs by “cherry-picking healthier patients and denying care when it’s needed.”Under the law, Medicare can penalize organizations that avoid high-risk, high-cost patients.Peter W. Thomas, a lawyer for the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, a national advocacy group, expressed concern about the impact on patients.“In an environment where health care providers are financially rewarded for keeping costs down,” he said, “anyone who has a disability or a chronic condition, anyone who requires specialized or complex care, needs to worry about getting access to appropriate technology, medical devices and rehabilitation. You don’t want to save money on the backs of people with disabilities and chronic conditions.”Nearly one-fourth of Medicare beneficiaries have five or more chronic conditions. They account for two-thirds of the program’s spending.Elizabeth B. Gilbertson, chief strategist of a union health plan for hotel and restaurant employees, also worries that the consolidation of health care providers could lead to higher prices.“In some markets,” Ms. Gilbertson said, “the dominant hospital is like the sun at the center of the solar system. It owns physician groups, surgery centers, labs and pharmacies. Accountable care organizations bring more planets into the system and strengthen the between them, making the whole entity more powerful, with a commensurate ability to raise prices.”Doctors and hospitals say the promise of these organizations cannot be fully realized unless they get broad waivers and exemptions from the government.The has urged federal officials to “provide explicit exceptions to the antitrust laws” for doctors who participate in the new entities. The F.T.C. has accused doctors in many parts of the country of trying to fix prices by collectively negotiating fees — even though the doctors do not share financial risk and are supposedly competing with one another.Hospitals and doctors have also asked the administration to waive laws intended to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare.In a recent letter to federal officials, Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, said, “To provide a fertile field to develop truly innovative, coordinated-care models, the fraud and abuse laws should be waived altogether.”These laws are an impediment and, in some cases, “a total barrier” to creation of accountable care organizations, Mr. Kahn said, making it difficult for hospitals to reward doctors for cutting costs or following best practices.Similar legal concerns arise when health care providers want to divide up a lump sum of money provided for an episode of care. The new law encourages such “bundled payments,” which may cover the services of hospitals and doctors, as well as nursing homes and home care agencies.One of the laws, intended to protect consumers, says that a hospital cannot knowingly make a payment to a doctor “as an inducement to reduce or limit services” to Medicare or Medicaid patients. Hospitals that do so, and doctors who accept them, are subject to civil fines up to $2,000 per patient and can be barred from Medicare and Medicaid.Other laws broadly restrict financial relationships between hospitals and doctors. With some exceptions, it is a crime to pay “any remuneration” intended to induce or reward the referral of Medicare and Medicaid patients to a particular care provider.A major purpose of accountable care organizations is to encourage doctors to work closely with selected hospitals, and the rewards paid to doctors — typically, a percentage of the money saved — could run afoul of this law, hospitals and doctors say.Dr. , the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hails the benefits of “integrated care.” But, Dr. Berwick said, “we need to assure both patients and society at large that destructive, exploitative and costly forms of collusion and monopolistic behaviors do not emerge and thrive, disguised as cooperation.”'"
"'10-11-21,'0','The government official familiar with the matter confirmed the outlines of The Journal’s article, but would not say whether arrests were imminent or whether specific companies were targets.Goldman Sachs is among the firms under scrutiny, according to a person briefed on the investigation who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The person said the inquiry involved several low-level Goldman employees, not executives.Both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have taken an increasingly aggressive — and public — stance in pursuing insider trading on Wall Street. Among the government officials taking the hardest line is Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan.“Illegal insider trading is rampant and may even be on the rise,” said Mr. Bharara in a speech last month. “Disturbingly, many of the people who are going to such lengths to obtain inside information for a trading advantage are already among the most advantaged, privileged and wealthy insiders in modern finance. But for them, material nonpublic information is akin to a performance-enhancing drug that provides the illegal ‘edge’ to outpace their rivals and make even more money.”Any new charges brought by the government would come on top of a widespread insider-trading case — billed by Mr. Bharara’s office as “the largest hedge fund insider trading case in history” — that has ensnared a number of money managers and company executives, including the Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. Last week two more Wall Street traders were revealed to have pleaded guilty to securities-fraud charges, the 13th and 14th people to have pleaded guilty in the criminal case.In all, 23 people have been charged criminally in the investigation.Earlier this month a judge sentenced Ali Hariri, a former executive at Atheros Communications, a technology company, to 18 months in prison for his participation in the Galleon case. Prosecutors alleged that Mr. Hariri provided a hedge fund manager with inside information relating to his company.The “sentencing provides another reminder of how pervasive insider trading has become and the lengths to which corrupt insiders will go to misuse confidential information for their own personal gain,” Mr. Bharara said in a statement. “It should also remind those who might contemplate similar crimes that we will ultimately find you, prosecute you and convict you.”Mr. Bharara’s sharp rhetoric is evocative of the insider-trading scandal during the 1980s when Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, prosecuted Wall Street executives using laws that had rarely been enforced. (Exactly 20 years ago Sunday, a federal judge sentenced the financier Michael Milken to 10 years in prison for securities violations relating to the insider-trading scandal.)In pursuing insider-trading cases, the United States attorney’s office has adopted increasingly aggressive techniques. In the case against Mr. Rajaratnam, federal authorities took the unusual step of using wiretaps to record his and other stock traders’ conversations. Federal prosecutors have traditionally used wiretaps for organized crime and drug trafficking.A federal judge in Manhattan is weighing whether prosecutors can use thousands of wiretapped conversations between Mr. Rajaratnam and his purported accomplices at his trial, which is set for next year.Lawyers for Mr. Rajaratnam argue that the government’s use of wiretaps was improper.Any new cases brought by Mr. Bharara would add to a robust lineup of insider-trading cases.In October, a federal jury found a former hedge fund manager guilty of an insider-trading scheme that prosecutors alleged earned more than $7 million in illicit gains. Federal prosecutors had charged the trader, Joseph Contorinis of the Jefferies Paragon Fund, of trading on tips about coming mergers from an investment banker at UBS. The banker, who had already pleaded guilty, was the government’s key witness at trial.'"

In your application, focus on any relevant customer-service experience you have, even if it wasn’t a focal point of your previous jobs, because a majority of seasonal positions involve some interaction with customers, Mr. Boyer says.If your day job has you working as part of a team or in a high-intensity environment — common situations in seasonal work — be sure to highlight that.Make it clear if you can work flexible hours, especially peak hours, weekends, and more hours closer to the holidays, Ms. Fay says.Q. At the interview, what can you do to increase the chances you’ll be hired?A. More than anything else, hiring managers look for a positive attitude, so be enthusiastic at the interview, Mr. Boyer says.If you can bring certain specialized skills to the job, talk about them. “Whether it’s a certain software you know or that you have lots of experience doing phone-based customer service, you want to show how you can help the company,” Ms. Fay says.In retailing jobs, employees often get a discount on merchandise. But while that’s a nice perk, it’s not the main reason you’re applying for a job, so it’s best not to mention it.“We hear again and again that within the first two minutes of an interview the applicant mentions the discount,” Mr. Erwin says. “You are competing against a lot of good people, and that hiring manager is going to make sure whomever they bring on is someone they could potentially keep on after the first of the year. They don’t want someone just in it for the discount.”Q. Is it possible to turn a seasonal job into something permanent, or to use it as an entry point for another position?A. A temporary position can be an audition for something more permanent. Even if you aren’t doing the kind of work you would want in the long term, it’s a foot in the door, so do an outstanding job, Ms. Fay says. Be sure to let your supervisor know you’re interested in permanent work.No matter how small your seasonal role, cultivate it as much as possible, Mr. Erwin says. “Tell your boss the goals you want to accomplish while you’re there,” he says. “This brings a whole new life to the position and shows you are sincerely interested in the company, and not just for the holidays.”'"
"'10-11-21,'0','KUDOS to the Congressional Oversight Panel for publishing a thoughtful and thorough report last week on the mortgage documentation mess. It argued that, yes, in fact, these paperwork problems may have significant implications for banks, investors and the stability of the financial system.Since mortgage paperwork flaws became front-page news this fall, the banks caught in the glare have characterized the problems as technicalities that are easily remedied.Their responses sound a lot like Mike Wazowski, the assistant scarer in “Monsters, Inc.,” who is reprimanded for not turning in his daily reports. “Oh, that darn paperwork,” he tells his supervisor. “Wouldn’t it be easier if it all just ... blew away?”But the mortgage paperwork problems aren’t blowing away, and the panel report analyzes their implications in fine detail. It also questions the view, held by some overseeing the Treasury Department’s loan modification effort, that mortgage documentation errors have no impact on the program.Phyllis Caldwell, chief of the Treasury’s Homeownership Preservation Office, articulated the Treasury’s view in her testimony before the panel, according to the report. She said false affidavits and other processing flaws weren’t problematic for the government’s modification plan, known as the Home Affordable Modification Program or HAMP.Because loan modifications don’t require physical production of a mortgage and note, the Treasury has not been examining whether document flaws have an impact on its efforts, she said.Ted Kaufman, the former Delaware senator who leads the panel, saw it differently on Thursday. “Financial institutions all say everything is fine, but prudence would dictate that we make sure,” he said. “Not that we don’t trust the banks, but let’s take a hard look at this thing.”In an interview on Friday, Tim Massad, acting assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability, clarified his agency’s position. “We weren’t saying these problems aren’t serious,” he said. “They are extremely serious, they are clearly widespread, they do pose dangers and they need to be fixed. But based on the evidence today, we didn’t see a systemic risk to financial stability.”STILL, the oversight report points out problems that arise if servicers modify mortgages under HAMP when they don’t actually have the right to do so.First, the report said, borrowers may either be granted or denied modifications improperly. And paperwork errors may mean the government is paying modification bounties of $1,500 a mortgage to the wrong banks.Treasury officials told the oversight panel that if ownership of the mortgage was not properly transferred, the government could claw back incentives paid to the wrong institution.But such a solution may not be feasible, the report concluded. And even if the Treasury chased down a loan servicer to return the incentive money it received in error, the government would have essentially handed that bank an interest-free loan for the period it kept the funds.Given the size and the ambitions of HAMP, all of these problems loom large. As of October, the program had generated about 520,000 active permanent loan modifications.The report also said a lack of concern at the Treasury over paperwork flaws might lead borrowers to conclude that HAMP traffics in double standards. After all, borrowers have to provide reams of documents before receiving a modification — even though servicers don’t have to prove ownership of the note underlying a property, the report said.But the meat of the report comes in its analysis of the threats that false loan documentation may pose to banks’ balance sheets and to financial stability in the broader economy. These perils are related to the possibility that banks will have to buy back loans from investors if they were based on false documentation, or if the proper records required when setting up mortgage securities trusts were not kept, the report said.“There are scenarios whereby wholesale title and legal documentation problems for the bulk of outstanding mortgages could create significant instability in the marketplace,” the report stated.'"
"'10-11-21,'0','The research included four separate surveys, in 1997, 2000, 2003 and 2006. They tracked a cohort of 525 continuously employed Boeing workers and managers as well as scores of people who left the company during the course of the study.After generally worsening between the first and the third surveys, employee attitudes toward the company showed some improvement by the 2006 poll, as some of Boeing’s changes took root. But according to the authors, morale issues remained.One of the book’s most notable findings has to do with outsourcing. As seen in the production of the 787 Dreamliner, its new wide-body jet, the effects were decidedly double-edged. Two aims of the outsourcing were to cut costs and to gain access to more foreign markets; both of those goals were largely achieved.But the parts contracts for the 787 were let to 135 sites in two dozen countries. In theory, the parts could be snapped and fitted together — much like pieces of a model airplane — at the Boeing plant in Everett, Wash. Yet in practice, the authors say, the process proved much more complicated, “something Boeing discovered to its considerable discomfort in 2008 and 2009 when many of the sections neither snapped nor fit properly.”) Production of the 787 would fall two years behind schedule.Many survey respondents worried that outsourcing would result in “the bleeding of engineering knowledge and jobs to global partner companies, hurting both Boeing and the United States in the long run,” the book says. One engineer with 27 years of experience at Boeing opined that “we are giving away the farm.”The authors found that the decision by top management to emulate the so-called “team” model, pioneered by Japanese companies like Toyota, had a generally negative effect on employee morale rather than promoting a sense of empowerment.The authors write that “perhaps more in sorrow than in anger,” many people said that “the notion of Boeing as a family, where employees’ contributions were respected as a source of competitive advantage, was a thing of the past, replaced by Boeing as a team where people and positions were expendable or interchangeable with other workers around the world.”Perhaps even more surprising was how disaffection with the changes at Boeing permeated every level of the company. “Importantly, at the end of our study period, there was no statistical difference between the number of managers and nonmanagers regarding their intentions to quit Boeing,” the authors report, later adding that “as the organization flattened, the career ladder became compressed to a step-stool; many managers and employees felt dead-ended as opportunities for advancement seemed to evaporate.”FOR an academic study, “Turbulence” is refreshingly accessible, with a coherent narrative punctuated by no more than the minimally requisite charts, and only occasionally marred by overworking a comparison of the company-employee relationship to a failed marriage.The interview excerpts are often heart-wrenching, and the long-term, disciplined nature of the authors’ research gives their findings credibility. For these reasons alone, “Turbulence” should be required reading for anyone at a major American corporation, especially in top management.Arguably, the single glaring weakness is in the book’s prescription for fixing the workplace. Insisting that neither companies nor employees can go it alone, the authors call for government to protect American workers and provide employment opportunities through “safety net programs based on pooled-risk insurance principles.”That may sound like an ideal combination of the family model and the team model. But given the outcome of the recent midterm elections, any proposal to enlarge the role of government in the private sector is not something the American public is likely to buy into anytime soon.'"

"'10-11-21,'0','The owners, alone with their vacant building at last, removed unnecessary drywall and discovered the old majesty of the place. Pictures of the interior, impossibly lush and filigreed, surfaced online and quickly became the talk of blog town, in the way that these discoveries do. New Yorkers love something hiding in plain sight.Ms. Corr was waiting patiently for her boyfriend of six years to shut up when, to her shock, Mr. Spinner invited them inside.“I’m like, you’re letting us in a construction zone?” Ms. Corr said. “He’s like, ‘You should go up in the elevator.’ That’s when I got suspicious.”The little lift with no windows was slow going. It rumbled to a stop six floors up, and the doors opened to reveal a spectacular sight: Daylight shone down from a roof of glass, lighting floor upon floor of halls stacked around a central atrium. A few steps out of the elevator, one stood at an old iron railing, looking down all those floors and up at the sky. The elevator was like a time machine to prewar New York, and the yawning emptiness invited sepia projections from a modern imagination. How the typewriters must have sounded, the clop of polished shoes, a secretary’s splash of color amid the dark suits.And there was something else Ms. Corr saw: rose petals on the ground, leading around a corner and upstairs. Mr. Irvine said it must have been from some kind of photo shoot, but Ms. Corr was not buying it.“I was like, ‘Oh, you’re proposing,’ ” she said.Temple Court is like a groom in its own way: nervous, possessing of a very big promise. Its owners — two real estate developers, Bonjour Capital and the Chetrit Group — have been in a dispute over how to pay off a construction loan, but it appears near settlement. They expect to sell it soon to people who have plans to transform it into a high-end hotel with 200-plus rooms.To tour the fantastic, peeling shell of Temple Court and imagine the work and expense of turning it into a hotel makes one’s brain hurt. In the meantime, it is enjoying a second (third? fourth?) act as a sought-after backdrop for still and motion photography — the supermodel Iman and actors from the conspiracy thriller “Rubicon” have each faced cameras there. Thus, what once was downtown’s premier office building has become, in the name of show business, an Eastern Hemisphere prison and a forest for fairies.Between the scrape of dollies across the floor and the hum of the old elevator, stories from its real-life past — back as far as when it was little more than sketches on paper and known only as the Kelly Building — whisper in the dust.THE headline read, “The Banker Breathed His Last at 9:35 Yesterday Morning.”The banker was Eugene Kelly, 88. His physician, a Dr. McCreery, had watched him throughout the night, but according to The New York Times, “for days, he had known that the case of his patient was hopeless.”It was Dec. 19, 1894. Then, as now, a rough idea of the measure of a man could be divined from the amount of ink spilled upon his death, and for days, newspapers chronicled the life of one of the city’s most successful immigrants and, with tick-tock scrutiny, the pageantry of his memorialization.“His name is inscribed in every hearthstone in Ireland,” the Rev. Henry A. Brann eulogized at a hero’s farewell at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, where the coffin was adorned with lilies and violets. “There are tears and wailings there for his death.”Mr. Kelly had been born in the Irish village of Trillick, in County Tyrone. He came to New York in his early 20s with about 100 pounds and a job offer from Donnelly Brothers, dry goods importers. Several years later, he struck out on his own in Maysville, Ky., and, later, in St. Louis, where he opened a Donnelly Brothers branch and married a Donnelly sister, who died in 1848, leaving him a daughter.He followed the gold rush to San Francisco, opened a banking house and returned to New York, where, in 1857, he married Margaret Hughes, who was the niece of a Roman Catholic archbishop and was “noted for her good looks and charming personality,” The Times reported years later. They had five sons.The Kellys kept a stable a few doors down from their home at 33 West 51st Street and led the rarefied life of the rich. Even crime seems courtly in hindsight. Two “persistent beggars” were arrested in the area in 1893; on them was a scolding note from Mrs. Kelly: “We all heard you cursing at the door a few nights ago.”Yet Eugene and Margaret would also come to know great loss and grief. One son, Joseph, was blown off a train while moving between cars on the way to Orange, N.J., in 1889.“Old Mr. Kelly was on the train in the middle car,” the conductor said later, recalling asking passengers to break the news and, when they refused, telling Mr. Kelly himself: “ ‘My son!’ he said. ‘No, no.’ He went forward with me, however, and in passing from car to car I had to exert my utmost strength to save him and myself from being blown away.” They arrived at last at Joseph’s body. “Falling on his knees beside the body of his son, he kissed him and for a moment knelt and gazed into his face while the tears dropped from his eyes upon the cold face of the boy.”Another son, Edward, gained notoriety in 1893 when it was disclosed that he was not a bachelor, as most who knew him believed, but rather married to a Protestant. The reading of Eugene’s will in 1895 revealed a rift with a third son, Robert.Mr. Kelly died with an estimated $25 million or more — the equivalent of about $630 million today. He authorized his executors to sell his real estate holdings as they saw fit — with a caveat. “It is, however, my preference that the property known as Temple Court,” he wrote in his will, “should not be sold until, in the opinion of my Executors and Trustees, it would be clearly detrimental to the estate to hold it longer.”THE KELLY BUILDING, as it was first known, was a sensation before a single stone of the bank and the bookstore that had stood on or near 5 Beekman was demolished to make room for it. Mr. Kelly’s architects unveiled their plans in April 1881. “The new building is to cost around $400,000 and will be one of the finest in the lower part of the city,” The Times wrote.It was a time of renewed vigor downtown: coming out of the Panic of 1873, builders were looking higher than the four-story structures throughout the city, and from 1870 to 1890, 9- and 10-story buildings grew between Bowling Green and City Hall. The Kelly Building would be nine, with two corner towers stretching one story higher.Mr. Kelly’s timing was applauded by the Real Estate Record and Builders’ Guide in 1881: “The demand for offices is no longer confined to the neighborhood of the Stock, Mining, Cotton and Produce Exchanges. All the great industries which are represented in New York are using offices instead of stores, and these last are very profitable.”By March 1882, the building had been christened Temple Court, perhaps anticipating its many law offices. It was completed a year later. Clad in brick and terra cotta, a material whose popularity soared after the great fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872, it had an atrium topped with a glass pyramid that flooded the interior with sunshine.A century later, the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission would collect the overwhelmingly positive reviews: “It contains five fine passenger elevators, which give quick and easy access to all the floors” (“King’s Handbook of New York City”); “stalwart and sumptuous” (The Manhattan, a tenant); “the pioneer among the great office buildings and the beginning of the revolution in these structures” (“New York 1895. Illustrated”). Only one, from the British publication The Building News, called it “nondescript” and likened the two towers to “donkey’s ears.”Temple Court’s 212 suites were rapidly rented — by lawyers, architects, advertising and insurance companies, unions and detectives. Many suites had fireplaces, and each floor had special trapdoors, the easier to hoist safes from below. Two people were required to open the doors of a huge basement vault for safe-deposit boxes, with two sets of lock combinations, The Times reported, and the night watchman was instructed to “send electric signals to the office of the burglar Police every half hour.”The builders promised that the 165,000-square-foot behemoth was fireproof. The test came quickly.NO one was sure how the blaze started — but the best guess of its origin was the office of Miss Margaret S. Powers, a typist in Room 725 of the Nassau Street annex. It was April 2, 1893. All was well when the night watchman left at 6:30 a.m., but an hour later, the janitor, Frank Leslie, who lived on the 10th floor, found the room he shared with his wife filled with smoke so thick they could not descend. They sought refuge on the roof. Firefighters hurried.“Water, in its combat with the flames, did considerable damage on its own account,” The Times reported. “Then the wind took a turn, and, careering wildly around the doorless and windowless building, caught hold of all conceivable kinds of papers which had escaped burning, and scattered them in all directions.”Except for the poor Leslies, no one had been inside. The building held, but interior pine walls became fuel. Reports of the damage, read today, offer a time capsule to another era: a stack of $500 stocks in the Asbury Park and Loch Arbour Pier Company; thousands of envelopes bearing 2-cent stamps; a library of law books, ruined by water. In many news stories that followed, the words “fire proof” were ensconced in what later generations would call “ironic quote marks.” But the building is still standing, which is more than can be said for many of its contemporaries.THE building left the Kelly family in the 1940s, according to the landmarks report, and spent most of the years since owned by Rubin Shulsky and his daughter, Rena. Somewhere along the way, a ring of drywall went up from bottom to top, blocking the atrium from view, making the jewel seem common.Frank Lombardi worked there in the 1960s, with an energy control company; he was shocked when he stopped by recently and saw the light streaming in. “None of that was showing,” he said of the atrium. “You were looking at a wall. It was very bland and nothing there, just walls.”Another Lombardi, Joseph, of no relation, had apprenticed at Temple Court as a young man in 1956, buying sandwiches at the nearby Horn & Hardart automat. “I’d go up on the roof and look down into that atrium,” he recalled. He became an architect, rented an office in a corner tower and was eventually the last tenant in the creaky place before he left in 2001.Last summer, Mr. Spinner, the broker, invited Nick Carr, a film scout, to photograph the interior. The results, posted on Mr. Carr’s Web site ScoutingNY.com, were a sensation — so much so that Mr. Spinner asked that they be taken off the site to lessen the deluge of calls to his cellphone.Since the blog post, which Mr. Carr removed, the building is a highly sought canvas, reimagined as blown-out war zone, overseas prison, noir checkpoint, enchanted forest.The supermodel Iman, her 5-foot-9 frame riding atop heels, posed for Harper’s Bazaar on the ninth floor one recent day, still as a statue in a long gown, towering over a photographer lying on the floor. Between shots, she bent to peer over the balcony to the lobby, impervious to the vertigo the view brings in others. In a nearby room, six beefy men guarded diamond-crusted necklaces, earrings and chokers on hand for use in the shoot; outside, in a truck, sat a 150-pound ostrich, hired to pose with Iman — but exactly where was a point of contention. “It can’t fly,” the bird’s owner said, peering down from the ninth floor. “It could die.”For the AMC series “Rubicon,” Temple Court became a mysterious, foreign, black-ops torture chamber. “It looks kind of bombed out,” Tim Grimes, a set designer for the show, remembered thinking. “It didn’t look like you were in America. No America that I know, anyway.” Characters in the episode wondered aloud where they were, and one estimated the airplane that carried them there traveled 13 ½ hours. In reality, the building is perhaps a 13 ½-minute stroll from the financial district offices depicted in the show.Mr. Grimes had just one complaint: “We went in there and there was a bunch of gold glitter on the floor that we had to clean up.”The gold was from a recent shoot for international editions of Harper’s Bazaar, featuring the model Hana Soukupova. “I wanted something that brought in fairy-tale elements and a dream state,” said Kristen Ingersoll of Hearst Magazines International. “Old branches and leaves and rocks and gold pedals that we sprinkled from the ceiling to create this angelic, dreamlike state. It was like a forest you could walk through at night.”Countless stories inside the walls of Temple Court had happy endings. The Leslies, huddled for what must have seemed like forever on the roof of a burning building, were rescued. The Iman photographer and the ostrich owner compromised and took pictures on the first floor. And the girl standing above the guy with his knee on the roses said yes.There was sparkling wine on a roof, the newly engaged gaping up at the nearby Woolworth Building. Then they left, and, for the time being, the building was empty again.'"
"'10-11-21,'0','Robert Dohrenwend, 47, of Miller Place, the third-place winner, decided Main Street was an antique truck in Yaphank. Peter Dicke, 65, of Huntington, who took fourth place, chose to depict it as suburbia’s quintessential hunting-and-gathering place: — a mall, specifically, the Walt Whitman Mall in Huntington Station.“If you’re a shopper on Long Island, a mall is Main Street to you,” he said.Started three years ago, the competition was created to encourage community involvement with the society, Mr. Broege said. Agriculture was the subject of the first event. Last year’s contest had a maritime theme.At the opening, the entrants, mostly amateurs, nibbled on cheese and crackers while discussing their work, which included color and black-and-white shots. Winners received ribbons.The photos will be displayed at the society’s Riverhead headquarters, 300 West Main Street, through Dec. 18. For historical perspective, the society also displayed some selections from its collection of glass-plate negatives by Hal B. Fullerton alongside the contestants’ entries. Mr. Fullerton was a special agent for the Long Island Rail Road in the early 20th century who took pictures throughout the island to encourage rail traffic. The seven shown are street scenes, including a loaded hay wagon traveling down a prototypical Main Street — a dirt road.Ray Germann, of Huntington, the judge of the competition and a documentary photographer whose work has ranged from New York street scenes to landscapes of the American West, was impressed by the entries.His top choice was a night shot of the Stony Brook post office, which he liked because of its technical detail and visual impact, he said.The winner, Virginia Bushart, 65, flushed with embarrassment at the attention, said she almost did not attend the event because she did not like competitions. But, she added, she is proud of her photo, which shows off the building’s illuminated facade and the warm glow of lights from adjoining shops on either side.In the opinion of Ms. Bushart, a longtime Stony Brook resident, the setting is a Norman Rockwell painting come to life — a community focal point where people sit on the steps eating ice cream and where tethered dogs await their owners picking up the mail.“I’ve taken my kids and now my grandchildren there over the years,” she said. “I think what I love about it is its reliability.”Taking a different view was Diane Tucci, 40, a fourth-generation Riverhead woman who worried about the sustainability of Main Streets in America, especially her own. She saw it changing in front of her eyes, and not necessarily for the better.The photo she entered in the contest shows an elderly man walking in downtown Riverhead while peering into the closed storefronts. His hands are clasped behind his back, and Ms. Tucci imagines him remembering better times.“Why is it we have such a beautiful setting for this town right on the Peconic River and yet nothing thrives here?” she said.Ms. Tucci has taken this very stroll herself, she said, and has had many of the same forlorn thoughts she imagined her subject having. She gestured at the historic Fullerton photos on display, then back at her own.“Maybe one day this picture will be the only thing left” of Main Street, she said. “It’ll be like one of those shots of a horse and carriage.”'"
"'10-11-21,'0','In August, to be closer to my aging parents, my husband and I moved from to Orange County. My family settled there more than 30 years ago, not long after coming to the from . I was 12, and the culture shock was pretty severe. There were moms in tennis skirts, dads in pastels, good-looking blond boys who surfed and good-looking blond girls who were born to wear bikinis. We were the only dark-haired people they’d ever met who didn’t speak Spanish. When I left for college, I told myself that I’d never live in such a homogeneous place again. Today the are still beautiful and surfers still ride the waves, but the blonds are in the minority.The closest market to our new house is a chaotic Persian supermarket usually filled with Chinese and Hispanic customers as well as people from just about every country associated with terrorists, floods and dictators. It’s the kind of place you might call “charming” until the third time the lady in front of you stops next to the pomegranates, jujubes or prickly pears, blocking the aisle with her cart to greet her friend with a kiss on each cheek and five minutes of pleasantries.My husband, François, goes to this market every day to buy fresh sangak, a Persian flatbread three feet long. He grew up in on fresh baguettes but has effortlessly switched allegiances. After returning from a business trip recently, he hugged me and told me how much he missed sangak. The bakery in the market opens at 7 a.m. We try to avoid the line during the day, because it is very long and very slow and the smell of fresh bread we can’t wait to eat makes time go by even more slowly. In order to control the chaos, the owners put up signs, like the one limiting each person to two fresh sangak. This means that if you want, say, eight sangak for your dinner party, you can either go four times or send three relatives, perhaps cousin­ Mahmood, Aunt Fakhri and Uncle Nematollah, to buy two sangak each. Let’s just say I know that this is done.Another sign warns against cutting in the sangak line. When we first came to America in 1972, my father was amazed at the way Americans waited in line at . No complaints, no cutting. In Iran, we have zerangi, a concept that loosely means “cleverness.” Zerangi can be both ethical and unethical. Coming to America and starting a successful business? That’s zerangi. Finding a way to avoid paying ? Also zerangi. Moving ahead in a long line? Zerangi at its finest. François likes to remind me that people from all cultures cut in line, including his own. True, but I like to think my people have turned it into an art form.A few Saturdays ago, we got to the market a bit late. I was behind an Iranian man who from the back looked like at least 12 of my cousins. As we waited, another Iranian man came to the front of the line and started asking the first guy in Persian if he could cut behind him. I don’t look Iranian, so he must have thought that I didn’t understand and that he was being very clever. I was about to give him a piece of my mind, but before I could say anything, François showed up with our youngest, who wanted a scoop of gelato, which is in the back of the store, next to six varieties of Feta cheese. “Can you take her,” he asked, “and I’ll wait in line?”'"
"'10-11-21,'0','Suzanne Berne’s father lost his mother to cancer when he was still a small boy. Not only did she leave her children bereaved — she also left them perplexed: “We were told she was gone. No one ever said where.”All these years later, reflecting on her now frail father’s long-held conviction that he was somehow deserted, Berne begins to believe that her grandmother Lucile’s absence is not only “the most significant thing about her,” but also “the Rosetta stone by which all subsequent family guilt and unhappiness could be decoded.” Partly in an attempt to lay a ghost to rest, partly to nourish her own difficult relationship with her father and partly because, let’s face it, novelists (myself included) are always suckers for family secrets, Berne sets out to see what can be found of her grandmother.It’s a quest toward which (in theory, anyway) I’m very sympathetic. It’s easy to like Berne’s good-hearted curiosity and her desire to replace an absence with a presence, to dignify a “lost” soul with some kind of biography. The moments when she uncovers some fact or photograph and offers it to her father are honest and tender. This journey, this book, is undertaken with gusto and sensitivity. And I’ve been in those libraries, struggled with those archives, attempted to decipher those murky photographs that seem to suggest both so much and so little. Such searches take passion, energy and love, and Berne displays all three. In short, this is my kind of book. Why, then, did I find it so arduous?The facts are not uninteresting. Lucile Kroger’s father grows up above his own father’s little dry-goods store “breathing the anxious air of retail” (a typically crunchy Berne phrase), only to get rich when he founds the Kroger supermarket chain. Lucile and her siblings are raised in the Midwest amid substantial wealth. Lucile goes to Wellesley, the first person in her family to attend college. She spends World War I working for her father before leaving for France, where she joins a Wellesley reconstruction unit, helping to repair the war-torn country. After a year she returns home, and meets and marries Berne’s grandfather, a baritone singer. She has two boys but dies from abdominal cancer in her early 40s.Berne has said that she originally thought of writing her grandmother’s life as a novel, and you can see why. She’s a first-rate fiction writer, and the passages where she quits her detective-style ruminating and allows herself to bounce off on some imaginative tangent are by far the most vivid and successful in the book. Skies and flowers burst to life. History turns from black and white into Techni­color. You can smell the air, feel the breeze on your cheek. People have conversations that sound credible and alive.

"'10-11-21,'0','VOGUE.com featured a flattering and splashy photo spread last month of the model Coco Rocha’s Gramercy Park-area apartment, in a new feature on the celebrities of the fashion world — the magazine’s “favorite people” — and the places they live.While describing how much fun she had redesigning the two-bedroom apartment, Ms. Rocha, 22, did not say in the Vogue article that the condominium, on East 23rd Street, had gone on the market in late August with an asking price of $1.65 million.Ms. Rocha has caused something of a stir in the world of modeling on the issue of extreme thinness, speaking out about other models’ being too skinny and saying earlier this year that she, at a Size 4, had received fewer runway jobs after refusing to starve herself.Despite the publicity in Vogue, her apartment has been on the market for almost three months and the price was recently reduced to $1.59 million. And Ms. Rocha would like to sell so she and her husband, James Conran, an artist whom she met while he was doing some painting in her apartment and whom she married in June, can move to Brooklyn, preferably into a loft in Williamsburg.“I’m kind of getting over the whole Manhattan life,” she said in an interview. “I’m from Vancouver, and that means mountains and a lot of space.” (She acknowledged there are no mountains in Williamsburg.)'"
"'10-11-21,'0','Perth Amboy’s mayor, Wilda Diaz, sounded all the same themes when she spoke about the city in a recent interview, although to her mind, there is never anything accidental about finding attractive real estate here.“Perth Amboy has so much to offer,” she said. “No matter what happens — and it’s hard to believe all the things that the city has gone through, sometimes — we are always working to create new opportunities.”In 2008 Ms. Diaz, who was brought up in a local public housing project, rose to become the first woman to be elected mayor, defeating Joseph Vas, an 18-year incumbent. The city certainly has battle scars, she said, and even some open wounds.She inherited a $7 million budget deficit after taking office from Mr. Vas, who had spearheaded redevelopment but was convicted last month in federal court on charges of corruption and trying to misdirect redevelopment funds to his Congressional campaign.These days Ms. Diaz is trying to dismiss that activity as “ancient history.” But others see the city’s reputation as badly tarnished. Last month, a city councilman suggested that Perth Amboy should file a “victim statement” at Mr. Vas’s sentencing hearing next January. And the local Business Improvement District hired a public relations firm to help scrub residual stains from Perth Amboy’s image.Earlier this year the city suffered another blow when it abruptly lost $15 million in school funding, as Gov. Christopher J. Christie imposed a freeze on state spending. (Perth Amboy officials filed suit to block Mr. Christie’s move, but lost in appellate court in June.)Ms. Diaz managed to muscle through deep job cuts and also moved to consolidate city departments to balance the municipal budget, but taxes went up in each of the last two years.None of this is a deterrent to Ms. Cepeda, one of three Staten Islanders who signed contracts at the Bay View building in recent months. She said she and Mr. Li saw their purchase as not only a bargain, but also a “sensible investment.” The unit was listed for $395,000.“There is no shortage of people interested in moving to Perth Amboy from New York,” said Susan Hoagland, the real estate agent handling sales at the Bay View, which has six more units available. “One reason is that prices are so attractive right now. They are lower here than even the outer boroughs — and so values are pretty much guaranteed to rise.”The Bay View is the third structure to be built as part of the Landings at Harborside, by the Kushner Companies. The Harborside project was planned as a $600 million mixed-use development, but the ailing economy and Kushner’s move out of New Jersey have forced a change, said Helga van Eckert, the city’s economic and community development director.Still, Ms. van Eckert added, the first Bay View building and a condominium called the Admiral are close to fully occupied. (A second, 10-unit Bay View building at the edge of the water is being completed now.)And the city continues to grow, the mayor says proudly. “We hope — and believe — the official population will rise to 50,000 when the next census results are announced early next year,” Ms. Diaz said. She campaigned in English and Spanish in neighborhoods believed to have been undercounted in the 2000 census, she said, because of their high proportion of immigrant residents. According to past census figures, about 70 percent of Perth Amboy’s citizens are of Hispanic origin.Ms. Diaz urged residents to stand and be counted so the city would receive its due under federal and state financing formulas.“We are growing, and we will have a stronger future because of that,” the mayor said in an interview at Perth Amboy’s historic City Hall. (In 1789, state leaders gathered at City Hall to ratify the Bill of Rights, and New Jersey became the first state to do so. In 1870, the first black voter cast his ballot there.)'"
"'10-11-21,'0','Shorthand is essential in television, and Mr. Wright displays a facility for pithy description in person and on the page. He says television made him better at communicating information to an audience quickly, pointing to a speech in “Mistakes” in which he signals that Felix lost a daughter through the way Felix describes the plot of a play — an indirect and rather elegant solution.Theresa Rebeck, whose dramas include “The Understudy” and “The Scene,” said she picked up similar skills working on “NYPD Blue.” “I learned that even when people were just walking down a hall, the scene had to have something interesting,” she said. She added that David Milch, a creator of that show, was “the only person to ever teach me about writing.” She added, “He was ruthless about detail and language.”But size matters too. Since TV dramas weave multiple narratives through an entire season, a refined sense of structure is as necessary as economy. Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, who wrote for “Big Love,” said that handling so many story lines was invaluable in building the revised book to the 1966 musical “It’s a Bird{hellip}It’s a Plane{hellip}It’s Superman,” which had a run this summer at the Dallas Theater Center.“A musical is more epic than a play,” he said. “So working in TV, where you have a large canvas, helps.” Writing about the patriarch of a polygamist Mormon family, he added, was an unlikely help in figuring out Superman.“Anyone can make the villains in ‘Superman’ interesting,” he said. “But how do you make the hero compelling? You have a similar challenge with Bill Paxton on ‘Big Love.’ Because of my experience in TV I better knew how to make Superman have drive and passion,”Television arguably has more in common with theater than movies. “Television is about scenes between people talking,” said Eric Overmyer, who wrote the acclaimed drama “On the Verge” before focusing on high-end television series like “The Wire” and “Treme.” “It might erupt in a gunfight, but it’s still carried along by dialogue.”For writers the primary difference may be the process. With network executives and large staffs of producers and writers, television has far more cooks in the kitchen than does theater. That can water down a script and lead to decisions based more on business than on artistic concerns. But dismissing TV as art by committee is an oversimplification.Certain writers, like Mr. Overmyer, have enough clout to avoid interference. And many argue that there are benefits to teamwork. “TV makes you a better listener,” said Stephen Belber, who maintains that experience on a network series helped him integrate personal experience and research to write his recent, well-received drama “Dusk Rings a Bell.” “I remember a show runner at ‘Law & Order’ giving me eight hours of notes. I thought: ‘I am a playwright. What about my voice?’ But I had to learn how to take these notes and solve them while keeping my voice.”Adam Rapp said he derided such collaboration when he started as a playwright. “I used to think TV was just selling soap, and judged those who went to the West Coast for six figure salaries,” he said, adding that working on series like Showtime’s “L Word” and, currently, HBO’s “In Treatment” changed his mind. “In my early work I embellished too much. I would become overwrought. You can’t do that in TV. You learn to use subtext more.”Collaboration, Mr. Wright said, means something different in the theater: “It means the lighting designer does their thing, the playwright sits in the back of the room looking slightly annoyed, and the director works hard to get the playwright to believe it’s working.”The writers’ room on a television show has a very different dynamic. The 27-year-old playwright Carly Mensch (“Now Circa Then”) said working on Showtime’s “Weeds” taught her how to take criticism. “In theater the human factor seems much more involved,” she said. “People don’t want to hurt each other’s feelings.”There may be a generational divide too. Many playwrights who hit the scene before “The Wire” and “The Sopranos” were more conflicted about working for television. But younger playwrights like Ms. Mensch and Mr. Aguirre-Sacasa seem less so. “I can’t think of a peer who doesn’t either work in TV or want to,” Mr. Aguirre-Sacasa said.If the stigma of working in television is fading, what does it mean for the future of theater if most of its best playwrights are, so to speak, part timers? Ms. Norman says her biggest worry is about playwrights under 35 who think they will go to Hollywood and then return to write their great play. “It doesn’t always work that way,” she said. “You need to get your angry plays early. Those are the plays you don’t want to lose — the wild things from nowhere.”But Ms. Rebeck finds snobbery toward television a waste of time, and no help to the theater either. “Going to TV doesn’t ruin your writing,” she said. “You know what ruins your writing? Not writing”'"

"'10-11-22,'0','So it was a surprise to many when Mr. Kontilai announced on Aug. 18 that he had bought the 31-year-old “Nightly Business Report,” which draws some 500,000 viewers nightly, from the Miami public television station WPBT.Mr. Kontilai’s business partner, Gary L. Ferrell, a former president and chief executive of North Texas Public Broadcasting, first approached WPBT in the summer of 2009. Talks about a joint venture turned to those about an outright sale early this year, before PBS told the station it would cut funding for “Nightly Business Report” to $1.3 million a year, from $2.6 million, on July 1. Before the sale, the program’s total annual budget was $6 million to $8 million.“We were challenged, and the purchase of the program by Mykalai was a positive for us,” said Rodney Ward, who was the program’s executive editor and recently became executive vice president for special projects at NBR Worldwide, the owner of the program.Rick Schneider, WPBT’s president, said in a recent interview that the pending reduction was just one factor in the sale.Neither side will discuss the price.Mr. Kontilai also will not discuss who invested what he says was “well over a million dollars,” calling it only a New York “institutional firm.” Mr. Kontilai, who has majority control, said he personally put in “very little” money.After other executives with knowledge of the situation said the firm was Atalaya Capital Management, Michael Bogdan, a partner there, confirmed the investment via e-mail. Atalaya’s investments include the alternative newspaper company Creative Loafing.Mr. Kontilai, a native of Des Plaines, Ill., a Chicago suburb, was born Michael Contile to Italian immigrants, but changed his name in 1998, he said, so that phonetically, it would mimic the Italian pronunciation. He graduated from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale in 1991 with a degree in speech communications.After moving to San Diego, Mr. Kontilai was hired at an educational video company. But in 1993, he struck out on his own, opening Mykalai Kontilai Companies, which had subsidiaries known as MK Companies, MK Enterprises, MK Entertainment, MK Television and the Televised Learning Company.“It was a very successful business for about six years,” he said in the interview. “I really shook things up,” he said, by offering public TV stations cheaper packages and better rights to instructional shows.He said some of the established players in the field were unhappy because of his pro-station stance. But that is not what one company he represented remembered.“Sadly, we’ve had business experiences together,” said Michael Hartogs, an owner of Landmark Media, in Falls Church, Va., for whom Mr. Kontilai distributed educational video. The first order, he said, “worked out. He got paid and he paid me, and that was the last payment I got. He still owes me today about $110,000.”Mr. Kontilai acknowledged that when the Mykalai Kontilai Companies closed, which he said was because of changing technology, unpaid debts remained.Another company, AGC/United Learning, sued Mr. Kontilai in 2000, alleging fraud and claiming estimated damages of $250,000. In a settlement, Mr. Kontilai agreed to get out of the instructional programming business, said Ronald E. Reed, a former president of AGC/United Learning.“We felt, from our point of view, that it would be best not to have him in the industry,” Mr. Reed said in an interview by phone, after “what we considered to be inappropriate business practices.” He declined to elaborate, citing a privacy agreement. But Mr. Reed said he was surprised five years later, when he discovered that Mr. Kontilai was still in business.Mr. Kontilai said that under the settlement, “full payment was made to AGC” and that there was “absolutely no stipulation that I would leave the business.”The disputes did not end there. In 2004, Mr. Kontilai said, he began working for a company called Teacher’s Choice, which ran the Scholastic ETV Consortium, which sold to public stations the rights to educational programming from Scholastic Inc., the large children’s media company.Several stations ended their contracts early, saying they did not get what they paid for. Scholastic Inc. declined to discuss its dealings with Teacher’s Choice, but said in a statement, “Scholastic was dissatisfied with Mr. Kontilai as a distributor of Scholastic product, and we terminated all business dealings with him in 2007.”Mr. Kontilai said he was just a marketing consultant to Teacher’s Choice, but a dozen executives across the country said they dealt almost exclusively with him.In recent years, Mr. Kontilai has dabbled in the mixed martial arts business. He represented several fighters free, including Tito Ortiz. Mr. Kontilai, with his business partner, Mr. Ferrell, was hired briefly by Xyience, a nutritional supplement company that is a sponsor of the sport, to find ways for its Xenergy drink to become a public television sponsor. He said he and Mr. Ferrell quit after not being paid.He did introduce the chief executive of Xyience to John Orecchio, a private equity fund manager and personal sponsor of Mr. Ortiz. Mr. Orecchio’s company, AA Capital Partners, invested about $23 million in Xyience, and AA Capital rewarded Mr. Kontilai with two million Xyience shares. (Mr. Orecchio is now in prison for embezzlement in an unrelated transaction.)Mr. Kontilai tried to finance a new public television program called “Collectors’ Café,” a collectibles show with a co-branded cafe chain, by selling off portions of that stake. But one company that bought more than $1 million worth of shares from him, AJB Investments, demanded its money back as the company faltered. Xyience filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The dispute ended up in court before being dropped in May. Mr. Kontilai declined to say why. “Collector’s Café” has yet to get off the ground.Under Mr. Kontilai’s ownership, “Nightly Business Report” has opened a San Jose, Calif., bureau in partnership with the public station there, KTEH, and added Rick Horrow, a sports business expert, to the lineup. Daily operations of the program are now being overseen by Mr. Ferrell, who on Nov. 10 was named executive vice president of operations and chief financial officer of NBR Worldwide.As for some of the other plans Mr. Kontilai mentioned, a spokeswoman for the Defense Department, Maj. Monica Bland, confirmed that Mr. Kontilai had proposed a program for returning veterans. But he was told that “in light of our comprehensive budget review efforts, O.S.D. was not starting any new programs,” she said, referring to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.Susie Gharib, an anchor of “Nightly Business,” said she knew Mr. Kontilai socially before the purchase. She says he is “very inspirational” and has “brought tremendous new energy to ‘Nightly Business Report.’ He’s also brought the spirit of entrepreneurship.” Of the past accusations against him, she said: “I’m not looking at all backward. I don’t know anything about any of that. He’s very dedicated to the program; that’s what’s important to me.”Mr. Bogdan at Atalaya Capital said in an e-mail, “Mr. Kontilai’s NBR business plan, his overall business successes and the high respect he has with key leaders within the public television community, we believe, will ensure the success of the business.” He added that the company considered his business troubles “irrelevant in these circumstances.”Some public television executives who had past dealings with Mr. Kontilai have called Mr. Schneider, WPBT’s president, with concerns. But Mr. Schneider said Mr. Kontilai should be judged going forward, adding, “I think he’s a big ideas guy, he’s optimistic and visionary and aspirational, and if he is able to deliver on or follow through on just a part of what his dreams for the program are, he’ll be very successful.”'"
"'10-11-22,'0','“The whole trial has been a nightmare since the disputes between judges and the prosecutor began in 2008,” said William A. Schabas, who teaches human rights law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and follows the court. Relations between the bench and the prosecution have become “ugly and unhealthy,” he said. “There appears almost a breakdown between the two sides.”Mr. Lubanga, 49, a onetime psychology student, has sat through the proceedings variously wearing a dark suit or African robes, looking somber and impassive, sometimes staring at witnesses. He was sent to The Hague in 2006 by Congolese authorities who had imprisoned several militia leaders from the Democratic Republic of Congo’s complex wars — involving years of protracted fighting fueled by ethnic strife and rivalries for power and mineral riches. Mr. Lubanga’s group, the Union of Congolese Patriots, was among the militias accused of massacring civilians in 2002 and 2003.Prosecutors say that Mr. Lubanga was accountable for the enlisting, often by force, of several thousand boys and girls, some as young as 8, who were drugged and trained to kill, steal or mutilate civilians, and in the case of girls, to provide sex to militiamen. The prosecution presented video of Mr. Lubanga visiting militia camps in the presence of child soldiers.The defense maintains that Mr. Lubanga was only a political leader who did no military recruiting and instead tried to demobilize children fighting in his group. It argues that he is a scapegoat for more senior leaders, some now part of Congo’s military or the government.At the start of the trial, which was postponed numerous times, the chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, presented it as a signature case that would show the world the atrocious plight of child soldiers and their destroyed lives.The United Nations has estimated that child soldiers — defined as younger than 15 — fight in at least a dozen armed conflicts around the world.But public knowledge of the trial, even among victims’ groups trying to follow it in Congo, has been limited by the mix of legal wrangling and the secrecy of the proceedings.Many witnesses, including 10 presented as former child soldiers, have testified behind closed doors, either to protect their privacy or because they feared reprisals at home. Lawyers have also asked to close sessions to the public because they fear witnesses may inadvertently divulge confidential material.“It’s still not clear to me if this is a strong case, if all this time and effort was worthwhile,” said Lorraine Smith, a lawyer monitoring the trial for the International Bar Association. “The substance of the case got lost in the procedural tangle; even the record is not clear because transcripts are missing or blacked out.”Some chilling details have come out in the trial. One witness broke down in court when he talked of the moment when the militia killed his mother while he and his siblings hid under the bed. Another, a former girl soldier, told the court that she was abducted by the militia at age 13, and taken to a training camp.She said recruits were shaved with broken glass and “some of us were wounded.” Training began at 4 a.m., boys and girls were often whipped for the slightest mistake and girls had to sleep with the commanders, she said.Victims, who have been allowed to join the case as “civil parties,” an innovation at the court, have protested that the prosecution has produced a narrow indictment of Mr. Lubanga, focusing on one charge and omitting the killing and the sexual violence of his group.“Congo has among the highest sexual violence in the world — it’s unfathomable that they brought no such charges,” said Bridgid Inder of the Women’s Initiatives for Gender Justice, one of the rights groups following the trial. She said that from the start, her group had brought large-scale rape in military camps and villages to the attention of the investigators but that it was ignored.“This was the chance to address the constant raping of the girl soldiers,” she said.The panel of three international judges has heard regularly about rape from witnesses for both the defense and the prosecution. But defense lawyers stopped further questioning about it, saying it was not part of the charges against Mr. Lubanga.Fatou Bensouda, the court’s deputy prosecutor, said in an interview that the trial intended to focus on child conscription as a whole, because it was a serious problem in many places. Mr. Lubanga was charged with child conscription, she said, “because that is where we had the best evidence at the time.”Lawyers in The Hague say they are puzzled that the first trial, dealing with a single issue, has taken so long. They point to more than a decade of experience in international tribunals dealing with Rwanda, Sierra Leone and the former Yugoslavia.“Instead of learning of their mistakes or adopting their best practices, this court has tried to reinvent the wheel,” said Ms. Smith, of the International Bar Association.The most serious errors in the eyes of the judges is that investigators for the prosecution collected evidence from United Nations staff members and rights groups in Congo and gave assurances that they would not disclose the identities of the sources. While the prosecution tried to insert much of that anonymous evidence in its case, the rules dictate that such material can be used only if its sources are disclosed to the judges and the defense.“Those investigators have now left, but we’ve spent three years undoing the damage and getting permission from sources,” said one prosecution official.Another problem arose because investigators had worked with outside intermediaries in Congo who served as local contacts and introduced possible witnesses. Prosecutors said such people were indispensable in a place where they have no office and are not familiar with the territory and the culture. But judges were furious when prosecutors refused orders to provide the names of some intermediaries because they had to be moved first to a safer place.Some lawyers following the trial believe that the court may expedite the pace now that a second trial was started this year and a third trial was to begin on Monday.The optimistic view is that the pitfalls of the first trial will serve to strengthen the institution.Tracey Gurd, senior advocacy officer for the Open Society Justice Initiative, a legal rights advocacy group, said in an appraisal of the case last January that the court’s effort to protect Mr. Lubanga’s rights had “helped build confidence that the I.C.C. is an institution determined to be fair.”But the outcome of the Lubanga trial is still uncertain. Later this month, the defense will rest its case, and Catherine Mabille, the lead lawyer, has said that she would ask the court to dismiss the case.'"

"'10-11-22,'0','Re “Putting Money on Lawsuits, Investors Share in the Payouts” (“Betting on Justice” series, front page, Nov. 15):Some critics of litigation finance claim that investors will stir up lawsuits among average citizens who would otherwise not be interested in suing for some slight harm. The MC Mojave case, in which elderly residents “discovered” that they were suing a homebuilder after they agreed to free home inspections, has been cited as an example of litigation finance run amok.The MC Mojave case did not involve litigation finance, as that term is commonly understood. The defendant home inspectors did not invest a single penny in the lawsuits at issue in that case. They stood to benefit from a corrupt bargain they struck with the lawyers who brought lawsuits based on the inspections.Those lawyers paid the home inspectors $500 for every client they referred to the lawyers, and even more when the lawyers settled a suit. In other words, MC Mojave involved a different problem — lawyers using unethical means to solicit clients.The MC Mojave case is disturbing because many of the elderly homeowners felt as if they had no control over the litigation handled by their lawyers. Litigation finance is the antidote to this problem, not its cause.By providing capital directly to persons who want to bring lawsuits, third-party investors support litigation without taking control over that litigation. Litigation finance, properly understood, can help individuals and small businesses regain control from lawyers and powerful defendants.The writer is a professor at the Benjamin N.

"'10-11-22,'0','For most Muslims, the holiday, which ended Friday night, is a joyful time with a charitable theme: according to tradition, a third of the slaughtered meat is to be given to relatives, and a third to the poor. It is a welcome gift in Egypt, where the price of meat has been rising and many families cannot afford it.What bothers Ms. Abaza and other activists is not the principle of Id al-Adha — the Feast of Sacrifice — which commemorates the biblical story in which God allows Abraham to slaughter a ram instead of his own son. Nor do they object to animal slaughter itself (Ms. Abaza is not a vegetarian).Instead, they complain that many butchers fail to abide even by Islam’s own strictures: that the animal should not be mistreated, and should not see or hear other animals being killed.Amateurs slaughter their own sheep at home in many Arab countries, with no special training on how to spare the animals pain. It is common to see men hurling terrified sheep into the backs of trucks, and beating the animals as they herd them to the killing grounds. In abattoirs, some workers sodomize the beasts with knives to drive them into the pens, Ms. Abaza and other activists said.“If you want to give a good image of Muslims and the Koran, why do you do this?” Ms. Abaza said, her operatic voice rising in indignation. “Why are we Muslims the ones known for this kind of behavior?”Ms. Abaza and a small but growing band of fellow activists have had some impact. In 2006 she helped an Australian reporter film at a slaughterhouse with a hidden camera. The resulting exposé created a scandal in Australia, and soon afterward the Australian government suspended shipping live sheep to Egypt.That got Ms. Abaza some attention, most of it negative. “People think we are attacking Islam,” she said. “They accuse you of being an American, a Jew, a Freemason.”It is true that Westerners tend to recoil a bit from the mass slaughter that takes place on Id al-Adha, despite the reality that plenty of animals are slaughtered in the West in ways that make animal rights activists cringe. Muslims can be sensitive about the Western reaction, and Ms. Abaza, who grew up here in a wealthy Francophone family, is an easy target.When she first started her organization in 2001, the Society for the Protection of Animal Rights in Egypt, her rhetoric was largely borrowed from similar Western groups.“Then I discovered that there are animal rights in Islam,” she said. “Once we started using the Islamic arguments, they didn’t attack us as much.”Some religious authorities agree with Ms. Abaza, but they rarely raise their voices, certainly not on the Adha holiday.“Muslims are passing through a period of degeneration where they are applying the Shariah law circumstantially and moodily,” said Sheik Ahmed al-Baba, a prominent Sunni cleric and member of the Islamic Endowment Council in Lebanon. “Some ordinary people do the slaughtering process and in a wrong way. They don’t have experience, they don’t know we are obliged not to harm the animal.”In fact, the Koran and the Islamic written traditions that form Shariah, or religious law, specify minimum ages for animals to be slaughtered, and provide details about avoiding any unnecessary pain, Sheik Baba said.In fairness, those rules are difficult to apply on a large scale. At the Basateen slaughterhouse, near the vast cemetery known as the City of the Dead, butchers stride about in knee-high rubber boots, surrounded by lakes of feces, blood and urine. It was here that the Australian reporter documented animal abuses in 2006.But the procedures do not appear to have changed. On Monday, one butcher described it this way: “We just throw them on their sides and cut their throats and say ‘Allahu Akbar.’ ” Asked whether the beasts were able to see and hear others being killed, he replied: “Sure, why not?”As for Ms. Abaza, she chose to celebrate the holiday in her own unique way. She drove to the local sheep market, where she bought a female sheep for 1,000 Egyptian pounds (about $175) and asked the butchers to load it in the back of her S.U.V. The men offered to slaughter it for her, and on hearing that she planned to “rescue” it, they could not contain their mirth. She paid no attention.“Baaaa! You’re lucky!” she said jauntily, beaming at the animal.She then drove to her ramshackle farm in the town of Sakara, on the outskirts of Cairo, where she keeps donkeys and sheep as pets. On the way, she groaned as she passed trucks full of sheep headed for slaughter, and dozens of fly-specked animal carcasses hanging in the sun.“It’s a bloody day,” she said scornfully. “I hate this feast. Millions will be killed.”'"
"'10-11-22,'0','The first act of “Knock Me a Kiss,” a dandy play about the ill-advised marriage of W. E. B. Du Bois’s daughter, is such rollicking fun that you may find yourself worrying at the intermission about whether there’s any way this production can successfully work itself around to the serious part of the story that you know lies ahead. But somehow it does, keeping its sense of humor but muzzling it just enough to allow some drama and poignancy to enter the mix.The play, by Charles Smith, is a fictional imagining of a well-known real-life story: how in 1928 in the midst of the Harlem Renaissance, Yolande Du Bois (Erin Cherry), only child of one of the century’s leading black figures, married the poet Countee Cullen (Sean Phillips) in a ceremony that rivaled a royal wedding. The marriage quickly fell apart, apparently after Cullen told his new wife that he preferred men.Mr. Smith’s smart script assumes that you’re aware of the rough outlines of this tale, and it derives its considerable humor from the advantage you enjoy over the characters, especially the clueless Yolande and her mother (Marie Thomas) and father (André De Shields). And this is decidedly not a W.Bois hagiography: the great man’s flaws, especially his odd ideas about love and marriage, are on full display, and Mr. De Shields expertly lets you laugh at them without allowing the role to degenerate into parody.The Du Bois characters may get the focus, but it is the performances in two secondary roles that really keep the zip in this production by the Legacy Creative Arts Company and Woodie King Jr.’s New Federal Theater. Gillian Glasco brings sass and nice comic timing to her role as Yolande’s friend and confidante. And Morocco Omari, as the slick, slang-slinging jazzman whom Yolande really loves, starts things off with a dazzling opening scene and turns up just often enough to re-energize the proceedings when they seem about to flag.There are moments in the second act when the play seems less like a work about the past and more like a work from the past — a bit of melodramatic excess creeps in — but Chuck Smith, the director, keeps this to a minimum. He also does as well as possible within the confines of dingy Abrons Arts Center space, delivering an engaging, well-acted production that deserves a better theater and a longer run.'"
"'10-11-22,'0','In early trading Monday, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, rose 0.8 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London rose 0.6 percent. The euro rose to $1.3747 from $1.3673 late Friday in New York.Bond prices reacted positively as well. The Irish 10-year yield fell 18 basis points, but — at 7. 73 percent — still carried a hefty premium to the comparable German bond, the European benchmark, which ticked up 2 basis points to 2.72 percent.“It’s a step in the right direction,” Henk Potts, a fund manager at Barclays Stockbrokers in London, said of the Ireland rescue, “but we need to see more detail,” particularly on how much money is actually on the table and how it will be distributed. Those details will be worked out over the coming days.“E.U. officials may have won the battle,” Mr. Potts said, “but the war is still to be fought.”The Irish finance minister, Brian Lenihan, said Monday that the rescue package could quickly put the nation back on course to borrow money in international bond markets.“The view in the discussions to date has been that the provision of this large facility may enable Ireland to return to the bond markets very quickly,” Mr. Lenihan told the Irish national broadcaster RTE on Monday.The loans to Ireland were necessary in large part because of the faltering state of the nation’s banking system, underscoring the extent to which ailing banks remain a threat to recovery two years after the financial crisis rippled through economies and pressured banks around the world into accepting bailouts.Ireland’s aid will come from a rescue mechanism worth roughly $1 trillion that was set up in May by the E.U. and the I.M.F. to help euro zone countries spiraling toward default.Government officials hope that the large commitment of money will calm investors and keep the crisis from spreading to Portugal and even Spain. It was fear of a market panic and looming contagion that prompted officials to press Ireland to accept aid early before its debt problem got out of control.Some economists point out that the yields Greece must pay on its bonds are higher now than before its rescue, raising concerns that confidence in the fiscal health of troubled countries remains low.Others, however, say that decisive action is what is needed to shift momentum toward recovery. “This may be an inflection point, when we stop digging a hole and start creating the conditions for reversing where we have slipped to,” said Pat Cox, an economist and former president of the European Parliament.Prime Minister Brian Cowen said at a news conference on Sunday night that there would be two funds. One will back up the country’s failing banks, and another will allow Ireland to continue government operations without turning to the bond markets for help, something Dublin has said it cannot afford. The package should allow Ireland to operate without funds from the markets for as long as three years.The request for help was a humbling turnabout for Ireland, which just last week was insisting it could manage its own finances. It does not view itself as being as profligate or irresponsible as Greece was in running up deficits, and has been preparing a four-year budget plan filled with sharp cutbacks that is intended to reduce its deficit to 3 percent, from 32 percent, of gross domestic product.But the Irish government has been sinking further and further into debt since its 2008 decision to protect its banks from all losses. The banking system had become so weakened that it could not afford to wait any longer for help.“This is a difficult time for the country,” Mr. Cowen said. “We have seen abnormal market conditions, so we have had to step out of the markets. We are determined to deal with the issues that have arisen, and we will soon have our public finances in order.”While a precise breakdown was not given, analysts and people involved in the talks said that about €15 billion was likely to go to backstop the banks. As much as €60 billion would go to Ireland’s annual budget deficit of €19 billion for the next three years.Mr. Cowen said that a negotiation would begin with the I.M.F. to discuss the specifics of the loan, although it was made clear that the interest rate would be lower than the 8 percent demanded by the market.The quicker than expected action over the weekend was prompted by fears of a bank run when the markets open Monday morning, people briefed on the discussions said.As much as €25 billion has flown from large banks like Allied Irish and Anglo Irish in the past months and officials say that the pace had quickened in the last week.Mr. Cowen said that the government’s budget plan would involve €15 billion of savings — €5 billion in tax hikes and the rest in spending cuts. He said the plan would be published Wednesday and the budget issued on Dec. 7. Ireland will not be required to raise its low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent, something it had strongly resisted.“The I.M.F. will not micromanage the Irish economy,” said Mr. Cowen, in response to questions that the government was being held hostage by the I.M.F. “And we are not ceding any policy sovereignty.”Mr. Cowen, a garrulous man with a rough and ready common touch, also served as finance minister during the Irish boom this decade. During the news conference, he was hit with a number of tough questions and accusations from journalists — a reflection of the mounting anger at the banks and real estate developers, who are generally perceived to be responsible for the three consecutive years of negative growth that have battered Irish citizens.“I have taken every decision in the public interest,” he said, remaining calm. “But when circumstances changed, our policies had to as well.”Banks, which issued loans recklessly during the real estate boom, have losses of about €70 billion, almost half the country’s economic output. A new set of bank stress tests will be imposed, and the number of banks will be pared down, officials said.So far, there have been few strikes in Ireland. People have been conditioned to believe that the deficit must be cut and that Ireland, as a small open economy, has little choice but to pay its debts and take the tough policy choices.But there is likely to be a limit to this patience as new spending cuts hit social services that by and large have remained protected. Irish unemployment is around 12 percent, and services like universal child benefits remain generous by European standards.'"

"'10-11-23,'0','In cities and towns across New York and in hundreds of pages of policy documents, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo relished deconstructing the “dysfunction” of Albany during his campaign for governor.But the details of how he was actually going to tackle the state’s many problems were scant. So a government watchdog has come up with several ideas for Mr. Cuomo in an effort to hold him accountable to his campaign promise to restore integrity to the state capital.The group will release a report on Tuesday that offers 11 executive orders that Mr. Cuomo, now the governor-elect, could enact on his first day in office in January without having to negotiate with the Legislature.“This is a gift, as it were, to Andrew Cuomo, and it’s also a challenge to him: here are 11 things that you can do right now,” said John Kaehny, the executive director of the group, Reinvent Albany. “This is not pie-in-the-sky stuff. We designed them to be politically possible, things that the governor can do within this fiscal environment and within his constitutional authority.”The report, called “Executive Orders,” deals with issues like ethics and voting rights, but its thrust is intended to put more government information online. One order would require all information that falls under the Freedom of Information Law to be posted online. Another order would apply the same principle to the notoriously opaque budget process and would require Mr. Cuomo to put budget documents online as the negotiation with the Legislature progresses.'"
"'10-11-23,'0','“That’s their right,” Mr. Burdette said. “I don’t know if it’s 10 people or 10,000 people. Just be professional. Assume you’re being videotaped.”With that, Mr. Burdette reminded everyone to remain vigilant, wished them a “good shift” and opened the unmarked door to a pre-holiday flow of travelers oblivious to the many worries for their safety.It can be argued that the T.S.A. has failed in customer relations, that in its zeal to anticipate every conceivable threat, it has forgotten to take a deep breath and calmly explain why it does what it does to us — for us.For example, the agency recently intensified its pat-down procedures, but, for what it says are security reasons, has declined to answer basic questions that might allay concerns that the new pat-downs are glorified grope sessions. How are these different from the old pat-down procedure? No comment. How are the officers trained to conduct these pat-downs? No comment.The void created by the unanswered questions is filled, then, by libertarian complaints about privacy and skits that mock front-line transportation security officers for following government orders, while administrators far removed from checkpoints in and , and Green Bay, Wis., struggle to make the right moves in a high-stakes game of Risk.Patrick Smith, who writes the “Ask the Pilot” column for Salon.com, is among many who argue against treating people as potential terrorists — “bullying people,” he says — simply because they want to fly. He said the T.S.A. should streamline its checkpoint operations and reallocate officers to conduct more thorough scanning of luggage for bombs and explosives.“We can’t protect ourselves from every conceivable threat, and we need to acknowledge that,” Mr. Smith said. “There’s always going to be a way for a resourceful enough perpetrator to skirt whatever measures we put in place.”But Mr. Burdette said this type of thinking reflected post-Sept. 11 . He said each security measure, from the new pat-down procedures to the increased use of body scanners, was driven by intelligence, not by a desire to create busywork.Mr. Burdette, 41, is a former Marine and counterterrorism investigator who keeps his hair short and his dark-blue suits crisp. As the supervisor of the 700 or so officers at B.W.I. who screen as many as 40,000 travelers a day — of whom fewer than 3 percent request pat-downs — he takes the morale of his troops seriously, and resents any smirking dismissal of them as burger-flippers in toy-cop uniforms.This perception was once so pervasive, and the officers were feeling so beleaguered, that two years ago the T.S.A. changed their uniform shirts to blue from white, and issued gold badges to replace their badge-shaped patches. The agency also began an internal campaign called I.G.Y.B. — for “I’ve Got Your Back.”For government benefits and a salary that starts at $12.85 an hour, these unarmed officers swallow the irritation of others, apply security methods that intensify by the day, stifle the awkwardness they might have about touching other people — oh, and be on alert for bombs, liquid containers holding more than 3.4 ounces, sharp objects, explosive ingredients and the next Abdulmutallab.“I want them to think Abdulmutallab with every pat-down,” Mr. Burdette said.He walked down an airport corridor, past a shoeshine booth and a Dunkin’ Donuts, to the security checkpoint at Concourse A, where these extraordinary times continued to make their rude intrusion upon the day’s ordinary rhythms: shoes off; empty pockets; raise hands. It is the surrender of certain dignity in the quest for increased security.The many people in line, grim-faced but uncomplaining, were met first by Jennifer Adams, 33, who assessed each traveler with a smile and a subtlety that suggested she was merely an official greeter. She joined the T.S.A. eight years ago, after earning a college degree in communications management, and has risen to become a supervisory behavior detection officer.What does that mean?“I’m entrusted to report here and protect the homeland,” she said.“I look for anomalies in the behaviors of the flying public,” Ms. Adams said. A coat too heavy for the season. Averted eyes when asked about carry-on luggage. “Anything that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up,” she said.Behind Ms. Adams stood another officer, Tradonna Pritchard, 23, who repeatedly but patiently instructed people to empty their pockets and, please, “remove your outer garments.”Behind Ms. Pritchard loomed a full-body scanner, on the other side of which stood another officer, Kristin Wade, 27, wearing a wireless earphone that linked her to an officer in an enclosed booth who studied the scanner’s transmitted images. If that officer spotted a shadow that shouldn’t be there, he would notify Ms. Wade, who would then conduct a targeted pat-down for what is invariably a set of keys or a cellphone.Four years ago, Ms. Wade was working as a waitress and a bartender. Now, she said, “I just try to stay alert and mitigate any threats that I see.”Working beside and around Ms. Wade were nearly two dozen other officers, including a bomb analyst named Robert Poe, 60, who has some from his years as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist with the Army, and Patrick Simmons, 50, who drives 100 miles to work every day from his home in .Mr. Simmons said complaints from travelers had grown in proportion with the increase in security measures. But people understand, he said, “as long as you explain things to the public in a calm voice.”He described himself as a former emergency medical technician and volunteer firefighter who is reminded of our collective vulnerability every time he crosses the seemingly endless Chesapeake Bay Bridge. “It could happen anywhere,” he said, the meaning of “it” crystal clear.Yes, Mr. Simmons said, he has heard some travelers dismiss him as nothing more than an overpaid security guard. But he is proud to wear the T.S.A. badge. And while he harbors no desire at all to pat you down, he will. It’s his job.'"
"'10-11-23,'0','In a written statement, a spokesman for Major League Baseball said, “This is a serious issue that raises concerns about the business practices of agents who have played a prominent role in the game.”Domingo Ramos, a former major league player who works for Mr. Boras’s company in the , said in an interview that the company normally represented a handful of top prospects each year and made loans to a majority of them. The money was typically used for housing, food and other necessities, he said.“Like I say, sometimes we get it back, sometimes we don’t,” Mr. Ramos said. “Sometimes it’s tough to get it back. It’s as simple as that.”He added, “But we thinking about helping the kid out and retain him as a client.”In the case of Edward Salcedo, a can’t-miss shortstop prospect who agreed around age 15 in 2006 to be represented by Mr. Boras, the loans gave the Boras Corporation significant leverage.From 2007 to 2009, the company provided payments to Mr. Salcedo and his family, according to Mr. Salcedo; his brother, Thommy; and a former Boras employee, Martiris Hanley. The loans eventually totaled about $70,000, which went for rent, food, other necessities and Thommy Salcedo’s college education, Thommy Salcedo and Mr. Hanley said.The money was to be repaid from Edward Salcedo’s future earnings, Thommy Salcedo and Mr. Hanley said.But the Salcedos hired a new Dominican trainer in 2009 because they believed Boras could not help them resolve questions that had arisen about Edward Salcedo’s age. That trainer, Edgar Mercedes, prepared him for tryouts with major league teams, and Mr. Salcedo received a $1.6 million contract from the last February.Days later, an employee of Mr. Boras’s called the family demanding immediate repayment of the loan, Thommy Salcedo said.He added, “We thought that if we went with another agent, Boras was going to put more pressure on us for this money, and my mother had so much debt that she couldn’t pay it.”“We loan Salcedos,” Mr. Ramos said. “We haven’t get that back, but we’ll get it back.”Edward Salcedo, 19, who struggled in 54 games this season for Class A Rome in , said he was still represented by Mr. Boras and had not repaid the money.In the statement, Mr. Boras said that the company had aided the Salcedo family “in their time of need,” and said it was “something that we’ve done for other clients in the past, always consistent with” the rules of the union.Mr. Boras said the aid to the family came as a legal remedy was pursued to the questions raised over Edward Salcedo’s age. That statement, however, appeared to contradict the accounts of Thommy Salcedo and Mr. Martiris, who said the loans began before age questions arose.Mr. Levinstein, the sports lawyer, said he found it “hard to believe” that the union would sign off on loans like the one involving Salcedo because the “entire set of rules they have created were designed to prevent this sort of relationship.”“I just can’t believe that they said this kind of relationship had their blessing,” he added.Mr. Boras, 58, is a former minor league player. His company, based in Newport Beach, Calif., employs scouts in the Dominican Republic, and elsewhere.Over the past two decades, he has represented many of baseball’s top players, including , and , negotiating contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars for them. This off-season, Mr. Boras represents several free agents, including Jayson Werth and . Mr. Boras, in particular, has been outspoken about the issue of agents who pay players.After Sports Illustrated published an article last month about a former agent who had paid college football players to represent them, Mr. Boras went on an talk show to criticize the practice.“A lot of these agents begin the process with social relationships, with bartering with the athletes, providing mundane services for people who have very little,” he said.“The mere association of providing illegal benefits to athletes was his foundation to entry,” he added, referring to the agent who had paid the football players.Mr. Boras’s company might not be the only one that might have violated the union’s rules. reported on Thursday about how investors from the are financing training academies in the Dominican Republic in hopes of cashing in on players’ signing bonuses and developing clients. Among those investors are agents who make loans to players and Dominican trainers.“You worry that these agents are gaining ownership over these prospects,” said Gabe Feldman, the head of the sports law department at Tulane Law School. “And the prospects then feel so indebted to the agents that the prospects feel that they cannot leave the agent for another.”In late 2007, when Edward Salcedo agreed to be represented by Mr. Boras, his mother, Solinia Diaz, began accepting monthly payments for more than $1,000 from Boras’s company, Thommy Salcedo and Mr. Hanley said.Within a few months, they said, the family moved into a larger house in a nicer neighborhood because the company wanted Mr. Salcedo to be more comfortable.Mr. Hanley, who last worked for Mr. Boras in 2008, said that he had been in charge of finding a new home and arranging the loans for the Salcedos.In February 2008, Mr. Boras negotiated a $2.9 million contract for Mr. Salcedo with the , who believed he was turning 16 that year. But questions arose about Mr. Salcedo’s age, and by the fall of 2008 the Indians walked away from the contract.Boras employees in the Dominican Republic said they tried to resolve the questions about Mr. Salcedo’s age, but Thommy Salcedo said of Mr. Boras, “It seemed like he wasn’t interested, and we were going through this ordeal.”So in 2009, Edward Salcedo left Mr. Boras and began working with Mr. Mercedes.“The mother told me she thought her kid was running out of time,” said Mr. Mercedes, who helped resolve the age questions that enabled him to sign with the Braves in February.Thommy Salcedo said Mr. Mercedes offered to pay what the family owed the Boras Corporation and to give them additional money if Mr. Salcedo chose an agent from the United States whom Mr. Mercedes recommended.“What I told them is that if he wanted we could coordinate paying it back and could help him make extra money to pay the money back,” Mr. Mercedes said. Around the same time, a Boras employee in Newport Beach demanded that the Salcedos repay the $70,000, according to Thommy Salcedo. He added that his mother took out a loan with 20 percent interest after the payments from Boras stopped in 2009.Mr. Mercedes said that Ms. Diaz told him that her son was returning to Mr. Boras because she did not have the money to repay him.'"
"'10-11-23,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — Netflix said Monday that it was introducing a subscription plan for customers who want to watch movies only online, underscoring yet another step away from its roots in DVD rentals by mail.The new plan offers unlimited access to Netflix’s library of streaming movies and TV shows for $8 a month. That is cheaper than virtually all of the company’s DVD plans.Netflix also raised the cost of its various DVD plans by $1 to $8 a month, suggesting that it was encouraging customers to shift to the new streaming plan.“Eventually you will see more and more people moving from the DVD plan to streaming,” said Atul Bagga, an analyst with ThinkEquity.Netflix, based in Los Gatos, Calif., already offers unlimited streaming as part of its DVD-by-mail service. In fact, the company said that its 16.9 million subscribers already watch more movies and TV shows online than on DVDs.'"
"'10-11-23,'0','But on Monday, he granted a motion filed by The New York Times to unseal them.Early in the hearing, Lynn said that he would file an ethics grievance with the state of Pennsylvania, where Greenberg practices law, if he ever used his status as a principal in the case to discuss bankruptcy law in the news media.“I don’t care if he says I’m wrong and I don’t care if he calls me an idiot,” Lynn told Greenberg’s lawyer. “But he must do it as a principal.”Lynn then turned to Stephen J. Shimshak, one of Major League Baseball’s lawyers. In June, he used a profanity in a strongly worded promise that baseball would “take over” the Rangers if the court did not approve the team’s reorganization plan. He was speaking during a conference call when he did not think his voice was audible. Lynn vowed to remove Shimshak from the case if he repeated the threat — and denigrated his professionalism.Although Lynn was dismissive several times of Thomas Lauria, the lawyer for Greenberg and Ryan, the lightest moment occurred in an exchange with Lauria, a former law firm colleague.“Why don’t you call me Blutarsky?” Lauria said, referring to John Belushi’s character in “Animal House.” “You could do that, too, I guess.”“I don’t call you anything,” Lynn said. “I just want to get out of this case.”The sale of the Rangers was complex, beginning with their owner, Tom Hicks, defaulting on $525 million in loans to the Rangers and the Dallas Stars. Although Hicks made a deal with Ryan and Greenberg in late 2009, he also looked to make a deal with others, angering M.L.B.Aggrieved creditors, including Monarch Alternative Capital, a hedge fund, wanted more than Ryan and Greenberg were offering. The team later filed for bankruptcy, hoping that it would speed the sale to Ryan and Greenberg. But it did not, and it took until a court auction held in early August, when Ryan and Greenberg’s bid, worth $593 million, beat one from Mark Cuban and Jim Crane.At one point, Lynn explained the tenor of some of his comments.“By the way, if I sound like I’m one-sided in this, I’m not,” he said. “I don’t like hedge funds any better than I do Major League Baseball. In fact, if anything, I used to like them less, but I’m making progress on that.”As Lynn and the lawyers discussed the qualifications of potential auction bidders, he said that it would “make perfect sense” for baseball to reject someone from the Russian Mafia or institutionalized gambling. But, he suggested, “If the buyer is Barack Obama, however, I would not want you to say, ‘No, we don’t accept Democrats or black people.’ Do you understand me?”The hearing occurred after a series of threats were e-mailed to William Snyder, the court-appointed chief restructuring officer, who had canceled the first scheduled auction of the team.Snyder said in an interview Monday that threats were part of his business and that they ended quickly. But Lynn told the lawyers in his chambers: “I’ve alerted the U.S. Marshals because I don’t want to see my home vandalized.

The last boat race ended early Monday evening, the final night of the holiday, and a concert was being held on the island, called Diamond Island, a long spit of land close to the royal palace on the shore.There was no confirmation of the cause of the stampede, but Information Minister Khieu Kanharith said it began when what he said were one million people became “scared of something.”A military police investigator, Sawannara Chendamirie, who was at the hospital said it appeared that the panic began when some people began shouting that the bridge was collapsing.“I got information that when the incident happened, some people thought the bridge was falling,” he said. “They were so frightened.”“People were frightened that the bridge would break.”The police and rescuers had to fight their way through crowds, sometimes beating people with their belts to get through, according to reports from the scene.Video from the site showed scenes of horror with bodies lying here and there and frantic rescuers rushing among them.People searched, weeping, through the corridors of the hospital, where bodies lay on the floor wrapped in woven mats or under sarongs. Hospital workers threw white sheets over groups of bodies on the floor. White-coated hospital personnel hurried through rooms jammed with cots.One survivor, Chhin Chenda, 16, was lying on a cot at the hospital. She said, “At first we were frightened of an electric wire. After that I fell and people ran over me. People were stepping on me. I called out, ‘Please help me.’ ”She said her mother and a cousin died in the stampede. Relatives found the mother’s body at the hospital on Tuesday, but not the cousin’s.Another survivor, Meoun Ly Heang, 12, said he went to the island with his 22-year-old sister without permission from their parents because he wanted to watch the festival. They came from Kandal Province. When the panic began, he said, “I couldn’t move, my leg was stuck. I couldn’t stand, I couldn’t move. My sister died. She could not breathe. She fell and people stepped on her.”The boy recalled his sister’s last words, “She was saying, ‘Please don’t step on me,’ ” he said.After the stampede, people staggered from the scene either alone or supported by rescuers. Some sat on the ground, holding their hands to their chests and breathing with difficulty.Other people carried bodies, both the dead and the badly injured, by their arms and legs; they knelt on the ground fanning those who were still alive or trying to perform CPR; they loaded the dead and badly injured onto flatbed trucks or the backs of motorcycles and packed them into ambulances.A doctor, Pok Somporn, said when he arrived at the hospital there were about 140 dead people and more than 100 people injured. “This is the first time this many have come to our hospital,” he said. This is the worst time for us.”Bodies were taken to a temporary tent morgue, outside the hospital. People were reaching through a window in the large tent and lifting sheets inside to search for people who had died.In the aftermath, the suspension bridge with its delicate fretwork was carpeted with the shoes and bits of clothes of those who had been crushed or fled.'"
"'10-11-23,'0','“We’re terrified,” says Dave Walton, site manager of Dry Tortugas National Park, a group of islands and an ecological reserve 60 miles west of Key West, where lionfish first appeared in September 2009.If the lionfish’s impact on other parts of the Caribbean is any guide, Mr. Walton and others in the region are right to be concerned. It is a formidable predator that can devastate fish populations wherever it feeds. Researchers here examined more than 1,000 lionfish stomachs and found more than 50 species of prey fish inside, including juveniles of commercially important grouper and snapper. The fish also eat juvenile parrotfish, which graze on algae and keep it from overgrowing and killing corals.“What we do know is what we can see in areas like the Bahamas where you go to a particular reef and all you can see is lionfish,” says Sean Morton, superintendent of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, a 3,900-square-mile park stretching from Biscayne Bay to Dry Tortugas National Park.If the reef system here is depleted of other fish species because of the lionfish’s appetite, the impact could be devastating to the region’s economy, which relies heavily on commercial fishing and recreational diving. Bob Holston, the owner of Dive Key West, a local dive shop, says the potential threat could spell doom for his business.“Imagine going into Yellowstone and not being able to see any birds, any bears, any deer or whatever — you would just be looking at trees,” he said.A native of the Indo-Pacific Ocean and the Red Sea, the lionfish has no known predators. It is believed to have been released by aquarists sometime in the 1990s and has since spread up the East Coast to North Carolina and through the Caribbean.Scientists say the fish can produce 30,000 eggs in a single spawning event, and can spawn as frequently as every four days. “That means we’re looking at annual output of two million eggs per female,” says Lad Akins, a research diver and the director of operations with the Reef Environmental Education Foundation, or Reef.Scientists and policy makers are at a loss as to how to eradicate the fish, a goal that a 2003 report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says is “nearly impossible.” The only hope, say officials, is some form of local control.Which is where the derbies come in. On Nov. 13, 18 teams competed from sunrise to sundown to kill as many fish as they could with hopes of sharing $3,350 in prize money.“We’re taking a part in the battle,” says Robert Hickerson, the captain of Team Frapper, a group of four divers from Vero Beach. Mr. Hickerson says he dives as often as twice a week. His “kill count” is a source of pride. “I’ve killed over a hundred of them. I try to kill them even when I’m on vacation.”While lionfish numbers are growing, the fish can be elusive. Despite the best efforts of the 18 teams in the Lower Keys derby, only 109 fish were killed, adding to the 550 lionfish killed in the two previous contests in Key Largo in September and Marathon in October.One potential solution is to promote the fish as food for another voracious predator: man. Lionfish are considered excellent eating. Indeed, after the lionfish derby here, participants feasted on fried lionfish nuggets.“They taste a lot like hogfish,” says Mr. Dugan of the Lion Hunters. “They’re really good.”'"
"'10-11-23,'0','DETROIT — The federal government has rated the Nissan Leaf, the battery-powered car scheduled to go on sale next month in five states, as getting the fuel equivalent of 99 miles a gallon, Nissan said Monday.The Environmental Protection Agency, which tests vehicles for emissions and fuel efficiency, has determined Leaf’s official range to be 73 miles on a fully charged battery, much less than the 100 miles previously claimed by Nissan.Both figures will appear prominently on the Leaf’s window label, which shows the estimated yearly electricity cost as $561. The E.P.A. calculates annual fuel costs as $867 for the Toyota Prius hybrid and $1,669 for Chevrolet’s Malibu, which like the Leaf, is classified as a midsize car.The E.P.A. puts vehicles through five tests to simulate varying driving conditions and levels of climate-control usage.Because drivers cannot simply stop at a gas station and refuel, the Leaf’s range is expected to weigh heavily on shoppers’ minds. Adding to any confusion they might feel, the Leaf will have a second sticker from the Federal Trade Commission — it regulates advertising by alternative-fuel vehicles — displaying the car’s range as 96 to 110 miles.“Driving behavior, temperature — those things do affect your range,” said Mark Perry, the director of EV and Advanced Technology strategy in North America for Nissan. “We’re trying to be very open so folks are making the right decision for them. We don’t want them to be surprised.”'"
"'10-11-23,'0','Q. What accounts for the difference among varieties of apple in how quickly slices turn brown?A. Cutting an apple releases compounds from within cells that interact with oxygen in the air in a process called oxidation, said Susan K. Brown, professor in the department of horticulture at Cornell University.“The browning is primarily because of a chemical reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called polyphenoloxidase, or PPO,” she said. Phenolic (nutritional) compounds in the fruit are oxidized into slightly colored compounds, called quinones, which then change to form darkly colored pigments, she said.“Different apple cultivars vary widely in their PPO levels, total phenolic content and rates of browning,” Dr. Brown said. A variety may have less browning because of low PPO, low phenolics or some combination of the two.Many popular cultivars, like McIntosh and Fuji, are fairly prone to browning, she said, but Cornell has developed some varieties that brown much less than most on the market. Other factors affecting the rate of browning include the ripening stage of the fruit, the length of time in storage and any topical treatments that have been applied.To stop browning, some use a mixture of lemon juice, which contains citric acid, and water, Dr. Brown said, but vitamin-fortified apple juice and lemon-lime soda also work. In commercial production, a solution of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is used.'"
"'10-11-23,'0','Marijuana smoking often starts in adolescence — and the timing could not be worse, a new study suggests.Young adults who started using the drug regularly in their early teens performed significantly worse on tests assessing brain function than did subjects who were at least 16 when they started, scientists reported last week.The findings led researchers at McLean Hospital to surmise that the developing teenage brain may be particularly vulnerable to the ill effects of marijuana.“We have to understand that the developing brain is not the same as the adult brain,” said Dr. Staci A. Gruber, the paper’s senior author and director of cognitive and clinical neuroimaging at McLean, a Harvard-affiliated hospital in Belmont, Mass.The study, done in conjunction with brain scans, was small, consisting of 35 chronic marijuana smokers who were 22 years old on average. The subjects were asked to complete an assessment of executive function — the brain processes responsible for planning and abstract thinking, as well as understanding rules and inhibiting inappropriate actions. The test — in which participants were asked to sort cards with different shapes, numbers and colors — is a measure of cognitive flexibility.At 15, Dr. Gruber said, the brain is still changing, and “the part that modulates executive function is the last part to develop.”'"
"'10-11-23,'0','DUBLIN — Prime Minister Brian Cowen said late Monday that he would step down once a series of fiscal packages and budgets were in place next month, acceding to the demands of the opposition and its coalition partner, and injecting the threat of political instability into a financial crisis that already has markets on edge.Earlier in the day, the minority Green Party declared that the public had lost faith in the government after its acceptance of a $100 billion rescue package over the weekend and that it would pull out of the government. It called for elections early next year, when a second round of austerity measures, forced on Ireland as a condition of the bailout, will be put before voters who have already suffered through three years of recession.“The mood in the country is for an election and the people want a new mandate — that much is clear,” said Joan Burton, deputy leader for the Labour Party.In agreeing to step down, Mr. Cowen became the first political casualty of the sovereign debt crisis in the 16-member euro zone. While Prime Minister George Papandreou in Greece has seen his popularity wane as the cuts mandated by the International Monetary Fund have begun to bite, he came out on top at a recent by-election and seems, for the moment, to have the backing of the country.The developments in Ireland sent a chill through financial markets and political circles in the euro zone. The uneasiness in the markets reflects the fear that politicians could backtrack on deficit cutting measures when faced with an angry electorate.Ireland faces a stark choice between accepting cutbacks in popular middle class social programs or rejecting them and jeopardizing the rescue package, which would invite default. Most analysts expect that Mr. Cowen, whatever the condition of his coalition, will be able to pass the budget — even though it will have put into law such severe measures as a decrease in the minimum wage (one of the highest in Europe) and changes to the country’s generous child benefits.As events unfolded last week and over the weekend, Mr. Cowen’s position grew increasingly untenable. His Fianna Fail party has been in power since 1987, and Mr. Cowen, before he became party leader in 2008, was finance minister as the seeds of the real estate boom were sewn in the early part of this decade. That he has lasted this long, presiding over three consecutive years of sharply negative growth, the biggest bank bust outside of Iceland and a humiliating bailout is a testimony to his undisputed skills as a political infighter.As the political climate has become more vicious, Mr. Cowen has focused on what he does best — twist arms and push for votes.This weekend while his government was locked in tense talks with negotiators from the monetary fund and the European Commission, Mr. Cowen flew to Donegal County, a poor, fishing-dependent region on Ireland’s north coast where a crucial by-election is to be held on Thursday that could well decide his government’s fate. He spent Saturday on Arranmore Island, home to about 500 mostly unemployed fishermen listening to their tales of woe that focused largely on their complaint that the fishing restrictions imposed by Brussels were threatening their livelihood.“These are dire issues,” he said to a small gathering of fisherman and their families. “But I have too much respect for the people here to say they are easily solved.” Addressing, the larger issue of negotiations with the monetary fund, Mr. Cowen said that “he hoped that the loan facilities will bring prosperity back to the people.”Although the county is traditional stronghold for his party, most polls have the Fianna Fail candidate losing to Sinn Fein. If that happens, the government will have an effective majority of two seats and will become wholly dependent on several independents that in the past have supported the government, but now are moving in the opposite direction.One independent who had supported the government, Jackie Healy-Rae, warned Monday that he might withdraw his support. Another, Michael Lowry, said he would support the budget legislation “in the national interest.”The always churning Dublin rumor mill is now in overdrive, with speculation mounting that a back bench revolt might be brewing as Fianna Fail ministers contemplate the possibility of going into a new election with a new party leader.The 2011 budget is to be presented before the Irish parliament on Dec. 7. It will call for six billion euros in savings and will be the first major hurdle that the government must clear to prove to the European Commission and the international Monetary Fund that this recession-battered country can come together and pass brutally painful budgets.Philip Lane, a professor at Trinity College Dublin, said despite the pronouncements there should still be “enough solidarity across the spectrum” for the budget to pass next month.Assuming the budget passes “there’s no reason to delay having an election,” he said.'"
"'10-11-23,'0','Women who are stressed at work are more likely than other working women to have a heart attack or other forms of heart disease, a new study suggests.The findings, presented Nov. 15 at an American Heart Association meeting in Chicago, were based on data from 17,415 otherwise healthy middle-aged women who took part in the Women’s Health Study, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.The researchers found that women who reported high job strain faced a 40 percent increase in cardiovascular disease over all, and an 88 percent increase in risk for heart attacks alone. (“Strain” was defined as demanding work with little decision-making authority or ability to use one’s creativity and skills.)Women who worried about losing a job did not experience an increase in heart ailments, but they were more likely than women with high job security to be overweight or to have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, risk factors for heart disease.Earlier studies on chronic job stress and heart disease in women have had mixed results, though studies of mostly male subjects have found a clear association between the two, said the study’s senior author, Dr. Michelle A. Albert, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School.“You can’t get rid of stress, but you can manage it,” she said'"
"'10-11-23,'0','Skiers, beware: you’re exposed to more ultraviolet radiation than you think. Hot chocolate at midday — preferably somewhere shady — may be a good idea.Scientists studying sun safety took multiple readings of ultraviolet radiation at 32 high-altitude ski areas in western North America and interviewed thousands of skiers to find out whether they took precautions against the sun, like wearing hats, sunscreen and goggles, at appropriate times. Their conclusion was: only occasionally.“There were lots of findings, but the big takeaway is that people do not know when UV is high and do not take precautions,” said Peter A. Andersen, a professor of health communications at San Diego State University. “People took precautions not only when it was sunny but when it was warmer, and that’s an erroneous calculation in people’s minds. There is absolutely no correlation between temperature and UV radiation.”There can also be a lot of exposure to UV radiation on cloudy days, he said.Skiers in the Northern Hemisphere get the highest exposure at midday, and during the late winter and early spring, as they get closer to the summer solstice, Dr. Andersen said. Exposure also increases with elevation.Readings were generally highest in high-altitude resorts in Arizona and New Mexico, but the highest UV rating — 10 UV index units — was taken at Mammoth Mountain in California. That rating is “just as intense as being smack-dab in the middle of the sun at Jones Beach in June,” Dr. Andersen said.'"

But Campbell reported declining sales of ready-to-serve and condensed soups.Douglas R. Conant, who is stepping down as president and chief executive in July 2011, said in a conference call on Tuesday that Campbell lacked new products to help draw people to the category, saying shoppers would not buy on price alone.Campbell earned $279 million, or 82 cents a share, in the first quarter, down 8 percent from $304 million, or 87 cents a share, a year ago.The performance missed analysts’ expectations by a cent. The estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters usually remove one-time items.Campbell said its first-quarter revenue fell 1 percent to $2.17 billion from $2.2 billion. That was shy of Wall Street’s estimates of revenue of $2.2 billion.'"
"'10-11-24,'1','The attack on Yeonpyeong Island occurred after South Korean forces on exercises fired test shots into waters near the North Korean coast. We hope ’s president is asking who came up with that idea. But the North should have protested, rather than firing on a populated area, wounding three civilians and 15 soldiers. South Korea showed admirable restraint earlier this year when the North Koreans torpedoed and sank a South Korean warship, killing 46 sailors. It needs to continue to exercise restraint, as difficult as that may be. Washington must underline that message, even as it rightly denounces the North’s belligerence.The enrichment plant is alarming because it gives the North a second way to produce fuel for nuclear weapons. And when the North owns up to one enrichment facility, who is to say there aren’t others hidden?Over the last several weeks, North Korean officials unveiled two ambitious new nuclear projects to three separate delegations of visiting American experts. In addition to an industrial-sized centrifuge plant, they are also building an experimental light water reactor, supposedly for energy production.Siegfried Hecker, a former chief of the Los Alamos nuclear lab who visited the centrifuge plant, called it “astonishingly modern.” He said the plant and the reactor could be converted to produce weapons. But he said they “appear to be designed primarily for civilian nuclear power, not to boost North Korea’s military capability.”Obama administration officials are right to be skeptical. North Korea did freeze its program for seven years, but repeatedly cheated on its commitments since — diverting enough plutonium from a reactor to build six to eight bombs, testing two nuclear devices and failing to dismantle its plutonium fuel program. The last time the North sat down with other members of the six-party talks was in 2008. Since then, North Korea tested a second nuclear device and has increasingly clashed with the South. Meanwhile, the backed South Korea and in suspending energy aid, tightening sanctions and demanding that the North show serious purpose before talks resume.Mr. Obama has insisted that he won’t get played by the North, but administration officials have also left the door open to both reviving the six-party talks and bilateral negotiations. We see no evidence of a serious American strategy for getting there.For now, China, reinforced by United Nations sanctions, has the best chance of walking the North back from the brink. It must take the lead. But Washington must also re-engage.'"
"'10-11-24,'1','“A lot of people were trying to say that I went to prison because of what I did and maybe because of who I was,” he said. “I went to prison because what I was doing was wrong. We all know what right is, and what’s wrong is wrong. I knew what I was doing. I didn’t say no; I did not stop. I didn’t get away from it.”Later, at Wilbur Cross High, Vick, appearing more relaxed, spoke candidly about his experience in dogfighting — and his disregard for his lofty N.F.L. stature.He described sitting on top of the world as the first player taken in the 2001 draft and then becoming the league’s most highly paid player. There was silence in the auditorium when Vick described his fall, his recklessness, traveling between Atlanta and Virginia to participate in the dogfighting operation. He told students about rewarding dogs who did well and cruelly disposing of those who did not.“After a while when you do so much wrong and you get away with it, you start to think you’re invincible,” he said.One student asked if Vick found it difficult to stand up and talk about his fall.“Not hard at all,” Vick said. “Coming out of prison, I didn’t want there to be any questions that I couldn’t answer. I wanted to be open and open-minded with any kid as I could be. I won’t hold anything back because I think they deserve the truth.“My thing is being honest,” he said. “That’s what I haven’t been in the past, that’s what I will be moving forward.”The major questions facing Vick — even as he enjoys a phenomenal season — is how sincere he is when he discusses his dogfighting transgressions.Is Vick speaking from the heart? Is he reformed?Is his marriage to the Humane Society one of convenience more than sincerity?Vick has spoken to 29 schools since he began working with Pacelle.“He seemed real laid-back, like he’s give a lot of speeches, like this is the norm for him, ” Aaron Williams, a senior at Wilbur Cross, said. “Not saying that he doesn’t really mean it.”Aidian Field, another senior, thought that Vick was effective and sincere.“I feel like it was a pretty strong message,” he said.Field, who owns a dog, said that he lost respect for Vick as details of the ring emerged. Over time, he said that he softened his attitude and after seeing Vick in person, he forgave him.“I think he was sincere,” Field said. “I think he sincerely had a change of heart, now that he’s seen the other side of it.”Vick is in a difficult situation. No matter how many touchdown passes he throws or how many apologies he makes, he will forever be, in certain minds, a pariah.The best thing he can do is play well, win and continue to make these appearances even after the season is over.“I totally understand there’s going to be people who will never forgive me,” Vick said. “I can’t change the perception of what they feel about me. I understand that what I did was totally inhumane and unethical, but I can’t change it. I don’t know what else I could do other than what I’m doing right now.”As Vick said, only time will tell.'"

"'10-11-24,'1','Bob Adler, one of the commission’s three Democratic members, said opponents were trying to shield manufacturers from greater public scrutiny.“Some folks are worried more about lost sales and not worried enough about lost souls,” Mr. Adler said. With Democrats outnumbering Republicans 3 to 2 on the board, the proposal is expected to pass.As proposed, the database would go live at SaferProducts.gov in March. It would allow visitors to browse safety-related complaints about various products while giving manufacturers the ability to post replies and, if they can prove a complaint is inaccurate, have it removed. Parents, for instance, could scroll through the database before purchasing strollers, cribs or toys to see if others have reported problems with them.Michele Witte, a Long Island woman, said such a database might have helped prevent the 1997 death of her 10-month-old son, Tyler, who became entrapped in a drop-side crib. Ms. Witte said she had purchased the crib because it was advertised as being safe; only after her son’s death did she learn that other children had died in drop-side cribs, too.“There was no database back in the ’90s where I could learn if other parents had been through this,” she said. “I believed my son was an isolated case.”The Republican commissioners want to limit complaints to people with first-hand knowledge of a product hazard, like parents and health care workers; they are also seeking stronger vetting of false or misleading complaints.“The commission’s proposal allows anything from anybody to go up on the public database,” said Nancy Nord, one of the Republican commissioners, who wants to ensure that consumers receive accurate information.The database was authorized by Congress as part of a 2008 law intended to give the Consumer Product Safety Commission — long maligned for its tepid oversight — more teeth.Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has a similar database, called SaferCar.gov, in which consumers can file safety complaints about automobiles.Under the commission’s proposal, the public could use the database to quickly report and find complaints about unsafe products. The agency’s current rules make it difficult to obtain such information without a manufacturer’s consent and typically require filing a Freedom of Information Act request, a process that can take months, even years.“It’s a slow death,” said Ami Gadhia, policy counsel for Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. “That information never gets out in the public.”But some businesses and their trade groups are concerned that any online database could become a government-sponsored bulletin board for bogus reports and merchant-bashing.The Republican commissioners, Ms. Nord and Anne Northup, have balked at some of the proposed regulations for the database, which were written by the agency’s staff.For example, Ms. Nord said, there is too much leeway in who can file a complaint: “users of consumer products, family members, relatives, parents, guardians, friends, attorneys, investigators, professional engineers, agents of a user of a consumer product, and observers of the consumer products being used.”She worries that plaintiff’s lawyers and competitors could post bogus information to gain an edge. In addition, Ms. Nord said the proposal emphasized quick posting of complaints and was not clear enough about how disputes would be handled.“The problem is, there might be a tendency to post it and forget it,” she said. “Having just a grab bag of junk that has not been investigated seems to not be in the consumer’s interest.”The commission chairwoman, Inez Tenenbaum, disputed the idea that manufacturers’ concerns had not been properly considered. She said the agency offered numerous forums for comment and some of those ideas were incorporated into the final proposal. “We have been abundantly fair,” Ms. Tenenbaum said.The Republican counterproposal was taken down from the agency’s Web site because the formal period for comment was over, staff members said.Consumer advocates suggested the opponents were trying to weaken the database to protect business interests.“They have a great deal now, and I think they are trying to maintain the status quo by levying these unfounded arguments,” said Rachel Weintraub, director of product safety for the Consumer Federation of America.Under the current proposal, complaints would include a description of the harm, or the risk of harm, as well as a description of the product, the name of the manufacturer, contact information and an affirmation that the submitter is telling the truth. The submitter’s name would not appear on the database and would be provided to manufacturers only if the complainant agreed.The commission would have five days to forward the complaint to the manufacturer, which would in turn have 10 days to review it and respond. If a manufacturer could prove to the commission staff that the information was inaccurate or contained confidential business information, the commission could redact part of the report or not post it.But Ms. Nord said the proposal remained far too vague. She cited the recent case of Pampers Dry Max, made by Procter & Gamble, in which thousands of parents asserted that the diapers were causing their babies to get a rash. A commission investigation found no link between the diapers and the rashes.“We would have posted all these complaints about them even though they proved to be wrong,” Ms. Nord said.Mr. Adler, the Democratic commissioner, said the database was not meant to be a legal forum like a court but more like a catalog of consumer experiences. He noted that a disclaimer on the database said the commission did not guarantee its accuracy.“ ‘I put my baby in a diaper and my baby developed a rash.’ That goes up. It’s an early warning system to alert other consumers,” Mr. Adler said. “This is a balancing act between consumer protection and manufacturers’ protection. I think the tie goes to consumers.”'"
"'10-11-24,'1','Even as the nation’s biggest banks have rapidly recovered, hundreds of small lenders remain at risk, according to the government’s latest report card on the financial industry.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said on Tuesday that its list of “problem banks” — those with the highest risk of failing — had grown to 860, or nearly one in nine lenders. Most are small community banks, saddled with bad real estate loans.Not all of the banks are destined to fail, but officials reiterated that they expected the number to peak later this year. The agency has shuttered more than 149 banks in 2010, with about 41 closing in the third quarter.Bank earnings, meanwhile, continue to rebound as losses appear to be stabilizing. The nation’s 7,760 banks made about $14.5 billion in profit in the third quarter, the F.D.I.C. reported. That was about $2 billion higher than a year ago, although down sharply from the last two quarters as a result of a $10.1 billion loss from Bank of America. Nearly two in three banks posted an improvement in quarterly results.It was the fifth consecutive period that earnings had registered a year-over-year increase.Fewer borrowers are falling behind on their loan payments, giving banks confidence to set aside the lowest amount of money since the credit crisis gathered steam in late 2007. And for a second consecutive period, the banks charged off fewer loans in nearly every category. Nearly two in three banks showed an improvement in their results this quarter.'"
"'10-11-24,'1','Also, Truvada, a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine that prevents the virus from replicating, is available by prescription in many countries right now, while the microbicide gel is made in only small amounts for clinical trials.The protection, known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, is also the first new form available to men, especially men who cannot use because they sell sex, are in danger of prison , are under pressure from partners or lose their inhibitions when drunk or high.It “does not involve getting permission from the other partner, and that’s important,” said Phill Wilson, president of the Black AIDS Institute, which focuses on the epidemic among blacks.Michel Sidibé, the head of the agency that fights AIDS, called it “a breakthrough that will accelerate the prevention revolution.”AIDS experts and the researchers issued several caveats about the study’s limitations, emphasizing that it looked only at gay men and Truvada. More studies, now under way, are needed to see whether the results can be duplicated, whether other antiretroviral drugs will work and whether they will protect heterosexual men and women, prostitutes and drug users who share needles.There is no medical reason to think the pill would not work in other groups, since it attacks the virus in the blood, not in the vaginal wall as a microbicide does. Pre-exposure prophylaxis became possible only in recent years as newer, less-toxic antiretroviral drugs were developed.Some scientists fear that putting more people on the drugs will speed the evolution of drug-resistant strains, though that did not occur in the study.Because Truvada is available now, some clinicians already prescribe it for prophylaxis, Dr. Fauci said, but whether doing so becomes official policy will depend on discussions by the , the , medical societies and others, which could take months.Although the C.D.C. would prefer that doctors wait for further studies, more will probably prescribe the drugs now that this study is out, said Dr. Kevin Fenton, chief of the agency’s AIDS division, so the C.D.C. will soon release suggested guidelines.The agency will suggest that the drug be prescribed only with close medical supervision and used only with other safe-sex practices.“The results are encouraging, but it’s not time for gay men to throw away their condoms,” Dr. Fenton said.AIDS advocacy groups were very excited by the results.“If you comply with it, this works really well,” said Chris Collins, policy director of amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research. “This is too big to walk away from.”Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, an organization that lobbies for AIDS prevention, called the study “a great day for the fight against AIDS” and said gay men and others at risk needed to be consulted on the next steps.In the study, 2,499 men in six countries — , , , , and the — were randomly assigned to take either Truvada or a placebo and were followed for up to three years. For ethical reasons, they were also given condoms, treatment for and advice on safe sex. There were 64 infections in the placebo group and 36 in the group that took Truvada, a 44 percent risk reduction.Two in the Truvada group turned out to have been infected before the study began. When the remaining 34 were tested, only 3 had any drug in their blood — suggesting that the other 31 had not taken their pills.Different regimens, like taking the pills not daily but only when sex is anticipated, also need testing.Also, many men in the study failed to take all of their pills, and some clearly lied about it. For example, some who claimed to take them 50 percent or 90 percent of the time had little or no drug in their bloodstreams.The pills caused no major side effects, though men who began to show signs of liver problems were taken off them quickly. Some men stopped taking the pills because they disliked relatively minor side effects like nausea and headaches. Also, some stopped bothering once they suspected that they might be taking a placebo.“People have their own reasons,” Mr. Collins said. “People don’t take their every day either.”A major question now is who will pay for the drug.In the United States, Truvada, made by , costs $12,000 to $14,000 a year. In very poor countries, generic versions cost as little as 40 cents a pill.Globally, only about 5 million of the 33 million people infected with the AIDS virus are on antiretroviral drugs, and in an era of tight foreign-aid budgets, that number is not expected to rise quickly.Hundreds of millions of Africans, Eastern Europeans and Asians are at risk and could benefit from prophylaxis, but that would cost tens of billions of dollars.In this country, insurers and normally pay for the drugs, and the Ryan White Act covers the cost for the poor, but none of these payers yet have policies on supplying the drugs to healthy people.No participant in the study developed resistance to tenofovir. Three were found to have strains resistant to emtricitabine, but investigators believe that all three were infected before the study began at levels low enough to have been missed by their first H.I.V. tests.Another concern was that the participants would become so fearless that they would stop using condoms, but the opposite effect was seen — they used condoms more often and had fewer sex partners. But that can also be a result of simply being enrolled in a study and getting a steady diet of advice on safe sex and free condoms, the investigators said.Other trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis have about 20,000 volunteers enrolled around the world. Their results are expected over the next two years.'"
"'10-11-24,'1','PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Injured survivors lay on the floors of hospitals here Tuesday, and the dead were loaded into coffins after one of the worst stampedes in recent years killed at least 378 people at a holiday celebration.The cause of the stampede on Monday night during Cambodia’s annual water festival was unclear, but most of the dead were suffocated or trampled or crushed to death on a small bridge that became so packed that survivors said they had been unable to move or even breathe.Some of the dead drowned or were killed when they leaped from the bridge into the Bassac River or onto concrete pilings nearby. Witnesses said some people were wedged for hours among the dead, calling out for water, as the police used batons to push back crowds so they could clear the bridge.“They were stacked up like firewood on a pile, people just up and up and up, more than five people up,” said Heng Sinith, a photographer for The Associated Press, who said he could hardly bear to press his shutter as he watched.“People were calling out for water,” he said. “ ‘Please help me, please help me!’ I feel so bad that I could not help them. I could not help them because they were locked together.”'"
"'10-11-24,'1','The reunion on Tuesday underlined the personal toll of the political campaign Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has waged during the past two decades.During that period she was detained for 15 years and only rarely allowed visitors or communication with the outside world.She has always been free to leave Myanmar, according to her lawyers, but chose to stay for fear of being denied re-entry.“I don’t believe in looking at it as a sacrifice,” she said of her decision to embrace her fate as a political martyr. “It’s a choice. It’s a choice I made.”Now that she is free, she said, she intends to lead what she calls a nonviolent revolution, rather than an incremental evolution.She said her use of the term “revolution” was justified because, “I think of evolution as imperceptible change, very, very slowly, and I think of revolution as significant change. I say this because we are in need of significant change.”The change she had in mind, she said, was “a change for the better from the point of view of human rights and democratic institutions.”But she said that unlike some of her supporters in the West, she did not see regime change as a goal. “What we want is value change,” she said. “Regime change can be temporary, but value change is a long-term business. We want the values in our country to be changed. We want a sound foundation for change.“Even if there’s regime change, if these basic values have not changed, then one regime change can lead to another regime change and so on and so on.”She said she did not endorse moves among her supporters overseas to try to bring the junta leaders into international court for crimes against humanity.“I’ve never said I want them to be brought into the international court,” she said. “I don’t think there is any solid reason for the generals to fear for their safety. We are not after them personally. I certainly do not wish them ill.”As for her own ambitions, she said, “I’m not very much concerned whether I personally come to power, but I am concerned about the power of the people.” The people of Myanmar, whose aspirations and whose popular uprisings have been crushed over the years, must understand that real power is in their hands, she said.To this end, she said she would continue to work through her party, the National League for Democracy, although the government banned it as a political party when it declined to take part in a parliamentary election this month.For the moment, she said, she is busy in Yangon, the main city of Myanmar, but she did not rule out a resumption of the trips she made around the country during her last one-year period of freedom, in 2003.“One should be free to travel around one’s country as one chooses,” she said.Her last period of freedom ended when a government-backed mob attacked her convoy, killing dozens of people and forcing her to flee for safety.Asked if she might again be putting her supporters at risk in public gatherings, she said, “They don’t have any reason to feel nervous just because they come out to greet me.”But she said, “In any society where the rule of law is not firmly established and basic human rights are not respected, there’s always a risk.”Asked about the personal animus the junta’s leader, Senior Gen. Than Shwe, is said to feel for her, and what she thinks of him, she said, “I don’t think we know each other well enough to care or not care for each other.”Television footage on Tuesday morning from the airport in Yangon showed Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and her son in a brief embrace before walking out of the terminal together.One of the first things he did after greeting his mother was to show her a red tattoo bearing the symbol of her party, which won an election in 1990 but was not allowed by the military to take power.This month, the junta held its first election since then, carefully engineered to produce a victory for its favored party, creating a new Parliament that analysts say will provide a civilian face to continued military rule.In 1991, a year after the previous election, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which was accepted for her in Oslo by her older son, Alexander Aris. Her late husband, Michael Aris, raised their two children in Britain. He was unable to visit with his wife before his death a decade ago at the age of 53, and she refused to leave the country to see him for fear that she would not be allowed to return to resume her house arrest.Asked in the interview about the culture shock of emerging from the sensory deprivation of house arrest to the tumult that surrounds her now, she said, “It’s a bit hectic, but it will calm down in a few weeks.”'"

Judge Ronald Leighton of Federal District Court in Tacoma ruled two months ago that former Maj.

The Justice Department appealed that ruling Tuesday, but did not seek a stay of the judge’s order.

But the Air Force on Wednesday made clear that if she meets her nursing qualifications, military officials and the Justice Department will reconsider whether to seek a stay.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','Larkin played 19 seasons for the Reds and is a possible Hall of Famer, but Close never rose above Class AAA. An outfielder and occasional pitcher, Close was drafted in the seventh round by the Yankees in 1986 and played for three seasons at Oneonta, Albany/Colonie and Columbus before asking for his release and moving on to Calgary, the Seattle Mariners’ top minor league team.His career ended there after two seasons, despite his hitting .330 and .270. But Billy Beane, the Oakland Athletics’ general manager, said that when he was a scout for the team, he wanted to sign Close.“If Casey had hung around,” he said by phone from Oakland, “he would have played in the big leagues or would have been a great player in Japan. But he was ready to move on.”Looking back during an interview with Baseball America in 2007, Close said: “I went into professional baseball thinking that I was going to be a very good major league player. My contemporaries, Hal Morris or Will Clark or Rafael Palmeiro, I matched up with fine.”But he came to believe that he was better suited for college baseball and cited “playing every single day, the ups and downs, putting too much pressure on myself, dealing with failure.”By 1993, Close was an agent at IMG and Jeter, the Yankees’ No. 1 draft pick the previous June, was the shortstop at Class A Greensboro. The Jeter family replaced his first agent, Steve Caruso, with Close.“I was told that Casey was the son of a good friend of Derek’s mother,” Caruso said Wednesday, “and I have no reason to disbelieve that.”As Jeter’s career soared, Close, 47, has kept the sort of low profile that is preached at IMG. In 1999, he defeated Yankees General Manager Cashman in arbitration, winning a $5 million salary for Jeter over the Yankees’ offer of $3.2 million; two years later, he negotiated Jeter’s 10-year, $189 million contract, which just expired.In 2006, when IMG stopped representing team sports athletes in their on-field contract talks, Close took his practice to Creative Artists Agency, and Jeter followed.Now the Yankees and the 36-year-old Jeter cannot agree on what to pay him or for how many years.Last week, Close publicly thrust himself into the debate about Jeter. In a column published Sunday, Close told The Daily News that the Yankees’ unwillingness to pay Jeter for his “total contribution to their franchise” was “baffling” to him.“There’s a reason the Yankees themselves have stated that Derek Jeter is their modern-day Babe Ruth,” he said.Close’s remarks prompted Cashman to ratchet up the tension. He told The New York Times that he had encouraged Jeter to test the free-agent market. “We have been very honest and direct with them — meaning Derek and Casey,” Cashman said. “We have made it clear to them that our primary focus is his on-the-field performance.”Sandy Montag, a former colleague of Close’s at IMG, said he did not view Close’s comments as public posturing.“I view them as Casey being protective of Jeter,” said Montag, an IMG senior corporate vice president. “They’ve known each other a long time. Casey’s just an honest guy protecting his friend. It’s a negotiation; he and Brian are doing whatever they can do to make a deal.”Close has not responded to Cashman and declined a request to be interviewed for this article.As a baseball agent, Close inhabits a universe where the dominant personality is Scott Boras, also a former minor leaguer. Fans know Boras’s face and are familiar with his controversial role in Alex Rodriguez’s opt-out from his Yankees contract in 2007. The New Yorker profiled Boras in an article headlined “The Extortionist.” Close, whose clients include Ryan Howard, Derrek Lee, Ben Sheets and Michael Cuddyer, is not a boldface name.Howard fired a previous agent, Larry Reynolds, to sign with Close. This year, Close negotiated a five-year, $125 million extension for Howard with the Phillies.“For Casey to do what he did, when I wasn’t an unrestricted free agent, with no other teams in the bidding, was great,” Howard said in a phone interview.Beane, who deals with Close regularly, said: “He’s so competent in his second career that you’d never expect someone that bright to have been a former player. I can say that as a former player.”Close’s renown is also exceeded by that of his wife, Gretchen Carlson, the 1989 Miss America and a co-anchor of the Fox News Channel’s morning show, “Fox & Friends.”They met on a blind date. “My contact was telling me, ‘I think I found the perfect person for you because you’re young, you’re single, you work too hard, you’re never around on the weekends,’ and she was doing a lot of the same things,” he told Baseball America. “And I remember asking myself: ‘Whoa, back up a little bit. Why is she having a problem getting a date?’ And sure enough, it had nothing to do with her. She was working from 3 p.m. to 11 at night.”Close may now be working extra hours to keep Jeter a Yankee at a salary he and the team can live with.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','As the investigations into the recruitment of Auburn quarterback Cam Newton continue, the lawyer for Kenny Rogers said Wednesday that officials from the Mississippi secretary of state’s office planned to interview Rogers.Rogers, the so-called “recruiter” with financial ties to the N.F.L. agent Ian Greengross, has said that Newton’s father, Cecil Newton Sr., requested $100,000 to $180,000 for his son to play at Mississippi State.Doug Zeit, the lawyer for Rogers, said that Rogers was expected to be interviewed the week of Dec. 7 in Chicago. Zeit said he had not been told details of the inquiry, but he believed it would deal, in part, with Mississippi’s agent laws in regard to the Newton investigation.“I think they want to know whether they’ve misnamed Kenny or no,” Zeit said. “Everyone wants to keep calling him an agent. The reality is that he is not and never has been.”Pamela Weaver, a spokeswoman for Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, said the office did not “comment on current, potential or pending investigations.”Zeit said that he had not heard from the F.B.I. regarding Rogers, and that the N.C.A.A. checked in for a follow-up question last week regarding Rogers’s business and what he did as a consultant. He declined to elaborate on the N.C.A.A.’s questions.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — Reacting to what it called complaints from law enforcement and a surge in medical emergencies, the Drug Enforcement Administration said on Wednesday that it would ban several chemicals used to make so-called synthetic marijuana products, which resemble herbs or potpourri but mimic the effects of the drug when smoked.In a notice published in the Federal Register, the agency said it would use its emergency powers to ban possession and sale of five synthetic cannaboids whose effects mirror that of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which gives marijuana its potency. Those chemicals are used to coat a variety of products which are marketed as incense, but have become popular as smokables for those seeking a legal high.Under the action, the five cannaboids will be listed as Schedule I substances, the most restrictive category, for at least a year while the government studies whether they should be permanently banned.The temporary action will take at least 30 days to take effect, meaning the products will not immediately be illegal. But on Wednesday, the acting agency administrator, Michele M. Leonhart, made it clear that she believes they are an imminent public safety threat.“Makers of these harmful products mislead their customers into thinking that ‘fake pot’ is a harmless alternative to illegal drugs, but that is not the case,” she said in a statement.The products, which began to appear in the United States in 2008, are sold in smoke shops and online under names like K2, Blue Dragon and Black Mamba Spice, and are marked with warnings saying “not intended for human consumption.” But according to the drug agency, those warnings are being ignored, leading to a variety of bad reactions, including agitation, vomiting, seizures and hallucinations.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','Boeing said Wednesday that the recent fire on a 787 Dreamliner was probably caused by debris in an electrical panel. And, as many analysts had speculated, it also announced that it would delay delivery of the first plane for safety changes.Boeing had planned to deliver the first 787, a passenger jet made substantially of lightweight carbon composites, next February. Lori Gunter, a company spokeswoman, said it was not clear how long the delivery would be delayed.Boeing has been counting heavily on the Dreamliner. It is supposed to cut fuel costs and has attracted nearly 850 advance orders, more than any plane in history.Boeing, based in Chicago, had said that a small fire broke out during a test flight on Nov. 8, forcing one of its six test planes to land in Texas.The company said Wednesday that the problem started with either a short circuit or an electrical arc in a power distribution panel. Boeing said that fault had most likely been sparked by the presence of a small foreign object.The panel receives power from the left engines and distributes it to other systems. Boeing has said the plane’s systems switched to backup power after the fire broke out.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','Mr. Liebis rented a house from Mr. Betit, started teaching at a public school and began volunteering at Mr. Betit’s farm in Burlington. Mr. Betit, 33, a father of four, was going through a hostile divorce and despite making $200,000 in 2008, according to court records, his farm was in turmoil and he had cash-flow problems. The solution seemed obvious: Mr. Liebis had the financial means and desire to get involved; Mr. Betit needed cash and someone who could balance the books.Mr. Liebis, who had never worked on a farm, agreed to pay for 900 chickens and 300 turkeys that would be raised on the Burlington farm and sold in New York at the Greenmarkets around the city. In return, Mr. Liebis would get half the profits.But he wanted to make some changes, he said.To turn a profit, the farm would need to start selling more — three markets a week did not make financial sense, according to the financier. It would be the marriage of local food and mass market. So the two agreed to expand and by August, they were selling at five markets a week.That is when things began to sour.Both sides are barred from discussing the case because of a confidentiality agreement in their court settlement. But it was clear from court papers that the physically exhausting farm work, combined with 10-hour round trips from Vermont to New York added up to a lot of frayed nerves.Mr. Betit claimed that Mr. Liebis took over the operation, spending entire days at the Tamarack Farm booths in New York bothering his employees and annoying customers, according to an affidavit.He said his new partner fired longtime workers and hired his friends at twice the rate. He also accused Mr. Liebis of pocketing the proceeds.“I no longer had any good idea as to what was going on with my business in New York City,” Mr. Betit claimed in court papers.The investor had his own problems with the farmer. He accused Mr. Betit of making unauthorized charges on his feed store account. Many of the turkeys died from pneumonia that summer. Others were lost to predators.The Labor Department was also investigating a complaint by the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program, which accused Mr. Betit of failing to pay an immigrant worker $720 that he had earned working on the farm. (The complaint was eventually dismissed because farms are not subject to hourly wage laws.)Things finally came to a head on Nov. 16, 2009, midway through what should have been their prime business season, when Mr. Betit told Mr. Liebis that he was no longer welcome at the farm or the farmers’ markets. The investor did not take it well.On Nov. 17, Mr. Liebis sent some of the farm’s customers e-mails about the free-range turkeys that they had ordered at a farmers’ market in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.The e-mail said Mr. Betit had “skimmed money” from Mr. Liebis’s investment for his “personal use” and had violated state and federal agriculture laws regarding slaughtering of the turkeys. The birds, it claimed, were not the heritage breeds that were advertised.The federal Agriculture Department “is launching an investigation concerning the poultry,” the e-mail read.The cancellations came rolling in.Mr. Betit would later admit that he was in violation of Agriculture Department rules because he was not authorized to cross state lines with birds slaughtered on his farm; under rules governing small farms, poultry slaughtered on site must be sold within the state.Mr. Liebis informed Greenmarket officials of the department rules violations. As a result, the Greenmarkets issued a two-week suspension forbidding the farm to operate its stand, Mr. Betit said.The final blow, Mr. Betit said, came exactly one week before Thanksgiving. According to an affidavit filed by Mr. Betit, Mr. Liebis drove to the farm in the middle of the night and stuffed chickens that they had bought together into garbage bags. Mr. Betit said that Mr. Liebis then loaded the chickens into his sport utility vehicle and drove off. Mr. Liebis has denied taking the birds.Two days before Thanksgiving, a State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan ordered Mr. Liebis to stop contacting customers, but the controversy had already taken its toll: at least 20 percent of the farm’s yearly income had vanished. Three barrels of turkeys went to waste, Mr. Betit said.The suit was settled in July. Lawyers for both sides claimed victory, but Mr. Liebis is no longer involved with farming, and Mr. Betit’s bankruptcy was made final on Friday.Most of Tamarack’s Thanksgiving customers received a refund on their birds last year, including Zeph Courtney, 40, a musician and self-taught chef. Mr. Courtney was preparing a Thanksgiving meal for his new wife — and both sets of parents were coming.“I had Excel spreadsheets about this meal,” said Mr. Courtney, who ended up buying another local turkey from another farmer at the market. “I come from Plymouth, Massachusetts. Thanksgiving is a big deal in my family.”In recent weeks, Mr. Betit has been back at the Union Square market trying to sell radishes, turnips and other root vegetables in the hope that this harvest would be better than the last.“I have a lot riding on the next few weeks,” he said. “We have to pay our rent based on the Thanksgiving market.”Despite the setbacks over the past year, Mr. Betit is determined to keep at it.“People who farm do it because they love it,” he said. “I can’t imagine doing anything else.”Correction: September 15, 2011  An article in some editions on Nov. 25 about a dispute involving turkeys sold at farmers’ markets in New York by Tamarack Hollow Farm contained several errors. The financier who invested in the farm, Michael Liebis, was born in Israel, not Brooklyn.  And while Mr. Liebis and Mike Betit, the owner of the farm, in Burlington, Vt., did indeed travel between New York and Vermont on business, they said they did not do so five times a week, though they continue to disagree about how many trips they did make. They met as early as 2006, not in 2009. And at the time the two formed a partnership, Mr. Betit was selling at three greenmarkets, not one. These errors were raised with The Times in April. This correction was first delayed because e-mails went astray and later because of research.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','Tired and frustrated, they were on the verge of giving up when Ms. Sandberg met Bitte Granlund, an interior designer who worked out at her gym. The two shared a personal trainer and, they soon discovered, similar tastes in design.Ms. Granlund, an owner of a Stockholm firm called Geco, agreed to help them draw up the floor plans and supervise the renovation. She also helped them secure approval from the various municipal boards that had to sign off on the design, since the building is designated as culturally significant.Construction began in 2006, with Dr. Sandberg as the project manager, stopping by the apartment before and after work. “I was here every day — morning and night — for a year and a half,” he said.As far as he is concerned, though, it was worth the effort. The extensive renovations, which cost about $2.5 million, transformed the space completely, into a modern loft. The only sign of its former function is the bust of a horse that hangs above a gate outside.First, the nearly 2,800-square-foot space was subdivided into two apartments: a larger one that is the Sandbergs’ primary residence and a smaller one they rent out.With 23-foot ceilings, there was room to install a second floor, which added 1,000 square feet of living space to the main apartment. That floor became a kitchen and dining area opening onto a covered rooftop terrace. (Because no changes to the facade were permitted by law, the terrace was built into the roof.)Connecting the kitchen and dining area with the living room and the two bedrooms on the lower level are a spiral staircase and a small elevator — the latter dictated by disability regulations that require all new apartments in Sweden to provide wheelchair access to essential rooms like kitchens, bedrooms and bathrooms.Throughout the apartment, furnishings are minimal and mostly white, which provides a backdrop for the Sandbergs’ art collection. The spare aesthetic suits the couple, who did not bring any furniture with them from the suburbs when they finally moved into the apartment two years ago.“We felt like we didn’t want so much stuff in our home,” Ms. Sandberg said. “It’s calming to come home and simply find your favorite things.”'"

"'10-11-25,'0','Netflix now has the frothy stock price to show for its success. The stock has enjoyed a Google-like rise, nearly quadrupling from its 52-week low in January, and with a market value of nearly $10 billion, Netflix is now worth more than some of the Hollywood studios that license movies to it.In some ways, the closest parallel as a one-stop digital marketplace is iTunes, the Apple service that has put itself at the center of the digital world and has used that power to demand concessions from its suppliers.“How did Hollywood end up supplying Netflix in the first place, particularly a product that was given to them on a flat-rate, wholesale basis?” said Jonathan A. Knee, a media investment banker and co-author of “The Curse of the Mogul.”As recently as a few years ago, Netflix didn’t look like a case study in success: if anything, it seemed to be just the latest media company destined to be run over by technology.From the company’s beginning in 1997, Reed Hastings, the chief executive and co-founder, had always thought of Netflix as an entertainment distribution service rather than a mail-order company, and by 2000, the company was experimenting with delivering movies over the Internet. In 2003, Netflix came up with a hardware solution, a $300 hard drive that would download films. But slow speeds — it could take six to eight hours to download a feature length film — doomed that effort. (Mr. Hastings declined to be interviewed for this article.)But the advent of streaming — watching video in real time as opposed to downloading — gained prominence in 2005 with the explosive success of YouTube. Mr. Hastings decided that software, not hardware, was the key to delivering films over the Internet and pushed to develop high-quality streaming technology. Pricing remained an issue, however, and in a move that gave Netflix a big head start, the company decided to give the service away to existing mail-order customers.Netflix now has more than 16 million subscribers. The company does not release figures on the most popular films or television shows streamed, but as a general rule, films that can be streamed instantly are not fresh out of theaters or plucked from the current TV season. People who want to relive past seasons of “The Office” can do so instantly, but if they are looking for the current season — or any season of “Mad Men” — they are out of luck.“We are very proud to announce that by every measure we are now a streaming company, which also offers DVD-by-mail,” Mr. Hastings recently told Wall Street analysts.Just as important, Netflix arrived with an open checkbook at a time when the film industry’s main source of profits, the sale of DVDs, was plummeting.“As the home entertainment industry comes under pressure, they are the only guy standing there in a red shirt writing checks,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research. “That makes Netflix really unique right now.”The biggest check came a few months ago, when the company spent nearly $1 billion to stream movies from three Hollywood studios — Paramount, MGM and Lionsgate.Steve Swasey, the company’s vice president for communications, said, “As we move from paying U.S. postage to acquiring movies and television episodes from the studios and networks, Netflix can become one of their top customers.”But digital economics can be much less lucrative to content companies. For example, under the terms of Netflix’s deal with Starz, the pay-TV channel, which allows Netflix to stream movies from Sony and Disney, Netflix pays about 15 cents a month for each subscriber, much less than the $4 to $5 a month that cable and satellite owners pay for access to Starz, according to research by Mr. Greenfield.For that reason, Netflix is increasingly viewed as a threat by cable companies and movie studios, who are considering a variety of ways to put the brakes on the company’s growth.For example, big media companies like Time Warner are moving quickly to offer their own streaming products. Studios have pushed back on release dates, requiring Netflix to wait through a window of 28 days while studios pushed more expensive and lucrative sales of the DVD and on-demand versions on cable.And the studios are positioning themselves to demand more money in future negotiations over streaming rights, especially next year when Netflix’s deal with Starz expires.“Though already a significant customer, they’ve grown faster than anyone anticipated, and going forward we expect the economics to improve significantly,"" said John Calkins, executive vice president of digital and commercial innovation at Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.For now, Netflix has become a barometer of the apparently voracious consumer appetite for streaming movies: a recent study by Sandvine, a broadband equipment maker, showed that Netflix, surprisingly, accounted for more than 20 percent of all Internet download traffic in North America in peak evening hours.“Netflix used an open-source network, the U.S. Postal Service, to launch an alternative distribution business without asking anyone for permission,” said Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor and author of “The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires.” “Now they are using another open-source network, the Internet, to transform the business. It is much easier for Netflix to change, because they don’t have to undergo a kind of religious conversion like media companies will have to.”'"
"'10-11-25,'0','Richardson called their connection instant. He knew he was supposed to work the room, but he struggled to pull himself away from Nelson.Nelson lives in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie, and since Richardson had N.F.L. Players Association business there, he took Nelson out to dinner soon after their initial meeting. Thus began their friendship.Richardson knew little of Nelson’s suffering, mainly because Nelson never complained or wallowed. His mother, Cynthia Nevels, a financial and business consultant, said doctors diagnosed cystic fibrosis two days after her son’s birth.At age 13, Nelson’s condition worsened. Forced from competitive sports, he developed diabetes and weighed less than 100 pounds. Doctors said Nelson’s liver was cirrhotic, his lungs damaged, his spleen the size of a football. His nose bled constantly. He coughed blood. He spent weeks in the hospital. He took 17 medications daily.Nelson answered pain with a smile on his face and laughter in his belly, and an outlook that remained positive. Only once in 16 years did his mother see frustration fill his face.Richardson sent text messages or called every other day. On Nelson’s last two birthdays, Richardson visited. Two years ago, that meant spending the day with Nelson in the hospital, where they ate cake and talked about girls and played video games. Nelson explained his preferred profession: pilot.Mostly, football was their bond. Nelson loves the Dallas Cowboys, and he rattled off the statistics of his favorite players, like Emmitt Smith and Terence Newman, and now Dez Bryant. Nelson taught Richardson to play the video game Madden NFL, where Nelson destroyed him.“He needed tips,” Nelson said. “When he came down here, I kind of blew him out. He’s not the only one.”In October, concerned with Nelson’s internal bleeding, doctors sent the family to the transplant hospital in Houston. Nevels leased her home near Dallas and sold most of her possessions to help cover medical costs. When she did not feel overwhelmed or scared, she felt numb.From Oct. 22 to Nov. 15, the family waited, uncertain of the status of transplants for Nelson, uncertain of his future. Nevels projected calm that masked her inner turbulence.“On the inside, I’m thinking, how is he going to make it?” she said. “There are no guarantees here. I was afraid. I still am.”She taught Tyler yoga to help with breathing. She flew one brother, Jeremy, a senior football standout at South Grand Prairie High School, to Houston, and that alone improved Tyler’s condition. On Nov. 15, the family learned that the hospital’s medical board had approved his transplants, which he will receive at the same time, from the same donor.The hospital gave him a pager. He sent a photo of him holding it, smiling, to Richardson.Even with Dr. Marc Schecter, the hospital’s medical director of the pediatric lung transplant program, Nelson remained all football, all the time. In fact, after the Jets’ comeback victory last Sunday against Schecter’s favorite team, the Houston Texans, Nelson entered the hospital in Jets gear.On average, Schecter said, patients wait 81 days for transplants. Because Nelson needs two organs, his wait could be longer.In the interim, Nelson and his family stay at the Ronald McDonald House in Houston, where he attends a nearby school and tries to maintain as normal a life as possible.“The hardest part is the waiting,” Schecter said. “We could call him tonight. We could call him in six weeks.”Through his contacts with the Jets and Nike, Richardson sent three boxes of hats, shirts, jackets and shorts to Nelson. He also reached out to the N.F.L. and the players union and asked teammates Dustin Keller, Mark Sanchez and Nick Mangold to spread the word via their Twitter accounts.Next week, Nelson will undergo an operation designed to divert the heavy bleeding from his intestines, stomach and esophagus around his damaged liver, toward the heart. He hopes his story will inspire more to donate organs (find out at giftstotyler.org). He also hopes the Cowboys will hire Bill Cowher or Tony Dungy as coach next season.“Tony will never know how much inspiration he provided,” Nevels said. “Human beings don’t do something like he did. He makes Tyler happy. He gives Tyler hope.”Richardson would like to hold a mirror to that notion. Because he sees the same thing, the other way around.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','Chas Percodani, 25, of Athol, Mass., rooted his HTC EVO to bolster the phone’s speed and performance, but also for more philosophical reasons. “I feel that I should have control and be able to install what I want, use the phone the way I want to,” said Mr. Percodani, who is planning to study computer programming.Because today’s smartphones pack the power of personal computers, they attract innovators, hackers and people who want the freedom to customize. In a jailbreak or root, the user slips through the phone’s defenses and takes down barriers established by phone makers.It is not a common practice, partly because people have the impression it is illegal. A recent ruling by the Library of Congress said jailbreaking did not violate copyright laws. That decision, combined with new techniques that make jailbreaking and rooting easier, has added fresh momentum to the movement. Flurry, an analytics company that tracks the behavior of iPhone users, said the number of jailbroken devices fluctuates from 5 to 8 percent.Jailbreaking has downsides. It may void a phone’s warranty, though a jailbreak can be reversed.Security precautions do need to be taken. After jailbreaking, you should change the password for the all-powerful user known as root, according to David Marcus, director of security research and communications for McAfee Labs. Otherwise, he said, the phone is vulnerable to attack.It is also important to use the same vigilance you use when considering a program for your computer. Some programs may be malicious. Learn about the developers by visiting their Web sites, reading reviews and talking to other users to gain assurances of reliability and trustworthiness.Apple maintains a tight grip on the iPhone experience by wielding veto power over what developers can sell at the App Store and by limiting the scope of their programming powers. Apple, which argued against jailbreaking in the copyright case, says it comes with risks. It can severely degrade the iPhone experience and cause the iPhone to become unreliable, according to Natalie Harrison, an Apple spokeswoman.Should you want to try jailbreaking anyway, numerous methods are available. After navigating to jailbreakme.com, using the phone’s Safari browser, a jailbreak can take place quickly if the phone’s operating system, called iOS, is a supported version. Other ways to jailbreak are made available at sites like Spiritjb.com and Limera1n.com. A new site, HelpMeJailbreak.com, publishes a list of options based on the phone’s model and iOS version.Some of the better apps that are then available include iRealSMS ($12.99, irealsms.com), the text-messaging app that Mr. Medenblik likes. He can send and receive messages while other apps like video and games are still running. IRealSMS and other programs, including MyWi ($19.99, intelliborn.com), the app that can turn an iPhone into a Wi-Fi hot spot, are available from a store called Cydia (cydia.saurik.com). Users can buy apps, themes and lesser-known programs called tweaks. In these, programmers have figured out ways to modify other apps. A tweak called YourTube (cocoanuts.co), for example, adds a download option to the YouTube app that comes with the phone, enabling users to save videos.Rooting an Android phone is similar to jailbreaking an iPhone. There are various ways to root phones. A program called Easy Root ($.99, unstableapps.com/buyme.html) is fast though it supports only a few models. Another source for rooting is RootzWiki (rootzwiki.com).Custom versions of the operating system, called custom ROMs, are one benefit of rooting. They are created by programmers like Steven Bird, known among Android hackers as Birdman. “It’s something that is actually yours,” said Mr. Bird, who recently developed one for the Droid X. “It’s not just whatever the manufacturer gives you.”Earl Dombroski of Albuquerque installed a ROM on his HTC EVO. He got it from XDA Developers (xda-developers.com) and prepared by reviewing the installation steps and practicing for about a day. The actual process took less than an hour. “It was a lot less scary than I was anticipating,” said Mr. Dombroski, who has experience in computer programming.After installing the ROM, he was able to remove several preinstalled applications that came with the phone. The result, he said, was improved battery life. Also because of root access he can use Titanium Backup (free, matrixrewriter.com/android), an app that enables him to quickly restore entire backups of his phone.Other rooters, like Mr. Percodani, are increasing the speed of their phones by over-clocking the processor with SetCPU ($1.99, pokedev.com/setcpu), an app that also lets you reduce the speed to improve battery life. Others are turning their phones into Wi-Fi hot spots with Wireless Tether for Root Users (free, code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether). Apps for rooted phones are available in Google’s Android Market store by searching for keywords like root or rooted.For Android phones, too, there are rooting risks. It voids phone warranties and it risks damaging the phone. One misstep during a root and you could turn the phone into an expensive paperweight, a mishap the Android community calls bricking.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','Assuming you have a good connection, the app sends you a product description (so you’re sure it scanned the right product). It also sends you information that gives you in-store power you have never had: a list of prices from the Web and nearby stores.Although you could use the apps to find better prices on a pair of socks or a Nerf ball, it would be more trouble than it’s worth. More expensive purchases are in this technology’s sweet spot, since a two-minute smartphone detour can easily save you $20, if not $200.If, that is, the item in question isn’t an evening gown or a pair of earrings.The rule to keep in mind: If you would expect to find troves of information about an item online — like electronics, books, or appliances — you can expect good results from the apps.Last week, I followed my 8-year-old son, Luca, as he trolled an independent toy store in our town. With his birthday falling on the same week as Christmas, the grandparents will want gift ideas.I pulled out my iPhone, opened RedLaser and snapped the bar codes of a couple of items he seemed to be interested in. Because of the poor lighting in the store, I struggled. The app failed to focus. (The app’s developer later suggested using the flash option, but I couldn’t find it at the time.)As I fumbled with my phone, a store manager fixed a gaze on me, arms crossed.“I’m using an app to put a list together,” I explained, thinking she might have mistaken me for a retail competitor — or, more likely, someone checking for better prices elsewhere.My explanation didn’t appear to please her. I nodded toward Luca. “I’m going to come back and get these things when he’s not around,” I mumbled. Like I said, you’ve got to get over the guilt to make this work.I could have proudly let her know I was using my smartphone to check what others were saying about the toys, but given the heat of her stare, I sensed it wasn’t the best strategy.Either way, she went back to her duties and let me be.Luca and I then visited a brightly lighted Wal-Mart, where, in the video games section, items scanned flawlessly, and clerks showed no reaction to my overt scanning activities. I found Wal-Mart’s prices comparable to anything online or nearby. If I had been ready to buy, I would have proceeded with no nagging worries about better prices elsewhere.A few days later I visited a Kohl’s department store, looking for ideas for my wife. The store offered a romantic item: a Dyson DC25 vacuum for $522.50, on sale from $550.RedLaser offered two sets of results. One list, from TheFind, which operates a popular online shopping comparison service, had the Dyson for $398 at Home Depot. Another list, from Google, found it on Amazon for $379.RedLaser’s results included only prices posted online, but suggested I might save $124 by driving a few miles, if the local Home Depot honored its online price. Curious to see more local results, I opened TheFind’s app. Although RedLaser offers results from TheFind searches, TheFind reserves some results for its own app. It came up with a higher Home Depot price ($438) in its Web results, but in the “Nearby” section it found the Dyson selling for $340 at a Best Buy four miles away.After my vacuum victory, I wandered over to the apparel section, where, app developers said, I should expect less success. True enough, I had difficulty getting the apps to recognize the products, even when the bar codes were in bright light.This is where Google Shopper came in especially handy. Because the app permits voice search, I just said “Asics Gel-Turbulent,” and the Android app delivered prices of the sneakers. Shopper, unlike the Google iPhone app, includes an icon that is meant to deliver reviews, but most of my search results did not include reviews.No matter. I just clicked on the Zappos.com result, and read the reviews from that site.Another option would have been the Runner’s World Shoe Shop app (free on iPhone), which offers editorial reviews of shoes, along with prices online and at local stores. Other magazine-affiliated apps, like Seventeen’s Fashion Finder, Shop Cosmo, GQ Style Picks and Marie Claire Shop the Shoot, offer similar features, so if your shopping tastes dovetail with any of these magazines, these apps belong on your iPhone.It’s worth noting that I succeeded with my apparel searches because I was in a store filled with mass-market items. Had I been touring haute couture boutiques, or anything close, I’d have struck out.As useful as the apps had been for these other purchases, they are essential for electronics. At RadioShack, I looked at a 32-inch AOC Envision HDTV, selling for $329. (Not quite as romantic as a vacuum, but still.) RadioShack’s bar code defied scanning, so I typed it into Shopper. The price was comparable to other retailers, and this time Google delivered reviews, positive ones, from CompUSA.com and TigerDirect.com.I strolled to a display of spy-related toys like night-vision goggles and voice-recording pens, where an amiable RadioShack manager joined me. I told him I was checking reviews of the toys, and he informed me that they were new.“Only three stores carry these,” he said. “The other ones are charging $20 more.”I scanned the bar codes, just so I’d remember the item later. Up came the prices, including one from a competitor that matched RadioShack.He may have misspoken. I may have misunderstood. But part of me — the part that enjoys the cat-and-mouse game of sales — thinks retailers are onto us.Fair enough. As long as I have a smartphone handy, I won’t be duped.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','Q. I sometimes receive e-mail messages with a “winmail.dat” file attached that I cannot open. Why does this happen, and what can I do to fix it?A. The winmail.dat file usually appears because various mail programs handle message formats differently. Certain messages sent from the Microsoft Outlook mail program (or a Microsoft Exchange server) may arrive with a winmail.dat attachment if your own mail program is not set up to handle mail in the Microsoft Outlook Rich Text Format.Unlike plain-text formatting, this Rich Text Format can display different text styles, fonts and colors within a message. The winmail.dat file contains the Rich Text Format information for the message, but usually will not open normally. (These attachments are sometimes called T.N.E.F. files, short for Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format, which is the technical term for the format Outlook uses.)If the winmail.dat file needs to be opened to read the message or its intended file attachment, there are a few ways to troubleshoot. One is to ask the sender to change Outlook’s settings so that mail can be sent in the plain-text format, and then to resend the original message. Microsoft has information on how to do this at support.microsoft.com/kb/290809.Another approach is to download a program that can translate the winmail.dat file. Several developers have created helpful programs that can open the files. The MozillaZine site has a list of shareware for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux systems, along with more information about dealing with winmail.dat files, at kb.mozillazine.org/Winmail.dat_attachments.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','Elena Salgado, Spain’s finance minister, insisted on Wednesday that Spain would not need rescuing. She told Spanish radio that “we are in the best position to resist against these speculative attacks.” Indeed, some say that one of Spain’s relative strengths is that a large amount of its government debt — 203.3 billion euros ($271.1 billion) — is owed to its own banks, rather than foreign lenders. If the government’s financial condition worsens, the thinking goes, Spanish banks would have a greater incentive to help out by easing terms on the loans than would foreign banks, which might take a harder line.Of course, it is a bit of a double-edged sword; if the Spanish banks need to ease terms to help the government, they could be forced to swallow steep losses, hurting their balance sheets.The likelihood of entering such a vicious circle could also rise next year, when Spain is due to repay lenders 192 billion euros, or about a fifth of the total debt. As a result of increasing interest it would have to pay for new borrowing, Spain faces a rise of 18 percent in the cost of financing its debt, according to the government’s budgetary plan.Investor nervousness is mounting just as Madrid is reining in a budget deficit that reached 11.1 percent of gross domestic product last year. Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, initially slow to recognize the crisis, narrowly pushed through Parliament last May an austerity package that included 15 billion euros of spending cuts. As a result, Spain’s central government deficit fell 47 percent in the first 10 months of this year, according to government figures released on Tuesday.Ireland also made steep spending cuts, but still needed a bailout. The main reason is that its banks were a lot more troubled than the government realized, and it could not afford the cost of supporting them without help from Europe.The looming question is whether Spanish banks are really as healthy as the government and the banks say they are.Last July, Spanish banks emerged relatively unscathed from stress tests carried out across Europe, which showed that only five Spanish entities might have insufficient capital. All of them, however, were among the weaker cajas, or savings banks, that were already due to tap into a 99-billion-euro state restructuring fund and get absorbed in a consolidation round aimed at cutting the number of cajas to about 20 from 45.But the credibility of the stress tests has since been undermined by the collapse of Irish banks. Spanish banks avoided the catastrophic subprime investments made by Irish and many other European financial institutions, but Spanish banks nonetheless had a “problematic exposure” of 180.8 billion euros to real estate and Spain’s collapsed construction sector, like substandard and repossessed assets, according to a study by the Bank of Spain. The bank has gradually been tightening the provisioning requirements for repossessed assets.Moreover, Spanish banks could suffer if Portugal’s financial problems worsen. Spain is not only Portugal’s biggest trade partner, it is also its biggest creditor, with Spanish banks holding $78 billion of Portuguese debt, according to the Bank for International Settlements.“Spain’s banks already have enough problems, but the exposure to Portugal could just turn into the wild cart which upturns the whole apple cart,” said Edward Hugh, an independent economist based in Barcelona. Ireland’s near collapse has revived concerns about Spanish banks, resulting in a plunge in their stock prices this week.Spain’s vulnerability would rise, warned Ralph Solveen, an economist covering Spain at Germany’s Commerzbank, should the government veer away from its deficit-cutting objectives or Spanish banks show further signs of fragility. “One clear risk factor is the banking system and possible bad news from there, because then many people would start to draw parallels with the situation in Ireland, whether justified or not,” Mr. Solveen said.Another concern is that the central government’s cost-cutting zeal might not be matched by regional and local authorities, which accounted for 57 percent of public spending last year. Coming regional elections, starting with Catalonia this Sunday, could persuade politicians to make some unsustainable spending pledges, in particular in regions like Andalusia, where some municipalities have already fallen behind in paying staff salaries.The central government, however, appears determined to force greater fiscal discipline even on Spain’s capital city. Last week, Mr. Zapatero rejected an appeal from the mayor of Madrid, which has debt of 7.15 billion euros, to relax recent restrictions on municipal debt issuance.“Saying ‘no’ to the most powerful municipality in this country does send a very strong signal,” said Antonio Fernández, head of restructuring and insolvency at Garrigues, a Spanish law firm.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','THE announcement of Kate Middleton’s engagement to Prince William loosed the inevitable flurry of speculation. What will her royal title be? Will she one day be known as Queen Kate? Will her dress vie in splendor with the satin-and-pearl confection that Diana, Princess of Wales, wore on her wedding day? Most urgently, who will design it?Daniella Issa Helayel, the Brazilian-born Londoner of the Issa label, is not about to clear up that mystery. But all indicators point in her direction. After all, Miss Middleton wore a gem-tone Issa dress at the engagement announcement to match her sapphire ring. She has a well-publicized relationship with Ms. Helayel, whose waist-enhancing frocks are custom-fitted to her frame; she wears them often, even on formal occasions, like the wedding last month of Prince William’s friend Harry Meade.Persuasive as it is, that accretion of evidence made no dent in Ms. Helayel’s defenses. She was flinty, in fact, insisting before agreeing to be interviewed that questions about a bridal gown never be raised. So it was startling to find that, speaking by phone from her Chelsea studio, she was engaging and strikingly frank.Her look is meant to suggest a billowy glamour, conjuring seaside holidays in Belize or St.-Tropez. Her inspiration is less rarefied. “I design clothes for people like me who think they’re fat,” she said bluntly, clothes that are meant to “hide people’s defects and accentuate the good points.”Ms. Helayel started designing a decade ago, because, as she said, “I couldn’t find dresses that fitted my figure.” Her solution was to buy vintage styles and alter them, “but then my clothes would smell like mothballs,” she confided with a laugh. “What I really wanted was one new dress.”'"
"'10-11-25,'0','The prospect of political chaos in Ireland, and fears that a splintered government might roll back deficit-cutting measures amid public ire, had worried European officials and financial markets. The events in Ireland have led investors to turn their attention to the troubled economies of Spain and, in particular, Portugal. On Wednesday, Portuguese workers staged a huge strike to protest government austerity measures designed to get the nation’s finances under control.In Ireland, trade unions were also warning of “civil unrest” and planned protests in Dublin on Saturday.The International Monetary Fund and Ireland’s partners in the European Union insisted on an austerity budget as a condition for the $114 billion bailout, money that Ireland badly needs after it intervened to rescue its banks.During the economic boom years before 2008, Irish banks borrowed cheaply and pumped out loans on houses and construction projects, helping to fuel an American-style housing bubble that went bust, ravaging their balance sheets.The austerity plan calls for cuts of nearly 15 percent in Ireland’s social welfare budget, one of Europe’s most generous, saving $4 billion a year. Some 24,750 public jobs — a huge number in a country of about 4 million people — would be eliminated, cutting state payrolls down to about what they were in 2005 and saving about $1.6 billion a year. Child benefits and other social welfare payments would be reduced, and the nation’s minimum wage, now 8.65 euros, or $11.59, an hour, would be cut by 1 euro, or about $1.34, in the hope of promoting job creation.Mr. Cowen said the sagging economy could recover only if Ireland proved it was cleaning up its act. “Without putting public finances on a sustainable basis, we can’t have confidence from investors to create jobs in Ireland,” he said. He predicted that the deficit reduction plan would help lower unemployment to less than 10 percent, from 13.4 percent currently, within four years.While voters were angry about the crisis, there was also an acknowledgment that the boom years fueled too many excesses, which must now be reined in. “In a bubble, things get distorted, and after it collapses you need to rebalance the economy,” said Philip R. Lane, a professor of international macroeconomics at Trinity College. “So this plan is not really radically shifting the nature of the welfare state, it’s just returning it to what it was before the crisis.”Under the measures, Ireland’s tax net would be widened to take in some low-income workers who currently pay no tax, and a series of new taxes would be imposed on certain residential properties, as well as on 120,000 people who receive public sector pensions.The government also plans to cut spending on health care by over $1.9 billion through measures that are likely to push up the cost of private health insurance.Capital spending on education will rise, but education programs will nonetheless take a hit starting next year, as more than $66.7 million is cut from the four-year budget. Classroom sizes may also grow if educators cannot find ways to reduce teacher payrolls.Thousands of young Irish, along with people who have been shut out of the job market, are swelling the ranks of Ireland’s university students as they ride out a difficult economy.Still, the austerity plan does not touch Ireland’s low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent, which has helped to lure companies like Microsoft, Intel and Pfizer to set up operations in the country.Though the country’s political parties are bitterly divided over many aspects of economic policy, they all agree that the low corporate tax rate is one of the few pillars that can allow Ireland to return to economic health. Multinational companies employ about one out of seven working people in Ireland, and their businesses are stoking export growth, even as the latest austerity program is expected to depress consumer demand and touch off a wave of retrenchment and job losses.The government is expected within days to take over effective control of the two largest banks in the country, Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland, following plunges in their share prices.Officials from the European Union and the monetary fund have been in Dublin since last week, talking with the government about the financial crisis. They will spend the next several days poring over the details of the budget plan.Before moving on to the Finance Ministry, protesters gathered outside hotel rooms where monetary fund officials have been staying, waving signs that urged the Irish to “fight for every job, resist every cut.” The ministry did not announce where the budget would be unveiled until nearly noon on Wednesday, citing security concerns and the likelihood that crowds of protesters could grow throughout the day.'"
"'10-11-25,'0','BMW and Daimler said this week that they would reduce the Christmas breaks at their factories to meet global demand.The Federal Statistics Office said Tuesday that the German economy had slowed in the third quarter, expanding by 0.7 percent from the second quarter’s 2.3 percent rate, but the data also showed signs that the expansion had moved beyond the narrow manufacturing sector.GfK, a market research firm, said its German consumer sentiment indicator for December showed a sixth consecutive gain, increasing to 5.5 for December from 5.1 in November, which itself was revised upward.Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics in London, wrote in a research note that German exporters had shown few signs of being hit by slowing global demand, and in fact the opposite might be happening because of the euro’s decline.“But we doubt that the resilience of exports will last, even if the euro weakens further,” she said. “German exports (and business sentiment) have responded strongly to changes in world demand in the past and our global forecasts point to a very sharp slowdown to come. German exporters cannot rely on Asian demand alone.”A separate report Wednesday from Eurostat, the official statistics agency of the European Union, suggested caution was in order.New orders for industrial goods for the 16 member nations included in the euro zone fell 3.8 percent in September from August; for all 27 members of the European Union, new orders fell 2.5 percent in September from August. Still, new orders were up by 13.5 percent from a year earlier in the euro zone and by 13.4 percent in the entire union.Ms. McKeown said fiscal tightening would constrain any consumer revival, and business and consumer sentiment could suffer as the euro zone bailed out weaker members.However, the Ifo survey suggests Germany will keep driving the euro zone recovery “in the very near term at least,” she said, adding: “We expect the region’s largest economy to expand by about 3.5 percent this year before growth slows to about 1.5 percent in 2011.In London, a report from the Office for National Statistics showed that the British economy expanded by 0.8 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter, confirming the initial estimate from October. Gross domestic product grew 2.8 percent from a year earlier.Scott Corfe, an economist at the Center for Economics and Business Research in London, wrote in a note that the figures were in line with market expectations, but said the details revealed “underlying weaknesses in the U.K. economy, which we believe will bear down on growth over the quarters ahead.”In particular, he noted, consumption, investment and government expenditure all slowed in the quarter, pointing to “frailty in the domestic demand side of the economy.”“There is certainly scope for private demand to disappoint,” Simon Hayes, an economist at Barclays Capital Research, wrote in an analysis. “However, the recent momentum in private demand provides plenty of headroom for a continued expansion even if these risks crystallize.”'"
"'10-11-25,'0','PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Investigators in Cambodia said Wednesday that a stampede that caused the deaths of 350 people who were suffocated or crushed Monday night was probably touched off by the slight swaying of a short suspension bridge packed on the last evening of an annual water festival.The report, carried on Bayon TV, a government-owned station, said 400 people had been injured. Most of the victims were among the millions of rural people who travel to the capital each year for the festival. Earlier estimates of the casualties had been higher.By Wednesday morning, most of the dead had been identified at hospitals and taken in government trucks to their villages, along with grieving relatives.At Calmette Hospital, where 140 bodies had been laid out in white sheets in an outdoor morgue, only three remained unclaimed. Several people wandered the hospital’s grounds holding snapshots of missing relatives, including wedding portraits and holiday photographs.The bridge where the victims died, closed off with yellow tape, remained littered with shoes and bits of clothing that had been torn off in the crush.'"

"'10-11-26,'0','This season, the 64-team field was dotted with upsets. Only one No. 1 seed, Stanford, has survived to the Round of 8. The Cardinal faces No. 2 Florida State on Friday in Palo Alto, Calif. Unseeded Washington, with a modest 13-8 record, defeated No. 1-seeded Portland on penalty kicks and edged California Irvine in double overtime on a goal from a freshman substitute, Allie Beahan. The Huskies play second-seeded Boston College, an Atlantic Coast Conference power trying to reach its first Women’s College Cup. In spite of its two titles, even Notre Dame has taken on a hint of a Cinderella story with its victory over North Carolina.No. 3 seed Ohio State made the quarterfinals once, six years ago, and will host unseeded Georgetown. This is only the second time the Hoyas have qualified for the tournament. They earned their first postseason tournament win with a 5-1 rout of Siena. Georgetown eliminated No. 1 seed Maryland on penalty kicks and then Minnesota, 1-0, on a last-minute corner kick, to reach Friday’s quarterfinal against Ohio State in Columbus.“It’s all uncharted waters for us,” Georgetown Coach Dave Nolan said. “It used to be that there were 20 great players divided between the four or so top programs. Now there are 100 great players. Those top schools are still getting their pick, but the other schools are getting great players, too.”Georgetown’s rise began four years ago, when Nolan secured a larger scholarship count from the university’s athletic department. Soon after, he landed the blue-chip recruit Ingrid Wells, a junior midfielder nicknamed the Little General. She has led the team to a program-best 15 wins this season.“It’s a sport of emphasis at a lot of schools; Title IX is really having that effect where people and budgets and scholarships are funded at a high level,” said Sue Ryan, the coach at Stony Brook and past chairwoman of the women’s committee of the National Soccer Coaches Association of America.Women’s soccer is a bargain for institutions seeking Title IX compliance. The equipment is minimal and cheap. The field dimensions make it possible to share space with football and lacrosse teams. The rosters are large, between 20 and 30 players, and the N.C.A.A. scholarship allotment is generous, allowing up to 14 fully funded players, a boon for universities looking to balance out their gender-equity numbers.At the grassroots level, the first generation of women born after the 1972 passage of Title IX are now parents of college players. They grew up during the youth soccer boom of the 1980s and are more likely to encourage their daughters to play, and to coach them. (In U.S. Youth Soccer’s Olympic Development Program Region 1, an area that stretches from West Virginia to Maine, there are more than a million registered youth players.)As a result, more girls are playing better soccer under increasingly sophisticated youth coaches, creating a greater supply of elite athletes. Some top players have begun choosing up-and-coming programs over the traditional powerhouses.“At the time I was being recruited, Stanford wasn’t the top program,” said Christen Press, a senior forward at Stanford and the Pacific-10 player of the year. “I wanted to play for a program that I could help build up, rather than become a plug-in player for a program that was historically strong.”Press’s team fell to North Carolina, 1-0, in last year’s final. The Cardinal aims to win this year.To do so, Stanford will have to go through a strong Florida State team, which reached the 2007 championship game but lost to Southern California, 2-0.Seminoles Coach Mark Krikorian likes his team’s resiliency but knows there are no guarantees; in soccer, one great breakout shot or one unfortunate turnover can be the difference between winning and losing.“The thing about soccer is, the most talented team doesn’t always win,” he said. “You’ve got to find a way to win, and that’s where resiliency can beat talent. This year’s field is more diverse than ever, and I don’t really see much of a common thread between the teams that are still in the tournament, but if it’s anything, it’s that psychological attitude.”'"
"'10-11-26,'0','In two of San Francisco’s lowest-crime neighborhoods, dozens of families pay up to $6,500 a year for armed off-duty or retired police officers, who provide such services as walking them from the sidewalk to their front doors. If asked, the officers will also accompany clients into their homes, and check closets and under beds for intruders.“This is a relatively inexpensive proposition for the peace of mind,” said Rick Paras, a retired police officer who recently took over the management of Pacific Heights Security Inc. Off-duty officers work from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. for $25 to $30 an hour.Mr. Paras said Pacific Heights and Presidio Heights were home to many business people who traveled a lot but left their small children and spouse at home. Presidio Heights and much of Pacific Heights are part of the Richmond precinct of the San Francisco Police Department, Mr. Paras said, where squad cars patrol a vast area. But with crime on the decline, there has been a steep drop in the number of families subscribing to the security service. In Presidio Heights, only 54 families participate now; a decade ago there were 118. Clients pay from $700 a year (for access to a cellphone number to report “anything you fear”) to $2,000 to add vacation monitoring of an empty house. Full-fledged guard service is $4,800 a year.On a rainy evening in October, William Oberndorf, a Presidio Heights resident, spoke at a meeting held by Pacific Heights Security to promote its service in the Chancellor’s Room of the University of California at San Francisco campus on California Street.Except for a reporter, he faced an empty room.Mr. Oberndorf said that 15 years ago he was robbed at gunpoint one evening in his garage. The San Francisco Police Department was terrific in handling the case, he said, but he also “felt we weren’t covered very well in the neighborhood.”'"
"'10-11-26,'0','“We would have liked to appeal, but with defense attorneys like his, who have the Appeals and Supreme Court eating out of their hands, and a number of powerful people who continue to protect Karadima, we knew it would be an uphill battle that we were likely to lose,” he said.Father Karadima still faces the possibility of church sanction. The archbishop of Santiago, Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz, sent an investigation report prepared by the Roman Catholic Church in Chile to the Vatican in June, asking it to rule in the case.Father Karadima, who could not be reached for comment, has insisted that he is innocent.A criminal complaint filed in April accused him of molesting the four plaintiffs, three when they were minors, over the last two decades in El Bosque Parish in Santiago. Since hearings in the case began, four other men have come forward with similar accusations.Mr. Hermosilla said the state prosecutor had gathered testimony from dozens of witnesses that “established a pattern of decades of abusive behavior.”But he said that the judge, Leonardo Valdivieso, never gave the parties access to the investigation report until the day he closed the case and withheld testimony and other evidence that could have advanced it.Judge Valdivieso dismissed the case without having Father Karadima face his accusers, as they had requested. Defense lawyers presented the court with a number of medical certificates asserting that the priest could have a heart attack if forced to do so, Mr. Hermosilla said.Complaints of sexual abuse by Father Karadima were filed with the church as early as 2003. A church investigation was opened in 2004 but suspended shortly afterward.Cardinal Errázuriz reopened the investigation in late 2009, and in June he referred the case to the Vatican.“We trust the Vatican will rule appropriately,” said Juan Carlos Cruz, a plaintiff who said he was abused by Father Karadima as a teenager. “Because as for the Chilean courts, we have done all we could possibly do, exposing our lives and reliving the abuses, at an enormous personal and emotional price.”'"

"'10-11-26,'0','LONDON (AP) — Roger Federer and Andy Murray easily secured spots in the semifinals of the ATP World Tour Finals on Thursday with straight-sets victories in their last round-robin matches.Federer continued his dominance against Robin Soderling, winning by 7-6 (5), 6-3 to earn the top spot in Group B of the season-ending tournament. Murray recovered from a shaky start to beat David Ferrer, 6-2, 6-2, handing Ferrer his third straight loss in the group phase.Their semifinal opponents will be decided Friday, when the last round-robin matches in Group A are played. That group includes Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Tomas Berdych and Andy Roddick, and all four are still in contention for the semifinals.Federer won his third straight group match and improved his career record against Soderling to 15-1, with his only loss coming this year in the French Open quarterfinals.“He always brings out something different every time he plays me, because he has to try different things,” Federer said. “I was able to handle it well, which was a very happy feeling for me to have.”Federer, ranked No. 2 in the world, broke serve for a 5-3 lead in the second set, hitting a backhand passing shot that Soderling returned into the net. Federer then set up match point with a drop shot and converted it when Soderling hit another return into the net.In the first-set tie breaker, Federer served two straight aces to take a 5-2 lead. He converted his second set point with a lunging one-handed backhand that Soderling let sail past him. He thought it would be long, but it landed in the far corner.“At first I was pretty sure it was going out,” Soderling said. “As soon as I let it go, I felt like this one is going much closer to the line than I expected. Of course, it went in. So, yeah, it was a little bit unlucky. But it’s my fault.”Federer’s victory meant Murray had to win only a set to clinch second place in the group. He took care of that in 31 minutes, recovering from 0-2 in the first set by playing nearly perfect tennis in winning the next seven games.He was broken at love in the next game, then broke Ferrer twice more for a 5-2 lead. Murray sealed the victory with an easy forehand winner at the net on his first match point.'"
"'10-11-26,'0','The classical offerings at Le Poisson Rouge usually explore either experimental corners of new music or the growing part of the repertory that borrows liberally from rock and jazz. But the club’s laid-back atmosphere makes it an appealing place to hear more conventional programs too, and on Wednesday evening, the Parnas/Kohlberg Trio presented a straightforward overview of the more conservative side of the 20th-century repertory, with a brief foray into the early 19th century along the way.Actually, the ensemble’s billing was deceptive: only one of the five works on the program was performed by the ensemble in its full form. The rest of the evening was devoted to a solo work and duets.As a curtain raiser, Madalyn Parnas, the violinist, and Yaron Kohlberg, the pianist, gave a fiery account of Lutoslawski’s “Subito” (1992), a work composed as a test piece for the International Violin Competition of Indianapolis and packed with technical challenges meant to show which competitors had the goods. Ms. Parnas negotiated this minefield with assurance and vigor, but she also seized the opportunities offered by this changeable score’s lyrical interludes and fleeting touches of humor.Cicely Parnas matched the virtuosity of her sister’s Lutoslawski performance in her own solo turn, Hindemith’s Sonata for Cello Solo (Op. 25, No. 3). In this compact five-movement work, Hindemith probes the cello’s full range and technical resources, and provides a measure of emotional heft as well. Ms. Parnas played it with focused intensity, attention to Hindemith’s constantly changing textures and an appealing touch of wildness when the music was at its most heated.Mr. Kohlberg’s solo work was to have been Janacek’s Sonata “1.X.1905,” but he played the final two movements of Chopin’s Sonata No. 3 instead. It was an odd choice, given the program’s modernist spirit, but it proved a suitable calling card for Mr. Kohlberg, who gave a measured, singing account of the Largo and a full-throttle finale enlivened, occasionally, by quirkily original phrasing twists.The full ensemble closed the program with Shostakovich’s Trio in E minor (Op. 67), and though the reading had its striking moments — most notably, an exquisite rendering of the tandem violin and cello lines in the Largo — much of it sounded emotionally at arm’s length. It was as if the players were so determined to produce a polished, unified sound that exploring Shostakovich’s troubled psyche was left on the to-do list.'"
"'10-11-26,'0','Some have suggested that the euro project is in danger of breaking up as a result of the crisis. But Axel A. Weber, president of Germany’s central bank and a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank, dismissed that idea.A fund of 440 billion euros (about $600 billion) was set up in May as a backstop for European countries. Mr. Weber said he believed that the size of the fund was sufficient but that European nations would come up with the difference — which he put at 145 billion euros — if faced with having to cover the total public debt load of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.“I think that this pessimistic scenario can be ruled out,” Mr. Weber said, according to Reuters. “If, however, it came to this worst of worst cases, the euro will not fail because of a difference of 145 billion euros.”Behind official statements, there still appears to be a difference between Germany and France, the two dominant economies in the euro zone.German government officials argue that markets will be calmed only when they know, and can adjust to, any new rules operating after the fund expires in 2013 .Berlin sees the current market turbulence as a consequence of the problems of the weak finances of some members, who for too long were able to benefit from low interest rates attached to their bond issues; the unspoken assumption was that Germany would provide a backstop if needed.Officials in Berlin argue that as a condition of obtaining any financial assistance after 2013, the private sector should face losses, albeit mild ones initially.But France and other member states have expressed concern about alarming nervous investors and exacerbating market strains. Paris is also aware that its budget position is weaker than Germany’s.Many European Union members also worry about having this debate before Ireland’s bailout is completed and while speculation continues that Portugal and Spain may require assistance.Some blame Berlin openly. German authorities “are slowly losing sight of the European common good,” Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, who heads the euro zone finance ministers’ group, was quoted as saying by Rheinischer Merkur, a German newspaper. But he added: “I am neither worried about the survival of the euro nor about the survival of the European Union.”Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels, said: “The German way is: ‘Let’s have clear rules and let’s define the rules precisely, and the private players learn what the rules are,’ The French approach is, ‘Let’s address the problems as they emerge, let’s keep maximum discretion and don’t set in stone what does not have to be set in stone.’ ”'"
"'10-11-26,'0','MOSCOW — Russia responded angrily on Thursday to a proposal that would deny European visas to a list of 60 officials who have been implicated in the death of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in pretrial detention in Moscow last year.Konstantin I. Kosachev, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the lower house of Parliament, condemned the proposed ban as “Bolshevik tactics” and said Russia might be forced to “very harshly retaliate” if the proposal went forward.He said such pressure “could have extremely negative consequences for the entire relationship between Russia and the European Union.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry called the move “direct interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state, and open pressure on the judicial system of the Russian Federation.”The comments were in response to the European Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, which voted to add the recommendation to its annual human rights report. The proposal remains far from becoming policy. First, it must be approved by the full European Parliament in December.Then it would be up to the European Union’s member states to decide whether to adopt sanctions against the 60 officials, said Heidi Hautala, a member of the Finnish delegation, who sponsored the proposal.'"
"'10-11-26,'0','Shares in Europe rose on Thursday after an upbeat finish on Wall Street before the Thanksgiving break, but the euro failed to get much of a lift amid concerns that Europe’s debt crisis could soon embroil Portugal or, more dangerous, Spain.In Europe, the FTSE 100 in London was up 49.06 points, or 0.87 percent, while the DAX in Frankfurt rose 59.93 points, or 0.88 percent. The CAC 40 in France climbed 16.88 points, or 0.45 percent.The week had a bumpy start when worries about Europe’s debt crisis became more acute after Ireland’s request for a huge financial bailout and tensions mounted on the Korean peninsula, but stocks have recovered their poise. The lift came mostly from data released on Wednesday showing a sharp drop in weekly jobless claims in the United States and encouraging consumer confidence figures ahead of the crucial Christmas shopping season.The American economic data confirmed that the recovery continued and might be picking up pace.Investors remain cautious, however, about whether the improvement will do much to get the American unemployment rate down from near 10 percent. That is a priority for both the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve, which earlier this month announced that it was pumping up to $600 billion into the economy over the coming months to help get unemployment down and prevent a dangerous bout of deflation — that is, falling prices.Investors also remain watchful of developments in Europe’s debt crisis, which has already forced both Greece and Ireland to tap their partners in the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund for bailout money.'"
"'10-11-26,'0','FRANKFURT — The Bundesbank, the German central bank, said on Thursday that the country’s banks were better off now than they were a year ago, benefiting from a strong domestic economy. But, the bank said, German institutions continue to engage in risky practices that make them vulnerable to a rise in interest rates.“Thanks to stable returns and improved capital, German banks have increased their ability to withstand risk,” Andreas Dombret, a member of the central bank’s executive board, said Thursday at a news conference. But “as before the German bank system still displays vulnerabilities and structural weaknesses.”Despite Germany’s economic growth, its banks are among Europe’s weakest. Moody’s, the ratings agency, ranks the average health of German banks below those of most other Western European countries as well as nations like Brazil, Jordan and Mexico.In its annual financial stability report, the Bundesbank warned that German banks had increased their dependence on short-term financing, a profitable but risky practice because institutions can be caught short if interest rates rise.About 30 percent of German bank debt will mature in less than a year, the bank said, well above the long-term average of 22 percent. Hypo Real Estate, a German property lender now owned by the government, nearly collapsed in 2008 because it could no longer borrow money short term at rates below what it was receiving in interest from customers with long-term loans.'"
"'10-11-26,'0','A preliminary government investigation reported that the mostly rural festival-goers panicked when the suspension bridge began to sway slightly under the weight of the crowd.This conformed to a report by a military police investigator, Sawannara Chendamirie, who said on the morning after the disaster that survivors told him there had been shouts that the bridge was collapsing.There were also questions about whether some people had been electrocuted, possibly by strings of lights on the fretwork of the bridge. Reports to that effect began immediately after the disaster, with some saying the police fired water hoses at the crowd that might have contributed to the problem.Doctors at the city’s main hospital, Calmette, did not rule out that possibility, but said they had seen no sign of electrocution among either the injured or the dead. But they said most of the injured had suffered from the squeezing of the packed crowd. Some patients at the hospital said they had been unable to breathe and had passed out.The police came under criticism for a failure of crowd management and for an inadequate and incompetent response to the disaster. One officer said only half the officially reported number of police officers were actually deployed. Seriously injured survivors reported being dumped into vehicles together with the dead.The government did quickly mobilize help for relatives of victims, many of whom traveled from distant provinces to claim the dead. Tables were set up near a makeshift morgue to confirm identities. Military trucks offered transportation home for coffins and family members. The morgue was all but cleared within a day, although some people wandered the hospital grounds holding snapshots of missing relatives.The Asian Human Rights Commission, based in Hong Kong, issued a report that documented the questions and criticisms.“While the exact cause of the stampede last night remains unclear, with contradictory reports indicating it may have been instigated by either crowd antics or poor construction of the bridge to Koh Pich Island, the failure of the state to control the crowd and limit the damage from the stampede is clear,” the report said.“It is clear, too, that Phnom Penh was unprepared for any large-scale disaster,” the report said. “Responses by police and military were lacking and may even have contributed to the stampede while hospitals were overwhelmed. Emergency and medical personnel resorted to piling bodies together, covering them with mats or sheets.”'"

"'10-11-27,'0','Can an accomplished septuagenarian coach turn back the clock in a college football world now run at speed?McCartney, a man of open faith, believes so. His 16 years away from the crush of Division I coaching is a positive, not a negative, he said. He offers up his trim waistline as evidence that he is prepared, both mentally and physically, to take on the load of resurrecting Colorado football once again.“I don’t identify with the guys who have stayed in it, the Paternos, the Bowdens,” said McCartney, who won 93 games at Colorado and had the Buffaloes ranked third in the national polls when he retired in 1994. “In fairness to them, they stayed on that pace, and it’s a strong current that you’re in, because the workload never gets done.”“I’m going to be significantly younger than the typical 70-year-old,” he added.It’s fair to say, with McCartney in the mix, that Colorado’s search for its next head coach is juicier than the typical regime change.The Buffaloes may be jumping to the Pac-12, but there is no shortage of nostalgia in Boulder for the years McCartney’s teams ruled the Big 8.Also considered among Colorado’s top coaching candidates are the interim coach Brian Cabral, a loyal 21-year assistant and former standout linebacker who led the Buffaloes to two straight wins in the wake of Dan Hawkins’ firing; and Eric Bieniemy, the university’s career leading rusher who now coaches running backs for the . Bieniemy is scheduled to be interviewed for the position Saturday. Jon Embree, the tight ends coach for the who also played for Colorado, is also scheduled to be interviewed.As with any coaching search, plenty of other names have surfaced, but there is a strong undercurrent from fans that Colorado’s next coach better be a McCartney man, if not McCartney himself.“The hire will have to be someone who understands what’s at stake here,” said Alfred Williams, the former All-American linebacker and Butkus Award winner who was a captain of the 1990 national championship team and now works as a radio sports-show host in . “It’s not just a new head coach. It’s also leading the university into a new conference and everything else. The way I look at it, it’s going to be a Colorado man that does that, either Bill McCartney or Eric Bieniemy.”There are strong opinions from a number of factions about which direction Colorado should go, but no name seems to split allegiances more than McCartney’s.Where some fans see a man who would restore instant credibility to a football program in need of direction, others believe his legacy could only be damaged and that the program needs to look forward, not backward.“Mac is a revered and hallowed figure in the lore of C.U. football and you bring him back, and that’s going to bring some real attention to the program,” said Larry Muse, a season ticket holder for the past 25 years and a former president of the Denver Buff Club. “But if for some reason it doesn’t work, you risk tarnishing that reputation.”, a McCartney assistant who returned to Colorado as head coach in 1999, said the university’s athletic department and its director, Mike Bohn, had a number of issues in need of addressing, and that McCartney was just the person for such a job. “Bill McCartney didn’t coach from an X-and-O standpoint,” Barnett added. “Bill McCartney coached from an emotional standpoint, a leadership standpoint. Putting together coaching staffs, that sort of stuff. That’s Mac’s real strength. That’s never left him.”Williams said the majority of fans he had talked to would like to see Bieniemy, a proven recruiter as an assistant at Colorado and , get his first crack at a head job. McCartney or Cabral would also be great hires, he said.If it is not McCartney or one of those two, Williams said that Bohn — who turned down numerous requests for an interview — and his search committee would not have learned a thing from Hawkins’s tenure, which began badly (a loss to Division I-AA State) and ended worse (a blown 28-point fourth-quarter lead at ). “The undertone is that it’s a Colorado man or it’s wrong,” Williams said.Barnett, who was fired in 2005, only three years after leading Colorado to a Big 12 championship, said that the program has bigger problems than just needing the right coach.Only one of the Buffaloes’ last six coaches, McCartney, left on a good note. Four were let go, and Rick Neuheisel bolted to for more money.At the top of Colorado’s list of challenges is a lack of organizational stability (the university has had eight presidents in the last 20 years), facilities that need upgrading, and the continuing struggle to attract support and donations.Whether McCartney should be on the sidelines next fall most likely will remain up for debate, until Bohn, who has said McCartney is a candidate, makes a hire.McCartney does not seem concerned with those questions. “I got out because coaching is very demanding and I wanted to be a better husband and father,” he said. “My wife, Lyndi, who has the most advanced case of , she went to the doctor recently and the doctor told her that she still had several years to live.“We got home that day, and she said to me, ‘I want you to go back to coaching.’ Well, I always wanted to go back into coaching. That just pushed it back into the front burner.”'"

"'10-11-27,'0','When “Twice Born” was first published, there were few books about the adoptee experience. Adoption in general was a veiled topic, and adoptees — assuming they were told anything — rarely knew their given names, their birth parents’ identities or the precise circumstances of their adoptions.As a result, generations of adoptees grew up with a void where their personal histories should be and, Ms. Lifton argued, with deep feelings of confusion, grief and loss.“When I was born, society prophesied that I would bring disgrace to my mother, kill her reputation, destroy her chances for a good bourgeois life,” she wrote in “Twice Born.”She added: “I say that society, by sealing birth records, by cutting adoptees off from their biological past, by keeping secrets from them, has made them into a separate breed, unreal even to themselves.”The book’s publication, which gave momentum to the emerging adoption-reform movement, prompted an outpouring of mail from people with similar stories. These letters, and subsequent interviews with adoptees, informed the next installments in Ms. Lifton’s trilogy, in which she examined the psychological toll that closed adoption can take, and the psychological affinities many adoptees appear to share.While some critics seemed discomforted by Ms. Lifton’s use of mythic metaphor (“I write of perilous journeys of the spirit, of labyrinths, of ghosts, of strangers with mysterious origins, of princesses and princes asleep under spells,” she said in “Twice Born”), others praised her willingness to speak frankly about a taboo subject.Her other books include “The King of Children” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1988), a biography of the Polish Jewish doctor, writer and children’s advocate Janusz Korczak, who was killed in Treblinka. She also wrote for children, including books about adoption and many titles inspired by Japanese folk tales.Blanche Rosenblatt, as she later learned she was originally named, was born in Staten Island on June 11, 1926. Her mother, Rae Rosenblatt, who was 17 when Blanche was born, and her father, a bootlegger and bon vivant, were unmarried, a scandalous condition then. (In the first edition of “Twice Born,” Ms. Lifton gives her birth mother the pseudonym Bea Silverstein.)Ms. Rosenblatt eventually gave up Blanche to a foster home. At 2 ½, she was adopted by a Cincinnati couple, Oscar and Hilda Kirschner, who renamed her Betty Jean.When Betty Jean was 7, Hilda Kirschner informed her that she was adopted, adding that her birth parents were dead. Such falsehoods, Ms. Lifton later wrote, were par for the course at the time.Betty Jean Kirschner earned a bachelor’s degree in English from Barnard College in 1948; in the 1990s, she earned a Ph.D. in counseling psychology from the Union Institute.In 1952 she married Dr. Lifton, a psychiatrist who went on to write many influential books, including psychological studies of war and the Holocaust. The couple lived for several years in Hong Kong and Japan.After returning to the United States, Ms. Lifton, long haunted by her opaque past, contacted the agency that had handled her adoption. She learned that her parents were probably still alive and began scouring public records for traces of them. Bit by bit, the information she gleaned led her to her birth mother.They met several times in the years that followed. Though their communication was often strained, for Ms. Lifton, as she made clear in her writing, it was absolutely necessary.

"'10-11-27,'0','To “finish the season winning all the matches in the group, three victories against top-eight players in probably the most difficult surface for me, is unbelievable now,” Nadal said after beating Berdych for the eighth straight time. “I’m very happy how I am playing, how I improved during the tournament.”It was not all easy sailing for Nadal, who lost his cool momentarily and argued furiously with the officials in the first set.With Nadal trailing, 6-5, a Berdych backhand was called out by the Brazilian umpire Carlos Bernardes, but Nadal had returned the ball in play. Berdych asked for a challenged on the call, which confirmed the ball was actually in, and was then awarded the point.Nadal argued that the point should have been replayed, and ranted first at Bernardes and then at the tournament supervisor sitting in the front row of the crowd, to no avail.“There is no argument,” Nadal said. “I am right.”Berdych said that he thought Nadal had stopped playing to indicate the ball was out, and that the umpire was correct to give him the point.“The referee is probably scared of him and just let him to talk with him too long,” Berdych said. “He was able to play. But every time when you just raise your hand, that means that you stop the play.”The rare outburst seemed to energize Nadal. He returned to the baseline to serve at 15-30, and when a fierce forehand drew an error from Berdych, he pumped his fist and yelled his approval.After dominating the tie breaker, Nadal raced through the second set, leaving Berdych with a familiar sinking feeling. The 25-year-old Berdych has lost 19 straight sets to Nadal, including three in this year’s Wimbledon final.Serving for the win at 5-1, Nadal even had the confidence to try a through-the-legs winner, and although that shot landed millimeters wide, he finished with 27 winners to Berdych’s 18.Roddick, who qualified for the eight-player tournament for the eighth straight year, leaves London with an 0-3 record after a surprisingly lackluster performance on Friday.Roddick, 28, had won his last four matches against Djokovic and engineered a break point in the opening game, only to put a backhand into the net.He failed to threaten again. A forehand into the net handed Djokovic his first break of the set at 2-1, and Roddick went on to rack up 22 unforced errors as his season ended with a whimper.“Feel I’ve been struggling physically on and off for a while now,” Roddick said. “I am looking forward to resting for 10 days and then trying to get in shape. It probably came to an end at about the right time.”'"

Japan’s critical consumer price index, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, was down from the same month a year ago.

"'10-11-27,'0','In what appears to be the latest phase of a far-reaching federal crackdown on online piracy of music and movies, the Web addresses of a number of sites that facilitate illegal file-sharing were seized this week by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a division of the Department of Homeland Security.By Friday morning, visiting the addresses of a handful of sites that either hosted unauthorized copies of films and music or allowed users to search for them elsewhere on the Internet produced a notice that said, in part: “This domain name has been seized by ICE — Homeland Security Investigations, pursuant to a seizure warrant issued by a United States District Court.”In taking over the sites’ domain names, or Web addresses, the government effectively redirected any visitors to its own takedown notice.“ICE office of Homeland Security Investigations executed court-ordered seizure warrants against a number of domain names,” said Cori W. Bassett, a spokeswoman for ICE, in a statement. “As this is an ongoing investigation, there are no additional details available at this time.”Among the domains seized were torrent-finder.com and those of three sites that specialized in music: onsmash.com, rapgodfathers.com and dajaz1.com. TorrentFreak, a news blog about BitTorrent — a file-sharing system that has tended to elude the authorities because it is decentralized — said that at least 70 other addresses had been seized, most belonging to sites related to counterfeit clothing, DVDs and other goods.On Friday, torrent users were already discussing new sites that had popped up to serve them.The takedown notices are similar to those that went up on nine sites in June as part of an initiative against Internet counterfeiting and piracy that the agency called Operation in Our Sites.'"

"'10-11-27,'0','The inspection report represents a setback for Johnson & Johnson as it tries to rebuild public trust in its drug brands after a series of recalls involving millions of products for more than a year. These included a recall in April of an estimated 136 million bottles of liquid children’s Tylenol and other pediatric products, made at a plant in Fort Washington, Pa., and a recall in January of millions of bottles of Tylenol, Motrin and other products made at the Puerto Rico site.A Congressional committee and the F.D.A. office of criminal investigations are separately investigating conduct surrounding McNeil’s recalls.In July, McNeil submitted a plan to the F.D.A. describing the steps the company planned to take to comply with manufacturing standards. McNeil temporarily closed the Pennsylvania plant this year for an overhaul and replaced some employees. In September, Colleen A. Goggins, a Johnson & Johnson executive in charge of the company’s consumer product division, said she planned to retire next year, an announcement that some Wall Street analysts interpreted to mean she was taking the fall for McNeil’s problems.The company has also heightened its vigilance in recalling products that might not meet manufacturing standards. This month, for example, after a review identified manufacturing problems, McNeil recalled nine million bottles of liquid Tylenol Cold Multi-Symptom to update labels, 71,000 packages of Rolaids soft chews because of an unusual texture caused by crystallized sugar, four million packages of Benadryl and 850,000 bottles of Motrin, the company said.These were wholesale and retail — not consumer —recalls and were not undertaken because of potential health risks, the company said. People can continue to use the products, McNeil said.But the latest F.D.A. report, a 10-page document covering inspections from late September through early November, noted some recurrent problems at the plant, including inadequate quality control and incomplete investigations of product deficiencies.For example, the report said that laboratory staff members who tested product quality had made a number of errors and that the company had not yet improved their training.The report concluded that there was no assurance at the Puerto Rico plant “that the current laboratory controls are adequate to assure that drug products conform to appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality and purity.”Officials also noted problems with equipment cleaning and drug mix-ups.“The established procedures and controls for cleaning and maintenance may not be sufficient to prevent mix-ups and/or contamination during the manufacturing and packaging process as evidenced by the mix-up deviations and incidents involving manufacturing and packaging operations,” the report said.The F.D.A. warning letter issued in January about the same plant included similar concerns. On the same day as the warning, McNeil recalled millions of bottles of Tylenol, Benadryl, Motrin, Rolaids, Simply Sleep and St. Joseph aspirin because some consumers had earlier complained about moldy odors emanating from some bottles. The company later determined that a byproduct of a chemical used to treat wooden transport pallets had caused the odor.In a statement, McNeil said that it had been working diligently since January to ensure that its manufacturing operations met F.D.A. standards.“While the company has made progress toward that goal, this is an ongoing commitment and we will invest all necessary resources in order to achieve it,” the statement said.Over the last 10 months, the statement said, McNeil has taken a number of significant steps to improve its manufacturing.'"
"'10-11-27,'0','A judge then reinstated her parole this month, restoring a semblance of freedom, or what amounts to it. She slipped out a side door of the prison where she was being held and back to the wrath of her neighbors. She cringed at the recollection of one recent incident as she walked down the street, holding her son’s hand.“The other day someone came up to me and said, ‘You are damned, and he is doomed. You’re going to suffer your entire life, and he’ll make you suffer more.’ ” she said. “I totally understand that people feel a strong rejection to someone who represents terrorism. The problem is, I may not be the person they paint me to be, and they’ll never know that.”THE tale of how Ms. Berenson, the daughter of New York college professors, became one of the most scorned people in Peru remains remarkable in all its twists and turns. Once a top student at the prestigious La Guardia High School in New York and then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she surfaced here in 1994.A letter from a magazine called Third World Viewpoint gave her press credentials and access to Peru’s Congress. But the police arrested her on a bus in Lima in 1995, hours before they raided a four-story house she had rented, where they found 8,000 rounds of ammunition, 3,000 sticks of dynamite and more than a dozen members of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, or M.R.T.A.She still insists that she did not know about the M.R.T.A.’s plans of violence. But a military tribunal sentenced her to life in prison for treason. The authorities sent her to a dank cell in Yanamayo, a prison high in the Andes. Her sentence was reduced to 20 years at a new trial in 2001, at which she was found guilty of renting the house that was used in a failed plot to take the entire Peruvian Congress hostage.Behind prison walls, life went on. In 2003, she married Aníbal Apari, an M.R.T.A. militant whom she met while both were incarcerated. She was allowed conjugal visits with Mr. Apari, now released and acting as her lawyer, even though they are now divorcing. She gave birth in 2009 to their son, Salvador, a citizen of Peru and the United States who has spent most of his life in prison with his mother.Several things make Ms. Berenson stand out from other Americans one might encounter in this city’s Miraflores District. One is her fluency in Spanish, which she speaks with a distinct Peruvian accent. Another is her hands, weathered and chapped from exposure to the elements in the prisons where she was held.But many Peruvians say they still wonder whether she is truly sorry for her actions, or just doing her best to stay out of jail.“I certainly am saddened, and I’m sorry that I have been part of something that was considered so damaging,” she said, bouncing her son on her knee as she acknowledged her ties to M.R.T.A., now a thoroughly marginalized group. “My participation has been collaborating. You know, I rented a house. I shared ideological things,” she continued, claiming she never had plans to participate in violence.STILL, much of Peru views her as a symbol of the turmoil that afflicted the country in the 1980s and 1990s, when almost 70,000 people were killed in that period of war and rebellion. A Maoist group, the Shining Path, was responsible for more than half of the deaths. Networks here still broadcast again and again a 1996 appearance by Ms. Berenson that is seared into the country’s memory. Fists clenched, she shouted, “There are no criminal terrorists in the M.R.T.A. It’s a revolutionary movement!”“My logic was not right, and the way I said it was even worse,” she now says of that youthful outburst. “It was a big mistake.”A few voices here urge Peru to move on and accept those words from a woman reflecting on the mistakes of her past. These opinions are often drowned out, though they include the country’s president, who has expressed his view while allowing judges to handle her case.“All this fear over a little woman who already spent 15 years in jail?” President Alan García said in a recent interview. “It is a right to make a mistake in life, and it is a right to be punished and released when that punishment is finished.”It is still not clear when Ms. Berenson’s punishment will end. Mr. Galindo, the antiterrorism prosecutor, is again appealing her parole. A tribunal expects to rule soon, potentially returning her to prison for the remainder of her sentence, until 2015. Reflecting on the challenges that await her, she said she often remembers a book she read in prison, “The Pig’s Deed,” a novel by the Argentine writer Marcos Aguinis. It is about the Spanish Inquisition as it unfolded in colonial Peru, focusing on the persecution of a doctor who acknowledged his Jewish origins.“It’s very vivid in the way things continue in society,” said Ms. Berenson, reflecting on the fate of outcasts then and now. “I think the difference is, people who were accused of terrorism weren’t burned at the stake. I wonder if we had been, maybe we would be less interesting. I think for some reason it’s useful that people still be considered dangerous.”'"
"'10-11-27,'0','RESPONSIBILITY FACTOR Many pet lovers scoff at talk about expenses. Dan Denbow, co-manager of USAA’s precious metals and minerals fund, said he had purposely never added up all the expenses from his four dogs, two cats, hermit crab and aquarium.“No, I’d be afraid to,” said Mr. Denbow, who lives in a rural town north of San Antonio. “It’s a lot of money, but it’s just something we’ve ended up doing.”But the expenses have added up. One spaniel charged a porcupine five times — with a cost to remove the quills at $250 per poke. Another dog had buckshot removed from its hindquarters. Only the hermit crab has been cheap: food, water and an occasional cage cleaning.Mr. Denbow said he was fortunate to have a good job to cover the costs, but added. “I realize some people have to make that decision — can I spend $300 to have this fixed?”City pets can be a more expensive proposition.Andrew and Julie Sacks of New York estimated that they spent $15,000 a year on Skye, their black Labrador. Skye has a dog walker to take care of him when they are at work. And he goes to camp in Pennsylvania when they go away.“It’s all about the right team,” Mrs. Sacks said. “We’ve been so lucky to have them.”Some people may find this excessive, but what else are they going to do with him? He needs to be walked during the day and he needs to be boarded when they go away. Kennels are not cheap, with board costing a minimum of $50 a night.But they are not complaining. Mr. Sacks, who runs Agency Sacks, a consultant that works with the affluent, said Skye’s brother Moose recently had a sock removed from his stomach at a cost of about $6,000.HORSE SENSE Of course, people who have horses will say that dogs and cats are cheap in comparison. And this is where otherwise intelligent people can make expensive mistakes.A thoroughbred racehorse can be purchased for as little as $1,000 at Keeneland, the premier horse auction in America. But Chauncey Morris, its sales marketing associate, cautions against thinking a less expensive horse will be less expensive in the long run. Just because the price tag is far below the $4.2 million paid by Benjamin Leon Jr., a Miami health care executive, at Keeneland’s yearling auction in September, does not mean that the maintenance costs are far less, too.“To keep a horse in training in the U.S., it will average $40,000 a year,” Mr. Morris said. “It’s the same for the $1,000 horse or the $4.2 million horse.”Not everyone who buys horses trains them to race. But the fixed cost is still high. Andrea Redmond, a consultant in Chicago and a lifelong horsewoman, owns the Bull Run Equestrian Center in Elburn, Ill., where she said she cautioned newcomers to ease into the sport. She said boarding alone was $750 a month, but could stretch into thousands of dollars at other barns.That fee does not include the farrier who shoes the horses — about $200 every four to six weeks — or the veterinarian bills. There are also the costs of the saddle, bridle, blankets, boots and brushes to get started.“I had three horses die in the past 12 months,” Ms. Redmond said. “One was old. The others were fluke accidents.”She said she had recently reduced the mortality insurance — such insurance is common for high-value animals or those with earning potential, like race horses and breeding animals — for a 12-year-old horse that died, but she was glad she had not dropped it entirely. “I learned the hard way to insure them,” she said.The costs of insuring horses depends on what they do. Holly Griffin, executive director of the equine department at the insurance broker Hub International and a former show jumper, said the least expensive was a dressage horse with an annual premium of 3 percent of the purchase price. The most expensive are steeplechase horses at 9 percent.Ms. Griffin estimated total fees for a horse at about $2,200 a month. “When you’re not around, that’s more for someone to exercise the horse,” she said.Health insurance exists for dogs and cats as well. But the Sackses said they dropped their pet health insurance because getting reimbursed for claims was time-consuming and frustrating.CHEAPER OPTIONS What can you do if your children are clamoring for a pet this year? Saying no is an option, but it rarely works.With a dog outside of a city — meaning no dog walker — the fixed costs can be fairly low, but a family needs to have a cushion for those times when the medical care costs increase.As my wife and I know, pet owners have few choices when their pets are sick. I remember a woman at Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston whose job it was to make sure we could pay before they began caring for our cat ($2,600 for liver problems) and later a dog ($1,250 for relief from a sausage that irritated his intestines). On this woman’s desk were brochures for payment plans, the same type people use for funerals or cosmetic dental work. But these plans only spread out the bill — with interest.Horses are different. With continuing costs of $9,000 to $40,000 a year, they should be for the rich only. Still, lots of children from more modest families want to ride, too.Lessons on a school horse are the cheapest at about $50 to $100 for 45 minutes. Beyond this, people have traditionally leased horses, by covering the boarding and insurance costs for the person who owns it. Ms. Redmond said that horse shares had recently become popular. In this sense, families are taking a half or quarter of a horse’s riding time in return for covering that amount in expenses.The biggest problem is when people cannot afford their animals. Lori Muhlenberg, a senior vice president at National Penn Investors Trust Company, takes care of 23 retired racehorses.Her family has owned 60 acres of pasture in Pennsylvania for decades, which she does not count in calculating expenses, and her horses spend their days grazing outside unless it is too cold. Still, she estimates that each one costs $5 a day to feed and an additional $6 a day for the four months when they need to be inside — or about $58,000 if nothing goes wrong.But the responsibility of caring for them cannot be simply calculated as an out-of-pocket expense. “You have to have the compassion and the commitment,” Ms. Muhlenberg said. “It’s not just the funds. You have to worry about them.”'"
"'10-11-27,'0','“We could end up with a problem, because in the markets expectations can become self-fulfilling prophecies,” José Luis Malo de Molina, chief economist at the Bank of Spain, said Thursday. He also urged the government to stick to its spending cuts because “the evolution of public finances will be the crucial touchstone to maintain confidence.”Like other officials, Mr. Malo de Molina insisted that Spain’s problems could not be compared to Ireland’s. “The Bank of Spain is convinced that additional transparency efforts will help reduce the doubts and unfounded suspicions that spread in moments of market nervousness,” he said.The Spanish prime minister, , went a step further, telling a radio station that Spain would “absolutely” not seek outside help and predicting that “those who are taking short positions against Spain are going to be mistaken.”Amid reports Friday that the was again buying Portuguese and Irish , the price of Portugal’s 10-year bonds rebounded slightly, pushing yields down nine-hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.69 percent. That was almost two and a half times the yield on German bonds, the euro zone benchmark.The yield on 10-year Irish bonds climbed 0.11 percentage point, to 8.88 percent. And the cost of protecting debt sold by Irish banks set new highs after The Irish Times reported that the European Union-I.M.F. mission to was examining ways in which senior bondholders could be compelled to pay some of the cost of rescuing Ireland’s banks. Those banks were downgraded Friday by the ratings firm.The spread, or differential, between the yields on Spanish 10-year government bonds and German bonds set a euro-era record Friday, widening to 2.64 percentage points.It fell back to 2.43 percentage points on an announcement that Spain would sell less debt than initially planned before the end of the year as its financing needs were already covered.The euro, which traded above $1.40 as recently as Nov. 5, had fallen Friday to $1.3237, down 3.2 percent for the week.Meanwhile, European officials joined their Portuguese counterparts in rejecting reports that Portugal was being pressed by European partners to accept a bailout to help calm markets.“This is not the position of the ministry,” said Bertrand , spokesman for the German finance ministry., president of the and a former prime minister of Portugal, told reporters at a conference in that “any reference to an aid plan” for Portugal was “absolutely false.” He added, “It’s being neither demanded nor has it been suggested by us.”After the vote Friday in Portugal, the prime minister, José Sócrates, said the country had “no alternative at all” to the belt-tightening policy. “We must make this effort,” Mr. Sócrates was quoted as saying by The Associated Press.Under pressure from investors, Mr. Sócrates presented an additional package of austerity measures in September that was initially rejected by the Social Democrat opposition because it contained increases. Mr. Sócrates is in his second term in office but without a parliamentary majority.Portugal’s two biggest parties eventually brokered a deal to avert a government collapse, which cleared the way for the vote Friday, in which Social Democrat lawmakers abstained. But that has failed to dispel concerns about the government’s ability to control spending. Rather than falling, Portugal’s deficit widened 2.3 percent, to 9.32 billion euros, in the first nine months of this year.Portuguese unions on Wednesday coordinated the country’s first general strike in more than two decades to protest the austerity program.The concerns have spilled over into Spain, pushing up its borrowing costs even though the latest data suggests will meet its target of cutting its deficit this year to 9.3 percent of G.D.P., from 11.1 percent in 2009.An austerity package adopted last May has helped cut Spain’s central government deficit 47 percent in the first 10 months of this year.To ensure similar belt-tightening and more transparency by Spain’s regional and local authorities, Spain’s finance minister, Elena Salgado, announced on Wednesday that Spain’s 17 regional governments would be required to update their budget figures quarterly.But political tensions are mounting in Spain. Mr. Zapatero, who is also in his second term but without a parliamentary majority, this week urged the center-right opposition Popular Party to show patriotism and avoid heightening the concerns of investors.Instead, the Popular Party warned the government not to publish any misleading data, and its secretary general, Dolores de Cospedal, insisted that “the problem of Spain is lack of trust in the government.”“Things would be easier for Spain if the two big parties could demonstrate real consensus on how to get out of this difficult situation,” said Alvaro Blasco, executive director of Atlas Capital, an advisory firm in Madrid.'"

The CAC 40 in France was 31.77 points, or 0.84 percent, lower at 3,728.65.On Wednesday, the major indexes on Wall Street rallied more than 1 percent after several reports suggested improvement in the economy, including in the job market and consumer spending.That was despite lingering concerns over debt problems in the euro zone, especially in Ireland, as well as worries over tensions between North and South Korea.The Irish government capitulated to bond market pressures by requesting rescue money on Sunday, and investors have been concerned that similar troubles could spread to other countries that use the euro.On Friday, some of the concern shifted to Portugal, where lawmakers approved a budget plan for 2011 aimed at reassuring nervous lenders that the country could avoid a bailout by meeting its deficit-cutting targets.But Portuguese and other European officials rejected reports that Portugal was being pressed by its partners to accept a bailout. “This is not the position of the ministry,” a spokesman for the German finance ministry, Bertrand Benoit, said.Adrian Cronje, the chief investment officer of Balentine, said that investors were unsettled by the “piecemeal” approach to each country’s financial troubles and that there needed to be a solution for the euro zone as an entire system. “Until that happens, you are going to find a lot of uncertainty in global markets,” he said.Concerns about finances have pushed up borrowing costs in Portugal and Spain as well as Ireland in recent days.The dollar rose against the euro, ending at $1.3237.Global equity markets lost ground as concerns about Europe and Asia persisted and despite the likely announcement of a rescue package for Ireland, currency strategists from Brown Brothers Harriman said in a research note.

"'10-11-28,'0','Edgewater is the city’s second-densest neighborhood in population, according to United States census data. Chris Swan, a chief executive of an executive recruitment firm and vice president of West Edgewater Area Residents, or W.E.A.R., said he worried about the lack of momentum on the park proposal.“What scares me,” Mr. Swan said, “is that the city is going to get tired of looking at this thing and tear it down, and then just give the developers the permits to build whatever they want. And who’s going to benefit from this? Not the community, that’s for sure.”Both Mr. Donovan and Mr. Swan are critical of Alderman Patrick O’Connor (40th Ward) for what they say is his inaction on the issue. Mr. O’Connor said he had no objection to a park, but did not know who was going to pay for it. The city would have to buy the property, and according to a private estimate filed to the city by Appraisal Associates, the land under the medical center is worth $5.3 million, not including the demolition costs.Mr. O’Connor, who is running for re-election in 2011, and members of W.E.A.R. have asked Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, and State Senator Heather Steans, a Chicago Democrat, to look for money in their budgets that could be used for the park. Representatives for both politicians have indicated interest, but no concrete commitments have been made.Mr. Donovan and Mr. Swan said they believed the necessary money was available in the Edgewater/Ashland Tax Increment Financing District fund, which is projected at $3.9 million. “I live in one of the houses that pays into the TIF,” Mr. Donovan said. “It was on my tax bill recently.""According to the 2009 spending report, the TIF district spends about $4,000 annually, generally on small budget items like development reports and surveys.At a meeting with Edgewater community groups in October, Mr. O’Connor was asked about spending TIF money for a park. According to Mr. Donovan, Mr. O’Connor said that $400,000 had been spent from the fund, but that he did not indicate what it went for. Mr. Donovan said he wrote to the alderman’s office asking for a record of that spending, but got no response.When asked last week about those expenditures, Mr. O’Connor said: “That might be the total amount of funding we’ve expended on local improvements, things like sidewalks and lighting.”He added that TIF money must be earmarked for future use — otherwise it expires — and that might explain the fate of some of the money.“We’re trying to get some people to understand this is not a situation where you can say, O.K., here’s the check,” Mr. O’Connor said.That is partly because there is no single owner. The Edgewater Medical Center is owned by the Edgewater Medical Center Bankruptcy Estate, which is made up of more than 250 creditors — individuals as well as business entities, including the French-Belgian bank Dexia. According to Scott Mendeloff, a lawyer at the Howrey firm who represents the bankruptcy estate, creditors are owed in excess of $110 million.Even if its ownership were clear, Mr. O’Connor said, there is still the issue of cash.“We’ve got maybe $3 million,” he said. “That’s a long way from $20 to $30 you’d need” to make this park a reality.Mr. O’Connor emphasized that he did not oppose a park in theory. “It’s not at all a dead issue,” he said. “I mean, who doesn’t want a park? It’s silly that there are people in the neighborhood who think we want to build something else other than a park. The real question is, can we afford it?”A park may not be feasible, Mr. O’Connor said, especially if tax-producing development on the site is taken off the table.“The amount in the TIF fund is based on assumptions that the hospital site would be developed and generate income,” he said. “Building a park, you’re not going to generate income.”That could affect the amount of money available for future TIF projects, he added.Mr. Swan said that was not true. “That money is coming from the houses that are already there,” he said. A park would “exponentially” increase surrounding property values, generate greater tax revenue and benefit the TIF district.Mr. Donovan said he would like to see the new park built as a public-private partnership, in the mold of Millennium Park.The W.E.A.R. board is expected to meet Tuesday. The park issue is likely to come up, Mr. Donovan said, but no one expects a quick resolution. District voters will have their say about the park via a nonbinding initiative on the February 2011 ballot.More immediately, Mr. Donovan said, “I’d like to see the alderman answer our letter about the TIF funds that have been spent in our district. I’d like him to agree to allocate this TIF toward the purchase and demolition of the facility, to lay the groundwork for a park or green space.”Mr. O’Connor counseled patience — and pragmatism. “Some of the folks involved are basically saying, ‘I want a park and I don’t care how it happens,’ ” he said.Mr. Swan said he was willing to wait for the outcome he wanted.“We’ve been living with this thing for nine years,” he said. “Personally, I’d rather have the empty building than a big development. We need to reclaim this property for the community benefit.”'"
"'10-11-28,'0','Mr. Issa has already drawn up a list of big targets: $40 billion a year in fraud or waste in Medicare; tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to the government-controlled mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; $8.5 billion in losses by the Postal Service in the last fiscal year; tens of millions of dollars spent on redundant programs within federal agencies or squandered through corrupt contracting procedures.Mr. Boehner and Mr. Issa are also counting on other Congressional committees to step up their oversight efforts. The Ways and Means Committee, for instance, along with the Energy and Commerce Committee, will pick apart aspects of the new health care law. The Financial Services Committee will scrutinize the administration’s efforts to tighten regulation of Wall Street.For Mr. Issa’s committee, which can delve into any corner of the government, the more policy-driven crusade is purposely devised to steer clear of the reputation for hectoring and henpecking that Congressional Republicans earned during the Clinton administration when they issued more than 1,000 subpoenas and repeatedly tied White House lawyers into knots, ultimately impeaching the president.To that end, Mr. Issa has sought to play down the unfettered power to compel testimony and force the production of documents through subpoenas that he will gain with his new post in January. Instead, he has put greater emphasis in recent weeks on pursuing legislation to grant subpoena power to the inspectors general in dozens of federal agencies, internal watchdogs who he believes are even better-positioned to hunt for waste.The current oversight committee chairman, Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, and Mr. Issa jointly supported a bill authorizing subpoena powers for inspectors general, but Democratic leaders did not make it a priority.The focus on spending may create less tension than more politically focused inquiries, like investigating what inducements White House officials might have offered Democratic primary challengers to step aside in favor of the Democratic Party’s preferred candidates.But there is still likely to be a blizzard of investigations compared with the last two years, during which Mr. Issa repeatedly accused Congressional Democrats of giving the Obama administration a free pass.And Mr. Issa (pronounced EYE-suh) is already cultivating one of the highest profiles in the new Republican majority.He is the richest man in the House, having made a fortune by making and selling car alarms, including the Viper, which features his own commanding voice declaring, “Please step away from the car.” And he is now clearly intent on making a name for himself sounding alarms of a different sort about the Obama administration.On Rush Limbaugh’s radio show before the midterms, he called Mr. Obama “one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times,” only to apologize later and say he did not mean to call Mr. Obama personally corrupt.He has also threatened to investigate the so-called policy czars, including Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard law professor who was chosen to create the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Mr. Issa has declined interview requests in recent weeks. Aides said he was waiting for his formal appointment as chairman, which is expected this week. But Mr. Issa has made no secret of his plans, which he has described in public remarks before and after the election and in a 17-page blueprint for greater oversight that he issued in September.He has said he wants his panel’s seven subcommittees each to hold two hearings a week for 40 weeks beginning at the start of the new Congress in January.In response, Earl E. Devaney, the chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which oversees government stimulus spending, quipped to fellow inspectors general: “Guess where some of us are going to be hanging out this year?”But even before he sets after the executive branch, Mr. Issa is fighting a more immediate battle, preventing cuts to his own committee by Republican leaders. “That’s a case I have to make,” Mr. Issa said in a speech to investigators, auditors and prosecutors at a conference on fraud prevention in Philadelphia this month. “I have already made it to Leader Boehner and Eric Cantor,” he said, “that oversight on my committee cannot be cut just to make some symbolic statement, that I am going to need the resources.”Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor, who will be the Republican majority leader, have made it clear that that they intend to lead by example, potentially cutting back in the House itself.The oversight committee now has about 80 staff members for the majority and 40 for the minority. Aides to Mr. Issa said it was not yet clear if those numbers would hold steady.In recent months, in his role as the senior Republican on the oversight committee, Mr. Issa has courted the inspectors general, raising serious questions, for instance, about the administration’s dismissals of the inspectors general for Amtrak and for the Corporation for National and Community Service.In the speech in Philadelphia, Mr. Issa urged the inspectors general to work with him.“It is important that we consider that we are as close to a team as we have ever been starting in January,” he said.The federal deficit cannot be closed simply by rooting out waste and fraud, and Mr. Issa readily acknowledges that many examples he cites will save what amounts to relative pennies in a $3.5 trillion budget.But his fierce commitment to do his part is the sort of rallying cry for smaller government that lifted Republicans to victory.For his committee to succeed, he said, “We are going to need sources of waste that go beyond just corruption, sources of waste that go into the question of why do we have, even within one cabinet position, seven or eight different groups doing the same thing.”In a brief conversation with reporters just off the House floor the other day, Mr. Issa expressed little interest in pursuing questions about the scientific basis for some Environmental Protection Agency rules, suggesting that there were not sufficient taxpayer savings to be found.“I’ll have limited resources and limited time,” he said. “I am looking for the largest dollars of waste.”'"
"'10-11-28,'0','If you did not spend last weekend tuned in to news from the NATO summit meeting in Lisbon, you probably missed the breakthrough on European missile defense.NATO leaders agreed to jointly develop a shield intended to intercept short- and medium-range missiles. And Russia agreed to cooperate, sharing intelligence and radar. Iran was not mentioned as the most immediate threat, but there was no doubt in anyone’s mind. Iran’s Shahab-3 can already reach European targets, mercifully not yet with nuclear warheads. Tehran needs to know that the world is running out of patience.Republican senators who are now resisting ratifying the New Start arms treaty should certainly have been paying more attention to the Lisbon meeting. They have been so busy claiming, inaccurately, that the treaty would constrain future missile defense systems that they apparently failed to notice real progress toward the only effective system that current technology permits.Unlike the troubled missile defense program here, the European shield can be built at a modest cost with already-tested systems. Claims that President Obama is shortchanging America’s nuclear arsenal are also off-base. The administration backs spending more than $85 billion on maintaining and modernizing nuclear weapons over the next decade, far more than we think is needed.The Republican leadership also apparently missed the parade of East European leaders — so recently darlings of the G.O.P. — declaring that prompt ratification would make Europe more secure. As Hungary’s foreign minister, Janos Martonyi put it, ratification “is in the interest of my nation, of Europe, and most importantly,” of the trans-Atlantic alliance. He is right. The treaty would modestly reduce deployed American and Russian strategic warheads and restore on-site verification. (Whatever happened to “Trust, but verify”?) Failure to ratify would undermine American credibility as it tries to curb the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea.It is probably too much to ask the Republicans to congratulate President Obama on moving European missile defense forward. But their indifference to all that happened in Lisbon is further proof that their opposition to New Start is nothing more than petty obstructionism.'"
"'10-11-28,'0','The chief reason this advance took so long, said Dr. Robert M. Grant, a virologist at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco and the study’s chief author, is that the two drugs in Truvada, tenofovir and emtricitabine, were not approved for use in humans until 2001 and 2002, respectively. Older drugs, like AZT, the first AIDS drug, adopted in 1987, were too toxic.Doctors once debated using nevirapine, approved in 1996. In poor countries, single doses for mother and baby are given at birth to prevent mother-child transmission. But taking nevirapine for even a few weeks can bring on brutal side effects. Over 10 percent of users get rashes. In rare cases, the drug can kill if not stopped in time.Giving powerful drugs to healthy people is different from giving them to the desperately ill. No doctor would give cancer drugs to a healthy person. Prophylaxis is common with, for example, malaria drugs for travelers making brief sojourns in the tropics. But a drug to be taken all one’s life — or at least for all of one’s sex life — must be very safe.Also, the drug must not prompt drug-resistance mutations in the virus. Tenofovir is unique that way, said Dr. Howard S. Jaffe, president of the Gilead Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Gilead Sciences, which makes Truvada. Structurally, it is so nearly identical to the bit of DNA it blocks that “the virus can’t easily outsmart it,” he said. Resistance to nevirapine, by contrast, can develop after a single dose.Another factor is that not every drug company wants to see its best treatment drugs, on which it earns billions of dollars, tested for prevention. Dying patients accept unpleasant side effects; healthy ones might sue. And any patient who gets infected, even if taking the drug improperly, could sue. Gilead Sciences was willing to let Truvada be tested, although it has not yet decided, Dr. Jaffe said, whether to apply for F.D.A. permission to sell it as prophylaxis.Also, several AIDS experts said, lab scientists were focused for years on the dream of an AIDS vaccine, while behaviorists assumed everyone would adopt condoms or abstinence. None of those hopes has been realized.The final delay was caused by political battling. Plans to test Truvada began in 2003, and sites were chosen not just in American cities with gay populations like San Francisco and Boston, but in countries where the virus was also killing prostitutes and clients: Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana and Cambodia.Then, at the 2004 International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, the Paris chapter of the AIDS activist group Act-Up unexpectedly attacked Gilead Sciences’ booth, spraying it with fake blood and accusing the company of experimenting on poor people.As Dr. Jaffe tells it, French activists “played the anti-U.S. card in Francophone countries” and stirred up sex workers’ unions in Cambodia, eventually leading the Cameroonian and Cambodian governments to stop their trials. Nigeria’s stopped for other reasons, though many Nigerians were hostile to drug companies because of rumors that polio vaccine was an anti-Muslim plot and because Pfizer had tested a new antibiotic on children with meningitis. “If not for this misplaced activism, we might have had an answer five years earlier,” Dr. Jaffe said.Dr. Grant saw the same struggle differently. The activists were disruptive, he said, but also “raised significant questions” about whether participants would be protected from side effects and about who, if anyone, would pay for lifelong treatment if participants did eventually get AIDS. One result, he said, was that protocols were improved and more countries added: South Africa, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Thailand.But more important, he said, was the emergence of the two agencies that now pay for treatment in poor countries, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It took until about 2005 for most poor countries to take advantage of that aid.Enrollment finally began in 2007. While monkey trials are quick and vicious — give the drug, zap the caged animals with virus, wait a bit, and dissect a few — ethical human trials are complex. At a cost of $44 million, this one screened nearly 5,000 people to find 2,500 participants to follow for up to three years.Any approval process takes time and hits unexpected roadblocks, Dr. Grant said. “But,” he insisted, “we started working on prep the minute the right drugs became available.”'"
"'10-11-28,'0','One nasty person can bring down a whole group. That can happen because the group members devote more energy to dealing with the bad apple and less energy to the task at hand. Moreover, anger and hostility are contagious, so the whole group can become infected.When I asked Ruth how she kept her sanity amid the meanness at the company, she told me about some advice she had received as a teenager from a river rafting guide: If you fall out of the boat, don’t fight the rapids. Just rely on your life vest and float with your feet out in front of you. That way, if you are thrown up against the rocks, you can use your feet to push off, and you’ll protect your head and conserve energy.The very day she got that advice, Ruth fell overboard while traversing rapids in the “Satan’s Cesspool” section of the American River in California. After a wild trip with her feet stretched out in front of her, Ruth wasn’t hurt and felt exhilarated.Ruth explained that she used the Satan’s Cesspool strategy to survive those nasty meetings some 30 years later. Verbal barbs bounced off of her, just as the rocks had bounced off her feet long ago. When the personal attacks, dirty looks and finger-pointing commenced, she stretched out her feet in front of her under the table, and told herself, “I just got thrown out of the boat by these jerks, but I know how to survive.”Instead of seeing herself as a victim, Ruth felt strong and in control. She shared her strategy with fellow victims in the office, and it helped them endure the slings and arrows as well.Ruth’s strategy was effective because it enabled her to reframe the nastiness so she could become emotionally detached — to “prevent the poison from touching my soul,” as she put it.In a healthy workplace, being emotionally engaged is great, but when you can’t escape a disrespectful environment, practicing the fine art of indifference and detachment can help you endure the onslaught.Detachment can also help you to quell the temptation to respond in kind — and thus avoid fueling a vicious circle of hostility.The Satan’s Cesspool strategy also helped Ruth to avoid wasting her emotional energy by battling against forces she couldn’t control. She reserved her energy for times when it could do some good, like helping others survive the onslaught and fighting small battles she could win against the worst of the local bullies.Although reframing the situation and winning small battles can be helpful, they are, at best, short-term strategies that dampen rather than eliminate the damage. If you work in a nasty workplace, the best thing you can do is to escape. And that is exactly what Ruth eventually did; she moved to a far more civilized workplace about a year later.To prevent employees from leaving, as Ruth did, bosses and their organizations may find that it’s more important to eliminate the negative than to accentuate the positive. Research suggests that if you lead a group where nastiness is pervasive, you should start by reforming the bad influences and, if necessary, expelling them.If a workplace is mired in meanness, the chances are pretty high that the boss deserves part of the blame but doesn’t realize it. People who wield power often have no idea what it feels like to work with them, and how their weaknesses are damaging morale and performance. So to bosses I say: take a long look in the mirror if you lead a jerk-infested group.'"
"'10-11-28,'0','“We have a beautiful face in tough times and during difficult moments, but in normal times, we are lost,” said Jan Oldakowski, an opposition member of the Parliament who was one of several members of the opposition Law and Justice Party to recently quit the party to form a more centrist coalition. “With freedom, Poles do not know how to cooperate with each other.”The political leadership is at war with itself. Personal attacks and insults are flying. Politicians have traded accusations of drug abuse, mental illness, collaborating with the Nazis and being agents of Moscow. They have said of one another that they would be better off dead. The former prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who lost a bid to become president after his twin brother died in the crash, has refused to shake hands with Mr. Tusk, refused to attend the main memorial service for the crash this year and has turned against some of his closest allies, prompting them to quit the Law and Justice Party, which the Kaczynski brothers founded in 2001.“Poles always feel they need to have an enemy,” Urszula Slawinska, 38, said one day as she walked along a sidewalk in Warsaw, an average citizen, headed home, uninvolved in politics, yet keenly aware of what was happening around her. “Because of our history we define ourselves, to be Polish meant to protect our country. So now that we don’t have to protect ourselves, we still need to find an enemy.”Inevitably, in this conservative, majority Catholic country, the church also finds itself caught up in the internecine fighting. Its leadership is split, with some outspoken clerics backing the political opposition while others are trying to move the institution away from partisan politics. There is a strong anticlerical movement, and there is growing concern within the religious community that Poland will itself become a more secular society like much of Europe.“I am very pessimistic,” said the Rev. Maciej Zieba, a popular priest here. “It is a providential moment for Poland. The political life is awful. For me as a Catholic priest, it is not good, either.”The fighting has had little impact on Poland’s still strong economy, with predictions of 4 percent growth next year. But some economists are warning that unless serious issues are addressed, Poland is headed for trouble. Economists said that once development money from the European Union slowed in 2012, the country would hit its constitutional debt limit. That will require cutting spending, raising taxes or raiding the retirement system. They also warn that Poland could face a power shortage in a few years that could cause blackouts.“In two or three years, we could face a disaster, truly a disaster,” said an economist, Krzystof Rybinski, who said that the political infighting had diverted the public debate from issues to vitriol. “Our society does not understand the challenges it faces. The driving force now is politics and public relations.”He said that there were structural issues that needed to be addressed, like a bureaucracy that discouraged entrepreneurship and that had ballooned in five years by 100,000 employees to a total of 430,000, about 1 percent of the population.The combination of success and fear has created dissonance in Poland. People understand how far they have come in just two decades, but also feel that they are stuck in the mud of politics, unable to address looming problems in social welfare spending and government finance.“We are talking about reform, but we are not doing anything,” said Lukasz Turski, a physicist at Cardinal Wyszynski University. “All reforms ended in the 1990s.”The crowds outside the Presidential Palace gathered in the early hours after the plane crash in April. At first, the nation was unified in shock and grief. But soon after the tragedy exposed deep divisions in society, accentuating the gulf that exists between the political classes, different sections of society (especially between big cities and smaller towns and villages), and the distance between almost everyone and the clergy.A clash that developed over whether to keep the cross in front of the palace was not just a clash over religious values and symbols. “The people at the Presidential Palace were not fighting for the cross or the church,” said Janusz Palikot, a member of Parliament who started his own political party. “There are two visions of Poland struggling to co-exist.”A large cross placed outside the palace became a political statement, a show of support for a vision of a more conservative, more religious, more nationalistic Poland, a Poland run by the Kaczynski brothers, many political scientists, religious leaders and demonstrators said.The other vision for Poland, championed by the governing party of Mr. Tusk and President Komorowski, was more focused on Europe, on adopting the euro, on ending Poland’s military presence in Afghanistan and on a state in which religion would be more personal and less institutional. The church leadership adopted an official position of remaining silent on the issue, which only angered both sides. “The church was not guilty. It was a conflict between the two parties,” said Father Zieba. “But the winners are the politicians. Who was the loser? The church.”In the early morning hours one day in September, a presidential aide slipped out of the palace and removed the cross. For a few days that seemed to be the end of it, and then the demonstrators were back, enraged. The demonstrators now say they see the removal of the cross as part of a conspiracy to cover up the real causes of the plane crash, which occurred while the officials were arriving in Smolensk, Russia, for an event honoring the 22,000 Polish officers murdered at Katyn Forest by the Soviets in 1940. The demonstrators think the Russians were behind the crash, and perhaps their own government as well.“I feel slapped in the face that the president does not find out about what really happened at the Smolensk tragedy,” shouted Andrzej Hadacz, 49, as he slapped his hands together.So the protesters continue to assemble, and political experts say the government continues to avoid making tough decisions in an effort to preserve its popularity in the fractured political environment, political scientists said.The former polish president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, who served for 10 years, said the best way to describe Poland today was with a short story: “A group of children say to a rabbi, ‘Please tell us in a few words what the situation is,’ ” and the rabbi answers, ‘Good.’“The children say, ‘Perhaps you can use a few more words, and the rabbi responds, ‘Not good.’ ”The former president laughed, but then said that the story was not funny.'"
"'10-11-28,'0','On his way into the talks, Olli Rehn, European commissioner for economic affairs, said, ""We have to discuss the broader ramifications of the current crisis and we have to discuss a systemic response to this crisis.""That will likely mean discussions on the economic positions of Portugal and Spain and on the shape of a new permanent mechanism to replace the 440 billion euro fund set up earlier this year to help eurozone countries. Fears that the private sector will be expected to absorb losses in any eurozone debt crisis after 2013, when the fund's mandate expires, has unsettled financial markets.Officials from Ireland, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund were still discussing on Saturday the interest rates to be applied to loans, and the role of the private sector in the rescue of Irish banks, which are straining under huge debt obligations.Suggestions that the bank restructuring could involve senior bondholders surfaced on Friday when The Irish Times reported that options being discussed included debt being converted into equity, or bond investors being given the choice of injecting fresh capital into the newly restructured banks or taking a loss.But European officials are cautious about such an approach because of the jittery markets and the risk that a negative reaction on Monday could push Portugal or Spain further into trouble.Ireland’s debt crisis was touched off in part by Germany’s insistence that the private sector should be involved in a future crisis resolution mechanism.In Ireland, imposing “haircuts” on bank investors might be politically popular in the short term, but it carries the risk of worrying lenders in the future, once the Irish government goes back to the market.The Irish broadcaster RTE has reported that the interest on loans from the European Union and I.M.F. could reach as high as 6.7 percent, but officials played that down on Saturday.Though that rate could be for long-term loans, spread over nine years, it would apply to the bank restructuring, not the three-year package to shore up the Irish government finances.The average rate is expected to be less than 6 percent, though slightly more than the 5.2 percent charged to Greece, which received aid from the European Union and I.M.F. earlier this year.The package is certain to be complex because aid is expected to come from four sources — two separate European Union funds, the I.M.F. and most likely bilateral loans from Britain and Sweden.'"
"'10-11-28,'0','“It is a democracy to speak freely, and the media speak freely, and political blocs speak freely,” he said. “And maybe we have a democracy that exceeded limits.”On American troop levels, Mr. Maliki is facing pressure from the followers of the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who played a critical role in supporting Mr. Maliki for a second term after last March’s indecisive elections.The Sadrists have promised to fight any attempt to maintain an American military presence in Iraq. Some American and Iraqi officials have argued that a residual force is necessary to continue training Iraqi soldiers and help maintain military equipment, but on Saturday, Mr. Maliki said the Iraqis could stand alone.Iraqi officials announced Saturday that they had arrested 12 people over the last week who orchestrated a bloody siege against a Christian church here last month. They called the arrests evidence of improvements in the country’s security forces.Interior Ministry officials said the insurgents had ties to Al Qaeda in Iraq, and had also planned to blow up the main gates of the International Zone, where the United States Embassy is located. Officials said they had seized 6 suicide belts, 10 improvised explosive devices and 5 tons of bomb-making material as a result of the arrests.At his news conference, Mr. Maliki, a religious Shiite, said he wanted the new government to include his main rival, Ayad Allawi, a secular Shiite and former Iraqi prime minister. But he indicated he would move forward even if Mr. Allawi was not on board.“If we reach the critical area and we have to announce the government, we will go on with who is beside us, who wants to be a partner,” Mr. Maliki said.Mr. Allawi’s Iraqiya coalition won support among Iraq’s Sunni minority and finished narrowly ahead of Mr. Maliki’s slate in the elections, but failed to build enough support to cobble together a majority in Parliament.Mr. Allawi has sharply criticized the power-sharing deal, and members of Iraqiya said they would continue to look to Mr. Allawi on whether to remain a part of the coalition.“He will decide if Iraqiya will be part of the government or not,” said Khadum Atya, a lawmaker from the bloc. “So if he will not join, we will be in an embarrassing situation, and we will go with what his desire is.”Mr. Allawi has been offered a position leading a new strategic policy council, a consolation prize to bring him into the government and mollify his supporters. But he has not said whether he will accept the post, given uncertainties about whether the council will have actual powers over important security and economic policies, or merely be an advisory panel.“It will be for someone else if he refuses,” Mr. Maliki said.Under Iraq’s Constitution, Mr. Maliki has 30 days to cobble together a government that satisfies most demands of the country’s ethnic, religious and political factions.He said he had sent letters asking the different coalitions for nominations for key government offices. He said he would choose his ministers based on “professionalism, qualification and integrity” and name his new government by Dec. 10 or 15.'"
"'10-11-28,'0','The United States will spend $53 billion this year on secret intelligence efforts, with the C.I.A. getting much of that money. Yet if Jones and other former employees are to be believed, the agency remains dismally unable to deal with terrorism or rogue states. It is a bureaucratic, risk-averse behemoth that rarely holds its managers accountable for failure. Its problems were not solved, and may have been made worse, by the reorganization of the intelligence community after Sept. 11, 2001.Outsiders have lodged similar complaints for years. But the C.I.A. and its defenders typically dismiss such criticism by saying that the agency’s failures are reported, while its successes must remain secret. But these new memoirs cannot be shoved aside so easily. The most intriguing come from the case officers, like Jones, who actually meet foreign agents and collect information for the C.I.A. on a daily basis.In book after book, operatives describe an agency that hires smart, aggressive and patriotic Americans, and then does its best to make sure they fail. Since 2008, two memoirs, Jones’s “Human Factor” and Charles S. Faddis’s “Beyond Repair: The Decline and Fall of the C.I.A.,” have gone so far as to call for the agency to be abolished and replaced.While not the best written of the recent books, Jones’s paints the fullest picture of the agency’s troubles. He claims he served under “nonofficial cover” — that is, overseas and without diplomatic protection — for more than a decade. The agency never publicly discloses how many similar operatives are working, but Jones’s account makes clear that the number is tiny, at most a couple of hundred worldwide. A vast majority of employees work either at the C.I.A.’s headquarters in Langley, Va., or under diplomatic cover in American embassies.Jones regards this breakdown of resources as worse than shameful. Employees under diplomatic cover are generally known to the intelligence services of the countries where they work and can operate only with the tacit approval of their host nations. Only nonofficial operatives can recruit agents in true secrecy. Only nonofficial operatives have a real chance of meeting or infiltrating terrorist groups. But these operatives face much higher risks than those under diplomatic cover, and the C.I.A. fears using them.Instead of taking real risk, the agency fetishizes the rituals of tradecraft, Jones says. In one sad and hilarious passage, he writes of meeting another case officer, who devises a routine familiar to anyone who has ever watched a spy movie. The case officer would carry a magazine folded under her left arm, and Jones was to ask, “Can you tell me the way to the parking lot?” She was to reply, “Are you looking for the hourly parking?”Jones objected. Since the meeting would be in “the benign city” of Philadelphia, he had a different suggestion: he would approach her in the lobby and say, “Hi, Mabel.”Jones describes the C.I.A. as addicted to the process of recruiting foreign agents, while rarely considering the value of their information. Embassy-based station chiefs and headquarters officers demand complex recruiting operations when simple meet-and-greets would do. And the agency’s preferred recruiting method — cash — tends to attract low-level diplomats and retired military officers who peddle dubious tales.In “Blowing My Cover: My Life as a C.I.A. Spy” (2005), Lindsay Moran, who served in Macedonia, writes of meeting a man who claimed he knew the whereabouts of a Balkan war criminal. Halfway through the meeting, Moran knew the man was lying, but she paid him anyway. “Word had spread that the C.I.A. was doling out big bucks for info, and the man had obviously come to cash in. . . . The C.I.A., I’d been discouraged to discover, paid for faulty information all the time.”Moran’s amusing book, which portrays her as a combination of Bridget Jones and James Bond, ends with her resigning to marry the photographer of her dreams. Less amusing is the fact that Moran probably should not have been hired at all. By her own account, even during training, she doubted the morality of recruiting foreign agents, the core of being a case officer. Yet when she told her supervisors at the Farm about her fears and requested a transfer to a back-office position, they refused. Moran finished training but lasted barely two years in the field before quitting. (The hero of “An Ordinary Spy,” a novel by Joseph Weisberg, who worked briefly for the agency in the 1990s, doesn’t even make it through his first tour.)Such cases are common, Charles Faddis, a case officer for 20 years, argues in “Beyond Repair.” Faddis describes the agency as rife with incompetence at every level and compares its leadership training unfavorably with that of the military. “Sixty years after its founding,” he writes, the agency “has never developed any system for the selection, training and cultivation of leaders.” Even the Sept. 11 attacks did not produce meaningful change. Faddis argues that adding a director of national intelligence to oversee the agency simply imposed another layer of bureaucracy. Of the 4,000 new employees in the director’s office, “not a single one of them runs operations. Not a single one of them recruits assets or produces intelligence. What they do produce, however, is process, lots of it.”Faddis calls for replacing the agency with an elite group of nonofficial operatives, a return to its roots as the World War II-era Office of Strategic Services. But neither he nor any of the other memoirists really expect change. The intelligence community, like Wall Street, has emerged from its deepest failure largely unscathed, thanks to a massive government bailout. As Iran develops a nuclear bomb, Al Qaeda regroups for new attacks, and North Korea threatens war, readers of these books may be forgiven for feeling less than confident about the C.I.A.’s ability to predict, much less prevent, the catastrophes ahead.'"
"'10-11-28,'0','“I don’t think it’s a homophobic conspiracy,” Mr. Ficarra said, referring to the movie’s distribution troubles, during a recent interview at a restaurant on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.Mr. Requa added, “But you can’t say that the subject matter and style of the film didn’t play a part.”The stranger-than-fiction plot of “I Love You Phillip Morris” draws from a true story. (The opening title asserts: “This really happened. It really did.”) The real-life Steven Russell is serving a 144-year sentence in Texas for escape and fraud. When Mr. Requa and Mr. Ficarra came across the story — in the form of a book treatment by Steve McVicker, a former investigative reporter for The Houston Chronicle — they were struck by the purposeful intensity of Mr. Russell’s fabulism.“This is a guy who is to a certain extent deluded,” Mr. Requa said. “But he has a real gift for making the world conform to the way he sees things.” An egregiously unreliable narrator, Steven sets the prevailing tone. As he pulls off one con after another, the film springs its own bait-and-switch traps and whiplash reversals.“The wonderful thing about this script is it kept confusing me,” Mr. Carrey said in a phone interview. “Every couple of pages I changed my opinion about Steven. I’d like him, I’d hate him, I’d like him, I’d hate him. The one constant in the whole thing is his relentlessness, which is what I wanted to play. I wanted to find out what’s behind it.”While preparing for the role, he said, he spoke to gay friends, read the writings of the activist Larry Kramer and watched “safe-sex instructional videos.” But he added that the central question remained, as it does with most of his parts: “What lie does the person believe about themselves? Even if it’s an absurd character, there’s a belief system.”In Mr. Russell’s case Mr. Carrey attributed his behavior to “a severe case of abandonment.” (In the film Steven learns at a young age that he was adopted, and as an adult he’s rebuffed by his birth mother.) “That forms a grandiose personality,” Mr. Carrey said, “a need to constantly prove yourself.”Mr. Requa noted that Mr. Carrey is the rare actor for whom the film’s wild tonal shifts are not a stretch. In comic and dramatic films alike, including “Liar Liar” and “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” Mr. Carrey has specialized in characters defined by raging identity crises and compulsions that verge on pathology. “Jim really identified with Steven as a man constantly reinventing himself,” Mr. Requa said.In managing the movie’s volatile mix of comedy and tragedy, irony and sincerity Mr. Requa and Mr. Ficarra often shot three versions of a scene, ranging from restrained to broad, to leave themselves options in the editing room.A gay romantic comedy that takes place largely behind bars presents a minefield of tasteless jokes about prison sex that most filmmakers would approach with caution. But Mr. Requa and Mr. Ficarra, the writers of “Bad Santa” (2003), which starred Billy Bob Thornton as a lustful, profane, binge-drinking St. Nick, are not the types to tread lightly. (They also wrote another potty-mouthed Thornton vehicle, the 2005 “Bad News Bears” remake.)“We think sex is funny, and people are too precious and too sensitive about it,” Mr. Ficarra said.“I Love You Phillip Morris” may celebrate the American genius for self-invention and self-deception, but its guiding principle is the French notion of “l’amour fou.” This conforms with the version of events that Mr. Russell presented when Mr. Requa and Mr. Ficarra visited him in prison.“Steven talks about the two of them like it’s the greatest love story ever told,” Mr. Ficarra said. “You talk to Phillip, and it sounds like that might not be the case.”Speaking by phone from Arkansas, where he now lives, Mr. Morris said he found the film funny and touching. “But I try to separate myself from the movie as if I wasn’t one of the characters,” he said. “They have to romanticize everything because it’s a movie.”Mr. Ficarra, 41, and Mr. Requa, 44, who are both straight, dedicated “I Love You Phillip Morris” to Paul Corrigan, one of their teachers at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where they studied film in the early ’90s. Mr. Corrigan, who was gay, was an important mentor. “He really Eliza Doolittled us,” Mr. Requa said, adding that the older man schooled them not only in screenwriting but also in fine dining and wine.Mr. Requa and Mr. Ficarra, who have worked together since their student days (their first produced screenplay was for 2001’s talking-animal picture “Cats and Dogs”), said they tried to summon Mr. Corrigan’s flamboyance and joie de vivre in shaping the characters in “I Love You Phillip Morris.” “There are still all these movies where gays are presented as victims of their nature,” Mr. Ficarra said. “We wanted to tell this story and make the homosexuality incidental.”Even though it never makes an issue of sexuality, “I Love You Phillip Morris” is matter-of-factly confrontational in its sexual frankness. A few minutes into the film Mr. Carrey bares almost all in a highly physical and vocal bedroom scene.“We call it inoculating the audience,” Mr. Requa said.The touchy-feely intimacy between Steven and Phillip is something Mr. McGregor and Mr. Carrey brought to the film. “There was one kiss in the script, and there are like four in the movie,” Mr. Requa said. “Every time we would roll long, Jim and Ewan would improv some dialogue, and then they’d make out.”While the movie’s no-big-deal attitude might presume a reasonably tolerant audience, Mr. Requa and Mr. Ficarra have encountered some squeamishness along the way. Mr. Requa said that an early potential backer had one request: “Can Phillip be a girl?” At the Sundance premiere the first question, directed at Mr. Carrey, was from someone who wanted to know what it was like to kiss Mr. McGregor.Mr. Carrey handled the moment with good humor — “A dream come true. I mean, look at the guy!” — but said he has since grown weary of such inquiries. “People haven’t grown up very much when it comes to all that,” Mr. Carrey said. “I’ve answered that question a thousand times now. What was it like to kiss Ewan McGregor? Well, he has lips, and they felt like lips.”Howard Cohen, co-president of Roadside Attractions, said that his company had made an offer for “I Love You Phillip Morris” last year — it was outbid by Consolidated and was ready to step in when that deal fell through. “We’ve embraced the fact that it’s an edgy movie,” Mr. Cohen said, “that it’s maybe not like other Jim Carrey movies. And if you look at the marketing materials, we’ve certainly embraced the gay content.”In the two years since they completed “Phillip Morris,” Mr. Ficarra and Mr. Requa have directed another film, a romantic comedy called “Crazy, Stupid, Love” (set to open in April), from the script of another writer, Dan Fogelman. They have also completed a screenplay titled “Pharm Girl,” with Reese Witherspoon attached, about a cheerleader turned pharmaceutical representative.It is unlikely that Mr. Russell will ever see “I Love You Phillip Morris.” “Never say never with Steven,” Mr. Ficarra said, “but you’re not allowed to show R-rated movies in prison.” Mr. Requa added, “Gay subject matter is also verboten.”Mr. Morris said that Mr. Carrey’s performance bears little outward resemblance to the Steven he knew. “Steven is the least flamboyant individual you would ever meet,” Mr. Morris said. “But I think he would love it.”Mr. Ficarra concurred. “I don’t know if we’re glamorizing him so much as really selling that he did it all for love, and I think he would embrace that,” he said. “I can guarantee you if Steven saw the movie, he would swear that every word and every frame was true. Even the stuff we made up.”'"
"'10-11-28,'0','When she was offered a part-time position teaching piano at the Long Island Conservatory of Music near Mineola, she was glad to relocate and continue her musical studies in New York. “New York is so abundant in musical and artistic events,” she said.Ms. Choi, 30, began looking for a one-bedroom rental early last summer, staying with a friend in Greenwich Village, which she knew was a “really cool area.” But she preferred the calm of the far Upper East Side, where she had heard rents were reasonable because of the distance to the subway, “which doesn’t really affect me because I am not going downtown to work every day,” she said.She was working against the clock. She had a three-week trip planned in July to Sydney, where she would play in a benefit concert. If she found a place immediately, the timing would be perfect. Otherwise she would return from Australia without a place to live, a possibility that made her nervous. “I am the type of person who wants it worked out in advance,” she said.Because of her piano, Ms. Choi’s first requirement was a building with a wide entrance and a capacious elevator. Ms. Choi’s price range, starting at $2,000 a month, quickly rose to $2,500.She was referred to Robin Rolison, a saleswoman at Citi Habitats.“This was a challenge on so many levels,” Ms. Rolison said. “Not everyone wants a piano in the building.” Ms. Choi also lacked the employment history, steady income and guarantor that New York landlords often require. “To a landlord, on paper, Vivian does not look like someone you would want,” Ms. Rolison said. “If they would take her money, they wouldn’t take her piano, and if they would take her piano, there was a problem with the money.”They visited Windsor 400, a postwar rental building at First Avenue and 71st Street, which Ms. Choi liked a lot. It was clean and bright, with a roomy elevator.But Ms. Choi’s income was too low, so the building required a guarantor in the tristate area. She crossed Windsor 400 off her list.A possibility came up at the Impala, a condominium on 76th Street near First Avenue. But the owner wanted a year’s rent upfront.Manhattan Place, a high-rise condominium on First Avenue at 37th Street, had a lounge with a piano. Ms. Choi heard that it was sometimes used for lessons, “and they would be totally fine with me playing if I wanted to,” she said. “I thought: Piano-friendly building.” But she was alarmed when her ears popped in the elevator. And the neighborhood didn’t seem residential at all.Ms. Choi discovered that condominiums tended to require reams of references or months of advance rent. A nice one-bedroom at East 79th Street presented especially high hurdles, including a $1,500 move-in fee and the need for board approval. The owner wanted a two-year lease, which Ms. Choi was reluctant to sign. Suppose her neighbors objected to her playing and she had to move? Or her neighbors moved and the new ones complained?“Initially, people say, I would love to have a pianist playing classical music in the building,” Ms. Choi said. “But I know that performing is one thing and practicing is a completely different thing. Sometimes I am repeating a very short passage millions of times and going on forever, and that can really drive people crazy.”But she liked the apartment. She prepared her board package the night before her departure for Australia. By the time she arrived in Sydney, she had determined that “this is too much effort and hassle for this to be the right apartment.”Upon her return, she had a new attitude: “Because it is New York it is so difficult, but because it is New York it is possible,” she said. “There is an abundance of everything, from food to people to events to places to live, as well.”This time, Ms. Rolison took her to an apartment at London House, a postwar rental building on 80th Street east of First Avenue. The place had 800 square feet, more than most that she had seen.Here, she easily qualified as a renter. “Sarah in the leasing office opened her arms up and said: ‘Vivian, you and your piano and your credit history are all welcome here,’ ” Ms. Rolison said.The building’s policies are more lenient than some. “We have a very thorough, equal-opportunity qualifying process,” said Sarah Williams, the assistant property manager for the owner, Equity Residential. The company looks at rental and employment history, and runs a background check.At $2,680 a month, the one-bedroom was above Ms. Choi’s price range, but she paid a low fee to Ms. Rolison — 4 percent of a year’s rent, or around $1,300. (The building also paid Ms. Rolison a fee of a month’s rent.) More typically, the tenant pays the agent 15 percent of a year’s rent.Ms. Choi and her piano arrived in early fall. She is happy with her walkable neighborhood and her “comfortable, sanctuary-type apartment,” where she added three layers of carpeting and sound-absorbing casters beneath the piano’s legs.Upstairs, her neighbor walks on hardwood floors in heels. Ms. Choi figures the heels and the piano cancel each other out.'"

"'10-11-29,'0','Much of Silicon Valley’s innovation comes about as engineers leave companies to start their own. For Google, which in five years has grown to 23,000 employees from 5,000 and to $23.7 billion in revenue from $3.2 billion, the risk is that it will miss the best people and the next great idea.“It’s a short step from scale to sclerosis,” said Daniel H. Pink, an author and analyst on the workplace. “It becomes a more acute problem in Silicon Valley, where in a couple years, you could have some competitor in a garage ready to put you out entirely.”Google’s chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, says that people who think Google faces brain drain are “fundamentally wrong.” The company’s attrition rate for people it wished would stay has been constant for seven years, he said.Nevertheless, Google’s maturation worries him. “There was a time when three people at Google could build a world-class product and deliver it, and it is gone,” Mr. Schmidt said. “So I think it’s absolutely harder to get things out the door. That’s probably our biggest strategic issue.”As a result, Google is taking aggressive steps to retain employees, particularly those with start-up ambitions. Google has given several engineers who said they were leaving to start new companies the chance to start them within Google. They work independently and can recruit other engineers and use Google’s resources, like its code base and servers, according to half a dozen employees.Google Wave, a way for people to work together online, was one example. The engineering team, based in Sydney, Australia, worked independently and got equity in the project, according to three people briefed on the agreement. But Google shut down Wave this year, and Mr. Rasmussen, who led the project, quit for Facebook soon after.Google is considering opening a start-up incubator inside the company, according to two people briefed on the plans.Other big companies have made similar attempts with varying success. Cisco Systems’s program has given birth to new businesses like TelePresence, a videoconferencing service, but Yahoo’s incubator was shut down in 2008, a year and a half after it started.From the beginning, Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have tried to prevent atrophy. That is one reason Google gives everyone time — called 20 percent time at the company — to work on their own projects. The company tries to limit groups of engineers working on projects to 10.But in reality, engineering groups quickly swell to 20 or even 40, several Google product managers said. And new products created during 20 percent time are less likely to get anywhere these days.Popular Google products like Gmail grew out of 20 percent time, for instance. But engineers say they have been encouraged to build fewer new products and focus on building improvements to existing ones, like the terrain layer on Google Maps.“There’s a lot of these cool features that are very hidden, and a lot of people worked very hard on them and they were kind of sad that they spent a year of their life on something that gets 0.1 percent usage,” said another product manager who is considering leaving for a start-up.Part of Google’s problem is that the best engineers are often the ones with the most entrepreneurial thirst. Google loaded up on that type in its early hiring.Some of those go-getters now want to leave as they become frustrated with the processes and procedures. Josh McFarland, a former Google product manager who left last year and started TellApart, which helps retailers advertise online, said he knew it was time to leave as the number of people he had to copy on e-mail messages ballooned.“I think that there is a class of person who is able to walk away from this relatively easy, consistent money because they are so dissatisfied with the processes of a big company,” he said.For others, it is about making more money elsewhere. Start-ups have a riskier and potentially more rewarding lure: shares in a company before an initial public offering.Google, which has always been generous with salary, stock options and benefits like massages, dry cleaning and free food, is going a step further to keep employees happy. This month, Google gave every employee a raise of 10 percent or more. The motivation was, in part, the “war for talent,” Mr. Schmidt said. People who have other job offers have been persuaded to stay with seven-figure bonuses. Google says 80 percent of people who get a counteroffer stay put.Of those who leave, employees going to Facebook get the most attention. According to résumés posted on LinkedIn, 142 of Facebook’s 1,700 employees came from Google. Mr. Schmidt dismissed the idea that Facebook was poaching Google’s best people, saying, “We hire more people in a week than go to Facebook in its lifetime.”Despite Google’s growing pains, it remains remarkably innovative when it wants to be. Last month, for instance, it unveiled robotic cars that drive themselves. And like many big companies, Google has been acquiring new technologies, like Android, instead of inventing them.While he worries about the consequences of becoming a big company, “People are dying to come here and they’re staying,” Mr. Schmidt said. “So I guess they’re putting up with the complexity.”'"
"'10-11-29,'0','BP is commissioning a feature-length film about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill — but the company says it is not intended to scrub its reputation clean.Widely reviled for its role in the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico this year, the company quietly responded with short Web videos that showed the myriad ways it was responding to the spill. The videos were produced by World Television, the same corporate video company based in London that is working on the longer feature.“They are making a film of the spill primarily for an internal audience as an archive of a momentous event in the company’s history (not to mention those impacted by the tragedy and its aftermath),” Robert Wine, a spokesman for BP, said in an e-mail.Mr. Wine said World Television had been BP’s main “internal video producer” for the last decade. World Television has started lining up interviews with journalists and other figures for the film; it did not respond to requests for comment. In total, World Television has completed about 190 Web videos about the oil spill this year, some of which are still available on BP.com.In that respect, what BP is doing is scarcely different from other major companies that prefer to underwrite their own media efforts rather than work through the fourth estate.One of the more recent videos, titled “A Community Fights Back,” is a 12-minute look at the recovery of the tourism economy in Florida, Louisiana and Alabama. BP’s Web site calls it a “mini-documentary.”'"
"'10-11-29,'0','After a day of meetings on Ireland and other debt issues, euro zone officials agreed that after 2013, bondholders could face losses in future bailouts, but only on a case by case basis, taking into account guidance from the International Monetary Fund and its experience in previous debt crises. This was a caveat that France had advocated as a way to calm investor anxiety.Berlin had wanted the automatic involvement of the private sector in sovereign debt defaults, while Paris preferred a more flexible system.“In view of market developments, it was important to clarify rapidly the role of the private sector in the mechanism,” Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, said in a statement. “Our framework will be fully in line with the I.M.F. approach.”Across Europe, governments have faced a rising tide of anger from taxpayers who are now footing the bill for a crisis created in part by the financial sector. Investors have so far been protected from potential losses resulting from bank failures and government default, both in the bailout of Greece in the spring and in the package of financial measures for Ireland announced on Sunday.But German officials have argued that, once the markets factor the risk of losses into their calculations, borrowing costs for more spendthrift euro zone nations will increase, forcing them to change their behavior. That is seen as a key tool to prevent a recurrence of the current problems.Under the agreement reached Sunday, the new, permanent bailout fund for the euro zone would be structured loosely on the current short-term mechanism created in the wake of the bailout of Greece in May. Beginning in 2013, euro zone bonds will include clauses requiring bondholders to accept restructuring measures if necessary. Berlin had wanted an earlier phase-in period.Officials rushed to announce the details of the new system — and of Ireland’s rescue package — before financial markets opened on Monday in a bid to relieve pressure on Portugal and Spain, the economies seen as the most vulnerable after Ireland.Europeans are desperate to keep the crisis from overtaking Spain, which, because of the size of its economy, would require a huge bailout and raise questions about the sustainability of the single currency.The ministers also agreed to undertake a new set of stress tests on European banks to try to reassure markets of their ability to survive shocks. And they said they would examine whether to extend the time given to Greece to repay its bailout funds to match more generous terms accorded to Ireland.But it remained unclear whether enough had been done to quell the fears of contagion gripping markets. Despite Ireland’s application a week ago for a bailout package, the markets have continued to threaten the stability of the euro, and yields on 10-year bonds climbed last week in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy.The euro gained in early Asian trading after the announcement, then slipped back, to $1.3218 on Monday compared with $1.3242 in late trading Friday in New York.In the meantime, Ireland formally became the second nation to accept a bailout. The 85 billion euro ($112 billion) total includes a contribution of 17.5 billion euros by the Irish government itself through money it has already raised. Of the rest, 22.5 billion euros will come from the International Monetary Fund. The remaining 45 billion euros will come from bilateral loans from European nations and two European Union rescue funds set up in the spring.Britain’s bilateral loan will be 3.8 billion euros, though it will also pay into the European Union and I.M.F. components, for a total contribution of 7.9 billion euros.“It is in Britain’s national interest,” said George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer. “It is money we fully expect to get back, and I think it will help Ireland get on a fully stable path back to growth.”In a condition that was strongly backed by Dublin, senior bondholders in Irish banks will not take losses. “There will be no ‘haircuts,’ ” said Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs.The interest rate on the loans has yet to be determined but would be around 6 percent and in line with I.M.F. policy, he said.Dublin has said it would try to cut its budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2014, from 32 percent now, but growth is likely to slow amid a new austerity plan that will cut 15 billion euros’ worth of spending over the next three years. In an acknowledgment of these new pressures, Ireland’s European partners said they would extend by one year, to 2015, the time in which Ireland must meet the deficit-cutting target.Before Ireland joined the euro, its banks tended to do business the old-fashioned way, financing their lending through the deposits they took in. Once in the euro zone, banks were suddenly able to borrow huge sums of money inexpensively on international markets with nearly no exchange rate risk, an activity that was barely regulated by policy makers. With easy access to these funds, banks like Anglo Irish lent huge amounts to prominent Irish developers, leading to a frenzy of overdevelopment.When the dust settles, most of Ireland’s banking system will effectively wind up nationalized by the government. The Irish central bank governor, Patrick Honohan, said last week that Ireland’s banks and various assets were up for sale.But while the European Union rescue package helps backstop billions in losses, a fresh wave of losses is expected to hit banks soon as more beleaguered homeowners default on their mortgages and housing prices continue to tumble in Ireland. With more losses to come, it is unclear who would step in to buy the banks.“The Irish banking system has become a black hole,” said Charles Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, a global association of the world’s largest banks, “and as long as real estate prices continue to deteriorate, it will remain somewhat of a black hole.”'"

"'10-11-30,'0','LONDON (Reuters) — The British police have warned students not to use violence in demonstrations on Tuesday against a planned increase in tuition fees, after clashes during two previous days of protests.Organizers are calling for university and secondary school students to take to the streets in what they are calling a “national day of action” against plans by the Conservative-led coalition government to almost triple tuition, up to $14,500 a year.“November 30 will see even more students come out on protest across the country,” the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts said in a statement. The organizers said that about 24,000 had promised to participate.Protesters smashed windows and started fires at the building housing the Conservative Party’s headquarters in London during a march this month, and scuffles and vandalism took place in London during protests last week.The police were criticized on both occasions, first for failing to anticipate the potential for trouble during the first day of demonstrations and then for tactics that some people said were heavy-handed during the second day of protests around the country.The Metropolitan Police commissioner, Paul Stephenson, has since warned that “the game has changed” in trying to restrain the protests and he said he expected more disorder.'"
"'10-11-30,'0','Some voices are clotted with emotion. Other callers tell their stories with the weary familiarity of people who have presented their case to countless lawyers, jailers and court officers, without success. Sometimes, children shout in the background as a missing father or son is described.On the air, Ms. Azawi solicits full names, birth dates, physical descriptions and last-known whereabouts. Was he — and invariably, the missing are men — sent to a particular prison? Where did he live?She interviews experts on detention policy and broadcasts short segments on life inside Iraq’s prisons. She displays photos of the missing, and tells callers she will search her lists of detainees and reach out to the Ministry of Justice for information. She wishes each caller luck, then greets the next person on the line: “Salaam aleikum.”“It is rare to find anyone,” Ms. Azawi said, looking drained after a live broadcast one recent evening. “Almost all of them are in secret jails or have been killed.”It is all but impossible to create a tally of Iraq’s missing, what happened to them or where they may be. Some are in government prisons, and others killed long ago by Shiite death squads, Sunni militants or criminal gangs.Amnesty International estimates that 30,000 people are being held without trial, and the government and Iraqi nonprofit groups say that as many as 15,000 people were reported missing in 2005 and 2006, two of the worst years of the sectarian war.Still people call in — dozens in a single hour — and overload the studio’s two phone lines, dialing in from the mountainous terrain of Kurdistan as well as the shrine cities in Iraq’s Shiite south. Stitched together, their calls create an oral history of the last eight years of war.Aziz Hasoon, whose brother was arrested more than three years ago, said he knew the odds were negligible that anyone would respond to his call for information. But Mr. Hasoon said his brother, an army soldier, was reported to be in jail in southern Iraq, and Mr. Hasoon said he believed he was still alive.There was a call from Faras of Mosul, in Baghdad’s volatile north, whose cousin disappeared into the labyrinth of jails run by different arms of the government after being arrested in 2005. And one from Salman, in Hitt, whose brother was kidnapped three years ago.“I can understand their suffering,” said Riyadh al-Barzanji, the show’s producer and creator.Mr. Barzanji started the show a year ago as a memorial of sorts to his older brother, who was kidnapped in 2005 from Baghdad’s Dora neighborhood, one of the capital’s worst battlegrounds. Mr. Barzanji said his brother was taken to safe houses operated by militias loyal to the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr and disappeared.Mr. Barzanji said his brother, who worked as a driver for Baghdad TV, was probably buried in an unmarked grave. So now, every Saturday, he sits in a cramped control room and forwards callers to Ms. Azawi.“People keep asking and begging for information about their families,” Ms. Azawi said. “It’s a heavy weight.”It has been four years since Subhiyah Fadel Khalaf, 62, kissed her son Abbas goodbye as he set off for Samarra, north of Baghdad. She and her other sons have been looking for him ever since. They have visited prisons across the country and paid thousands of dollars to shadowy figures who promised to free her son, only to abscond with the money.She thought she glimpsed his face in a television report on detainees, lifting her hopes. Every week for the past four months, Ms. Khalaf has called in to the show to talk about Abbas, hoping that someone will recognize his name or offer a signal that he is all right.“I keep dreaming of him coming back home,” Ms. Khalaf said in an interview. “That’s why I call. This is maybe the only hope left for me now, to keep waiting every week.”'"
"'10-11-30,'0','Meanwhile, companies are alarmed by indications that travel costs are rising, even as improved economic conditions argue for sending more employees out on the road. Next year, according to the American Express Global Business Travel Forecast released last month, “pricing power will swing back to air and hotel suppliers for the first time in two years.”For business travelers, of course, this all means more lectures from corporate travel managers about saving money. As the American Express report put it, companies need to re-examine cost control tactics to guard against the expected “significant rate increases” next year.According to the annual Business Traveler Survey just released by the consulting company Deloitte, 24 percent of respondents plan to take more business trips next year and an additional 56 percent expect to take at least as many as in 2010. They’re on a tighter rein, too. Half said they were now required to obtain preapproval for business trips. Nearly a quarter said they were now staying at cheaper hotels.Companies are especially tightening up on pretrip approval, said Adam F. Weissenberg, a Deloitte vice chairman who heads its travel and leisure division. Before the recession, he said, “people were traveling kind of at will, while business was great.” Now, many companies are saying, “wait a second, we need to go back and take a hard look at how our people travel,” Mr. Weissenberg said.Increasingly, he said, the approval process means “having the person make a business case” for the trip. Also, he added, many companies have become stricter on auditing expense accounts, while insisting on better adherence to travel policies, including deals that corporations make with preferred airlines, hotels and other suppliers.Now, those of us who have been around this rodeo for a while have seen this particular event many times. Corporate travel managers wail that costs are soaring, and they demand compliance with new or old, but always strict, travel policies — or else.But as business conditions improve and the need to travel becomes compelling, many business travelers push back and say, in effect, “Whaddya mean I have to save money by connecting on that crummy airline through Chicago and Houston to get to my destination in Los Angeles, where you expect me to stay at some cheap hotel that’s an hour’s drive from my meeting?”It is no secret whose side I am generally on in these inexorable tugs of war between those who must be on the road and those who pay the bills. As I have often said, a smart company knows that a valuable employee who travels with a basic measure of comfort is a more productive employee — even if that means paying for a business-class seat to ensure that the employee can work and rest on the plane and then arrive ready to go after that long flight to Shanghai.So we’ll listen to the lectures and travel with our usual fiscal prudence. But we can take heart in a statistic released by the International Air Transport Association. Penny-pinching aside, international premium travel in first- and business-class was up 12.1 percent in September.As they say at the rodeo, Yippee!'"
"'10-11-30,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The United States Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear Microsoft’s appeal of a record-setting $290 million jury verdict for infringing a patent held by a small Canadian software firm.The result of the Supreme Court’s review of the three-year-old case, which is expected by the middle of next year, could alter the way patents are enforced in the United States by making it easier to challenge their validity.The dispute, which started in 2007, was seemingly resolved in 2009 when a federal jury awarded $290 million to a Toronto company, i4i Inc., after finding that Microsoft had infringed the company’s patent relating to text manipulation software in the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word, Microsoft’s word processing application.Microsoft subsequently appealed the verdict but was rebuffed by a federal appeals court that specializes in patent and trademark cases, making the jury award the largest patent infringement verdict ever affirmed on appeal. The Patent and Trademark Office upheld the validity of the i4i patent in April.Microsoft continued to dispute those decisions, but did remove the contested features from its current software.'"
"'10-11-30,'0','Instead of long-term insolvency, running out of cash is what causes financial crises like the one slowly unfolding in Europe. Yet much of the effort by policy makers around the globe has been to shore up solvency, not stabilize sources of financing. Unless that changes, the world will lurch from crisis to bailout and back again to crisis.Ireland’s banking problems are only the latest example of how seemingly solvent institutions can be brought to the brink because they cannot in the short term raise the cash needed to finance themselves. Only four months ago, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland were given a clean bill of health in the European Union’s official stress tests. One weakness of these tests was that they stressed solvency, not liquidity, although that may be remedied next year.The two biggest Irish banks did not have a large enough base of stable retail deposits. The loan-to-deposit ratios at Allied Irish and Bank of Ireland stand at just above 160 percent, which made them excessively dependent on wholesale money from other banks and big investors. When that dried up, they had to turn to the European Central Bank. When deposits from corporate customers also started to flee, emergency action was required.Sadly, this is an all-too-familiar story. Financing was the Achilles’ heel of banks that went to the brink, or over it, in 2008. The likes of Lehman Brothers, Northern Rock of Britain, Washington Mutual, Royal Bank of Scotland and Fortis of Belgium may have had inadequate capital. But death by insolvency is usually a slow one. Death, or near death, through lack of liquidity is rapid.If Portugal’s banks also get sucked into the continuing European maelstrom, financing troubles again will be the cause. Banco Espirito Santo and Millennium BCP have high capital ratios and look solvent as a result. But like the two big Irish banks, they have loan-to-deposit ratios above 160 percent, making them dependent on unreliable sources of funds.Governments, meanwhile, differ from banks because they do not finance themselves through deposits. However, they do need to continue rolling over debt as well as pay for new deficits. As with banks, the more stable their sources of money, the better. A domestic private sector flush with cash and willing to buy government bonds helps.'"
"'10-11-30,'0','Our everyday picture of a narcissist is that of someone who is very self-involved — the conversation is always about them. While this characterization does apply to people with narcissistic personality disorder, it is too broad. There are many people who are completely self-absorbed who would not qualify for a diagnosis of N.P.D.The central requirement for N.P.D. is a special kind of self-absorption: a grandiose sense of self, a serious miscalculation of one’s abilities and potential that is often accompanied by fantasies of greatness. It is the difference between two high school baseball players of moderate ability: one is absolutely convinced he’ll be a major-league player, the other is hoping for a college scholarship.Of course, it would be premature to call the major-league hopeful a narcissist at such an early age, but imagine that same kind of unstoppable, unrealistic attitude 10 or 20 years later.The second requirement for N.P.D.: since the narcissist is so convinced of his high station (most are men), he automatically expects that others will recognize his superior qualities and will tell him so. This is often referred to as “mirroring.” It’s not enough that he knows he’s great. Others must confirm it as well, and they must do so in the spirit of “vote early, and vote often.”Finally, the narcissist, who longs for the approval and admiration of others, is often clueless about how things look from someone else’s perspective. Narcissists are very sensitive to being overlooked or slighted in the smallest fashion, but they often fail to recognize when they are doing it to others.Most of us would agree that this is an easily recognizable profile, and it is a puzzle why the manual’s committee on personality disorders has decided to throw N.P.D. off the bus. Many experts in the field are not happy about it.Actually, they aren’t happy about the elimination of the other four disorders either, and they’re not shy about saying so.One of the sharpest critics of the DSM committee on personality disorders is a Harvard psychiatrist, Dr. John Gunderson, an old lion in the field of personality disorders and the person who led the personality disorders committee for the current manual.Asked what he thought about the elimination of narcissistic personality disorder, he said it showed how “unenlightened” the personality disorders committee is.“They have little appreciation for the damage they could be doing.” He said the diagnosis is important in terms of organizing and planning treatment.“It’s draconian,” he said of the decision, “and the first of its kind, I think, that half of a group of disorders are eliminated by committee.”He also blamed a so-called dimensional approach, which is a method of diagnosing personality disorders that is new to the DSM. It consists of making an overall, general diagnosis of personality disorder for a given patient, and then selecting particular traits from a long list in order to best describe that specific patient.This is in contrast to the prototype approach that has been used for the past 30 years: the narcissistic syndrome is defined by a cluster of related traits, and the clinician matches patients to that profile.The dimensional approach has the appeal of ordering à la carte — you get what you want, no more and no less. But it is precisely because of this narrow focus that it has never gained much traction with clinicians.It is one thing to call someone a neat and careful dresser. It is another to call that person a dandy, or a clotheshorse, or a boulevardier. Each of these terms has slightly different meanings and conjures up a type.And clinicians like types. The idea of replacing the prototypic diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder with a dimensional diagnosis like “personality disorder with narcissistic and manipulative traits” just doesn’t cut it.Jonathan Shedler, a psychologist at the University of Colorado Medical School, said: “Clinicians are accustomed to thinking in terms of syndromes, not deconstructed trait ratings. Researchers think in terms of variables, and there’s just a huge schism.” He said the committee was stacked “with a lot of academic researchers who really don’t do a lot of clinical work. We’re seeing yet another manifestation of what’s called in psychology the science-practice schism.”Schism is probably not an overstatement. For 30 years the DSM has been the undisputed standard that clinicians consult when diagnosing mental disorders. When a new diagnosis is introduced, or an established diagnosis is substantially modified or deleted, it is not a small deal. As Dr. Gunderson said, it will affect the way professionals think about and treat patients.Given the stakes, the blow-back from experts in personality disorders should come as no surprise.Dr. Gunderson has written a letter co-signed by other clinical and research leaders to the trustees of the American Psychiatric Association and the task force that governs DSM-5. And Dr. Shedler and seven colleagues published an editorial in the September issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry. In the relatively small world of mental health diagnostics, this is most certainly a battle worth watching.Right now, this much seems clear: It is way too early for the narcissists to give up their seat on the bus.'"
