Novartis’s generic-drug unit, Sandoz, sued United States regulators last year to win approval to copy the human growth hormone.“We will quickly bring this product to market for the patients and physicians who need it,” Sandoz’s chief executive, Andreas Rummelt, said.The approval, which follows a positive opinion on the product by a European Medicines Agency panel in June, covers the treatment of renal anemia and chemotherapy patients.Companies are pushing to bring out copies of biological medicines as drugs go off patent and governments cut health care budgets.'"

Three religious organizations, including the Tyndale Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, waged the fight. The court said banning an institution like Tyndale from using the term “seminary” in its name violated the Constitution. Tyndale was cited in 1998 for violating a law that requires seminaries to be accredited and prevents unaccredited institutions from awarding degrees. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board fined it $173,000.'"
"'07-09-01,'0','“I am not 100 percent yet, but I am improving.”The Nadal who took the court yesterday looked like the player who threatens the dominance of top-seeded Roger Federer in every major. He unleashed his full array of shots while having no trouble covering the court. Tipsarevic was the one dragging himself around in obvious pain before pulling out.In the other late-night match, 16th-seeded Lleyton Hewitt of Australia, a champion here in 2001, lost to Agustin Calleri of Argentina, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2.The most impressive performance of the evening was registered by Venus Williams, who played so effortlessly in beating a promising player, that even her sister appeared a bit overwhelmed. Serena Williams said she watched some of the match after she finished playing.“She’s playing really good,” Serena said. “She’s encouraging me to do better. She’s playing unbelievable.”Venus said she felt torn about watching her sister’s match while trying to prepare for hers.“She’s obviously an unbelievable competitor, so when push comes to shove, she shoves,” Venus said. “I’m not too worried about whether or not she’s going to make it.”It would be a twist in the Williamses’ story here if Venus were to outlast Serena. They have each won two titles here, but Venus has threatened infrequently since winning in 2000 and 2001, and losing the final to Serena in 2002. Injuries have been a constant worry and a wrist problem kept her out of last year’s Open.So she is soaking in the atmosphere in her return to the spotlight.“It was a good day,” Venus said. “I definitely told myself I can play. I know what I’m doing, I just have to go out and execute. That’s pretty much my game plan.”Serena’s game plan appears to be one of survival. Her display of pique began with the first points. She yelled at herself, made exaggerated displays of disgust after bad shots, put her face in her hands and occasionally looked as if she were about to cry.“I was mad at different points and different shots,” she said. “For the most part I tried to stay O.K.”But when the umpire told her during a changeover in the first set that she had to put away a book of notes, Williams appeared ready to boil over. She argued that she always used it and had never been told to put it away.“He said it was fine,” Williams said. “I asked him if that was something they do on the ATP Tour, because I don’t play on that tour, nor do I belong over there. He said, ‘Yeah.’ I was like: ‘No one has ever told me. I’ve been doing this for my first two matches as well.’ ”In the end, her frustration completed, she had advanced to the fourth round tomorrow, when she will face Marion Bartoli of France, a surprise finalist at Wimbledon.Venus Williams, who beat Bartoli in that Wimbledon final, will play fifth-seeded Ana Ivanovic of Serbia tomorrow.Also last night, Tim Henman of Britain lost in the final Grand Slam tournament of his career, dropping his second-round match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France, 7-6 (2), 2-6, 7-5, 6-4.“There’s the next part of my life that I’m pretty excited about,” Henman, 32, said. “I have two young kids and another on the way, so I have a lot to be happy about.”'"

But late Thursday, Lone Star told the mortgage lender that it wanted to pay $8.50 a share.In exchange for the reduced price, Lone Star offered to let Accredited seek other buyers.But Friday afternoon, Accredited said the price was settled two weeks ago, when 97 percent of the company’s shares were tendered at $15.10. Accredited said it would continue pursuing a lawsuit it filed this month in a Delaware court to try to force the equity firm to complete the deal.Accredited shares rallied Friday, rising $2.74, or 43 percent, to $9.05. The shares traded above $30 late last year but tumbled in March and have remained depressed.The Lone Star-Accredited deal is the latest in a string of buyouts that are in trouble or being renegotiated.'"
"'07-09-01,'0','The New York attorney general Andrew M. Cuomo has subpoenaed the First Marblehead Corporation as part of his investigation of the student-loan industry in the United States.The company, based in Boston and the third-largest securitizer of student loans, received a subpoena on Aug. 22, according to a statement yesterday on its Web site.The subpoena reflects Mr. Cuomo’s seven-month investigation of the $85-billion-a-year industry. The investigation has led to the firing of financial aid officials at Columbia University in New York and the University of Texas at Austin.Mr. Cuomo has looked at 12 lenders and more than 24 colleges and universities for conflicts of interests and preferential treatment in exchange for gifts, stock options and payments.“We provide outsourcing solutions for lenders,” a First Marblehead spokeswoman, Janice D. Walker, said in a telephone interview. “He’s already reached out to lenders, so it’s not unexpected that he would reach out to us.”'"
"'07-09-01,'0','“We have more questions than we have answers at this point,” the commissioner said in an interview on Thursday in his office at department headquarters in downtown Brooklyn. Stressing that it was “grossly unfair to judge them or their conduct” this early in the investigation, he said, “I’m the ultimate judge of what happens to them.”But the problems for Mr. Scoppetta and the department may go well beyond the tragic circumstances at the former bank building. The city has ordered, in effect, a complete review of the department’s program for inspecting buildings of all sizes and complications across the city. Some in the department fear what that inquiry might reveal about its diligence in recent years.And so Mr. Scoppetta finds himself in the harsh light of scrutiny from without and within, an outsider who has never completely ingratiated himself into the deeply traditional and insular agency he leads.But his allies from more than three decades of public service in New York City say that it is just this sort of crisis that brings out the best in Commissioner Scoppetta, a former state and federal prosecutor known for staying levelheaded and sticking to facts at times like this.“To be willing to do that, you have to have a clear head, a good mind,” said Robert Leuci, 67, a former police officer who testified against fellow officers in corruption cases in the 1970s. His story became the basis of the book and film “Prince of the City,” and Mr. Scoppetta was the prosecutor at his side.“He grew up in a very tough environment,” Mr. Leuci said, “and he comes away one of the most gentle guys you could meet.”Commissioner Scoppetta was born in 1932 and was abandoned, along with his two brothers, by his parents when he was 5 and living on Spring Street in Little Italy. He spent several years in foster care, a period of his life that he guarded for many years before he was named commissioner of children’s services in 1996.He called the job an “emotional fit, given my history, as a kid,” but said his place as an outsider of that agency had people wondering about his effectiveness, given his background working as, among other jobs, a prosecutor and as the commissioner of the Department of Investigations.“It was, ‘Why do you have a prosecutor here?’” he said. “You can’t worry too much about that. Do the job. Everyone will see this is genuine; you can be effective.”Linda I. Gibbs, deputy mayor for health and human services, who worked under Commissioner Scoppetta at children’s services, said he relished difficult jobs.“Anyone who takes a job like this knows they’re going to be constantly under fire,” she said. “You can’t be defined by what others say about you.”It was later in December 2001, after the party at the Russian Tea Room, when Commissioner Scoppetta was summoned before Mayor-elect Bloomberg, three days before the inauguration, and asked to lead the Fire Department.“That was a little bit of a surprise,” Commissioner Scoppetta recalled with typical understatement. “I said: ‘I’ve been a prosecutor. I know something about the Police Department, and I’ve worked with the police. This is something new to me, the Fire Department.’ ”But he said the idea thrilled him. “It seemed irresistible, post-9/11, to be connected to the Fire Department and do whatever any of us could to help rebuild,” he said.Peter Madonia, 53, was Mr. Bloomberg’s chief of staff, and remembered thinking that Commissioner Scoppetta’s temperament was what the battered department needed. “Nick was really an elder statesman,” he said. “Almost like a father figure.”But those who serve under Commissioner Scoppetta have been less kind during his time at the department. He is frequently described by some within the department as being out of touch with its nuts-and-bolts workings, and has appeared to some to be ineffectual in ways that his counterpart at the Police Department, Raymond W. Kelly, is not. In 2005, Mr. Bloomberg adopted Mr. Kelly’s view in a dispute over who should control the scene at terrorist attacks and other emergencies, further cementing the perception that the Police Department stands in front of firefighters in line for money and responsibility.Mr. Scoppetta remains unruffled by these beliefs. “I don’t know that people who have been fire commissioner who grew up in the department got any better reception than people who came from the outside,” he said. “It’s a really unusual culture in the Fire Department, and a lot of it is much to our benefit.”A common complaint, he said, is low morale among firefighters. “From time immemorial, you’ll hear that morale has never been lower,” he said. “When that is said to me, I just can’t help but have this reaction: ‘Compared to who? Compared to what?’ ” Of firefighters, he said, “Every one of them looks forward to coming to work.”“It is traditional at the department to take their shots at headquarters,” he said. “When I was in the Army for two years, we felt the same way about officers. No matter what you do, the commissioner is always headquarters, is identified with the mayor. I think the mayor has been extremely helpful.”When the fire began in the former Deutsche Bank building, Commissioner Scoppetta was at his home in Amagansett, in Suffolk County, preparing to have dinner with John E. Zuccotti, the former first deputy mayor. “I told my wife: ‘I’m sorry, I can’t do it. I’ve got to get out of here,’ ” he said. He speeded to Manhattan with police escorts and visited the hospital where the dead men lay, the burning building and the stricken firehouse in SoHo. “That’s always the hardest part of all this,” he said. “You have to be at one of these things to appreciate the emotion, the bond between the men.”In the days that followed, it was revealed that a battalion chief, William Siegel, had outlined his concerns about the building in memos, calling for a specific firefighting plan for the building and recommending weekly inspections.“In the week following the fire, I learned that there had been this review of the building and there was a memo written to the division commander,” he said, declining to discuss specifics while the investigation was active. “There was no prefire plan. Perhaps that building deserved it.”On Monday, he and Mr. Bloomberg announced the reassignment of the three officers, Deputy Chief Richard Fuerch, 55, who is the Division 1 commander; Battalion Chief John McDonald, 52, the commander of Battalion 1; and Capt. Peter Bosco, 48, of Engine Company 10, the company responsible for conducting the inspections.Since then, Captain Bosco’s brother, John M. Bosco, has said there was a policy understood by firefighters to have been approved up the chain of command to not enter the building because of the toxic substances inside. Others, including union leaders, have called the officers scapegoats and accused the commissioner of protecting the higher-ups at headquarters.“I don’t think that’s fair. It seems clear the inspections weren’t done,” the commissioner said. “It’s prudent to remove them from operations until the investigation is done.”He said he hoped this latest crisis would lead to improvements in the department.“Out of every crisis I’ve been involved with in government, as terrible as it might be, there is an opportunity,” he said. “Opportunity to address what might have gone wrong that’s created the crisis. I think building inspection, for example, may be considered a mundane activity by some. It’s enormously important. We have this example at the Deutsche Bank.”'"
"'07-09-01,'0','The dispute between Apple and NBC Universal over the pricing of videos on iTunes grew more heated yesterday as Apple announced that it would not add any new episodes of NBC television shows to the online store’s inventory.Among the fall shows NBC Universal will not be able to market through iTunes, effective immediately, are “Bionic Woman,” a high-profile and expensive modernization of the 1976 original, and “Chuck,” a drama about a computer geek who unwittingly acquires government secrets.One point of contention is whether new episodes of returning shows, including popular ones like “The Office” and “Heroes,” are affected. Apple says they are; NBC Universal says Apple is contractually obligated to sell new episodes of returning shows.Private negotiations between the companies over pricing became public Thursday when NBC Universal told Apple that it would not renew its iTunes contract, which expires in December. Among other things, NBC is unhappy that Apple will not relax its policy of pricing downloads of television shows at a flat $1.99. NBC Universal wants to be able to charge more for popular episodes, or, in the case of special promotions, to charge less.Yesterday, Apple swatted back, characterizing NBC Universal’s move as greedy and an attack on consumer interests. Apple said the sharp increases NBC Universal is seeking in the wholesale price for certain content would drive retail prices to $4.99 an episode.“We are disappointed to see NBC leave iTunes because we would not agree to their dramatic price increase,” Eddy Cue, the Apple vice president who oversees iTunes, said in a statement. “We hope they will change their minds and offer their TV shows to the tens of millions of iTunes customers.”'"
"'07-09-01,'0','PARIS, Aug. 31 (AP) — Pierre Messmer, a member of the French Resistance and prime minister from 1972 to 1974, died Wednesday in Paris. He was 91.His death was confirmed by former President Jacques Chirac.Mr. Messmer entered the Resistance in 1940, fleeing Nazi-occupied France for England on a cargo ship. He took part in major campaigns in North Africa and elsewhere and fought on the beaches of Normandy in June 1944.After the war he entered politics and was appointed prime minister in July 1972 by President Georges Pompidou. After Pompidou’s death in April 1974, Mr. Messmer was widely viewed as a potential presidential candidate, but he was outmaneuvered by political rivals and never held another major office.Born on March 20, 1916, in Vincennes, a Paris suburb, Mr. Messmer studied to work as an administrator in France’s colonies. After World War II, he worked in Vietnam and later West Africa on the decolonization of France’s overseas possessions.He was named minister of the armed forces under de Gaulle in 1960, when France’s war in Algeria — the jewel in its colonial crown — was reaching its bloody apex. After Algeria won its independence in 1962, Mr. Messmer led an overhaul of the French Army.'"
"'07-09-01,'0','“It was unforgettable,” Djokovic said to the crowd in his on-court interview minutes later. “I hope you enjoyed it.”The 4-hour-44-minute marathon was the longest match of this year’s Open so far, and it featured, according to Hawk-Eye Innovations Ltd., a total of 1,994 and 104 rallies that lasted longer than eight exchanges.One more exchange, however, transcended a statistic and spoke to the emotion running throughout the day. After the defeat, Stepanek climbed over the net to hug his younger opponent and the two stumbled backward together.“I think that match was really special,” said Stepanek, a 28-year-old Czech. “I think it was not a match you can see every day here.”Stepanek, who reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon last year, was perhaps more known for being the former fiancé of Martina Hingis.He is encouraged by how much his game has improved the last three months, compared with a year ago, when he missed the Open because of a dislocated disk in his neck. It cut a nerve and caused him to lose feeling in his right hand.Opting for rehabilitation instead of surgery, Stepanek recovered to win the tournament last month in Los Angeles and reach the semifinals of the Rogers Cup this month in Montreal.“I’m seeing tennis differently,” he said. “I want to enjoy playing.”Hitting backward overheads, skipping to changeovers and playing an aggressive serve-and-volley game, Stepanek looked as if he would send Djokovic — and his hype as the next great thing — tumbling out of the tournament.Djokovic’s first serve was failing him and he was tightening up on his passing shots. Stepanek, meanwhile, mixed the pace to lull him into long rallies and draw him to the net.Neither player lost his serve in the first two sets, splitting tie breakers. Djokovic admitted that he was feeling the pressure after he lost the third set, slamming his racket to the court, then lost his serve in the opening game of the fourth set.“There’s always expectations as the No. 3 player of the world,” said Djokovic, a semifinalist at the French Open and Wimbledon this year. “I had some impressive results. Of course, the people expect me to do well because this is my most preferred surface.”Djokovic composed himself in the fourth set, got the break back, then called for a trainer to massage his back on the changeover at 2-1. He had four visits from the trainer in the match, to ease cramping muscles in his back and legs.That massage must have helped him spring into the air to celebrate winning the fourth set. But the third game of the fifth set was when he won the fans.After running down Stepanek’s devilish drop shots on wooden legs, Djokovic finished an exhaustive rally with a touch volley into the open court to hold his serve. Then he danced a jig.“When he finishes his career, he can apply for another job for sure as a dancer or a singer,” said his coach, Marian Vajda. “It was the kind of emotion he needs to put out and he needs to entertain the people.”When the tie breaker began, he was ready. At 1-1, Djokovic blasted an inside-out backhand return winner to gain a minibreak and never lost his momentum. Stepanek made two straight unforced errors.“To play tie breaker in the fifth set is also kind of lottery,” Stepanek said. “I didn’t have the right ticket today for the lottery.”But there was more than luck involved for Djokovic, who defeated No. 1 Roger Federer and No. 2 Rafael Nadal to win at Montreal this month.“I would say give him still a little bit of time,” Stepanek said. “But he’s closing on them and he’s very close to catch them.”Yesterday, he answered every parry from Stepanek, leaving satisfied, if not depleted.“As much as I was running and sliding and cramping,” Djokovic said, “I still had a lot of fun.”'"

"'07-09-01,'0','“He’s not a fair-weather friend,” Jon Hanian, a spokesman for the governor, said of Mr. Otter. “This whole kind of cowboy ethos is what he’s about. He believes that when the chips are down and the going gets hard, you don’t throw somebody to the wolves.”Nonetheless, Mr. Otter faced increase speculation over whom he might appoint to fill the Craig seat if it comes open.Though there seems no doubt the choice would be a Republican, many people say that unlike in other states, where political succession can be well choreographed, it is far from sure that Mr. Otter would keep to whatever game plan state Republican Party leaders might propose.“Sometimes my read is that whatever he does, I’ll probably be surprised,” said Robert L. Geddes, the Republican president of the State Senate.Would he appoint the lieutenant governor, James E. Risch, a pragmatic conservative who deferred to Mr. Otter in the governor’s race last year but is not a close confidant? How about his friend and former colleague Representative Mike Simpson, perhaps a bit more aligned with Mr. Otter? Maybe it could be a place holder — like Dirk A. Kempthorne, the interior secretary and former Idaho governor and senator — who would allow someone else to run when Mr. Craig’s term expires in January 2009.“Part of the angst that we feel here in Idaho is wondering what he might do and how much input he might or might not solicit before he makes a decision,” said Brent Hill, a Republican state senator from Rexburg.John Foster, executive director of the Idaho Democratic Party, urged Mr. Otter to name a place holder.“That would allow the people of Idaho to choose their own representation next year, rather than some Republican operative from Washington, D.C., doing it,” Mr. Foster said. He suggested several possibilities, including Phil Batt, a former Republican governor, Cecil Andrus, a former Democratic governor, Jim McClure, a former Republican senator and Bruce Newcomb, a former speaker of the State House of Representatives, who changed his party affiliation to Republican from Democrat.“The people of Idaho have this great desire for independent folks to represent them,” Mr. Foster said. “Appointing anyone but a place holder would send the message that this incident has been turned into a political opportunity.” The governor, like several other prominent Republicans in the state, has emphasized that his friendship with Mr. Craig remains intact and expressed gratitude for his public service. But no one has gone out of the way to defend him.“I urge everyone to give our senator a fair hearing,” Mr. Otter said this week. “I know him to be an honorable man and I am confident that Larry Craig will do what is best for him, his family, and the state of Idaho.”Aides to the governor said the last comment was not meant as a nudge out the door.Mr. Risch, the lieutenant governor, said he would run for Mr. Craig’s seat should the senator retire. Some Republicans noted that if Mr. Otter appoints Mr. Risch he would remove any likelihood of being challenged by him in a re-election primary for governor and would have the chance to appoint a new lieutenant governor.Mr. Hanian, the governor’s spokesman, said reports circulating today that Mr. Otter had already promised the seat to Mr. Risch were untrue.“The governor’s made no promises to anybody about a seat that we’re still under the understanding is occupied by Senator Craig,” Mr. Hanian said.Some top Republicans say the relationship between Mr. Otter and Mr. Risch is frosty, their styles are different and that Mr. Otter would prefer someone like Mr. Simpson, a conservative from eastern Idaho with whom he served in Congress. Mr. Simpson has made nuclear energy and waste top priorities.Either Mr. Risch or Mr. Simpson would probably have strong party support if they ran for a full term in 2008. How an interim Republican senator would fare in next year’s election is open to debate.Larry LaRocco, a Democrat who has already declared his intention to run for Mr. Craig’s seat next year, said in an interview that “the mood has changed” in the state amid the fallout over Mr. Craig. He also noted that the number of Democrats in the state is growing.But Mr. LaRocco, a former congressman, lost decisively to Mr. Risch when he ran against him for lieutenant governor, and most analysts say the seat will stay Republican, though which flavor — in the short run — could be up to Mr. Otter.While the governor’s past troubles are of a very different ilk than those of the senator, and are perhaps less offensive in a state that last year passed a ban on gay marriage, several people said Mr. Otter eventually transcended them by confronting them.“The governor never denied that he did it — well, after maybe an initial bumble there,” said Stephanie Witt, director of the Public Policy Center at Boise State University. “He just said this is what happened, here’s what I did and I’m moving on. The senator is not there yet. The senator is still fighting.”'"
"'07-09-01,'0','We’d already heard about some ways the current White House flacks carefully manage coverage of presidential appearances: lighting an entire cathedral as a dramatic backdrop, forcing the photographers into positions where they can photograph the president only at flattering, power-enhancing angles and so on.Now a presidential manual for managing dissent at the president’s appearances has come to light. It reveals the meticulousness with which President Bush has been protected from hearing or seeing dissenting citizens, and more important, the ferocity with which Americans have been blocked from hearing and seeing protests in coverage of these occasions as well.Maybe it’s time for the news media to seek out the dissenters near presidential speeches as a routine part of coverage; bring those silenced words and images into the story.If the White House blocks protests with scripted signs and shouts, the press must listen more closely.While the Bush administration may be more adept and obsessive about controlling the fabric of those who attend the president’s speeches than previous administrations have been, the close to total absence of protest outside these arenas — during the run-up to the war and 2004 election — is what is far more disturbing.Most thinking Americans have been disgusted, disillusioned and outraged by this administration’s policies for a long time. That so few have actually actively expressed their protest, at the ballot box and in large scale protests like the kind that finally forced our withdrawal from Vietnam, is the real outrage.Protests are not only a right guaranteed under the Constitution (and we know too well how this administration feels about constitutional law), they are also a way to inform and educate the apathetic or uninformed about issues, minus the White House spin.'"
"'07-09-01,'0','After the behaviorists make their recommendations, Kilgore said, he can try to have those few that are suitable put up for adoption or put them down.“One of them may make a nice pet for someone that is an expert in pit bulls and knows exactly what they were doing with it,” he said while providing a tour of the kennel Thursday to a reporter and a photographer from The New York Times. “But the majority of people that want dogs like this want them for all the wrong reasons.”Kilgore, a burly man with blond hair, acknowledged that he did not feel comfortable around the dogs when they were not leashed. Most of these dogs charge the front of their cages and gnaw at the metal that surrounds them when they see or smell another dog. They are allowed out only to see a veterinarian once a week or when kennel workers clean the pens.“They can’t calm down in a kennel environment,” Kilgore said. “Their prey drive and activity level are so high that if not controlled, they can be very dangerous.”He added, “They latch on to any sound or noise.”Vick’s dogs take up the entire back section of the kennel. Most approach the front of their pens and try to lick Kilgore’s fingers, but a few hide in the back of their cages.Dog No. 43, a wiry, black pit bull, spends most of her time scampering from one end of her pen to the other. Her chest and neck are covered with scars. In the next pen, the nose of No. 30, a tan pit bull, is also marked by scars. She stands at the front of her cage, calmly peering out. But her mood changed when a photographer used a flash.“That dog will lick your fingers, but her emotions can range,” Kilgore said. “She can get very irritated.”The dog began to growl. “Now she is not happy,” Kilgore said. “She is nice, but it is all genetics, sometimes.”A few pens away, No. 41 seemed so timid that he hid in the back of his cage and ducked his head behind his hind, a sign of past abuse or socialization problems.“It’s very sad,” Kilgore said. “He is clearly not happy. We, as humans, have bred animals for our own pleasure for thousands of years. In this case, we have bred animals to fight.”[On Friday, John Goodwin, the deputy manager of the Animal Cruelty Campaign for the Humane Society of the United States, said that fighting dogs were bred to have boundless energy. When they are placed in confinement, he said, their condition rapidly deteriorates.[“They can’t burn off their excess energy in their pens, and they start to demonstrate neurotic behavior and oftentimes tear their kennel run to pieces,” Goodwin said. “They tear the fencing and destroy any blankets or toys they are given.“This is why we favor quick judgments about what will happen with seized fighting dogs.”]At night, the lights at the pound are turned off in the hope that the dogs will rest. The local authorities said they kept a close eye on the building to ward off people who might attempt to take one of the animals.The dogs have been here for three weeks. They had been at the Surry Animal Control Pound, which is less than 10 miles from Vick’s property. But that pound could house only about 15 dogs, and the Surry County animal control officer was overwhelmed, Kilgore said.“They have put on a lot of weight since they got here, and that is good,” Kilgore said. “It may be diet. Some have gained 7 pounds, some 10. We may feed them more. We have probably catered a little more to them because of where they have been and what they have been through.”'"

"'07-09-02,'0','Mr. Bush and his commanders weighed whether to reward the Sunnis with early provincial elections, restoring a degree of political power to them. But calling elections is no longer within the power of the United States, and the Shiite-dominated national government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has long opposed empowering the Sunnis.They also discussed ways to pressure Mr. Maliki’s government to provide millions of dollars in Iraqi funds — much of it oil money — to reconstruction of Anbar’s schools and health care centers and the reopening of state-run factories.“This is all about finding ways to circumvent Maliki,” said one senior official who is involved in preparing Mr. Bush’s presentation of a new strategy, which will probably come in an address to the country after General Petraeus and the American ambassador to Iraq, Ryan C. Crocker, have presented their report to Congress starting on Sept. 10. “We can’t go to the Hill again and say Maliki will perform if we just give him the space. He won’t. So you find other means to accomplish the goal.”But circumventing a central government that the United States itself set up is unlikely to prove easy. In the end, it is the new Iraqi government that has control of the country’s treasury, and determining when to hold elections around the country is a subject the Iraqi Parliament has not been able to agree upon.“There is an effort to accelerate the bottom-up reconciliation,” said one Defense Department official who declined to speak on the record. “The idea is to capitalize on the unexpected progress made at the provincial level through the Sunni awakening and efforts to work with former insurgents. We are increasing Iraqi and American money being invested in the provinces.”The money would come, the official said, by spending State Department funds through provincial reconstruction teams, which are finally being deployed in significant numbers. Some would come from American military commanders, who have emergency funds at their disposal, and some from a Department of Defense program to generate jobs by revitalizing state-owned industries — a reversal of the privatization effort begun by American forces four years ago.The reduction in attacks on Americans in Anbar, according to current and recently departed officials, has fueled a new optimism in the White House that Republican defections from Mr. Bush’s overall Iraq policy will be limited, and that Democrats will once again find themselves unable to assemble the votes to cut off financing or force an early withdrawal of troops.But Mr. Bush’s argument that Anbar is a locus of progress has drawn fire from Democrats and critics of his war strategy, who say that he is picking out a single tactical accomplishment and ignoring broader strategic failures that have been documented by the intelligence community, the Government Accountability Office and an independent commission examining the Iraqi military and police.The president is expected to argue that what has happened in Anbar is beginning to be replicated in Diyala Province and other places, and that to pull back now — and fail to reward the Sunnis in Anbar — would halt the first significant gains that American forces had made against the insurgency in four years.Officials were cautious about discussing Friday’s Pentagon meeting. Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney were said to have used it to hear a variety of viewpoints, officials said, including lengthy descriptions from the Joint Chiefs about how the increase in forces is unsustainable beyond spring without extending the tours of forces already in Iraq. Several aides to Mr. Bush have said in recent weeks that such extensions are so politically unpalatable that they are not under consideration unless an emergency breaks out requiring the use of American forces elsewhere in the world.But Mr. Bush, they said, is also unlikely to wait until April to begin the drawdown. If he does so, he would have to pull troops out at the same pace at which he sent them this year, about a brigade a month, the officials said.By beginning a drawdown slightly earlier, the officials say, Mr. Bush would both maximize his flexibility and avoid having to stick to a strict timeline for withdrawal, which the president has said in the past would signal to enemy forces exactly when and how quickly American forces would begin to leave.'"
"'07-09-02,'0','A separate online Library of National Intelligence is to include all official intelligence reports sent out by each agency, offering Amazon.com-style suggestions: if you liked that piece on Venezuela’s oil reserves, how about this one on Russia’s? And blogs, accessible only to other spies, are proliferating behind the security fences.“We see the Internet passing us in the fast lane,” said Mike Wertheimer, of the office of the Director of National Intelligence, who is overseeing the introduction of A-Space. “We’re playing a little catch-up.”It remains to be seen, however, whether technology alone can bring to secretive bureaucracies the connectedness that comes naturally to cybersurfers in the outside world.Skeptics say turf — the curse of the spy world — might keep analysts from using the tools. Mr. Wertheimer acknowledges that some managers discourage their people from adding to the Web encyclopedia, fearing that their agencies will lose credit for scoops.And for the intelligence world, putting the Web tools to work requires a cultural revolution. “Need to know” has long been the agencies’ mantra. The juiciest stuff is still called S.C.I., or Sensitive Compartmented Information, and walling off data offers protection against leaks and moles, or so the theory goes.But the Sept. 11 attacks revealed how hoarding information could lead to catastrophe. In a report released last month, the Central Intelligence Agency’s inspector general described a dysfunctional spy family, in which the National Security Agency refused to share intercepts from Al Qaeda with the C.I.A., and the C.I.A., in turn, withheld information from the F.B.I. More than 50 C.I.A. officers read cables in early 2000 about two future hijackers but failed to ask the State Department to put them on a watch list, the report said.To prevent such blunders, Congress created the post of director of national intelligence in late 2004 with orders to rope the 16 spy agencies into a single enterprise. The National Counterterrorism Center serves as a hub for threat information. There are plans to train analysts from different agencies together.And now there are high hopes that a virtual community, linking all of the 100,000 employees of the intelligence world, could help make information-sharing as automatic for spies as it is for middle school students. Agency officials will discuss the new Web tools with private-sector gurus this week at an open meeting in Chicago.Intelligence veterans and experts generally applaud the new technology, but some warn that it is no panacea.Amy Zegart, associate professor of public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of “Spying Blind: The C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the Origins of 9/11,” identified 23 moments when the C.I.A. or F.B.I. might have stopped the plot. But she said she saw “almost zero chance” that the Web would have made a difference, because intelligence officers didn’t recognize the significance of the information they had.“I think we overemphasize what technology can do,” Ms. Zegart said. “The most important fusion takes place inside people’s brains.”When Mark M. Lowenthal became the C.I.A.’s assistant director for analysis and production in 2002, he set out to survey the reports the agency was writing — and found that security barriers, clumsy technology and overwhelming volume made the task difficult.“If A-Space and Intellipedia make it easier for analysts and managers to know what’s being produced across the board, that will be a great thing,” said Mr. Lowenthal, who left the agency in 2005. But he said he had doubts. “My concern about blogs and wikis is the confusion of opinion with expertise,” he said. “Intelligence is expertise.”Whether A-Space will permit analysts to create personal pages viewable by others remains to be decided; managers are as wary of preening and time-wasting on the Web as parents. But its creators say A-Space will incorporate both secret and unclassified e-mail and chat functions, permit collective editing of documents and allow analysts to type in a name and instantly discover what far-flung agencies have dug up on it.A Somalia specialist, for instance, will be able to link up with counterparts in other agencies, post to blogs on East Africa and get an alert when the Intellipedia page on Mogadishu is changed.Aware that such a system could be vulnerable to a mole, officials say computers will flag users who download masses of data or repeatedly seek information outside their work area, just as credit card companies scan transactions for patterns indicating fraud.But some old-timers still fear that the spy Web could give away the nation’s secrets to hackers and turncoats.Chris Rasmussen, an analyst turned “knowledge manager” at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and an evangelist for the new tools, has been called a “traitor” and compared to the C.I.A. supermole Aldrich Ames in comments left on his internal blog, he said in a talk in May.But Mr. Rasmussen, 32, who like half of all intelligence officers was hired within the last five years, is undeterred. To combat turf consciousness, he and about 30 like-minded intelligence officers patrol Intellipedia to remove agency names that are used to label content.Mr. Wertheimer, who spent 20 years as a code-breaking N.S.A. mathematician, said he was aware of the obstacles but saw encouraging signs. When a crisis breaks, he said, and an article goes up on Intellipedia, “within a few hours we’ve got all 16 agencies contributing.”'"
"'07-09-02,'0','The police say the goal of any vice squad is to protect the public — perhaps a young boy using that Minneapolis bathroom — and also the suspects, who are easy prey for extortion, assault, even murder, and unlikely to report crimes against themselves.And the standard for the legal defense of entrapment is high. Even if the undercover officer had solicited and enticed Mr. Craig, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of disorderly conduct but last week insisted he was innocent, an entrapment defense would have been a very cloudy matter, legal experts said. (In an audio tape made after the arrest, Mr. Craig had raised that possibility to the officer: “You’re out to enforce the law,” he said. “But you shouldn’t be out to entrap people, either.”)In entrapment cases, the evidence may need to be collected from a state of mind: When did the suspect decide to commit the crime? When the police offered him the opportunity? Was it because an opportunity was presented, or was he planning on illegal activity anyway?In New York, the City Council is considering an anti-voyeurism bill, expanding a state law that bans peeping with cameras also to ban peeping in person; say, someone looking up a woman’s skirt while standing in a subway stairwell.Talk about murky: when is a leer too long and an ogle illegal? What is the legal standard on staring?The United States is one of the few countries where entrapment is a legal defense. In a significant case on entrapment, Jacobson v. United States, in 1992, the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Nebraska farmer arrested for buying child pornography sent to him in the mail by undercover agents.When he was arrested, the farmer, whom inspectors had targeted for two years before the arrest with dozens of mailings inviting him to buy pornography, had none in his house, other than the two magazines he had bought from the undercover inspectors, the ruling said.The court said the case was clear: the government made him do it.'"

LOUISE KRAMERA PRETTY PENSION A. G. Lafley, the chief executive of Procter & Gamble, may have earned three times as much as any other P.& G. executive last year, but it’s hard to imagine how he could ever collect a pension like James M. Kilts’s.Mr. Kilts, the former chief executive of Gillette who retired as P.& G.’s vice chairman on Oct. 1, has been drawing retirement pay of $110,000 a month since then. (Mr. Kilts is on the board of The New York Times Company.)According to a proxy statement the company sent to shareholders last week, none of the five highest-paid P.& G. executives have been promised a pension. Last year, Mr. Lafley, who is 60, had a pay package worth more than $27 million, the proxy shows. The next-highest amount went to Mr. Kilts, whose pay in the three months before he retired was valued at almost $9 million.

"'07-09-02,'0','Vanguard, the mutual fund group, says that only about 11 percent of the typical 401(k) retirement plan is invested in international equities. Ellen Rinaldi, principal for investment counseling and research at Vanguard in Malvern, Pa., cautions that investors should not make rash moves just because of domestic market volatility, but adds that it makes sense for average investors to have 20 percent of their holdings in non-American stock funds.“Moving to 20 percent would be a significant increase and a good diversification,” Ms. Rinaldi says.But it does not make sense, in her view, for investors to go beyond about 30 percent. “As you move up, and if you go over 30 percent, you’re taking on additional risk and expense, so you’re not getting as much diversification benefit,” she says. Her firm offers a variety of international mutual funds like Total International, Pacific, Emerging Markets and Developed Markets. Emerging markets have traditionally been viewed as the riskiest in the world, but over the past several years, they have attracted a flood of capital and have performed strongly. “These aren’t your father’s emerging markets,” says Arthur P. Steinmetz, who manages $20 billion in assets at OppenheimerFunds, $5 billion of which is invested in emerging markets.Mr. Steinmetz, based in New York, says that most emerging markets are far more sophisticated and stable than they were 10 years ago, when the Asian financial crisis hit. He notes that Brazil, for example, has $160 billion in foreign exchange reserves and that its foreign debt, once an issue of concern, has shrunk dramatically. It is much better able to withstand volatility. “The sandbags that Brazil has around it against global flooding are much higher than they used to be,” he says.Although Mr. Steinmetz says that now is a good time to buy emerging-market equities, Antoine van Agtmael, head of Emerging Markets Management in Arlington, Va., says that recent run-ups in their share prices mean that investors should wait.“Emerging markets are fully priced,” says Mr. van Agtmael, whose firm manages a family of funds with more than $20 billion in emerging-market investments. “You don’t want to go into these markets after they’ve had a big run.”He says he is convinced that emerging markets are a good bet over the next five years, just not in coming months.Although Mr. Steinmetz and Mr. van Agtmael may differ over timing, they share the view that further expected declines in the value of the dollar and other macroeconomic adjustments needed to reduce American borrowing in the world make investing in foreign securities increasingly important. “I would argue that having exposure to international securities denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar is a useful hedge,” Mr. Steinmetz says. “Investors will have an asset that is appreciating,” he said, even if the value of United States-based assets declines.Mr. van Agtmael, the author of “The Emerging Markets Century,” is credited with coining the term “emerging markets” in the early 1980s. He argues that structural changes in emerging markets mean that they are stable enough for average American investors.One such change is the investment opportunity offered by big infrastructure projects. “Emerging markets now invest more in infrastructure than the United States,” he says, citing the recent steam-pipe explosion in Manhattan and the bridge collapse in Minneapolis. “That was not true just a couple of years ago. Their investments are going up at a rate of about 20 percent while ours has been growing at about 5 to 6 percent.”Although the American market is traditionally regarded as being so vast and deep that it is more stable than emerging countries’ markets, those countries have made big strides in managing their foreign exchange reserves, current account deficits and currency positions. “They’ve learned their lessons,” Mr. van Agtmael says. “Their economic policies have become a lot sounder than they were before and they have a hell of a lot more money.”Mr. van Agtmael is clearly more aggressive about emerging markets than many other investment professionals and argues that if emerging markets represent 23 percent of the world economy, investors should have at least 20 percent of their portfolios in these markets. “That’s neutral,” he says.And he has profited from his convictions: his fund has gained more than 30 percent in value over each of the past three years.PATRICK DORSEY, the director of equity research at Morningstar in Chicago, which rates mutual funds, says there is no one international investment percentage that all investors should embrace. “It depends on age, risk tolerance and a whole list of factors,” Mr. Dorsey says.But he agrees with money managers that Americans are “overinvested” in their home market. “It’s a familiarity bias,” he says. “But it may very well be that our home market is the riskiest. It’s a mistake for investors to always think that foreign investments are always riskier.”'"

"'07-09-02,'0','“Traffic? Tell Them About It” (Aug. 26) reminded me how grateful I am now that I am a convert to traffic news.I go back and forth from New York City to the Hamptons almost every week. In the past, I thought it was fairly futile to listen to stories of accidents, closed lanes or other reasons to avoid a particular route. Now I listen to “traffic on the ones” from 1010 WINS on the radio. I watch Joe Nolan on WABC-TV, but by the time I hit the road the information is already stale.I recently tried to get emergency alert signage placed in public places to notify us when a disaster strikes. Public officials still are woefully behind in implementing that service. They expect us to look like the poor lost souls in the horror films of our past, waiting for word of mouth to explain Godzilla’s whereabouts. A one-hour wait on the Cross Bronx Expressway or the Long Island Expressway can be almost as monstrous.Until we get better signage, turn on the radio and take those service roads.I recently returned from a comprehensive treatment program for New York metro area traffic malaise — namely, a six-month stay in the Poncey-Highland and Buckhead sections of Atlanta. In that city, traffic around the clock is just like Route 17 in Paramus during the holidays.For various reasons, every other Northeasterner I met there would return here immediately if the opportunity arose. As for our traffic, it will be years, if ever, before I complain about it again.“Better Late Than Never: A Bit Extra for State Tourism Ads” (July 15) highlighted the funding challenges that Connecticut’s tourism regions face in these times of economic uncertainty. Given the cyclical nature of advertising and the currently unpredictable nature of funding, it seems the time is right to start tying funding to performance.Our current marketing plan of focusing our marketing dollars on women ages 35-54 with household incomes of more than $80,000 in the New York metropolitan area, providing timely responses to requests for information with appealing marketing materials and investing in the research to be certain that the plan continues to be on course, is yielding excellent results.Unfortunately, the ambiguity of our funding this year resulted in missed opportunities to position the greater New Haven region for a spectacular fall tourism season. While we are incredibly grateful for the continued support of the governor and the Connecticut Legislature, it would be far more effective to link our funding directly to the travel and tourism industry.Connecticut should reinstate the intercept funding used by other states and municipalities who allocate tax dollars to their convention and visitor bureaus based on the generation of hotel tax dollars. This direct correlation between room nights and financial resources would provide accountability and reward for performance — and would eliminate the hardship created by having lapses in funding.The writer is chairman, South Central Regional Division, Greater New Haven Convention and Visitors Bureau.'"
"'07-09-02,'0','NICHOLAS J. BIANCO has a strong sense of place, having sampled many local landscapes and ending up comfortably in a town where he can often breathe country air. The son of Italian immigrants, he grew up in the 1950s in the jostling streets of the Bronx, and, after marrying, warily walked a cop’s beat in his next home, Yonkers.For the past 35 years, he has watched Yorktown peel off its lingering pretensions of butter churns and blacksmiths and slip on the trappings of a standard-issue suburb — shopping centers and subdivisions included.The United States Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that a government could use eminent domain to seize private property for economic development, including commercial uses like malls. (Some of the property for the new headquarters of The New York Times was acquired through eminent domain.) Mr. Bianco felt the ruling was wrong, even un-American, violating the near-sanctity of a place of one’s own. So did fellow townsfolk who asked him, as a member of the Town Council: “Will you ever do that?”“Not on my watch,” he promised.Last January, he went further and engineered passage of a law barring the town from condemning private property for commercial purposes, while allowing it for traditional public uses, like the building of roads, sewers and schools. A vague declaration that a neighborhood is blighted or dangling a promise of jobs and taxes could not be used to expropriate a home or shop for a developer’s benefit.“It’s not the government’s right to say that you’ve got to move, you, a person who lived here and paid taxes here,” Mr. Bianco, 63, said in a Panera Bread store. “My belief is the individual is just as important as the mass. That’s our Constitution. Every citizen is important.”'"
"'07-09-02,'0','It might seem a strange thing to say about a writer who has spent so much of his working life producing children’s books — more than 60, at last count — but simplicity doesn’t come naturally to Russell Hoban. In his adult novels, of which the 1980 “Riddley Walker” is the best known, Hoban’s default setting is head-splitting complexity: the plotting tends to be fiendishly elaborate, the language dense and punny, the relationship between fiction and reality intricately vexed.On the face of it, the ingenious “Linger Awhile,” his latest book for grown-ups, is fairly typical of the odd concoctions Hoban likes to cook up in his laboratory: a brief, fanciful narrative about reanimating a dead B-movie Western starlet from the “visual DNA” of a black-and-white videotape, by means of a chemical process the novel’s very mad scientist refers to as a “suspension of disbelief.” This sounds like the sort of thing the French call a jeu d’esprit, and the English call too clever by half — a charge that would certainly stick to a good deal of Hoban’s fiction. Not this one, though. “Linger Awhile” is a friendly, shaggy little thing, eager to please and only a tad smarter than it has to be. It’s too clever by 10, 15 percent, tops.Hoban is 82, and this is distinctly an old man’s book: cranky, wistful, riddled with mortality. What sets in motion all the monkey business about reanimation is the erotic obsession of an 83-year-old London widower named Irving Goodman with one Justine Trimble, the female lead in an undistinguished ’50s oater called “Last Stage to El Paso.” Irving, in the throes of an “end of life” crisis, brings his well-worn videocassette to Istvan Fallok, proprietor and presiding genius of a somewhat dubious Soho tech outfit known as Hermes Soundways. Fallok, a sexagenarian, falls hard for the svelte cowgirl too, and after restoring her to the land of the (barely) living decides to keep her for himself.Once Justine has been resurrected — it happens gratifyingly quickly — the novel settles into a relaxed, old-pro routine of genre parody, light irony and gentle philosophizing: nothing too taxing for an aging fabulist and his aging characters. The story starts out as “Frankenstein,” then turns unexpectedly into something more like “Dracula,” thanks to Hoban’s best joke: for Justine to live in full color, rather than in the unnerving black-and-white in which she has emerged from Fallok’s “primordial soup,” she needs blood and plenty of it. And lots of sex, which delights her admirers (until it exhausts them). Jealousy poisons the atmosphere, and things get uncomfortable when Justine’s nocturnal blood-hunts attract the attention of the police, but for the most part the eccentric senior citizens of “Linger Awhile” seem energized by their sci-fi experiment in nostalgia, happy to trade in their tattered-coat-upon-a-stickness for a lustier, more colorful, wider-screened sort of existence. Whatever is clapping its hands and singing here, it’s probably not the soul.The creature’s charms aren’t lost on the middle-aged either: she has a third passionate fan in Chauncey Lim, a 40-ish purveyor of “optical novelties.” Age notwithstanding, none of these men seem interested in sailing to Byzantium anyway: Justine’s got them all on the last stage to someplace wilder and scarier, where Yeats’s “monuments of unaging intellect” are thoroughly beside the point. This is, in a peculiar way, a fortunate development in Hoban’s fiction, which has in the past sometimes lusted too strenuously for intellectual significance of the monumental, unaging sort. “Linger Awhile” is, for example, enormously more readable — and more affecting — than the novel in which, 20 years ago, Hoban introduced Istvan Fallok, the gnomic, grimly frolicsome “Medusa Frequency.” That book labors mightily to retell the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, and the strain shows: the wit is arch, donnish, and the deep thoughts about art and life are pretty consistently gaseous. (The fact that most of these fetid pensées spring from a disembodied head of Orpheus, conjured by Fallok and often taking the form of a cabbage or a soccer ball, doesn’t even begin to excuse them.) The pop-culture mythology of “Linger Awhile” has the welcome effect of tamping down Hoban’s instinct for profundity. But it gives him room to show off his true gift for dark farce, with just a spritz of music-hall metaphysics. The pleasantly cheesy Borges-on-Viagra tone suits Hoban’s peculiar talent well.Artists, like the rest of us, think of old age as an inconvenience, an infirmity, a curse. With novelists, the books tend to get shorter, terser, bolder (or should it be balder?); the writer’s energy isn’t what it used to be, so he cuts to the chase. That last stage runs a fast, direct route through some perilous territory. But age clearly has its benefits for a writer like Hoban, who, in times of greater stamina, displayed a penchant for wandering off course and leaving himself (and his readers) stranded in a lush, obscure semantic wilderness. In one of this book’s most apparently inexplicable turns, Irving Goodman, after losing interest in Justine, begins to have dreams about William Bligh, the infamous captain of the Bounty. The old man finds himself admiring the determination — “plus his practical knowledge and his seamanship” — that enabled Bligh to guide his men to land in a small boat through treacherous waters.'"
"'07-09-02,'0','ON July 20, 2005, he received an e-mail message from his broker at a small regional firm, with the following header: “Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund will accept smaller investments this month on a limited basis.” Noting that the fund was temporarily reopening on Aug. 1, 2005, the message said that for investors who “do not have $1,000,000 to invest, the fund will accept a limited number of clients this month for 500k and perhaps 250k.”The message went on to note the fund’s stellar performance: up a cumulative 29.4 percent since its October 2003 inception, and no down months.Mr. Greene, a former engineer, said he invested in several hedge funds in recent years, aiming to preserve his principal. Most of the funds have worked out well, he said, producing slightly better-than-market returns with little volatility. He estimated that he has $600,000 to $800,000 invested in hedge funds.He invested in the Bear Stearns fund in October 2005, and he said the fund appealed to him because its returns of about 1 percent a month did not seem to fall into the too-good-to-be-true category.Mr. Sherman, the Bear Stearns spokesman, said the fund’s general partner was allowed to waive the $1 million investment minimum and that any investor in the fund had to have at least $5 million in liquid, investable assets.“Everything went fine until last June,” Mr. Greene said; that was when he learned from his broker that the funds were having difficulties. “I asked him how they could be in trouble if they were high-grade securities. He said they were bundled high grade but not really high grade. If you’re going to be dealing with a high-grade securities dealer, I didn’t understand how that was an excuse of any kind.”Mr. Greene said officials at Bear Stearns Asset Management conducted monthly conference calls with investors, discussing the funds’ performance.For example, according to notes taken by another investor during some of these calls, Ralph R. Cioffi, senior portfolio manager for the fund and an executive at Bear Stearns Asset Management, predicted on Jan. 18, 2007, that fund investors would benefit from a negative bet that he had recently placed on subprime mortgages. Mr. Cioffi also said the fund had plenty of cash to take advantage of market dislocations, according to the investor, and that the team of people monitoring the securities in the fund had increased to 11.The next month, according to the investor, Mr. Cioffi told conference-call participants that the fund had little exposure to subprime mortgages. And in April, Mr. Cioffi told investors that even though returns were down, the fund had not been forced to sell securities. Acknowledging that investors had been frightened by unusually high delinquencies on loans made in 2006, Mr. Cioffi said fund investors would be safer at Bear Stearns because it did its own due diligence and did not rely solely on ratings agencies, the investor said.In June, the wheels came off the Bear Stearns hedge funds. Mr. Greene said that as soon as he learned that his fund was in trouble, he submitted a redemption request to Bear Stearns, through his broker. “We had all kinds of trouble getting them to admit they had received it,” he said. He never got any of his money out.In mid-July, Bear Stearns told investors that the funds, once worth $1.5 billion, had lost almost all their value. By the end of June, the firm said, the fund Mr. Greene had held was down 91 percent.“In light of these returns, we will seek an orderly wind-down of the funds over time,” Bear Stearns told its clients in a letter. Obviously, the lawsuits over this debacle are only just beginning for Bear Stearns. One of Mr. Greene’s lawyers, Jacob H. Zamansky, said he and his co-counsel have been contacted by fund investors from around the world. All tell the same story, Mr. Zamansky said.“We believe that Bear Stearns misrepresented the risk to investors in the hedge fund, misrepresented the extent of risk controls that were in place to cut losses and misrepresented performance on conference calls to avoid a run on the bank,” he said.Mr. Sherman, the spokesman, said that “the allegations are unjustified and without merit.”“The accredited, high-net-worth investors in the fund,” he added, “were made very aware that this was a high-risk speculative investment vehicle.”Of course, it will be up to the securities arbitrators to judge whether investors in the funds were misled about their risks. But these cases may also help regulators understand the degree to which retail investors have bought into hedge funds.Back in 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission conducted a study on hedge funds and determined that their investors were mostly institutions. But the study also warned that the types of hedge fund investors appeared to be changing. “Although we did not observe an existing retail market for hedge funds,” the study said, “the potential for that market is clearly at hand.”The study was right. Four years later, that potential may have become a reality.'"
"'07-09-02,'0','When Tom Glavine gained the 300th victory of his career recently, it was widely speculated that he could be the last 300-game winner because pitchers these days have fewer chances to win games. But the Elias Sports Bureau found that not to be so. The percentage of wins by starters, Elias determined, has not changed appreciably, if at all, in the last 25 years.This season, starters have gained 70 percent of the victories. Five years ago and 10 years ago, starters had 70 percent of the victories. Continuing in five-year increments, it was 69 percent in 1992 and 1987. In 1982, it was 70 percent.In other words, pitchers today may be throwing fewer pitches and lasting fewer innings than their predecessors, but they are still receiving credit for the same share of victories.The question, then, is why are pitchers suddenly unable to win 20 games? Last season, Johan Santana and Chien-Ming Wang led the majors with 19 victories each. Six pitchers led the National League with 16, the lowest league-leading total ever.Santana seemed certain to win 20 after gaining his 18th win Sept. 10. He had a possible four starts left, but after he won only one of the first three, Manager Ron Gardenhire saved him for the playoff opener rather than have him pitch on the final day of the season.Yesterday began with 21 pitchers at 14, 15 or 16 victories, and the calendar allowing another six starts for each.Four of the pitchers had 16 victories: Tim Wakefield and Josh Beckett (Red Sox), John Lackey (Angels) and Wang (Yankees). Four had 15: Tim Hudson (Braves), Jake Peavy (Padres), Kelvim Escobar (Angels) and C. C. Sabathia (Indians).Thirteen pitchers had 14 wins. Jeff Francis (Rockies), Roy Oswalt (Astros) and Aaron Harang (Reds) joined that group Wednesday, which they needed to do to stay mathematically alive for 20. Santana (Twins), Roy Halladay (Blue Jays), Noah Lowry (Giants), Brad Penny (Dodgers) and Carlos Zambrano (Cubs) did not win that day, meaning they will have to win the rest of their starts to become 20-game winners.On consecutive nights last week, two starting pitchers, Ervin Santana (Angels) and Andrew Miller (Tigers), failed to get out of the first inning. They brought to 19, Elias said, the number of starting pitchers who had failed to complete one inning this season.Santana recorded one out and Miller two, but last night at Florida, J. D. Durbin (Phillies) topped them. He became the sixth starter this season who did not record an out.Durbin faced seven Marlins batters, and all seven scored after five got hits, one walked and one was hit with a pitch. Durbin, a 25-year-old right-hander, departed after throwing only 19 pitches.Two of the other five no-out starters, Jeff Karstens and Darrell Rasner, both of the Yankees, were knocked out of their starts by batted balls. Karstens (six pitches) sustained a broken leg, Rasner (nine pitches) a broken finger.Kyle Davies (then with the Braves) faced five batters, throwing 22 pitches; Nate Robertson (Tigers) lasted six batters (30 pitches); and Kirk Saarloos (Reds) left after seven batters (38 pitches).Plácido Polanco stroked three hits in each of Detroit’s first two games and hasn’t stopped hitting. But then, Polanco never stops hitting.A good hitter who is also a good fielder, Polanco was batting .340, fourth best in the major leagues, through Friday. Entering the weekend, he was the toughest batter to strike out, doing so once every 21.9 plate appearances.Even more impressive numbers were 155 (games) and 766 (fielding chances). That’s how long Polanco, a second baseman, had played without committing an error, both major league records, through Friday. He made his last error July 1, 2006.“His range is solid, not spectacular,” said David Dombrowski, the Tigers’ general manager. “He catches everything he gets to, he turns double plays well and he goes back on pop-ups well.”But Polanco’s flawless fielding is almost taken for granted; it’s his hitting that commands attention.“He is just a good hitter,” Dombrowski said. “He has a nice short stroke, makes contact, puts the ball in play. He takes what the pitcher gives him and uses the whole field. He’s not a guy who tries to do more than he’s capable of doing. He’s not a home run hitter; he doesn’t try to be a home run hitter. But he does hit the ball out of the park sometimes. He knows his limitations and handles them well.”The Tigers acquired Polanco from the Phillies in June 2005 for reliever Ugueth Urbina.“We wanted to upgrade ourselves at second base; the Phillies were interested in Urbina,” Dombrowski said. “We had depth in the bullpen; they had Utley at second and Polanco wasn’t playing for them. Two of our scouts recommended him and said he would help our ball club.”Polanco has helped the Tigers, and an official scoring change helped Polanco. In a game Aug. 24, he was initially charged with a throwing error, but the scorer, after talking to the umpire, changed it to an error on first baseman Marcus Thames.Jimmy Rollins, the Phillies’ shortstop, deserves some kind of honor.Even before spring training, Rollins put his neck on the chopping block, declaring unabashedly that the Phillies were the team to beat this year.Although they are finally contending for the National League East title, courtesy of the Mets’ generosity, the Phillies haven’t lived up to Rollins’s boast, but he gets no blame. He hasn’t let the team’s lack of cooperation undermine his performance.A .274 career hitter, Rollins has batted just under .300 most of the season and has produced numerous key hits.He was instrumental in the Phillies’ stunning four-game sweep of the Mets last week. On Monday, he led off the third inning with a single and scored on a home run, then singled with one out in the sixth and scored another run.In the second game, with the Mets leading, 2-0, Rollins led off the eighth inning with a home run, starting the Phillies on their way to a 10-inning victory. The next night, his leadoff homer in the first inning tied the score, and his fifth-inning single contributed to what turned out to be the decisive run.Then in the final game of the series, Rollins opened the first inning with a double, his first of three hits, and scored the first run of what would become an 11-10 series-sweeping victory.After 16 successive starts in which they didn’t win once, the Milwaukee Brewers removed Chris Capuano from the starting rotation and relocated him in the bullpen. They had no interest in seeing if Capuano could match the dubious achievement of Jack Nabors.In 1916, according to Elias, Nabors made 17 consecutive starts for the Philadelphia Athletics without him or them winning. Nabors’s inability to win something he started isn’t the worst case of pitching futility. In 1912, Walt Dickson made 18 consecutive starts that the Boston Braves lost.Capuano, who last won May 7 and whose winless streak symbolizes the Brewers’ collapse, may still get a chance to extend his streak, but for now he is a relief pitcher. That doesn’t mean he has been able to escape losing. In his first two relief appearances, he was the losing pitcher, meaning the Brewers had lost 18 consecutive games in which he had pitched.'"

"'07-09-03,'0','“About 10 days before the New Hampshire primary in 1992, I was dropping like a rock in the polls,” he said to chuckles and applause from the crowd of several thousand. “I was proclaimed dead by everyone who could measure a pulse. My internment services were being planned all over America.” Ultimately he delivered the key memory, recalling a Portsmouth photo and painting of him walking the winter streets to mount his comeback. “It symbolizes the never-say-die attitude that’s best about America,” he said.He is pithy and self-deprecating about his bona fides. “I have a pretty unique perceptive about what the challenges of the job are,” he said here and at a rally earlier Sunday in Concord. He is also more selfless than he was in Iowa in July, where he sometimes mentioned the 22 million new jobs created during his administration; he now barely mentions his track record, focusing mostly on hers.His endorsement is both explicit and rhetorically dramatic. “I will be a voter 40 years next year – Oooo, I hate that,” he said in Portsmouth. In all that time, he continued, Mrs. Clinton was “the best prepared, most qualified” non-incumbent candidate for the presidency that he had ever had the chance to vote for.The inner wonk blessedly stays buried for this speech – he keeps the dry policy to under a minute. At the same time, though, he speaks mostly in boilerplate language that leaves audiences still.“She has been working on education for more than 25 years, she has a very good program on that,” he said in Portsmouth. “She has a real understanding of what it would take to withdraw from Iraq.”The former president barely dwells on her years as first lady, when she was an appendage of his; instead he sizes her up on her own two feet, focusing on the Senate years and her intellect. He said in Iowa in July that she had “the best combination of mind and heart” he has ever seen; in New Hampshire on Sunday, he linked her abilities with her agenda, saying “she has the best plan to give us a clean green energy future to create jobs, not cost jobs.”Mr. Clinton devotes a full minute, and sounds particularly emphatic, on the next bit – asserting that other nations and world leaders are pulling for Mrs. Clinton’s ascension in 2008. The world leaders are not named (presidential discretion, apparently) but seem to be from all over – Asia, Africa, some in Europe, Mr. Clinton has said. On Sunday he took it one step further and roped in voters across Europe and Canada as well, citing a new poll that found Mrs. Clinton running stronger than the other American presidential candidates in those countries.“You want to fix America’s position in the world overnight? Elect Hillary president,” he said here.It is also Mr. Clinton’s job to try to knock down the doubts about Mrs. Clinton’s electability in a national race, should she be the Democratic nominee. Mr. Clinton usually tries to sound neutral, noting that in her Senate re-election race in 2006, Mrs. Clinton carried dozens of New York State counties that President Bush had won. Yet after delivering these statistics in Portsmouth, Mr. Clinton had a testier moment as well.“This electability thing is a canard, it doesn’t amount to a hill of beans,” he told the crowd. “What you need to figure out is, who would be the best president.”There is, it seems, not enough time for juicy secrets (if only!) or tales of Chelsea (thus far). As for raw emotion, it usually comes with the closing anecdote: Mr. Clinton invariably chokes up, tears up, or bites his lower lip as he recalls a New York firefighter’s praise of Mrs. Clinton’s work on 9/11 issues and the firefighter’s conviction that she cared deeply about regular people.Now, the timing of the anecdote is a little fuzzy. Mr. Clinton first told the story during the Iowa trip in early July; on Sunday, he said he spoke to the firefighter “a few weeks ago” (as he put it in Concord) and “the other day” (as he put it in Portsmouth). Picky, picky, perhaps, but for a reporter who has heard the anecdote about eight times, precise consistency starts to matter.What really matters, of course, is whether the Clintons can convince the firefighter to debut on the campaign trail at some point and hail Mrs. Clinton. She is indeed popular with New York firefighters, but one from the days after 9/11 would prove especially powerful. For now, though, she has Mr. Clinton’s testimonial – and that’s definitely not half bad.'"

"'07-09-03,'0','“From a developmental point of view, we simply don’t know how accurately we can diagnose bipolar disorder, or whether those diagnosed at age 5 or 6 or 7 will grow up to be adults with the illness,” he said. “The label may or may not reflect reality.”Most children who qualify for the diagnosis do not go on to develop the classic features of adult bipolar disorder, like mania, researchers have found. They are far more likely to become depressed.But Dr. Mani Pavuluri, director of the pediatric mood disorders program at the University of Illinois, Chicago, said that label is often better than any of the other diagnoses that difficult children often receive. “These are kids that have rage, anger, bubbling emotions that are just intolerable for them, and it is good that this is finally being recognized as part of a single disorder,” to better tailor treatment, she said.In the study, researchers from New York, Maryland and Madrid analyzed data from a National Center for Health Statistics survey of office visits, which focused on doctors in private or group practices. The researchers calculated the number of visits in which doctors recorded a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and found that the numbers went up from roughly 20,000 such diagnoses in 1994 to about 800,000 in 2003“I have been studying trends in mental health services for some time, and this finding really stands out as one of the most striking increases in this short a time,” said Dr. Mark Olfson of the New York State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia University, the senior author of the study, which appears in the September issue of Archives of General Psychiatry, which is to be published Tuesday.The increase makes bipolar disorder more common among children than clincial depression, the authors said. The study found that psychiatrists made almost 90 percent of the diagnoses, and that two-thirds of the young patients were boys. About half the patients also had been identified as having other mental difficulties, most often attention-deficit disorder.The treatment given the children almost always included medication. About half received antipsychotic drugs, like Risperdal from Janssen or Seroquel from Astrazeneca, both developed to treat schizophrenia; a third were prescribed so-called mood stabilizers, most often the epilepsy drug Depakote; and antidepressants and stimulants were also common. Most children were on some combination of two or more drugs, and about four in 10 received some psychotherapy.Their regimens were very similar to those of a group of adults with bipolar diagnoses, the study found. “You get the sense looking at the data that doctors are generalizing from the adult literature and applying the same principles to children,” Dr. Olfson said.The rise in bipolar diagnoses in children reflects several factors, experts say. Bipolar symptoms do appear earlier in life than previously thought, in teenagers and young children who later develop the full-blown disorder, recent studies suggest. The label also gives doctors and desperate parents a quick way to try to manage children’s rages and outbursts, in an era when long-term psychotherapy and hospital care are less accessible, they say.In addition, in recent years drug makers and company-sponsored psychiatrists have been encouraging doctors look for the disorder, ever since several drugs were approved to treat the disorder in adults. Last month the Food and Drug Administration approved one of these medications, Risperdal, to treat bipolar in children — which many experts say they expect will escalate the use of Risperdal and similar drugs in young people.“We are just inundated with stuff from drug companies, publications, throwaways, that tell us six ways from Sunday that, ‘Omigod, we’re missing bipolar,’ ” said Dr. Gabrielle Carlson, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Stony Brook University School of Medicine on Long Island. “And if you’re a parent with a difficult child, you go online, and there’s a Web site for bipolar, and you think, ‘Thank God I’ve found a diagnosis. I’ve found a home.’ ”Some parents whose children have received the diagnosis say that, with time, the label led to effective treatment. ""It’s been a godsend for us,"" said Kelly Simons, of Montrose, Colo., whose son Brit, 15, was prone to angry outbursts until given a combination of lithium, a mood-stabilizer and Risperdal several years ago. He is now on lithium alone and he is an honor-roll student.Others say their children have suffered from side effects of drugs given for bipolar disorder, without getting much benefit.Ashley Ocampo, 40, of Tallahassee, Fla., the mother of an 8-year-old boy, Nicholas Ryan, who is being treated for bipolar disorder, said that he had tried several antipsychotic drugs and mood stabilizers, and that he had been better lately.But, she said in an interview, “He has gained weight, to the point where we were struggling find clothes for him; he’s had tremors, and still has some fine motor problems that he’s getting therapy for.”She added, “But he’s a fabulous kid, and I think, I hope, that we’re close to finding the right combination of medications to help him.”'"
"'07-09-03,'0','PLANDOME, N.Y., Sept. 2 (AP) — A member of a white supremacist group and a teenager have been arrested and accused of scrawling swastikas and other anti-Semitic graffiti on the side of a synagogue here and on a school bus, an elementary school and a house in nearby towns on Long Island, the Nassau County police said on Sunday.Swastikas and Jewish slurs scrawled in red spray paint were found Saturday on the Reconstructionist Synagogue of the North Shore, on a school bus parked at Roslyn High School and on a Roslyn Estates home, the police said. Graffiti also was found at an elementary school in Manhasset.The police on Saturday arrested John Rocissano, 20, and a 17-year-old in connection with all four crimes. Mr. Rocissano, of Manhasset, and the teenager, of Floral Park, were to be arraigned Sunday on several counts of aggravated harassment and criminal mischief.The police said they did not know the names of the suspects’ lawyers. The suspects’ telephone numbers were unlisted.Mr. Rocissano acknowledged belonging to the National Alliance, a white supremacist group that has been in decline since the death of its founder, William Pierce, in 2002, said Detective Sgt. Gary Shapiro of the Nassau County Police Department.The graffiti on the synagogue included a life rune, a symbol that resembles an upturned pitchfork and is used by the National Alliance, Sergeant Shapiro said.'"
"'07-09-03,'0','“He blended religious study and intellect with worldly manners to heal the sick and guide the healthy,” Rubin said.“He was respected and honored by both Jews and Arabs. This is especially relevant now in our life and times.”Maimonides is owned and was named by Ahmed Zayat, an Egyptian now living in New Jersey.He did not know about Rubin’s visit, and, indeed, was flying back from San Diego and Del Mar on Friday morning. When told of the smiles of the youngsters petting the nose of his expensive colt, however, Zayat was beyond gratified.He is a Muslim who grew up in a suburb of Cairo and had put much time and effort into bestowing the name Maimonides on his prize purchase.“He was a very special man who was highly regarded by all people, regardless of faith,” Zayat said of Maimonides. “What has happened with Sept. 11, Iraq, and what’s going on in the region is contrary to the way I grew up. If this horse was going to be a superstar, I wanted an appropriate name. I wanted to say something with the tool I had, which was a horse. I wanted it to be pro-peace, and about loving your neighbor.”When Zayat tried to register the name Maimonides with the Jockey Club, however, he discovered that it had been reserved for more than nine years by Earle I. Mack, a New York real estate investor and a former ambassador to Finland.In 1997, Mack, then the chairman of the board for the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, was instrumental in bringing King Juan Carlos I of Spain to New York to accept the school’s Democracy Award.Mack had been moved by the king’s remarks about how much Spain’s culture had lost when the country expelled its Jews in 1492 as part of the Inquisition.The king mentioned Maimonides, who was born in Córdoba, Spain, in 1135, and who, with his family, was forced out of the country while Spain was ruled by Muslims.“I was just waiting for a horse good enough to deserve the name,” Mack said.He has owned and bred horses for more than 40 years, and knew that Zayat’s colt, a son of Vindication, was bred to be special. Each also understood the other’s good intentions. Zayat donated $100,000 to Cardozo to commemorate the king’s visit there, and to promote tolerance. Mack released his claim to the name Maimonides.“He had the right horse, and the right motives,” Mack said. “We are all after the same thing: to touch people across cultures.”Zayat and Mack know that horse racing is an unpredictable business, and a thoughtfully named horse hardly guarantees future fame and fortune.When Eli O’Brien, 14, patted Maimonides between the ears and promised to say some prayers for him, Baffert nodded enthusiastically.“We’ll take anything you can give us,” Baffert said.'"
"'07-09-03,'0','But which one? Serena started the season by winning the Australian Open, giving Venus the impetus to get on the sister Slam scoreboard at Wimbledon.Yesterday, Richard Williams, their father and coach, slipped into the stadium for the last six points of eighth-seeded Serena’s 6-3, 6-4 victory against Marion Bartoli, who was the runner-up to Venus at Wimbledon. He had just gotten off the practice court with No. 12 Venus, who three hours later crushed the French Open finalist Ana Ivanovic, 6-4, 6-2.The sisters overwhelmed their opponents with booming serves. Serena led the ace tally with 10 to Venus’s 1. But Venus’s fastest serve registered at 126 miles an hour, compared with Serena’s 124.“Venus is moving extraordinarily well,” Richard Williams said. “From what I can see, Venus is moving better than anyone that is playing right now.”It has been five injury-filled years since the sisters, ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the world, last played in the prime-time United States Open final created with them in mind. Serena won in 2002 and 1999; Venus won in 2000 and 2001.Serena, 25, still leads Venus, 27, in Slam titles, 8-6. “They like the titles more than the money,” said their mother and coach, Oracene Price.They were on track to meet in the Wimbledon final until Serena toppled to the court in the fourth round, seized by a calf cramp. She braced her fall with her left thumb, spraining it severely, but returned to lose to Justine Henin in the quarterfinal.“I thought if it wasn’t for that calf and that thumb, they both would have made it,” Price said. “Serena was really on. Serena was more on than Venus.”Serena was in a splint for four weeks, which restricted one of her favorite activities. “She couldn’t text with her thumbs,” Price said. “Texting is very important.”But until then, tennis seemed to have recaptured its importance in Serena’s life.“I felt like I was going to win Wimbledon,” she said. “I felt like I was just going to do big things in the summer.”She added: “I was really ready to play, and I felt like when I finally dedicate myself, this happens. It was actually frustrating, and mentally I just had to pull myself back and be like, ‘It’s going to be O.K.,’ because it was really hard.”Serena will now play the top-seeded Henin tomorrow for the third straight Grand Slam event in the quarterfinal. Henin defeated Dinara Safina, 6-0, 6-2, in the fourth round last night.“That’s why I’m playing tennis, to play this kind of match,” said Henin, who lost to Serena in three sets in the Miami hardcourt final in March. “She’s been stronger than me at that time to finish the match. Probably I didn’t believe in myself that much, and that’s what changed in the French and Wimbledon.”While Serena said she was different, too, with no more pain in her thumb, she seems to have other nagging injuries, according to her father. “She’s done a marvelous job of hiding it,” Richard Williams said.The Williams camp was muted over Serena’s physical issues, which have hampered her foot speed, but it is believed that they are not serious. “I would be the last person to tell you just in case Justine or Safina reads it, and they’re like, Oh, I know what to do,” Serena said.Then again, there was very little Bartoli could do with Serena’s serve, especially a 113-m.p.h. ace out wide on match point.“With Serena, she just elevates her game when she needs to,” Bartoli said. “She’s not obviously trying to play the hardest on every point. She just wait for the great moment, and then go for it and play some great shots when she really need to.”If Serena is playing with selective focus — a product of the layoff since Wimbledon — Venus has been playing with trademark calm until she blasts deep winners with anguished grunts.“She’s the type of player that plays better each match,” said Ivanovic, who lost to Venus in the Wimbledon semifinals. Tomorrow, Venus will play No. 3 Jelena Jankovic, who last night beat Sybille Bammer, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1.Unburdened by knee or wrist injuries and bolstered by strength training, the 6-foot-1 Venus glides with ease.“Serena reminds me of a pit-bull dog and a young Mike Tyson all in one,” Richard said. “Venus reminds me of a gazelle that’s able to move, prance and jump. Venus looks as if she is really enjoying herself out there more than Serena is right now.”'"
"'07-09-03,'0','Mr. Zhang’s studio factory is so large, he has hired a staff just to document the objects as they come off the production lines.“When I went to his studio and saw the works, that really did it,” said Melissa Chiu, curator of “Zhang Huan: Altered States” at the Asia Society. “The scale of it and the subject matter — those Buddhist sculptures, and the ash heads with the long ear lobes — were just fantastic.” It is the museum’s first retrospective for a living artist.Mr. Zhang grew up in impoverished Henan province in central China, the son of factory workers. An early interest in art led to a degree in painting from Henan University and then to courses at Beijing’s elite Central Academy of Fine Arts.But in the early 1990s, he said, his penchant for disobedience and mischief inspired him to form a community of experimental artists in what came to be called Beijing’s East Village. There he took up with performance art and tested the limits of what was permissible in the years after the Tiananmen Square protests. It was a time when most avant-garde art was banned in China.Mr. Zhang — who stands just 5 foot 7 but has a muscular frame — used his body as his medium for shocking art. He suspended himself, nude and chained, from a studio ceiling; he locked himself in a metal box; he stuffed earthworms in his mouth — all on camera. In “12 Square Meters,” considered a seminal work of the Beijing East Village period, he slathered his body with honey and fish oil and sat nude in a stench-filled public toilet swarming with flies.Mr. Zhang and his fellow East Village artists like Rong Rong and Ma Liuming formed a singular art collective as experimental art began emerging in China. “He was known for the most violent kind of body art,” said Wu Hung, a professor of art history at the University of Chicago and the author of a book that chronicles the East Village artists. “There was blood, and a lot of social commentary on the environment and on the living conditions in China.”The authorities often raided East Village studios and occasionally Mr. Zhang was forced to flee after a performance. “We often had to hide him,” recalled Mr. Ai, his frequent collaborator.But photographs of his performances, like “To Raise the Water Level in a Fishpond” and “To Add One Meter to an Anonymous Mountain,” brought Mr. Zhang and the East Village crowd international recognition. “Basically I showed people what happens in reality through me,” Mr. Zhang said, chain-smoking through an interview in his studio here. “A lot of radical things happened every day. This is how I feel about the changes.” Later he fell out with some of his East Village colleagues when those early photographic images, taken by others, began to fetch huge prices in the international market, and Mr. Zhang insisted they were his creations.In 1998 he was invited to perform in New York; for eight years he made the city his new stage and his base to travel the world. At the Whitney Museum he dressed up in a suit of raw beef and paraded like a bodybuilder, in what appeared to be a commentary on American power. He was photographed with books smashed over his head, and with Chinese calligraphy covering his face and body.“If you talk to him, you get a sense of how intransigent he is,” said Christopher Phillips, a curator at the International Center of Photography in New York who is a longtime observer of Mr. Zhang’s work. “He’s a tough artist whose best work often has a brutal edge to it. And he’s got a singular focus, which has helped set him apart from others.”He has developed a reputation for aggressively peddling his images to collectors, to the annoyance of some Western galleries working with him. But he has found new ways to preserve his art. For his “Peace” series he created bronze casts of his naked body, for example, which depict him as a kind of beam, striking a bronze temple bell. One recently sold for more than $400,000 at a Sotheby’s auction.When he returned to China last year, he said, he decided to abandon performance art and create paintings, sculpture and large installations in the massive studio factory he opened here. “I was tired of performance art,” he said. “I ran out of new ideas. I came back to this country and I had new feelings — mixed feelings, but I got excited again.”Now he walks the floor examining dozens of projects, all being created by an army of craftsmen and apprentices under what could be called the Zhang Huan brand. Carvers from Dongyang, a city south of Shanghai known for wood carving, etch images into old doors; in another room a taxidermist works on cattle skins imprinted with Buddha figures.

"'07-09-03,'0','“We think it’s too difficult to try to be something beyond a news organization,” the editor in chief of Bloomberg News, Matt Winkler, said. “Clearly, there is a part of CNBC that is focused on entertainment. That’s not our focus.”In the best of bull markets, audience numbers for financial news are tiny. Last month, CNBC’s business day averaged 87,000 viewers ages 25 to 54, its best August in five years. CNBC is also found on a lot of trading floors, and Bloomberg TV can be found on the Bloomberg terminals, in addition to its own cable channel.So instead of sheer numbers, the networks fight over demographics, and here Bloomberg has an advantage. The Mendelsohn Affluent Survey has found that Bloomberg TV viewers have an average household income of $199,000, the highest of any cable network it measures. CNBC viewers have an average household income of $184,000.Brian Sullivan, host of the noon to 2 p.m. program “In Focus” on Bloomberg TV, said he prefers influence over reach. “I’d take a smaller, more elite audience anyway, because then I don’t have to have game shows,” he said, taking an unveiled shot at “Fast Money MBA Challenge,” the CNBC game show that started in August.Unlike CNBC, Bloomberg TV does not subscribe to Nielsen ratings, so it is difficult to estimate how many televisions are tuned to the channel on a given day, but the number is assumed to be low. (Over all, Bloomberg has a potential cable reach of 49 million homes in the United States, less than CNBC’s 90 million but more than Fox Business Network’s anticipated 31 million. Bloomberg has an additional 150 million potential international viewers and broadcasts in seven languages.)E! Entertainment Television simulcasts Bloomberg TV from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m., and the measured audience is minor: the early morning broadcasts averaged 30,000 viewers ages 25 to 54 in the third quarter of 2007, edging CNBC’s 26,000 viewers in the demographic.Bloomberg does not break out its TV division revenue. During a given hour, CNBC broadcasts almost twice as many commercials as Bloomberg TV.“Television helps build our brand around the world. It gives us access to the kind of people who make news. And we think it helps us sell the other Bloomberg product offerings,” Peter T. Grauer, Bloomberg’s chairman, said.Chris Roush, a business journalism professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who edits the Talking Biz News blog and worked in Bloomberg’s Atlanta bureau, said he perceives Bloomberg’s content to be stronger than CNBC’s but thinks the graphics are a distraction.“The problem with Bloomberg is that they’re trying to do too much on the screen,” he said. “I think people would be more attracted to it if they just had a face or two faces on the screen.”The current design surrounds anchors and guests in a mass of market indexes, company information, stock quotes and news headlines.“Years ago, I think people laughed at it,” Carol Massar, the channel’s morning anchor, said. “Now everybody’s copied us.”With the graphics face lift, Bloomberg TV hopes to use graphical data to tell stories. The changes consist of a box in the upper right corner of the screen and an information bar on the bottom.Instead of a constant stream of stock prices, the information bar will show data related to the topic being covered, delivered from the Bloomberg terminal.The old screen is probably more familiar to viewers than most of the Bloomberg anchors. The channel is probably better known for the on-air talent it has lost — including Erin Burnett and Dylan Ratigan, both of CNBC — than for the anchors it has now.But Bloomberg TV recently lured the husband and wife team of Al Hunt and Judy Woodruff to its Washington bureau.Ms. Woodruff, a longtime CNN anchor, interviews guests for a monthly program. Mr. Hunt, a former reporter at The Wall Street Journal, oversees news coverage in the nation’s capital. At The Journal, Mr. Hunt said, he spent 99 percent of his time creating newspaper content. At Bloomberg, his bureau feeds the terminal, television, radio, Web site and wire service.“Other places talk about multimedia, but I don’t know if anybody is as genuinely multimedia as we are,” he said.'"
"'07-09-03,'0','Citing research conducted at the University of Bonn, which compared the water and energy consumption of people from several European countries who washed dishes by hand with the quantities used in modern dishwashers, the company said the machines won, hands down.Coming in for particular scorn was a category it identified as ""the carefree dishwasher.” These people kept the water running through the whole process, squirting dishwashing liquid onto sponges, but still ending up with the dirtiest dishes and the most wasted water and energy.An ad now appearing on television in Germany tells consumers that they could reduce their water use 85 percent by using a dishwasher. That is 700 million bathtubs full of water a year across Germany, according to the ad, created by the agency Euro RSCG, which is part of Havas.Referring to one of its European brand dishwashing products, it said: “So Calgonit is not only good for your dishes but for our future, too. Be a part of it.”The ad may be used in other European markets, like Britain, where Reckitt sells the Finish brand, and the United States, where it markets Electrasol, said Rob de Groot, a Reckitt executive. Different ads with a similar message have appeared in markets including Southern and Eastern Europe and South Africa.It is not the first time that an advertiser has asked consumers to conserve. Procter & Gamble used a similar message in a recent campaign in Britain for its Ariel brand of laundry detergent, urging people to use lower-temperature washing cycles.Getting specific can complicate matters in some cases. In South Africa, the Advertising Standards Authority recently banned advertisements for Finish that made the environmental claims, saying Reckitt Benckiser was unable to prove, as the spot ad asserted, that automatic dishwashers used 50 percent less energy and one-tenth the water.Some consumers had complained to the authority, saying such comparisons were hardly relevant in a country where many people lack running water.Some marketers, not wanting to be seen as hectoring those who buy their products, have been wary about taking this approach. As a result, many green ad campaigns talk more about what companies are doing to reduce their carbon footprints or to otherwise make the world a better place than demanding that the consumer do likewise.“There are a lot of high-level messages out there, but very few that zero in to this level,” said Pete Zillig, a brand director at Euro RSCG.'"
"'07-09-03,'0','Millions of PC users already rely on Web applications that either provide a service or store data. For instance, Yahoo and Google do their own forms of cloud computing, offering popular e-mail programs and photo-sharing sites that are accessible through a Web browser. The photos or the e-mail messages are stored on those companies’ servers. The data is accessible from any PC anywhere.Hundreds of companies in Silicon Valley are offering every imaginable service, from writing tools to elaborate dating and social networking systems, all of which require only a Web browser and each potentially undermining Microsoft’s desktop monopoly.Google, the most visible example, took cloud computing a step further last October and directly challenged Microsoft by offering a suite of free word-processing and spreadsheet software over a browser.“To the extent that the industry is moving toward an on-demand business model, it poses a threat to Microsoft,” said Kenneth Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry Association and a longtime Microsoft adversary.Microsoft is a late entrant to a set of businesses that are largely defined as Web 2.0, but the company is counting on its ability to exploit its vast installed base of more than one billion Windows-based personal computers. It plans to give away some of its services, like photo-sharing and disk storage, while charging for others like its computer security service and a series of business-oriented services aimed at small and medium-size organizations.“I think Microsoft is going beyond search to a more sophisticated set of services,” said Shane Robison, executive vice president and chief strategy and technology officer at Hewlett-Packard. “It will be a race, and who knows who will get there first?”Brian Hall, general manager for Microsoft’s Windows Live services, said, “We’re taking the communications and sharing components and creating a set of services that become what we believe is the one suite of services and applications for personal and community use across the PC, the Web and the phone.”He said the software would be the first full release of Windows Live that is intended to produce a “relatively seamless” experience between the different services and applications.The Windows Live service — which will be found at www.live.com — includes new versions of the company’s Hotmail and Messenger communications services as well as Internet storage components. Microsoft executives said there were roughly 300 million active users each on the Hotmail and Messenger services, with some overlap.The software release will offer PC users the option of downloading a set of the services with a single Unified Installer program, or as separate components. The individual services are Windows Live Photo Gallery, Windows Live Mail, Windows Live Messenger 8.5 and Windows Live OneCare Family Safety, a computer security program.The release, though it includes the Windows Live Writer blogging application, carefully avoids cannibalizing two of Microsoft’s mainstays, the Word and Excel programs.Windows Live services also underscore Microsoft’s desire to become the manager for a user’s data wherever it is located. Although they will not be included in the initial test release, the company’s recently announced SkyDrive online data storage service and its FolderShare service are being folded into Windows Live. SkyDrive currently gives test users 500 megabytes of free Internet storage, while FolderShare makes it possible to synchronize between multiple computers — including Apple’s Macintosh computers.“When you think storage, think Windows Live,” Bill Gates said in an interview this summer. Microsoft is moving to create an experience that will divorce a user’s information from the particular device the person is working with at any moment, he said.Microsoft’s new approach is in many ways a mirror image of the strategy used during the 1990s in defeating Netscape Communications when the start-up threatened Microsoft’s desktop dominance. Microsoft tried to tie the Internet to Windows by bundling its Internet Explorer Web browser as an integral part of its desktop operating system. The company lost an antitrust lawsuit in 2000 brought by the Justice Department in response to this bundling strategy.Today, that strategy has been flipped with the growing array of Web services that are connected to Windows. But the new approach, which the company refers to as “software plus services,” is once again beginning to draw industry charges of unfair competition from competitors.To head off that challenge, Microsoft has been participating in various international organizations that are setting standards over a wide range of services: from those aimed at consumers, like blog-editing and photo-sharing applications, to automated business processes like Web-based customer relationship management systems for sales staff and automatic ordering and logistics applications.Last week, for example, Microsoft executives were put on the defensive after the company’s efforts to gain international adoption for a Microsoft-designed document format known as Office Open XML, led to charges of vote-buying in an international standards vote in Sweden.After the charges received international publicity during the week, the Swedish Standards Institute reversed its position and decided to abstain on the issue, and a Microsoft executive apologized publicly for the gaffe.On Wednesday, Jason Matusow, Microsoft’s senior director for intellectual property and interoperability, wrote on his Web site: “I understand the concern raised by this error in judgment by an MS employee. The only thing I can say is that the right things were done as the issue was identified. The process and vote at S.I.S. were not affected.” Microsoft did not specify what actually had transpired.While the industry dispute over document formats was visible last week, several Microsoft competitors were quietly pointing to another standards issue that may prove to be a significant advantage for software giant in the future.A set of Web services standards that have emerged from the World Wide Web Consortium might give Microsoft a performance advantage, according to industry executives at three companies, who declined to be identified because they are Microsoft business partners.Microsoft’s standards efforts have angered its competitors because four years ago the software publisher argued publicly against adding compression features that are designed to improve performance to industry Web services standards. Now, however, Microsoft has developed its own compression standards that will potentially make its versions of Web services perform better than those of their competitors.“They’re playing the game right,” said a rival. “The idea is to offer a solution that works better in an all-Microsoft environment.”On Friday, a spokesman for Microsoft said that services that take advantage of the Web standards effort like Silverlight, a new system for displaying multimedia content via a Web browser that competes with Adobe’s Flash media player, would not be included in the first release of Windows Live, but would be added in the future.'"

"'07-09-03,'0','Only one Democrat, Representative Brian Baird of Washington, has publicly reversed his position during the current recess to support the president’s strategy. The switch, made after a trip to Iraq last month, infuriated many of his constituents; several hundred spent four hours castigating him at a public forum. His switch also prompted attack advertisements against him by MoveOn.org, a group that opposes the war.Mr. Mahoney said the lack of political or economic progress in Iraq had hardened his view that a new strategy was needed.In talking to constituents about Iraq during lawmakers’ August break, Mr. Mahoney emphasized his outrage over the financial cost of the war, hoping that the same message of fiscal conservatism that helped elect him would once again resonate with voters and help establish his reputation as a centrist Democrat in a district where President Bush won with more than half the vote in 2000 and in 2004.“You have got to understand, for the last seven years all the money has been going to Iraq, all the money has been going to homeland security,” Mr. Mahoney said Wednesday at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon in the Village of Wellington, Fla.“The president has been trying to keep it off the balance sheets so you don’t know how bad it is,” he added. “I’m here to tell you it’s bad.”In Wellington, which is best known for its polo grounds and equestrian centers, Mr. Mahoney did not get a single question about the war, which he attributed to his constituents having made up their minds and being satisfied with where he stands.Carmen A. Priore, a member of the Wellington Village Council who attended the lunch, had a different explanation. “A lot of people sitting here in the chamber, they are concerned about how am I going to make a mortgage payment,” Mr. Priore said. “Iraq seems so distant.”The rising demands to address domestic issues are an added burden as Mr. Mahoney and other moderates struggle to reconcile the conflicting facts on the ground in Iraq. They are also navigating the political peril of being attacked by liberal groups insisting on immediate withdrawal and being mischaracterized by White House allies seeking to transform any praise of American troops into support for the president’s policies.After his visit to Iraq in July, Mr. Mahoney was quickly quoted in a Republican press release as saying the escalation of troops in Iraq “has really made a difference and really has gotten Al Qaeda on their heels.” The quote was a snippet from a local Florida newspaper article in which Mr. Mahoney also said, “There is going to have to be a different strategy.”Still, a month later, Mr. Mahoney said he felt a need to explain, a reflection of the pressure he faces as a freshman lawmaker in a district that Republicans are gunning to win back in 2008. “To a large extent, the progress I talked about was taken out of context,” he said.Then, Mr. Mahoney, whose focus when he ran for office was on domestic rather than foreign affairs, gave a detailed analysis of recent developments in Iraq, including what he described as limited military progress.“Militarily, things have improved,” Mr. Mahoney said. “But everybody I talked to at the beginning of the surge back in February all said the same thing, ‘This is a three-legged stool.’ There has got to be economic progress. We haven’t seen it. There has got to be political progress — nonexistent.”Mr. Mahoney added, “We put the $100 billion in and two legs of this stool are broken, the two things that the Army can’t solve.” The bottom line, Mr. Mahoney said, is that he is going back to Washington hoping Congress will force the president’s hand. “Congress has to send a message,” he said. “And that message is we’re going to stop funding it.”But he is also eager to address the domestic concerns of constituents like Keith Sutcliffe, 42, who owns an optical store in Jupiter, Fla.Mr. Sutcliffe’s 25-year-old daughter recently returned from her third tour with the Air Force in Iraq, and on Wednesday his son-in-law deployed for an eight-month assignment with the Air Force at Baghdad International Airport. Mr. Sutcliffe went to see his congressman on Thursday not about the war, but about rising property taxes and insurance premiums.“I would love us to get out of Iraq,” Mr. Sutcliffe said at the Palm Beach County Commissioners office, where he had gone to hear Mr. Mahoney at a forum on insurance costs. But economic issues were foremost on his mind, Mr. Sutcliffe said. “The property taxes and insurance are killing people,” he said.Mr. Mahoney said he shared the concerns about domestic issues. But he said he also understood that voters blame not only President Bush, but Congress for the situation in Iraq. He noted the low approval ratings for lawmakers.“What people are telling me is you got to stop it” he said of the war. “The reason that Congress is at 17 percent is because people are frustrated.”'"
"'07-09-03,'0','A friend of Mrs. Helmsley’s recently received two calls from dog owners who were interested in having their pets mate with Trouble. One of the callers was joking; the other was serious.With her owner gone, Trouble has become an easy stand-in for New Yorkers’ less than generous feelings about Mrs. Helmsley, whose reputation for mistreating workers earned her a seat in the tabloid nobility as the “Queen of Mean.” The agitation over the dog’s fortune has overshadowed the fact that Mrs. Helmsley actually left the bulk of her billions to a charitable trust.A cute-as-pie Maltese with white stringy hair and button eyes, Trouble is not easily embraced in a city of grinders, and her defenders are few. Much of what is publicly known about her comes from Ms. Sfara, who worked for Mrs. Helmsley for three months and sued her after she said she was bitten by the dog.Trouble’s whereabouts remain unknown. Mrs. Helmsley’s longtime spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein, declined to comment for this article.The dog came into Mrs. Helmsley’s life as a puppy. Ms. Sfara said Mrs. Helmsley had told her that John Codey, a friend and adviser, went on a walk with Mrs. Helmsley one day, and they ended up at a pet store. Trouble approached Mrs. Helmsley, and they made an immediate connection. Mr. Codey bought the dog for her as a present. Mr. Codey did not return a phone call seeking comment.The dog was featured in ads for the Park Lane, and in one she wears pink bows over her ears and puts on a pout next to the words: “It’s a sad day when you leave a Helmsley Hotel.”Ms. Sfara, who said Mrs. Helmsley gave Trouble her name, recalled a day when Mrs. Helmsley had an eye appointment at the NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital in Manhattan. Trouble was refused entry. “She was making so much fuss and arguing with people,” Ms. Sfara said of Mrs. Helmsley, “that they let us go upstairs.” With Trouble.One afternoon in 2003, Mrs. Helmsley went to Bravo Gianni, an Italian restaurant on East 63rd Street, for a lunch date. She brought Trouble with her, but she was told the dog would have to wait outside. She and her guest had lunch elsewhere. In February that same year, the former general manager of the Park Lane won a sexual discrimination suit against Mrs. Helmsley, after a jury found that she had fired him because he was gay. She sat down for an interview with The New York Post to discuss the case, with Trouble resting in her arms.“But when I reached over to pet the pooch,” The Post’s Andrea Peyser wrote, “Trouble bared her teeth and threatened to rip off my finger.”Trouble, despite her size, seemed to earn the name.Ms. Sfara said Trouble bit her dozens of times during the three months she worked for Mrs. Helmsley in 2004. Once, when Mrs. Helmsley was returning from a trip to her home in Greenwich, Conn., Trouble rested on Ms. Sfara’s lap in the limousine. When she moved her right arm to get a tissue, Trouble lunged and bit her hand, drawing blood, she said. Ms. Sfara said Trouble had also bitten Mrs. Helmsley’s bodyguards, a dog groomer, a nurse and at least one hotel guest.“Trouble didn’t let people get close to her,” Ms. Sfara said of Mrs. Helmsley. “She says, ‘She’s my first bodyguard.’ ”Ms. Sfara sued her former boss over one of the dog bites. In 2005, a judge dismissed the case, agreeing with Mrs. Helmsley’s lawyers that she was insulated from liability under the Workers’ Compensation Law. Ms. Sfara said she still suffers pain from nerve damage from the bites and wears a brace on her right hand.As would any New Yorker who comes into a ton of money, Trouble is going to need expert legal representation. Ms. Sfara’s son, Remus Pop, 27, said he and his mother were talking to a law firm about taking up their case again and going after Trouble’s inheritance. “That is the next step,” Mr. Pop said. “That dog got money. That money is going to be taken away from that dog.”Besides the money, Mrs. Helmsley’s will has other clues about how fond she was of her pet. It says that Trouble is to be cared for by her brother, Alvin Rosenthal. The will further stipulates that when Trouble dies, “her remains shall be buried next to my remains” at the Helmsley mausoleum at the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Westchester County.But Mrs. Helmsley may not get her wish. A spokesman for the Department of State’s Division of Cemeteries said that state law has been widely interpreted to forbid the interment of non-human remains at human cemeteries. The superintendent of Sleepy Hollow said it would abide by the regulations, and any questions about the law would need to be settled by the Division of Cemeteries.Ms. Sfara said she did not think Trouble could survive long without her companion. “They were too close,” she said. When Mrs. Helmsley would leave her penthouse at the hotel and head down to the restaurant, Trouble would patiently wait. “Leona would be out for three hours,” Ms. Sfara said. “The dog would stay by the door, lying on the floor for three hours, waiting for her to come. It never moved.”'"
"'07-09-03,'0','BAGHDAD, Sept. 2 — Moktada al-Sadr, the powerful Shiite cleric, on Sunday repeated his demand that the investigation into last week’s gun battles in the holy city of Karbala be impartial, threatening to make “decisions far from government expectations” if the inquiry did not move quickly and justly.Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki announced Sunday that he had established an independent committee to oversee the investigation. But Mr. Sadr’s comments seemed to heighten tensions over the episode.The case has become a test of loyalty, as Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, tries to walk a line between the Shiite groups involved in last week’s fighting: Mr. Sadr’s militia, the Mahdi Army, and the armed wing of the Sadrists’ main political rivals, the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council, which controls the Iraqi Army units protecting Karbala’s shrines.Both groups supported Mr. Maliki for prime minister after the 2005 elections but the withdrawal of support by either could mean that a no confidence vote in Parliament would pass, requiring Mr. Maliki to step down. Mr. Sadr’s political party has boycotted the government but not signaled a complete rejection of the prime minister.On Sunday, Mr. Maliki was careful not to criticize either group directly. He blamed “corruptive gangs” for the violence, which left at least 52 people dead and 279 wounded, and said that if Iraqi soldiers had misbehaved, that, too, would be disclosed.“The investigation will go its own way, and that is why a neutral committee was formed to run the inquiry and uncover all the details, the background, who took part and who fired and killed and wounded this number of people,” he said. “We will wait until the committee has finished its detailed inquiry, and we will announce the results at that point.”'"

"'07-09-04,'1','LAS VEGAS, Sept. 5 — A search was under way in the mountainous terrain of western Nevada on Tuesday for Steve Fossett, the millionaire aviator, who disappeared on Monday after taking off from a ranch for a brief recreational flight in a single-engine plane.Mr. Fossett, 63, took off from a ranch owned by the hotel magnate William Barron Hilton at about 9 a.m. but was expected back by noon to leave the ranch with his wife on a private jet, said Major Cynthia S. Ryan, public information officer of the Civil Air Patrol Nevada Wing.Mr. Fossett is a veteran aviator known for his quests to set world records. In 2002, on his sixth try, he became the first person to fly around the world uninterrupted in a hot-air balloon. He has an application pending with the federal Bureau of Land Management to allow him to try to break the land-speed record in a jet-powered race car in the northern Nevada desert sometime next year.Nine aircraft have been searching several hundred square miles for signs of Mr. Fossett or the blue-and-white single-engine Citabria Super Decathlon he was last seen in, Major Ryan said. Mr. Fossett took off heading south from the Flying M Ranch, which is about 90 miles southeast of Reno.A spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, Alison Duquette, said that Mr. Fossett’s family had called when he did not return, and that her agency had issued a notice on Tuesday morning to all pilots in the area to look for wreckage.Among the aircraft used in the search were six Civil Air Patrol Cessna 182 planes, each with three-person crews and helicopters from the Nevada National Guard, the California Highway Patrol and the Naval Air Station Fallon in Fallon, Nev.'"
"'07-09-04,'1','It was clear that the Democrats were laying the groundwork to undermine any positive assessments of the war by the Bush administration, and some Republicans on the Foreign Relations Committee sought to cast doubt on the report’s findings.Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota, suggested that the report did not include data from August and that more recent numbers present a more positive picture.“The data in August, I think, would be very clear about the reduction in violence,” Mr. Coleman told Mr. Walker.But Mr. Kerry and his fellow Democrats harped on what is certain to be a common refrain in the days ahead, that the escalation of troops since February has not led to marked political improvements by the Iraqi government.“There has been no meaningful progress on meeting political benchmarks,” Mr. Kerry said to Mr. Walker, with no intonation of a question mark although he was in a question-and-answer session with Mr. Walker.The G.A.O. report concluded that “violence remains high” in Iraq amid mixed progress on security and that political reconciliation efforts remain far from sufficient, eight months after President Bush began his troop-increase plan.The report places greater emphasis on shortcomings than successes, saying that Iraq has failed to meet 11 of the 18 military and political objectives, or benchmarks, set by Congress and agreed on by Mr. Bush, while partially meeting four.“Overall, key legislation has not been passed, violence remains high, and it is unclear whether the Iraqi government will spend $10 billion in reconstruction funds,” said the report from Mr. Walker. “These results do not diminish the courageous efforts of coalition forces and progress that has been made in several areas, including Anbar Province.”The report found that only two of nine security benchmarks had been met: the Iraqi government had established committees in support of the Baghdad security plan and set up most of the planned joint security stations in Baghdad.But it had not eliminated militia control of local security, put an end to political intervention in military operations, ensured even-handed law enforcement, increased army units capable of independent operations or ensured that political authorities made no false accusations against security forces.The report said that the Iraqi government had met only one of eight legislative benchmarks as it protected the rights of minority political parties in the legislature. It had not enacted legislation on de-Baathification, oil-revenue sharing, provincial elections, amnesty or militia disarmament.It said that it was unclear whether sectarian violence had decreased, a key benchmark, “since it is difficult to measure whether the perpetrators’ intents were sectarian in nature, and other measures of population security show differing trends.”A graphic in the report shows attacks on coalition and Iraqi forces, and civilians, as rising in the spring months, while American forces were still being increased and declining since June, when the so-called surge was completed.In a draft version of the G.A.O. report obtained last week by reporters, the agency found that the Iraqi government had failed to meet 13 of 18 military and political objectives agreed to by President Bush not 11, as the final version states.Pentagon officials had contended that at least two more categories should have been given passing grades. They said that Iraq had in fact delivered the army units to Baghdad it had promised as part of stepped-up security there, and they challenged a finding that questioned whether sectarian killings had declined in recent months.Other reports, including a National Intelligence Estimate and a bleak assessment of the Iraqi national police by a congressionally established commission, have also offset some of Mr. Bush’s more optimistic portrayals of progress in Iraq, while leaving each side in the debate on Iraq with evidence to support their cases.The hearings on Iraq began as Congress re-opened for business after a tumultuous monthlong recess.And the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, in his opening speech from the Senate floor, vowed to change the course of the war. “September is the month for policy change in Iraq,” Mr. Reid declared, noting that many Republican lawmakers had urged patience until the reports due this month from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker.“The calendar has not changed,” Mr. Reid said. “It’s September. We have reached this goal. It’s time to make a decision. We can’t continue the way we are. We can’t afford it, militarily and financially.”'"
"'07-09-04,'1','Microsoft’s bid to extend its dominance in digital documents to the new field of open-format documents was unexpectedly rebuffed today when a global technical panel refused to designate its Office Open XML as an international standard.The underlying code of an open document format is public, allowing developers to improve upon it and create new products that use it without having to pay royalties.Microsoft is seeking to have its format declared a standard so it can sell software with open characteristics. Such software is increasingly being demanded by national and local governments in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Brazil, as well as by the state of Massachusetts.Microsoft failed to meet two criteria for a standards designation under voting rules of the Geneva-based technical bodies, the International Organization for Standardization, known as the I.S.O., and the International Electrotechnical Commission.In five months of electronic balloting that concluded on Sunday, only 51 countries, or 74 percent of the 87 that had participated, supported Microsoft’s bid, said Tom Robertson, Microsoft’s general manager for interoperability and standards, in a statement.

He saved his best for last, a perfectly executed inside-out forehand winner on the line.The match turned on those three missed break opportunities by López. Federer did not lose a point on his serve the rest of the way, reeling off 35 consecutive winners before misfiring on a service return in what proved to be the last game.Federer said he had no idea he had won that many points in a row on his serve. “That’s awesome,” he said. “Come on. What have I done?”Lopez fought to the end — he saved three match points on his serve — before bowing out in two hours. He finished with 34 winners to Federer’s 44 and 29 unforced errors to Federer’s 12.Federer’s quarterfinal opponent will be Andy Roddick. It is a repeat of last year’s final, which Federer won, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-1, to capture his third consecutive Open crown.WHY AMERICAN MEN DON’T RULE Much has been said about the decline of elite men’s tennis in the United States. But there is another side to the story: Tennis around the world — in South America and Europe, in particular — is broader and deeper on the men’s side than ever before.Statistics do not show, conclusively, why the United States no longer dominates men’s professional tennis as it did in the 1970s and ’80s. But there is some tantalizing evidence to consider.¶From 1972 to 1981, about 25 countries a year were represented in the United States Open draw. That number jumped to around 34 a year from 1998 on. This year, 35 countries were represented in the main draw.¶Countries like France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Argentina and the Czech Republic are sending more and better players to the Open.¶In the 1970s, three other countries — Australia, South Africa and Britain — accounted for about 40 percent of the non-United States players in the tournament. Australians alone filled 22 percent of the draw among non-Americans. But from 2000 on, no nation has truly dominated the field. Australia, South Africa and Britain together accounted for only about 7 percent of the non-American players. Spain has sent the most players to the main draw over the past seven years, making up about 13 percent of the non-United States total.¶This year’s Round of 16 on the men’s side looked more like the World Cup than the Open. Ten nations were represented among the final 16 players.Viewership statistics can be unreliable, but tennis remains one of the most popular sports on television. The 2004 Wimbledon final was, by one measure, the 10th-most-watched sporting event in the world that year.The sport is gaining popularity as a recreational activity in many countries, even if it peaked in the United States long ago. The International Tennis Federation, the sport’s governing body, conducted a participation survey from 1997 to 2002 and found a clear upward trend in the popularity in many countries.

"'07-09-04,'1','BERLIN, Sept. 3 — Amid intense lobbying, Microsoft is expected to squeak out a victory this week to have its open document format, Office Open XML, recognized as an international standard, people tracking the vote said Monday.The move would help Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, maintain its competitive advantage in the expanding field of open document formats.“After what basically has amounted to unprecedented lobbying, I think that Microsoft’s standard is going to get the necessary amount of support,” said Pieter Hintjens, president of Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, a Brussels group that led the opposition.The underlying code of an “open” document is public, allowing developers to improve and derive new products without having to pay royalties. The first open format to become an international standard, in May 2006, was OpenDocument Format, developed by a group led by International Business Machines.Microsoft sought a similar status for Office Open XML so it could also sell software with open characteristics, which are increasingly being demanded by national and local governments in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Brazil, as well as by Massachusetts in the United States.'"

"'07-09-04,'1','Other experts say bipolar disorder is overdiagnosed. The term, the critics say, has become a catchall applied to almost any explosive, aggressive child.After children are classified, the experts add, they are treated with powerful psychiatric drugs that have few proven benefits in children and potentially serious side effects like rapid weight gain.In the study, researchers from New York, Maryland and Madrid analyzed a National Center for Health Statistics survey of office visits that focused on doctors in private or group practices. The researchers calculated the number of visits in which doctors recorded diagnoses of bipolar disorder and found that they increased, from 20,000 in 1994 to 800,000 in 2003, about 1 percent of the population under age 20.The spread of the diagnosis is a boon to drug makers, some psychiatrists point out, because treatments typically include medications that can be three to five times more expensive than those for other disorders like depression or anxiety.“I think the increase shows that the field is maturing when it comes to recognizing pediatric bipolar disorder, but the tremendous controversy reflects the fact that we haven’t matured enough,” said Dr. John March, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.“From a developmental point of view,” Dr. March said, “we simply don’t know how accurately we can diagnose bipolar disorder or whether those diagnosed at age 5 or 6 or 7 will grow up to be adults with the illness. The label may or may not reflect reality.”Most children who qualify for the diagnosis do not proceed to develop the classic features of adult bipolar disorder like mania, researchers have found. They are far more likely to become depressed.Dr. Mani Pavuluri, director of the pediatric mood disorders program at the University of Illinois, Chicago, said the label was often better than any of the other diagnoses often given to difficult children.“These are kids that have rage, anger, bubbling emotions that are just intolerable for them,” Dr. Pavuluri said, “and it is good that this is finally being recognized as part of a single disorder.”The senior author of the study, Dr. Mark Olfson of the New York State Psychiatric Institute at the Columbia University Medical Center, said, “I have been studying trends in mental health services for some time, and this finding really stands out as one of the most striking increases in this short a time.”The increase makes bipolar disorder more common among children than clinical depression, the authors said. Psychiatrists made almost 90 percent of the diagnoses, and two-thirds of the young patients were boys, said the study, published in the September issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry.About half the patients were identified as having other mental difficulties, mostly attention deficit disorder.The children’s treatments almost always included medication. About half received antipsychotic drugs like Risperdal from Janssen or Seroquel from Astrazeneca, both developed to treat schizophrenia.A third were prescribed so-called mood stabilizers, most often the epilepsy drug Depakote. Antidepressants and stimulants were also common.Most children took a combination of two or more drugs, and 4 in 10 received psychotherapy.The regimens were similar to those of a group of adults with bipolar diagnoses, the study found.“You get the sense looking at the data that doctors are generalizing from the adult literature and applying the same principles to children,” Dr. Olfson said.The increased children’s diagnoses reflect several factors, experts say. Symptoms appear earlier in life than previously thought, in teenagers and young children who later develop the full-scale disorder, recent studies suggest.The label also gives doctors and desperate parents a quick way to try to manage children’s rages and outbursts in an era when long-term psychotherapy and hospital care are less accessible, they say.In addition, drug makers and company-sponsored psychiatrists have been encouraging doctors to look for the disorder since several drugs were approved to treat it in adults.Last month, the Food and Drug Administration approved one of the medications, Risperdal, to treat bipolar in children. Experts say they expect that move will increase the use of Risperdal and similar drugs for young people.“We are just inundated with stuff from drug companies, publications, throwaways, that tell us six ways from Sunday that, Oh my God, we’re missing bipolar,” said Dr. Gabrielle Carlson, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the Stony Brook University School of Medicine on Long Island. “And if you’re a parent with a difficult child, you go online, and there’s a Web site for bipolar, and you think: ‘Thank God, I’ve found a diagnosis. I’ve found a home.’ ”Some parents whose children have received the diagnosis say that, with time, the label led to effective treatment.“It’s been a godsend for us,” said Kelly Simons of Montrose, Colo., whose son Brit, 15, was prone to angry outbursts until given a combination of lithium, a mood stabilizer, and Risperdal, which was often given to children “off label,” several years ago. He now takes just lithium and is an honor roll student.Other parents say their children have suffered side effects of drugs for bipolar disorder.Ashley Ocampo, 40, of Tallahassee, Fla., whose 8-year-old son is being treated for bipolar, said that he had tried several antipsychotic drugs and mood stabilizers and that he had improved.“He has gained weight,” Ms. Ocampo said, “to the point where we were struggling find clothes for him. He’s had tremors and still has some fine motor problems that he’s getting therapy for. But he’s a fabulous kid. And I think, I hope, that we’re close to finding the right combination of medications to help him.”'"
"'07-09-04,'1','DUBLIN, Sept. 3 (Reuters) — American workers are the world’s most productive, followed by the Irish, though productivity is rising fastest in China and much of the rest of Asia, according to the International Labor Organization.When productivity was measured by the hour rather than by the total number of hours worked, however, Norway, an oil nation, was the most productive, followed by the United States and France, the organization said in a report released over the weekend and published every two years. It mostly used 2006 data.“The difference in rankings can be explained by the fact that annual working hours per person employed are considerably higher in the United States than in the majority of European economies,” the report said.Ireland was in second place when productivity was measured in total hours worked, moving up from fourth position in 2005. The country was fifth in terms of productivity per hour, up from sixth two years earlier.France, where President Nicolas Sarkozy has pushed for a reduction in the workweek to an average of 35 hours, was a notch or two lower in the organization’s rankings, whether measured in output over total hours worked or by hour. The same was true with Belgium, another country high in productivity.'"
"'07-09-04,'1','But the biggest force driving up milk prices is the same one that has driven up prices for conventional commodities like iron ore and copper: a roaring global economy. Rising incomes in emerging economies from China and India to Latin America and the Middle East are lifting millions of people out of poverty and into the middle class.It turns out that, along with zippy cars and flat-panel TVs, milk is the mark of new money, a significant source of protein that factors into much of any affluent person’s diet. Milk goes into infant formulas, chocolate, ice cream and cheese. Most baked goods contain butter, and coffee chains like Starbucks sell more milk than coffee.Just meeting that demand, said Alex Duncan, an economist at Fonterra, the dominant dairy cooperative in New Zealand and one of the world’s largest dairy-exporting companies, will require the addition each year of the equivalent of New Zealand’s entire annual milk output.That is a lot of milk. New Zealand is one of the world’s largest milk producers, according to IFCN Dairy Research Center in Germany, but it is the largest exporter of dairy products. Some dairy economists doubt that the world’s cows are up to the task and say there is a possibility that the shortage of milk now being seen in parts of the world will spread.Others say there are plenty of places where more milk can be produced if the price is right. One thing they agree on is that milk prices are likely to stay high and rise even higher.“No one forecast this rapid shortage of milk,” said Torsten Hemme, head of the IFCN center.This is not good if you are in the market for milk. Pizza parlors and ice cream vendors are raising their prices. Starbucks has raised the price of its drinks. Milk is also weighing on profits at Cadbury Schweppes and at Kraft Foods’ cheese unit.What is unusual, and somewhat confusing, about the milk boom compared with other booming commodities is that milk is not like oil: You cannot stick it in barrels and stockpile it. It goes sour. Even in powder form, the most commoditized version, milk has a shelf life. As a result, only about 7 percent of all the milk produced globally is traded across borders. The rest is consumed in domestic markets, which are protected by geography and just as often by tariffs or subsidies.Big buyers like chocolate makers and grocery stores buy their milk under long-term contracts and so can smooth out sudden spikes or dips in prices. Thus, the full effect of the global shortage varies from country to country, and not all consumers are yet suffering the full impact.But because of the local nature of the market, there is little spare capacity. In the past, the world could always count on the United States and Europe to fill shortages by exporting some of their subsidized stockpiles of cheese, butter and milk powder. But the United States has drawn down its butter mountain and other stockpiles; the same is true of the European Union, which started cutting dairy subsidies in 1993 and will finish this year. Rising dairy demand in the United States and among the European Union’s new members, moreover, is draining supplies. As a result, Mr. Hemme said, “This storage capacity is empty now.”At the same time, rising demand for biofuels is pushing up the price of corn and other grains, which is what farmers in the United States, Europe, Canada and Japan feed their cows instead of grass. Rising feed costs help to push milk prices even higher.Production is growing in emerging markets like China, but demand there is growing even faster. The average person in China now consumes more than six gallons of milk a year, up from more than two gallons in 2000, according to IFCN. So while China is now one of the world’s top milk producers, it is also the world’s largest milk importer.Experts say the growing demand for milk will have to be met in countries like China and Argentina as higher prices lead to greater investment in lifting milk yields.Some see the United States as another main source of milk supplies. International prices have now risen above the subsidized price of milk there, making it profitable for American dairies to export their milk. “There’s a real opportunity for the U.S. to export without government support or subsidies,” Mr. Goode said.Mr. Hemme at IFCN estimates that both the American Midwest and Europe could multiply their milk production. But it would take one or two years and require using more costly corn and grain. So even if milk supplies keep up with demand, the price will stay high.“Even when prices start easing back, we don’t expect them to go back to where they were,” said Hayley Moynihan, a dairy analyst at Rabobank in New Zealand. “The cost of production and ongoing demand is going to see prices eventually settle at higher levels than they did in the past.”'"
"'07-09-04,'1','The lawsuit is a reminder too of a hallowed era in dance history, the 1930s and ’40s. The New Dance Group, one of the first racially integrated dance schools, sought to make the art form relevant to the public and give it a social agenda. (Lessons cost 10 cents each.) It is holding its 75th-anniversary gala on Oct. 22.Ms. Blatt and the other plaintiffs — the choreographer Mary Anthony and Thomas D. Hurwitz, the son of Jane Dudley, another Graham veteran and influential teacher who helped found the New Dance Group in 1932 — argue that there is clear evidence of their ownership, including copyright registrations in some cases. They argue that the dances’ value depends on performances that maintain the original artistic standards.Mr. Schussel’s contention that he can present the works “will cause serious and irreparable harm” to their artistic integrity, the plaintiffs argue, as well as “irreparable devaluation of the work and serious and irreparable damage to the artistic reputations of Ms. Dudley, Ms. Maslow and Ms. Anthony.”Mr. Schussel did not respond to a telephone message last week. But his lawyer, John R. Sachs Jr., said the dances belonged to the company and questioned the plaintiffs’ motives. The lawsuit was filed in June, and Mr. Schussel and the New Dance Group studio filed court papers in response on Friday.“The New Dance Group considers these dances to be part of its heritage — what it does and the contribution it makes,” Mr. Sachs said. “These choreographers were closely associated with the company as employees or board members and were doing the choreography under the auspices of the New Dance Group.” The other side says none of the three choreographers in question were paid for that role.Mr. Sachs said the two heirs and Ms. Anthony were mainly interested in being paid, threatening a lawsuit before performances of three works in June at the New Dance Group. The performances of the works — “Harmonica Breakdown” and “Time Is Money” by Ms. Dudley and “Folksay” by Ms. Maslow — were canceled just days before they were to take place.“They don’t want us to do it unless New Dance Group pays these people,” Mr. Sachs said. “As usual, it’s all about money.”The three works are representative of what the group stood for. “Folksay,” from 1942, is a cheerful number based on Carl Sandburg’s poem “The People, Yes,” mixing dance, song and dialogue. Guthrie sang in some early performances.“Harmonica Breakdown” (1938) is set to harmonica and washboard music and is meant to convey Dust Bowl-era despondency. “Time Is Money” (1934) is an anticapitalist statement and was first performed, the lawsuit says, at the Workers’ Dance League Revolutionary Solo Dances.Ms. Dudley, who died in 2001 after living in England for three decades, and Ms. Maslow, together with William Bales, formed a well-known trio. The children of the two women — Ms. Blatt and Mr. Hurwitz — have known each other since childhood. Ms. Dudley, Ms. Maslow and Ms. Anthony all taught at the New Dance Group, and Ms. Dudley was on its board from 1936 to 1965, the lawsuit says. Their works and other New Dance Group pieces are occasionally revived on smaller stages.'"
"'07-09-04,'1','The residents of this town on the shore of Lake Garda — in northern Italy, between Venice and Milan — realized that a minute before midnight on Nov. 24, 2004, when an earthquake registering 5.2 damaged hundreds of buildings. Since then Mauro Biasin, an architect, has been overseeing the restoration of nearly 300 damaged churches and monasteries. Many are still closed and carry signs saying, “Closed because of earthquake damage.” There were no deaths, but Mr. Biasin points out that had it struck exactly one month later, the churches would have been filled for Christmas Eve.The church of Santa Margherita di Scozia in Carpeneda di Vobarno above Lake Garda was built in 1949, just a few years before anti-earthquake construction regulations went into effect. The 2004 earthquake detached the facade and opened gaping cracks on the triumphal arch as well as minor cracks above the windows. It also loosened and rotated beams, Mr. Biasin said. The restoration consisted of joining all the various elements of the building — walls, apses and roof — using steel tie-rods and trusses. The damaged frescoes were restored by the original painter. The church was reinaugurated in June.The buildings that Mr. Biasin has restored in the last three years are about to become textbook cases for the initiative, because his work was directed by the study group that developed the guidelines. Steered by information from the group, Mr. Biasin’s restorations eschewed reinforced concrete, a material commonly used in the past because it had been found seismically resistant in contemporary structures.The project will be a good case study, Mr. Biasin said in an interview in his office in Brescia. “The calculations say this will work. I just hope I don’t live long enough to experience the next major earthquake to see if they actually do.”Sergio Lagomarsino, a professor of structural engineering at the University of Genoa who helped create the working group, said, “Great faith used to be placed in reinforced concrete.” But it is now known that concrete doesn’t interact well with traditional masonry; it’s not flexible enough, and its salts have been known to ruin stonework. Interventions in concrete, were “often invasive,” he said.Seismic improvements and strengthening interventions like inserting tie-rods or adding upper stringcourses, or horizontal bands, to the masonry can be designed case by case to meet specific weaknesses. “Every building is different, so no rule will apply to all,” said Carlo Blasi, a professor of architectural restoration at the University of Parma.This means that for each historical building, the seismic history of the region and the vulnerability of the structure is examined, and its cultural significance is taken into account in determining its vulnerability.“The key thing is that a building doesn’t collapse during an earthquake,” Ms. Moro said. “But if the building is culturally important — having, say, a significant fresco — then making sure it doesn’t collapse isn’t enough. You have to limit the damages too.”Money to cover the evaluation and eventual strengthening of a structure are drawn mostly from existing budgets, depending on who owns the building. Many government institutions and private entities already set aside money for monitoring a building’s state of health. “Seismic safety has to become a criterion for all interventions,” said Ms. Moro, who coordinates a database (www.benitutelati.it) of the state of conservation and the seismic risk to individual cultural buildings. “The problem is getting people to set limited funds aside for something that can’t be predicted, like an earthquake.”The Culture Ministry and the Civil Protection Agency report that more than 64 percent of Italy — more than 3,000 municipalities — faces a medium to high risk of serious damage from an earthquake. In all about 500,000 buildings in Italy, many of them private, will have to be examined.Compared to other earthquake-sensitive areas like California or Japan, “the damage in Italy can be potentially higher because older buildings are more vulnerable,” said Mauro Dolce, director of the department in the Civil Protection Agency that assesses seismic risk. Culturally significant historic buildings are also under special surveillance because many house hospitals, schools and other public institutions.Experts believe that preventive action, including seismic retrofitting, can reduce future costs to the state. After an earthquake devastated parts of southern Italy in October 2002, killing 27 schoolchildren, rental fees for scaffolding topped 5.2 million euros, more than $7 million. That is “about a fifth of what the state is spending to restore the Uffizi and double the exhibition space,” the Culture Ministry noted.“In the last 25 years more than 75 billion euros have been spent in post-seismic reconstruction, not to mention the loss of lives that could have been avoided,” Mr. Cecchi said, adding that preventive measures “would have cost a fraction of that.”Yet the experts have no illusions. “No building can ever be safe, so we’re really talking about an objective to reach that will be determined in any case by the available resources,” said Michele Calvi, an engineer at the University of Pavia specializing in seismic design. “The guidelines are just a start.”Applying them may also uncover other, existing structural problems. “It’s like an old woman who falls and breaks her leg,” Mr. Biasin said. “She’s still going to have a variety of ailments caused by her age.”'"
"'07-09-04,'1','Cellphones are everywhere these days, so why shouldn’t they be in the wild, as well? That question has occurred to scientists who have begun using cellular technology to track animals in the field.But cellphones have yet to find much use in playback experiments to study how wild animals communicate. The thinking has been that the audio quality is not good enough. (Sound familiar?)Dale Joachim and Eben Goodale of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tested whether cellular audio was good enough to play and record animal sounds in the wild. Using a Nokia phone with an external speaker and a microphone set up in a forest, they played recorded calls from screech and barred owls.As described in Biology Letters, they found no difference in response by owls of both species to calls played through the cellphone or through a more conventional CD system. And the audio quality of the response calls picked up by the phone was good enough for a listener to distinguish between the two species.The researchers say cell technology could be useful for similar communication experiments. An array of phones could be set up over a wide area, and a researcher at a remote location could send calls or other sounds to any or all of them — as long as they are in reach of a cell tower.'"
"'07-09-04,'1','Dr. Robert D. Truog, professor of medical ethics and anesthesia at the Harvard Medical School, lists three categories of living organ donation: directed donation, to a loved one or friend; nondirected donation, in which the organ goes to the general pool to be transplanted into the recipient at the top of the waiting list; and directed donation to a stranger, in which a donor gives to a specific person with whom there is no emotional connection.And, Dr. Truog added in an essay in The New England Journal of Medicine in August 2005, “Each type of donation prompts distinct ethical concerns.”When, as with Ms. Fox and Mr. Maloney, the donated organ is destined for a loved one or friend, there is the possibility of coercion — intense pressure on the potential donor to risk the surgery, as well as the chance that the transplant will not succeed. For those who do not want to go forward with a living organ donation and say so to the doctors involved, transplant teams are typically willing to provide a reasonable medical excuse to enable the person to bow out gracefully.But, Dr. Truog noted, there are “situations in which people feel compelled to donate regardless of the consequences to themselves.” He told of a case in which a child was dying of respiratory failure. Both parents “insisted on donating lobes of their lungs in a desperate but unsuccessful attempt to save her life.”He maintains that in such cases it is not enough to obtain informed consent from the potential donor. Rather, he said, “physicians are obligated to prevent people from making potentially life-threatening sacrifices, unless the chance of success is proportionately large.”In nondirected donations to the general transplant pool, it is important to explore what has motivated the person to make such a sacrifice for an anonymous recipient.The possibilities include personality or emotional disturbances like depression, low self-esteem, an abnormal desire for attention or a desire to become involved in the recipient’s life. Or the person may simply want to repay a kindness to society, perhaps because a loved one’s life was saved by an organ from a deceased donor.But when the motive is suspect, transplant teams are supposed to assess the reasons and prohibit donations that raise serious concerns.Recently, there has been an increase in organ donations directed to strangers who may advertise their need for transplants through the news media, the Internet and even on billboards. Although there is nothing illegal about soliciting a donor organ, the practice is inherently unfair and raises the possibility of buying and selling organs, which the medical community considers highly unethical. Donated organs are considered a “gift of life,” not a commodity to be bought and sold.There is a national list of people awaiting transplants, and those who are the sickest, though rarely the wealthiest, are at the top. But when donations are directed to strangers, potential recipients “who have the most compelling stories and the means to advertise their plight tend to be the ones who get the organs, rather than those most in need,” Dr. Truog said.There are other possible wrinkles in donations directed to strangers. The donor may insist that the donation not go to a recipient of a particular race, religion or ethnic group. One case, in which a white brain-dead donor specified that his organs go just to white recipients, prompted Florida to pass a law prohibiting patients and families from restricting donations in this way.Another case was less clear-cut. A Jewish man in New York learned of a Jewish child in Los Angeles who needed a kidney and said he would donate a kidney to help this child. This is clearly a discriminatory donation, even though it would enable those below the child on the transplant list to move up a notch. On the other hand, if the donation was not allowed, no one would benefit, because the man would not offer his kidney to anyone else.Pressure is mounting to establish a national registry of live donors, people who were willing to donate organs to relatives or friends but were not good matches.Through such a registry, patients anywhere in the country could “swap” one of their donors who is not a match for a donor who is. Such programs have the potential to increase significantly the donor pool and the success of transplants, because the surgery can be done before the patient is deathly ill. In recent years, small donor exchange programs have been established by the Johns Hopkins Medical Center, the New England Organ Bank and the Ohio Paired Donation Consortium.'"
"'07-09-04,'1','Women whose ovaries are removed before menopause may be at increased risk for dementia, a new study reports.Researchers studied 1,489 women who had one or both ovaries removed, comparing them with a control group of 1,472 with intact ovaries. The team followed the women for 25 to 30 years, interviewing them or a caregiver to determine mental status.The younger the women at surgery, the greater the risk for neurological and mental disorders. Women who had operations before 43 had a 67 percent higher risk of mental impairment compared with women who had intact ovaries through menopause. Women given estrogen replacement until 50 had no increased risk, although the number of women treated was too small to be statistically significant.The authors, writing in the Sept. 11 issue of Neurology, theorize that estrogen deficiency caused by ovary removal is the initial impetus for physiological changes that increase the risk for mental impairment. “Oophorectomy was once thought to be purely an advantage — it prevents ovarian cancer and seemed to have no disadvantage,” said Dr. Walter A. Rocca of the Mayo Clinic, the lead author of the study. “There are still situations where it’s a good idea, but not for all women.”'"
"'07-09-04,'1','Take a weeklong trip between Teterboro in New Jersey, the major business jet airport in the New York area, and St. Martin in the Caribbean, on a speedy eight-seat Citation X large-cabin jet. That’s about seven hours of total flying time, and another seven hours of ferrying the airplane from and to. The ferry fee would have been about $15,000, Mr. Santulli said.The new policy divides destinations into four zones. Ferry fees for light jets like Hawker 400XPs and Citation V Ultras are waived for Mexico and the Caribbean. Owners of midsize jets like Hawker 900XPs and Citation Sovereigns also get waivers for Central America, and Hawaii is added for owners of supermidsize jets like Citation Xs and Hawker 4000s. For owners of large-cabin jets like Falcon 2000EXs and Gulfstream 450 and 550s, ferry fees are also waived for major destinations in Europe, Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Russia. NetJets has more than 60 of the big Gulfstreams.NetJets, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has expanded significantly internationally, especially in Europe. Asked one day last week how the NetJets fleet was deployed at that moment, Mr. Santulli tapped on his keyboard and said: “It’s a slow day. We’ll have about 452 revenue trips here in America. Our Gulfstreams are in 15 different countries; our European fleet is in 30 countries; we have airplanes in China, a couple in Russia, a lot all over Eastern and Western Europe; some in Mexico; six in the Caribbean.”In recent years, NetJets has been depending on a new source of revenue — selling business jet trips by the hour rather than just selling fractional ownership shares in an airplane. The company’s Marquis Jet Card program sells flight time on specific models in 25-hour blocks, without the complications (or potential tax benefits) of actual ownership. Twenty-five hours of flying time on a light jet, for example, costs about $140,000 a year. The jet card business now accounts for most of NetJets’ growth, Mr. Santulli said.Fractional shares are sold in increments starting at one-sixteenth of a share in a plane (which provides about 50 hours of annual flying time). The average NetJets fractional-share owner spends about $300,000 a year on flying over and above the initial purchase cost, Mr. Santulli said.One of dozens of competitors in the market, however, says that the fractional ownership market is flat, and that the jet card model, whether sold by NetJets or other companies, does not adequately serve one of the industry’s fastest-growing segments, the high-volume business jet flier who needs a lot more than 25 or even 100 hours a year.XOJet Inc. has 12 Citation X jets with eight more on order. While the company sells flight time by the hour, when available, its main customer base is a growing breed of traveler who contracts to fly “200 hours or 500 hours or more a year,” said Nick Solinger, the chief marketing officer.About 11,000 business jets are now in the skies, up from about 6,000 in 2000, according to industry data. Major manufacturers are selling all the airplanes they can make, and individual aircraft are flying more hours than ever. “You see the high-volume business traveler really stepping up,” said Mr. Solinger, who says his average customer flies 300 to 400 hours a year on a Citation X. “That’s what’s driving the industry’s growth.”'"

If a person likes the song and wants to buy it on iTunes, tapping an icon on the screen will download the song.Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ chief executive, said Starbucks stores in the United States are being equipped to manage this process. He said that stores in Seattle and New York City would have the capability by Oct. 2, and that other stores across the country would get the service over the next two years.In other announcements, Apple announced a new iPod Nano, squatter than before, but with a bigger screen for viewing video. The 4-gigabyte model will sell for $149 and an 8-gigabyte model will sell for $199.The company said the original iPod will be dubbed the Classic. An 80-gigabyte model will be sold for $249, and a 160-gigabyte model will sell for $349.But it was the iPhone price cut that got the most attention, raising questions about the device’s continued success.Apple executives insisted that the move had been planned long ago and that the pricing strategy was conceived in part to keep the iPhone’s pricing in line with its new iPod Touch. But the sharp price cut suggested that even Apple, which has long lived in a pricing bubble insulated from other personal computer makers, is not immune from the brutal pressures of the cellular phone business.“My suspicion is that they got to 750,000 really quickly, and then it started to slow down,” said Van Baker, an industry analyst at Gartner Group.Mr. Jobs had previously said that the company would sell its first million iPhones by the end of this month, and 10 million phones by the end of 2008. On stage today he reiterated the company’s goal of selling a million by the end of the month, but now at a much lower price.“They have decided to become extremely aggressive,” Mr. Baker said.Another breakthrough Apple product, the original Macintosh, initially sold briskly in 1984 and then stalled abruptly. The Macintosh market did not regain its luster until 1986 with the introduction of the Macintosh II.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','Stocks fell sharply today after a report suggested that the troubles in the housing market were deepening. The sell-off briefly intensified after a Federal Reserve survey of regional conditions suggested that the credit crisis did not appear to be affecting the broader economy aside from housing.The survey, known as the beige book, disappointed some investors who are hoping that Fed policy makers cut their benchmark short-term interest rate, now at 5.25 percent, when they meet on Sept. 18.The major stock averages were down all day, and the loss on the Dow Jones industrial average reached 200 points shortly after the Fed report’s release. The Dow closed at 13,305.27, off 143.39 for the day, or 1.1 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 1.2 percent.Treasury prices jumped, as investors sought safety in debt backed by the federal government. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.47 percent, from 4.55 percent on Tuesday.Earlier in the day, an index that tracks signing of contracts for existing home sales tumbled 12.2 percent in July to its lowest level in more than six years, the National Association of Realtors reported. The trade group said that its members were reporting that buyers of homes were having a tougher time obtaining financing.A recent spike in the interest rates banks and mortgage companies charge for jumbo home loans — those above $417,000 — appears to be having a sizable impact. Pending home sales dropped by nearly 21 percent in the West, where home prices are higher than in most of the country.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','Boeing’s shares fell as much as one percent before recovering. They were down about 0.25 percent in late trading in New York.Speculation about a 787 flight-test delay has been mounting for months. At the Paris air show in June, Scott Carson, chief executive of Boeing’s commercial aircraft division, indicated that the company expected to have the first 787 flying by the end of September — already a month later than a previous August target. At the time, Boeing attributed the delay to a global shortage of fasteners that hold the plane’s huge fuselage, wing and tail sections together.Mr. Bair said today that in addition to the fastener shortage, the company and its production partners had run into unanticipated snags involving production of certain specialized parts for the plane as well as the programming of its flight-control software.He described every new aircraft development program as a “voyage of discovery” that often involves hiccups that cannot be anticipated even by state-of-the-art computer modeling software and logistics experts.“We underestimated the complexity” of the production process, Mr. Bair said. “We didn’t simulate missing thousands of fasteners, so we were surprised by that. It wasn’t something that was on our radar screen.”Production of the 787 is being spread across a global consortium of industrial partners, part of a strategy that Boeing says will cut costs and spread the financial risks involved the project.The Dreamliner is also the first large commercial jet to be made largely from so-called composite materials — high-technology plastics aimed at making the plane more fuel efficient and cheaper to maintain than traditional aluminum aircraft.Yet despite the plans to use new materials and largely untried manufacturing processes, Boeing has always envisioned an ambitious flight-test schedule for the Dreamliner. The company originally planned a window of about nine months from first flight until first delivery — two months fewer than it took to test its last new commercial plane, the 777.The delay announced today now leaves the company just six months to test and certify the six planes involved in the testing program.“It was already a very aggressive flight-test program,” said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm in Virginia. “Now it’s an extremely aggressive one.”That said, Mr. Aboulafia and others remain willing to give Boeing the benefit of the doubt that it will meet its promised delivery deadlines.“I am disappointed that we haven’t seen a first flight by now,” said Howard Wheeldon, a senior strategist at BCG Partners in London. “But this is a large public company. They can’t afford to be arrogant and mislead in any way.”'"
"'07-09-05,'0','Reports of the discovery at a United Nations office last week of a potentially deadly chemical from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq unleashed a rash of embarrassing questions about the world body’s fact-finding abilities. How did the sample get there? How did it get misplaced after being collected by U.N. inspectors in 1996? And how could it sit in a box, unnoticed, for over a decade at a vaunted world agency in the middle of New York?But now, heaping embarrassment upon embarrassment, it appears the chemical may not have been so deadly after all. Preliminary tests indicate the substance, initially believed to be a choking agent called phosgene, was merely a commercial solvent, a law enforcement official said.“We learned later that initial tests indicated it might be some kind of over-the-counter solvent,” the official said. “Though we don’t know what kind.”The development was first reported by The Daily News.The sample, sealed in a container inside a plastic bag, was reported to federal authorities last Thursday after being discovered in the offices of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission at East 48th Street, one block north of U.N. headquarters. Workers happened upon it while clearing out filing cabinets and boxes, a spokeswoman said.The sample was unmarked save for an inventory number, which, when crosschecked with old records, indicated that it was phosgene collected from a chemical weapons facility in 1996 in Samarra, Iraq. Phosgene is made of carbon monoxide and chlorine, and was used in World War I and by Mr. Hussein against the Kurds in the 1980s. Even in small doses, it can wreak havoc on the eyes, skin, throat and lungs. In large doses, it can kill.After the discovery, the State Department was alerted, and so were the F.B.I. and the New York Police Department. Members of a joint hazardous material team flooded the offices, and workers were evacuated. The sample was removed and sent for testing to a laboratory in Edgewood, Md., where, according to a law enforcement official, early tests indicated that it was not phosgene after all.Farhan Haq, a spokesman for the U.N., said in an e-mail that the agency had not received official notification about the early results, and thus could not comment on them.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','Norman Hsu, the fugitive fund-raiser for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and other Democrats who turned himself in to California authorities last week, failed to show up for a court appearance today, and his lawyer said Mr. Hsu’s whereabouts were unknown.Mr. Hsu, who had been free on $2 million bond, was scheduled to appear in Superior Court in Redwood City at 9 a.m. Pacific time to surrender his passport. But when the appointed time came and went with no sign of Mr. Hsu, his lawyer and prosecutors met in chambers with the judge, who then announced he was revoking Mr. Hsu’s bail and issuing a new warrant for his arrest.“We do not know where he is at this moment,” said James Brosnahan, Mr. Hsu’s lawyer. “We hope he will be court today.”Mr. Hsu’s absence seemed to be a repeat of his disappearing act in 1992, when he skipped out on a sentencing hearing related to his conviction in a fraud case, only to re-emerge years later as a major Democratic fund-raiser in New York. Since 2003, he personally contributed $600,000 to Democrats around the country and raised hundreds of thousands more, frequently hosting fund-raising parties and getting his picture taken with prominent politicians.He was a designated “Hillraiser” for Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign, meaning he had bundled over $100,000 in contributions from others. Last week, the Clinton campaign said it was given to charity $23,000 Mr. Hsu had donated, and was reviewing other contributions he helped raised for any evidence of illegality.Also last week, Mr. Hsu resigned from the board of the New School in New York, where he had served as a trustee and a member of the board of governors of the Eugene Lang College there.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','“Tomorrow, I don’t want to run more,” Ferrer said in his on-court interview. “Now I am very tired. To beat Rafa, I have to run a lot. I’m sorry for that, for my friend, for my partner, Rafa. Thanks a lot for the people to support me.”Nadal left the court quickly after the match, dispirited that his aching knee and sore hand had failed him. Ferrer, meanwhile, advanced to the quarterfinals to play Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina.“Sure, disappointed for me, but that’s tennis, that’s the sport,” Nadal said in the post-match news conference. “I was having a very good season. I’m disappointed, I couldn’t play 100 percent in the tournament because of the knees, and maybe that affected a little bit my physical performance.”But Nadal also said he did not want to use his physical problems as an excuse and was quick to compliment his countryman. “He’s a very good player, he’s having an unbelievable season,” Nadal said. Earlier this summer, in Cincinnati, Ferrer also defeated Andy Roddick.Nadal finished his season of Grand Slam events having defeated Roger Federer at the French Open for his third consecutive title in Paris. But after losing to Federer in the Wimbledon final, Nadal did not have the chance to renew his rivalry with the world’s No. 1 player and prove he could win on this surface. At just 21, he is breaking down on the hardcourts.Nadal started the tournament unsure of whether he would even be able to play, with tendinitis in his left knee. During this match, he called for the trainer to ice the ring finger on his left hand. He appeared to cramp in his leg in the last game, sweating it out until the end.Nadal saved one match point on his serve, but he could not keep up with Ferrer, who tracked every ball as if his career depended on it. On the second match point, Nadal’s volley sailed long at 1:51 a.m., the third-latest match ever at the U.S. Open.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','No one seems to know how the impasse will be resolved. Mr. Bush, in Australia on Tuesday, lamented the failure of Congress to complete action on any of the regular spending bills.In the vote on Mr. Nussle’s nomination, Senate Democrats were evenly divided, with 23 supporting confirmation and 23 opposed. No Republican voted against the nomination.The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said they were voting against Mr. Nussle to show their profound disagreement with Mr. Bush’s policies.“The president has turned record surpluses into record deficits by giving hundreds of billions of tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans while borrowing nearly $500 billion to finance the Iraq civil war,” Mr. Reid said.Mr. Conrad said that Mr. Nussle, a former chairman of the House Budget Committee, was “clearly qualified” to be budget director. But, Mr. Conrad said, the vote was “a question of what policy we pursue in the future.” And, he said, Mr. Nussle was an architect of what he described as Mr. Bush’s misguided tax and spending policies.“Spending is up dramatically,” Mr. Conrad said. “Real revenue has stagnated. The deficit and the debt have soared.”Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, led the opposition to Mr. Nussle, whom he described as a symbol of everything wrong with Mr. Bush’s domestic policies.“The Bush administration is completely out of touch with the harsh economic reality facing tens of millions of American families,” Mr. Sanders said. “We need a budget director who will make this president understand what the ordinary American family is going through. Unfortunately, there’s nothing in former Congressman Nussle’s background to suggest that he is that person.”Republicans defended Mr. Bush’s fiscal policies. “I hope Congressman Nussle continues those policies,” said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee.Mr. Gregg said the Bush tax cuts had produced “a huge influx of revenues to the federal government,” and he praised Mr. Nussle as an advocate of fiscal discipline.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said Mr. Nussle had displayed “an encyclopedic grasp of the federal budget process and an understanding of the importance of good relations between the executive branch and Congress.”Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut and the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, supported the nomination. But Mr. Lieberman said, “I do so with the understanding that Congressman Nussle will have to exercise the full measure of his diplomatic skills at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue” to work out a compromise with Congress.Mr. Lieberman said he hoped the coming confrontation would not lead to a shutdown of parts of the federal government, like the ones in 1995 and 1996. “No one gains from such a stalemate,” he said.The Senate on Tuesday also moved toward approval of a spending bill that provides $109 billion for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs. That is $4 billion more than Mr. Bush requested. The bill includes $87.5 billion for veterans health care, which is $3.6 billion more than Mr. Bush requested.The White House said Tuesday that the extra money was not needed. But Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, the senior Republican on the subcommittee responsible for the bill, said the White House had assured her that Mr. Bush would sign the bill.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','The troubled Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, set to be closed despite a roster of prominent alumni, for the first time accepted no freshman class. It is sharing its building with three small schools that will eventually replace it.At Jamaica High School, students arrived to find that the state had designated their school as “persistently dangerous” and that their principal, Jay A. Dickler, had been abruptly removed.But the most closely watched hotspot was one of the city’s smallest schools, Khalil Gibran International Academy, a new school in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, devoted to Arabic language and culture. As the school’s 55 sixth graders filed in, about 70 supporters gathered with a banner welcoming them and nearly as many reporters, some from other countries, arrived to document the opening.About two dozen opponents, meanwhile, took to the steps of City Hall, charging that the academy would indoctrinate students with radical Islamic beliefs and again demanding that it be shut down.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein arrived at Public School 53 in the Morrisania section of the Bronx yesterday morning flanked by Gov. Eliot Spitzer and City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn as well as Randi Weingarten, the president of the city’s teachers’ union, and Ernest A. Logan, the president of the principals’ union.It was a carefully choreographed display of unity for one day at least among leaders who have sparred intensely in the recent past.“In the new school year, we are ready to take student success to the next level, because while our schools are getting better, we need to do even more,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “There will be even greater accountability,” he said, citing as a prime example new report cards in which schools will be given letter grades of A through F.Mr. Spitzer used the occasion to note the additional $700 million in state aid that the city schools will receive this year, the first influx of billions more dollars the state has promised as a result of a 14-year court battle over school financing. Still, the governor emphasized that the city would have to meet several state requirements to receive a portion of the money.“Writing a check is easy,” Mr. Spitzer said. “Ensuring that there is accountability, ensuring that we then get the result that we care about is the much more difficult task.”Mr. Klein went on to visit schools in the four other boroughs.As television cameras awaited the mayor, Beatrice Dones used her video camera to capture her son Mark, 5, as he headed off to the first grade, a Power Rangers backpack on his shoulders.Asked what he was most excited about, Mark exclaimed: “Homework!”But outside Public School-Intermediate School 194 in the Bronx, Hannah Beauchampe, 5, her hair pulled back in two tight pigtails, sobbed to her mother that she was not ready to start kindergarten. “Mommy, please don’t make me,” she pleaded.At one of the city’s temporary registration centers, also at P.S.-I.S. 194, parents whose children were not placed in schools or were seeking transfers waited, sometimes for hours.“People talk about No Child Left Behind, but believe me, there are children being left behind today,” said Hancel Brooks, whose daughter was trying to transfer to a high school closer to the family’s Bronx home.At Khalil Gibran, where the founding principal resigned before school began after trying to defend the word intifada on a T-shirt, the school’s supporters held a banner reading “New Yorkers Support the Khalil Gibran School,” and set up a table loaded with hummus, pitas and apple juice.“The school is a vision of tolerance,” said Rabbi Michael Feinberg of the Greater New York Labor-Religion Coalition.After dismissal, Adnane Rhoulam, 12, said he and other students had learned to count to three in Arabic and to say “hello” three different ways. Adnane, whose mother is from Morocco, said he hoped to “understand more about what my mom’s talking about.”Mr. Klein, speaking to reporters, described the outcry against the school as “tragic,” saying, “I think most New Yorkers understand the importance of dual language education. The school is going to open up and do well.”But the school’s opponents continued their campaign against it. “I’m heartsick to see that our good mayor and our good chancellor are part of a program to destroy the American public school system,” said Rabbi Aryeh Spero, who said he is president of a group called Caucus for America.At Jamaica High School, a sign on the school’s front lawn still proclaimed Mr. Dickler to be the principal, and students and parents debated how dangerous the school really was and who bore the blame.Terrence Stith, 16, a sophomore, said he met the school’s new interim acting principal during football practice last week.“He said he was going to stop all the violence,” Terrence said. “The way he was talking it seemed like it could be a good thing. But with Principal Dickler there wasn’t that much violence. They’re taking it too far.”Sharlene Joseph, 15, said she occasionally felt unsafe at school, particularly when fights would break out in the hallways. Still, she said of Mr. Dickler, “I think he was doing a pretty good job.”At Lafayette, Juan M. Camilo, a math teacher, mourned the decision to close the school and said it had left him questioning his own effectiveness.Mr. Camilo said he was optimistic that this year would be better than last, when teachers sparred bitterly with the school’s former principal. But he noted, “You always feel good on the first day.”'"
"'07-09-05,'0','“More than a lack of credit, there is a lack of confidence about where the economy is heading,” Mr. Carter said. “Many buyers are tightening their purse strings on big-ticket items such as autos.”Sales have particularly dropped in states like California, Nevada and Florida, where the housing market has weakened considerably.Jesse Toprak, director of industry analysis at Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives car-buying advice to consumers, said: “They’re not sure about the future value of their house so they’re postponing purchases, or they may be buying cheaper vehicles. They may also be buying nothing at all and getting a used car instead.”Strong sales of fuel-efficient passenger cars, as gasoline prices remained near $3 a gallon in much of the country, helped Honda and Nissan increase their market shares.Ford’s market share fell to 13.7 percent, excluding three European brands that the company is expected to sell soon, matching its low in July, when the three Detroit automakers combined to fall below 50 percent of the market for the first time.Chrysler’s sales fell 6.1 percent. Both G.M. and Ford reduced their full-year forecasts for the industry, and overall sales, down 3 percent from January to August, according to Autodata, are on pace to be the lowest since at least 1998.Discounts are partly responsible for G.M.’s better-than-expected performance in August. G.M. has been ramping up discounts in an effort to keep Toyota, which has offered sizable rebates and no-interest financing on its Tundra pickup, from eating away at its share of that profitable segment.“We’re going to defend that turf,” said G.M.’s chief sales analyst, Paul Ballew. “We need to, for the overall health and position of our brands in the marketplace.”G.M. also had a good month for some vehicles that had not been discounted, like its new large crossover vehicles: the Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia and Saturn Outlook. The Enclave has the fastest turn rate, or the time at a dealership before being sold, of any General Motors vehicle.Ford fared poorly in August, with sales of its passenger cars plummeting 37 percent.Mark Fields, president of Ford’s Americas division, acknowledged at a dinner with reporters on Aug. 22 that dealership sales had fallen more than executives expected, at a time when Ford was cutting back on less-profitable sales to rental car companies.Its chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, who was also at the dinner, expressed concern about the macroeconomic conditions that had hurt the industry this summer.“Our business is really dependent on consumer confidence,” Mr. Mulally said.Ford said its fourth-quarter production would be 5.6 percent higher than in the final months of 2006, when the company cut output by 24 percent, the most since the 1980s.Standard & Poor’s Equity Research on Tuesday reduced its forecast for full-year sales to 16.2 million units, from 16.3 million, matching Edmunds’ and Autodata’s projections. In 2006, automakers sold 16.55 million vehicles, and at one point, some had expected the industry to reach 17 million this year.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','LAS VEGAS, Sept. 4 — Steve Fossett, the millionaire adventurer, disappeared on Monday after taking off from a ranch for a brief recreational flight in a single-engine plane.Mr. Fossett, 63, took off from the ranch, owned by William Barron Hilton, the hotel magnate, at 8 a.m. He was expected back by noon to leave the ranch with his wife on a private jet, said Maj. Cynthia S. Ryan, a spokeswoman for the Civil Air Patrol Nevada Wing.On Tuesday, searchers looked in the mountains of western Nevada for him. As many as 14 aircraft searched several hundred square miles for signs of Mr. Fossett or his blue-and-white Citabria Super Decathlon, Major Ryan said. The search went into the night, with a C-130 aircraft and a helicopter that use infrared imaging to see in the dark, Major Ryan said.Mr. Fossett is a veteran aviator known for his quests to set world records. In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first person to fly around the world uninterrupted in a hot air balloon. Last year, he completed the longest nonstop flight in aviation history, flying 26,389 miles in 76 hours in a lightweight experimental plane.Mr. Fossett, an investment executive, is also a sailor and racecar driver. He has applied to the Bureau of Land Management to let him try to break the land-speed record in a jet-powered race car in the northern Nevada desert next year.Mr. Fossett took off heading south from the Flying-M Ranch, 75 miles southeast of Reno. A spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, Alison Duquette, said that Mr. Fossett’s family called when he did not return and that the F.A.A. issued a notice on Tuesday morning to all pilots in the area to look for wreckage.Major Ryan said she remained optimistic that Mr. Fossett would be found alive, if only because the weather was comfortable at night and Mr. Fossett is a highly skilled pilot.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller faced pressure to concede defeat as officials began a final tally of ballots from an election Monday praised by international observers as “professional and transparent.” With her People’s National Party apparently suffering a razor-thin defeat, she refused to give up, saying the final count, expected to take two days, could shift some close races. Preliminary returns gave the opposition Labor Party 31 of the 60 seats in the House of Representatives, just large enough to end the governing party’s nearly 20 years in power and make Bruce Golding, the Labor leader, prime minister. In an editorial, The Gleaner, Jamaica’s leading newspaper, urged Ms. Simpson Miller to accept defeat. “Political leaders need to both show statesmanship and encourage calm and good sense, not the opposite,” it said.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','But he went on to say: “I don’t think it translates, necessarily, into foreign policy or national security expertise. I know of nothing in his background that indicates that he has any experience in it, with him or Romney.”The remarks represented a departure for Mr. McCain, who has usually refrained from questioning the experience of his rivals. And he has until now shied from any criticism of Mr. Giuliani, whom he describes as a friend and often praises.Asked about Mr. McCain’s remarks, Maria Comella, a spokeswoman for the Giuliani campaign, said, “The mayor considers John McCain a friend and continues to have the utmost respect for him and for his service to our country.”Mr. Giuliani spent Tuesday highlighting his Sept. 11 experience during a visit to Pearl, Miss., where he drew heavily on his experiences in New York after the attacks and in calling for a restructuring of the Department of Homeland Security.His remarks were somewhat of a departure from his recent appearances, where Mr. Giuliani has chosen not to dwell on the details of that day. “I saw a man throwing himself out of the 101st, 102nd floor of the north tower,"" he said to a hushed crowd.The McCain comments also drew a rebuke from the campaign of Mr. Romney, whose spokesman, Kevin Madden, said: “One of the problems with Washington right now is that everyone inside the Beltway thinks the only ideas that exist are the ones on Capitol Hill or in the halls of the bureaucracy there. That’s just not the case. Governor Romney’s experience has been built over a lifetime of making decisions and achieving results instead of just assigning blame.”Mr. McCain plans to spend much of September trying to win support for continuing President Bush’s strategy in Iraq, and is planning rallies with other former prisoners of war and veterans of the Iraq war in early primary states as well as debating the issue on the Senate floor.Asked about Mr. Bush’s remarks on Monday during a surprise trip to Iraq that raised the possibility of some form of troop withdrawal, Mr. McCain said they were consistent with what he was supporting.“At some point if the strategy succeeds, the logical endpoint is the Iraqis being able to assume enough responsibilities that we begin withdrawing,” he said.Earlier, at Concord High School, Mr. McCain faced some tough questioning from the students. One noted that Mr. McCain, who is 71, would be the oldest president elected to a first term if he won, and asked him if he worried that he might die in office, or get Alzheimer’s disease, or something else that could affect his judgment.Mr. McCain answered by talking about his vigor, and noting that one of his sons sometimes jokes that he is getting to the point where he hides his own Easter eggs. “Thanks for the question, you little jerk,” he finished, to laughter. “You’re drafted.”Then another student, William Sleastor, 16, asked Mr. McCain what he planned to do about “L.G.B.T. rights.” When Mr. McCain looked puzzled, the student explained that the initials stand for “lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender.”“I had not heard that phrase before,” Mr. McCain said. Then, with a glance at the student who asked about his age, he said, “That authenticates your comment.”'"
"'07-09-05,'0','A panel of software experts yesterday unexpectedly rebuffed Microsoft’s bid to have its open document format, Office Open XML, recognized as an international standard. The decision complicates the company’s effort to extend its dominance to the emerging field of open documents.After five months of electronic balloting, Microsoft failed to meet the two voting criteria to win a designation as an approved standard from the Geneva-based International Organization for Standardization, or the I.S.O., and the International Electrotechnical Commission, or I.E.C.The fight over the standard, while technically arcane, is commercially important because more governments are demanding interchangeable open document formats for their vast amounts of records, instead of proprietary formats tied to one company’s software. The only standardized format now available to government buyers is OpenDocument Format, developed by a consortium led by I.B.M., which the I.S.O. approved in May 2006.The timing of the decision may be inopportune for Microsoft, coming two weeks before the European Court of First Instance is to rule on its appeal of the European Commission’s 2004 antitrust decision against the company.Of the 87 countries that participated, 26 percent opposed Microsoft’s bid. Under the rules for approval, no more than 25 percent of the countries could oppose the bid. Microsoft also failed to win the vote of 66 percent of 41 countries on another panel of I.S.O. and I.E.C. members.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','“It is one of the last of its kind,” said Paul Gallay, executive director of the Westchester Land Trust, a nonprofit organization.“There are very few estates on the Hudson waterfront that have been kept together,” he said. “There are religious and educational institutions of this size, but one by one most of the old large estates in this part of Westchester have been subdivided.”Mr. Gallay said his organization would probably reach out to Mr. Marshall to discuss the possibility of donating a conservation easement, a popular means of saving open space in which a landowner agrees in perpetuity not to build on a portion of the property. Such easements can yield income and estate tax savings for the seller, Mr. Gallay said.A lawyer for Mr. Marshall, Rita W. Warner, said in a phone interview that “no decision has been made about the disposition” of Holly Hill. A family member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the struggle over Mrs. Astor’s will, said it was unlikely that Mr. Marshall, 83, who has an apartment in Manhattan and a summer house in Maine, would keep the estate.Holly Hill figured prominently in the bitter dispute over Mrs. Astor’s care that dominated headlines last summer. One of her grandsons, Philip Marshall, accused his father, Mr. Marshall, of neglecting her care while enriching himself with her wealth.One of the allegations against Mr. Marshall was that he had shut down Holly Hill to save money, thus depriving Mrs. Astor of her beloved home. (Mr. Marshall said he had wanted his mother to be close to her doctors in Manhattan.) But after Mrs. Astor’s close friend Annette de la Renta was appointed her temporary guardian in July 2006, Mrs. Astor was moved to Holly Hill, where she remained until her death.Mr. Pridemore, the rector of Trinity Episcopal Church in Ossining and a friend of Mrs. Astor’s, said the late grand dame of New York philanthropy almost never missed a weekend at Holly Hill over several decades, except during July and August, when she went to Maine.“She came to Holly Hill Friday afternoon and went back down Monday morning to work,” he said. “There was that flow and rhythm that kept her invigorated and motivated. That was the reason her friends were so distressed a year or so ago when it appeared that she was going to be held at Park Avenue, which to her was work. Even though it was an enviable residence, to her it had that association.”Mrs. Astor once said that spending time at Holly Hill was “like backing up to the Esso and getting refueled.” But she certainly was not sedentary here. She swam for exercise regularly until she turned 100, and even in the past year went on walks with help from a nurse, friends and relatives said. Mrs. Astor did not go in for large-scale entertaining but rather oversaw intimate gatherings that often included her good friend David Rockefeller, whose own estate is a few miles south in Pocantico Hills.“During the week she was out day and night,” said Mrs. Perdue, who helped manage Mrs. Astor’s business affairs. “She might have a little dinner party or a lunch, but for the most part Holly Hill was a refuge. She regrouped when she was up there.”Holly Hill was the official home of her memories, too. In what Mrs. Astor called her memory room, there were photographs upon photographs of her with presidents and other luminaries, as well as a framed letter from the Princess of Wales, thanking her for a wedding gift. “It was chock-full,” Mrs. Perdue said.Mrs. Astor bought Holly Hill in 1964, five years after the death of her third husband, Vincent Astor, who was heir to the fur and real estate fortune of John Jacob Astor. In 1973, according to village records, Mrs. Astor, who never remarried, bought a 20.2-acre parcel adjoining the original 44.2 acres.Over the years she maintained a small staff at Holly Hill: a butler, a cook, two maids and at least three gardeners. At one time the greenhouse was a showplace, with unusual specimens of orchids and cacti. Years ago, Mrs. Astor ordered the planting of tens of thousands of daffodil bulbs, which dazzled visitors in the spring.In a county known for sky-high property taxes, Holly Hill stands out; the most recent annual bill was about $170,000. Yet the taxes could go higher. “The taxes are probably way under what they should be because no one has been in there in 35 years” to do a reassessment, said Gloria B. Fried, receiver of taxes for the Town of Ossining, which includes the village.Michael S. Blau, the village manager, said Briarcliff Manor was revising its master plan and might change the zoning in the estate’s area to require larger lots for houses. “There’s a concern about open space here just as there is everywhere in Westchester,” he said.On a sultry afternoon, a security guard kept watch by a wrought-iron gate at the estate on Scarborough Road. (The main house cannot be glimpsed from any public street.) Mature holly trees flanked the entrance, and a small sign to the right of the driveway cautioned: “Look Out for Small Dogs.”One neighbor, Barbara McKeegan, whose 19th-century Victorian sits opposite Holly Hill, said she had no illusions about its future.“I would rather they preserve it, but I don’t think it has a chance of remaining one big estate,” she said. “We just don’t have those anymore.”'"
"'07-09-05,'0','“How much would you pay to slow or stop the aging process?” asks one ad from the Aug. 24 issue of USA Today for a company called MitoPharm, which makes what it calls a “true anti-aging drink” called Restorade. “This industry is making smart investors overnight millionaires,” the ad states, citing Coca-Cola’s purchase of Glaceau. “The buying frenzy is likely to continue,” and, the ad concludes, “MTPM could be the hottest story to hit Wall Street this year!”R. Cromwell Coulson, chief executive of the Pink Sheets, an unregulated over-the-counter market, said that such ads offer plenty of obvious reasons to beware. “If it’s being hyped like this, it’s probably worthy of cynicism,” he said. “If it’s a small company, why are they spending so much on touting their stock?”There is no indication that the recent ads have broken any securities laws, and newspapers, which are facing declining ad revenues, are not required to vouch for the veracity of the claims. Maria Terrell, a spokeswoman for the International Newspaper Marketing Association, said that “it’s not a newspaper’s responsibility to verify the facts of an ad being placed.” But she added that the recent ads, for newspapers and investors alike, were “definitely something to pay attention to.”Last April, a small unknown company called Nano Chemical Systems Holdings bought a full-page ad in the business section of The New York Times, replete with frothy lines like “Don’t miss this incredible investment opportunity!”In the ad, Nano Chemical Systems Holdings of Seaford, Del., a former publisher of history textbooks, described its plans to become a leading biofuel maker and compared itself to Intel and Microsoft. “These two industry giants made early investors rich beyond their wildest dreams,“ reads the copy, adding that in “in much the same way, Nano Chemical Systems Holdings is positioning itself as one of the companies that can help make the Alternative Energy revolution possible!”Neither the ad nor Nano Chemical’s Web site discloses that the company’s main business is manufacturing industrial waxes and lubricants. And there were other gaps. The ad made no mention of the fact that in January 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued subpoenas to Nano Chemical related to its issuance of press releases, among other things. The company has said it is cooperating with the S.E.C.’s investigation.The fine print at the bottom of the Nano Chemical Systems Holdings ad did disclose that a company named GIA Consulting had been paid over $232,000 by an unnamed third party to prepare and place the ad as well as “other informational advertisements.” While the ad said that GIA Consulting did not own any shares in Nano Chemical Systems Holdings, it gave no contact details for GIA Consulting or specific mention of the third party.Alex H. Edwards III, the interim chief executive of Nano Chemical Systems Holdings, said he thought GIA Consulting was “a shareholder who placed the ad because they thought the company was undervalued.” He said he did not know where GIA Consulting was based or that the ad was coming out. Attempts to locate GIA Consulting were unsuccessful.Asked about the ad, Abbe R. Serphos, a spokeswoman for The Times, said that “it has been the longstanding policy of The New York Times to accept advertisements that promote stocks or securities as long as those securities are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the attorney general of New York State.” She added: “In a few rare instances companies with unregulated securities have managed to place ads in the paper. When we learned of them, we took steps to make sure their ads do not appear in the paper again.”Nano Chemical Systems had registered its securities offerings, according to filings; the stock trades on the Pink Sheets for around 5 cents a share.Pat Huddleston, a former enforcement official with the S.E.C. who now runs Investor’s Watchdog, a consumer advocacy organization, said that “it’s a sign of how optimistic of success these scam artists are that they are turning to papers like The New York Times.”By May, other tiny, unknown companies, among them USA Superior Energy (an oil company), Trend Exploration (mining) and BioStem Inc. (stem cell storage), were subjects of full-page ads, some in color, in USA Today, the nation’s largest-circulation daily newspaper.The ad for BioStem, for example, said that the firm was “capitalizing on the new cord blood stem cell industry with its potentially life-saving medical applications.”Those are high ambitions for a company formerly known as National Parking Systems, and whose main business today is still running parking lots and “vehicle immobilization services” in Atlanta, where it is based. None of that information is disclosed in the ad.Neither is BioStem’s previous incarnations as the Web Views Corporation (an Internet company) and the Cascade Mountain Mining Corporation.Neither does the ad give any indication of BioStem’s shaky financial position, including accumulated losses of more than $15.5 million, according to S.E.C. filings.The ad says that BioStem will be acquired by Cryobanks International Inc., a private, untraded company based in Altamonte Springs, Fla., that is “a leader in the collection, processing and banking of stem cells.”But the USA Today ad omits mention of the suspected role of Cryobanks in a Ghana-based money-laundering scheme.That role is described in an amended lawsuit filed by federal prosecutors in Federal District Court in Brooklyn in August 2004 against Shankar’s Emporium and various related participants and bank accounts.The civil complaint contends that in early 2004, at least $59,800 obtained in connection with the scheme was placed in Cryobanks International by Kazi Management VI Inc., a firm incorporated in the United States Virgin Islands.Kazi Management and its related entities are owned or controlled by Zubair Kazi, who is the chairman of Cryobanks International and, through a Kazi Management entity, a major investor in Cryobanks. Mr. Kazi is also the second-largest KFC franchisee in the United States, according to the Cryobanks Web site. Calls to Mr. Kazi in Studio City, Calif., were not returned.In November 2005, the Shankar entities settled the case for $1.3 million without admitting wrongdoing. Alan Burger, a lawyer for Cryobanks in the case, declined to comment.When asked about the BioStem ad, a spokeswoman for USA Today said: “Advertisers are responsible for the content of their ads, as well as for complying with any legal obligations associated with those ads. USA Today does occasionally review ads on an as-needed basis.”To be sure, the fine print in the newspaper ads reveals more than the typical Internet-based solicitation.For example, in its USA Today ad, BioStem discloses that a firm called ATN Enterprises L.L.C. prepared the ad and paid a second firm, Discovery Stocks, $37,500 to place it. The ad also discloses that ATN “has been hired by third-party consultants and is contracted to receive” one million “free-trading shares” of BTEM, and thus has an inherent conflict of interest in promoting BioStem. It also says that Discovery Stocks can trade in the shares. Calls to ATN’s head, Roy Campbell, in Miami Springs, Fla., were not returned.Steve Clark, the head of Discovery Stocks, said: “I’m not promoting the stock. It’s essentially a direct-response advertisement. We’re seeing a lot more of it now.” He said he had recently placed similar ads in newspapers in Seattle and Tampa, among other cities.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','The latest dot-com casualty comes from the newsstand, not the Internet.Business 2.0, a monthly magazine about the new economy, will be shut down rather than sold, its owners at Time Inc. have decided. The publication, which has been suffering from a decline in advertising revenue, will cease publication after its October issue, which will have a cover article on where to invest in a real estate downturn.According to people familiar with Time Inc.’s handling of the matter, Time turned down offers from Mansueto Ventures, owners of the rival magazine Fast Company, and other prospective buyers to acquire the Business 2.0 brand and its circulation list of 600,000 subscribers.Instead, Time Inc. will reassign the editor of Business 2.0, Joshua Quittner, and nine other editorial staff members to Fortune magazine, where they will help with Fortune’s technology coverage, conference business and Web site.“I’d be lying if I didn’t admit to being heartbroken,” said Mr. Quittner, who steered the magazine for five and a half years. “That said, we had a terrific team here and learned a lot. A bunch of us are going on to Fortune, where we’ll have an even bigger platform to carry on the good fight.”Today, human resources personnel and other executives from Time Inc. will visit the magazine’s San Francisco headquarters to formally close its operations, employees there have been told.The developments mark the final chapter in the decade-long life of the Business 2.0 brand. The first magazine to be called Business 2.0, a biweekly, made its debut in 1998 and was published by the Future Network, a British media company. Time Warner bought the magazine in 2001 for a reported $68 million and combined its operations with its own fledgling business magazine, eCompany Now.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','But while it lasted, the San Francisco office market resembled a bidder’s war at a high-price art auction. Since the start of 2006, nearly 29 million square feet — a stunning 75 percent of the city’s highest-quality office space — changed hands, according to figures compiled by Studley, a commercial real estate company. Some buildings, like One Market Plaza, have been sold more than once in that time.In the process, real estate professionals say, the prices paid for buildings seem to have soared far ahead of the growth of the rents paid by the tenants of those buildings.The 34-story building at 650 California Street, which sold for about $350 a square foot in 2004, recently changed hands for about $610 a square foot, even though there has been little change in either the building’s tenants or its rental income, said Steven Barker, a broker who is executive vice president in Studley’s San Francisco office.In fact, the average price per square foot paid by investors for Class A offices — the highest-quality space — rose to $622 in the second quarter, from $322 in 2005, according to figures from Grubb & Ellis, a national real estate brokerage.To justify those prices, investors need to raise the rent sharply and quickly, Mr. Barker said. “They are expecting ‘hockey stick’ rent increases,” he said of local landlords, using the sports analogy to indicate that the line on the rental-growth chart needs to move from practically horizontal to almost straight up.Office rents have risen robustly, if not at the same rate as the prices paid for buildings. In the second quarter, landlords were asking an average annual rent of $41.80 a square foot, up from $32.20 a year ago, Studley said.A few tenants have already shown themselves willing to pay top dollar for premium “view” space. Artis Capital Partners agreed this year to pay $100.50 a square foot for a suite in One Market Plaza, perhaps the highest rent in the city and twice what some other tenants pay for comparable space without a bay view, Studley said. (Officials from Artis Capital declined to comment.)In the Pier 3 building a few blocks north, Bloomberg News is paying $95.50 a square foot.But only a small fraction of San Francisco’s office buildings — less than 10 percent, in Mr. Barker’s view — can command rents higher than $60 a square foot.Still, investors in past years who hoped for rising rents were not disappointed, professionals say. In the last year, San Francisco office rents have jumped about 20 percent.Further emboldening investors is a vacancy rate approaching 10 percent, the level which Mr. Barker described as the “equilibrium point” in the office market. Higher than 10 percent indicates a soft market, he said, while less than 10 percent is considered a “landlord’s market,” giving building owners the advantage in negotiating rent with tenants.But Mr. Barker cautioned that a number of tenants are not using all their space and are seeking to sublet some of it. Counting sublease space, he said, the actual vacancy rate is 12.9 percent.Scarcity of developable land is a factor favoring landlords. Tracts suitable for large office buildings are hard to find in downtown San Francisco and construction is increasingly expensive, professionals say. Little new space is under construction, and what there is will not be available to compete with existing buildings until 2009.All this may be leading building owners to expect to raise rents substantially in the near future, eclipsing the high-water marks set during the dot-com euphoria, which ended abruptly in 2001. In the first quarter of that year, high-quality downtown space rented for an average of about $60 a square foot.But Mr. Barker, the office broker, cautions that landlords may be overly optimistic in assuming that tenants will pay any price for office space in the city. San Francisco itself is not a hub of any particular industry beyond financial services and law, he argued. If rents rise too high, he said, cost-conscious tenants will simply shrug and decamp to the suburbs, where there is more space available and rents are lower.Landlords might be foolhardy to raise rents aggressively based on vacancy rates alone, because the total volume of downtown space occupied by tenants is actually shrinking, not growing, Mr. Barker said.In the first half of the year, the total volume of downtown office space occupied by tenants diminished by 82,274 square feet, compared with a decrease of 27,310 square feet in the year-earlier period. In short, the universe of tenants in downtown San Francisco is not growing.Another professional sees the current state of the city’s office market somewhat more positively. An executive director of Morgan Stanley, Scott Brown, insisted the San Francisco office market is not overheating. “The San Francisco market has extremely strong fundamentals,” he said.The current credit crunch is likely to leave real estate investment deals in question for the near future. Aside from that difficulty, Mr. Brown dismissed the suggestion that investors were flooding the market and driving up prices unsustainably.“The opportunity to benefit from the market recovery is in front of owners today,” he said in an e-mail message.'"
"'07-09-05,'0','For years, all it took was a chef’s name on a bottle of sauce or a book jacket to turn a restaurant into a retailer. But those are mere tokens compared with the markets that have been installed next to dining rooms lately, from well-stocked alcoves to free-standing grocery stores and wine shops. And more are on the way.BLT MARKET The shelving near the front of Laurent Tourondel’s latest restaurant provides a showcase for some of the artisanal American goods that often find their way onto his menu. Olive oils from California, McClure’s pickles from Brooklyn, and jewel-colored syrups from Sonoma Syrup seem to have been selected as much for their decorative allure as for their contents: 1430 Avenue of the Americas (Central Park South), (212) 521-6125.BOROUGH FOOD & DRINK The restaurant’s concept suggested the addition of a market, with menu and shelves featuring iconic foods from around New York City that are on the menu. If you like the Russ & Daughters herring plate you ordered, you can buy the fish at the front door of the restaurant in the Flatiron District. The same goes for Pain d’Avignon breads from Long Island City, Queens, Di Palo ricotta from Little Italy, preserves from Nordic Delicacies in Brooklyn and wursts from Forest Pork in Flushing, Queens: 12 East 22nd Street, (212) 260-0103.LITTLE PIGGY (MARKET) Even though their barbecue spot, Smoke Joint in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, offers takeout, Craig Samuel and Ben Grossman, the owners, thought that a kind of country market with a Brooklyn stamp on it would be a nice complement. The rustic shop next door opened three weeks ago. It does not sell barbecue but offers sandwiches, salads, produce like heirloom tomatoes, cookies, cupcakes and some prepared foods, including excellent meatloaf finished on a grill. Penny candy, coffee and sacks of Anson Mills grits and cornmeal round out the growing inventory: 64 Lafayette Avenue (South Elliott Place), Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 797-1011. MARKET TABLE This may be the most ambitious restaurant-market venture, with half the premises devoted to selling meat, seafood, produce, groceries and some restaurant foods ready to cook, like the pork chops from Little Owl, whose owners are partners here, and prepared crab cakes, ready to sizzle. Well-worn butcher blocks and other vintage market accouterments contribute to the horse-and-buggy feel of the place, which will open this week. Mike Price, an owner and the chef, said that people seemed eager for his market, even though Bleecker Street, just a block away, is a shopper’s delight: 54 Carmine Street (Bedford Street), (212) 255-2100.Later, another Fig & Olive, with olive oils and vinegars for sale, will open in Midtown. In Inwood, Jason Minter will be selling produce and specialty food items at his Indian Road Café, opening in November. And Prana, which will occupy the former Scopa space at 28th Street and Madison Avenue, will open a market with Asian products, before the restaurant is ready.'"

"'07-09-05,'0','Yet the most striking feature of the new season may be not what it offers, but what it doesn’t: Formality.Imagine a crop of new restaurants without even one that strives for the high-gloss grandeur represented by Gordon Ramsay at the London last year, Del Posto the year before, or Per Se the year before that. Instead, plans are afoot to eventually bring burgers with Daniel Boulud’s brand to the Bowery.All around town, bare tables have shed snowy linen, customers’ shirttails are hanging out as ties and jackets are left in the closet, flip-flops replace Ferragamo, and an assortment of small plates of food, often shared, fills in for traditional three-course dinners.Even hotel dining is no longer the bastion of gleaming silver, tuxedoed waiters and elaborate folderol. In his new venture in the ornate Beaux-Arts palace of the St. Regis, Alain Ducasse said, he expects to set a very different tone than he did in 2001 when he opened in the Essex House. “In six years, style and expectations have changed,” he said. “You cannot present the same degree of formality.”Where his restaurant in the Essex House was gilded, the décor at Adour, which will open in late fall, is merely silver. It will be in full view of the hotel’s Astor Court lobby restaurant, and will have a tiny bar with four seats and a small lounge near the entrance with a pared-down menu so a bite to eat instead of a three-hour dinner will be an option.After years at the overwhelmingly formal Lespinasse, when Gray Kunz finally opened his own place in the Time Warner Center in 2004, it was more or less a brasserie. In a few weeks, he will move further away from old-fashioned trappings when he opens Grayz, a cocktail lounge with private party rooms in Midtown.Of course, it would be premature to write an obituary for elegance based on a single season. A few chefs still want to present their cooking in settings they believe befit their seriousness. But they are becoming scarcer by the minute. The death of Brooke Astor of the white kid gloves may turn out to be a potent symbol of the end of an era.“The upscale stuff, it’s not what people want any more,” said Drew Nieporent, who was among the first to appreciate and exploit the downtown vibe when it began to resonate 20 years or so ago, and who, it must be said, has been disparaging fancy fine dining for years.The Zagat survey of New York restaurants that will be released next month will include many fewer places that Tim Zagat, the book’s publisher, said he would call “impressive” than in the past. “Almost all the formal high-end restaurants are gone,” Mr. Zagat said. “Now it’s much more fun and young and hip.”Mr. Zagat attributed the change to a generational shift. “The people who are eating out every day, lunch and dinner, are all young, and they’re looking for a different kind of experience,” he said. “They don’t want fine dining in the classic sense. They just don’t eat the same way. They don’t dress the same way.”An extreme version of this view is in a new book “The Death of the Grown-Up” by Diana West (St. Martin’s Press), in which the author observed that parents behave like their children and dress in the same outfits. She argues that this generation, which subverts traditional values, has been disastrous for Western culture. It has not been good for dress codes in restaurants.Certainly, if you are Daniel Boulud or Jean-Georges Vongerichten and want to expand your empire, you do not replicate your first-class establishment. You open a DB Bistro, or a Spice Market. In other words, you dress down and broaden your market.And if you are Laurent Tourondel, you create a brand that is called BLT — it’s not KFC, but it defines your places as accessible and easy to enjoy. This brand does not showcase your formal French training as directly as in a restaurant with haute-cuisine ambition.The tables at his latest, BLT Market, have paper mats — in the Ritz-Carlton hotel, no less. Mr. Tourondel and other seasoned restaurateurs may be put off by the high cost of formality. Mr. Kunz said that setting up a fine-dining restaurant requires “a much higher expense — the china, the glass, it’s just really, really expensive.”Sandy Chilewich, whose woven vinyl placemats were introduced in 2000, expects to sell 300,000 of them this year to restaurants around the world.And then there is rent, which is always a challenge in New York but is particularly punishing at the moment. “The rents have become so high that unless you have a big group you are getting priced out of the market,” said Leslie Siben, a managing director of JDF Realty in New York, which specializes in restaurant real estate. Paul McLaughlin, a partner in Oceana, Molyvos and Abboccato, said he has been looking for new restaurant locations but cannot find any that are not well over $100 a square foot.Richard Coraine, the chief operating officer of Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns establishments as diverse at Gramercy Tavern and Shake Shack, estimates that landlords now demand between $50,000 and $75,000 a month for suitable spaces, “compared to half of that 10 years ago.”In years past, restaurateurs responded to high rents by striking out for new, cheaper neighborhoods. “But the hard thing is I don’t see any undeveloped areas right now,” Mr. Coraine said. “Everybody’s discovered the meatpacking district.” The same goes for the Lower East Side. Even in Harlem the rents are rising fast, Ms. Siben said.Partly because of the expense of running a restaurant, the decline of elegant dining does not necessarily mean the food will be any cheaper. There has been a certain dumbing-down, as with the appearance of truffle oil everywhere, the culinary equivalent of a Louis Vuitton bag from a street vendor. But no matter what they are cooking, serious chefs do not want to compromise on ingredients.Jennifer Baum, a publicist whose company, Bullfrog & Baum, handles restaurants, including the BLT chain, said that downscaling is not about inexpensive dining. “You’re wearing jeans and it can still be a couple of hundred dollars a person by the time you’re done,” she said.And this season, established chefs and restaurateurs are offering more choices with less pretense than ever. So wear those Armani jeans out to dinner, if you wish, but remember to bring plenty of money.'"

"'07-09-06,'1','Forty-eight hours later, a FedEx man appeared at the door, bearing a new copy of the program: version 1.1. It was identical to the version I'd been testing -- except now it had a list view. Some programmer had had a very busy weekend.Benjy called. He thanked me for the list-view idea and asked if there was anything else I'd like to see in the program. I hedged; he prodded.""O.K., well,"" I managed, ""it'd be nice if you could mark and print subsets of your cards.""You guessed it: within two days, version 1.1.1 arrived, complete with mark-and-print features.This loony cycle went around a few more times, the little company writing the software to accommodate the review. I knew this wasn't quite the way the reviewer-vendor relationship was supposed to work -- but I really thought the software was getting better. At last the review deadline came, and Benjy stopped adding new features. That program was probably the only version 1.1.1.1.1 ever sold.* Another company fervently wanted my review to appear simultaneously with its new program's release. Of course, that's impossible; because of editing and shipping, computer-magazine reviews are written weeks in advance.But Sheila, the P.M., had a great idea: she'd send me a late beta-test version of the program, and I could review that.I explained to Sheila that I was allowed to review only final, shipping software versions. Too much can change between the testing version and the final one. ""If it isn't shrink-wrapped,"" went the magazine's rule, ""we can't review it.""I didn't hear from Sheila again until a week later. She said she was finally ready to send me a review version of the program, shrink-wrapped and everything.I eagerly opened the package, installed the software, and got to work. I was halfway through writing the review when I happened to glance at the program's About box. There it was, plain as day in 9-point type: Version 1.0b18.Sheila, clever woman, had sent me a beta-test copy of the software after all -- but had had the box shrink-wrapped!* One program I reviewed was awful. I found it difficult to believe that, as Frank the P.M. insisted, hundreds of companies were happily using this program every day.Finally, I asked Frank if he'd mind providing me with the names of a few of these happy users. ""Not at all,"" he said. Sure enough, he called back a few days later with three names and numbers.The first user said he was thrilled with the program. Only one problem: he worked for the Canadian division of the same software company. Hardly impartial.The second guy, fortunately, didn't work for the software company. He was, however, Frank the P.M.'s brother.The third guy had no such ties. He was wild about the product. On and on he raved: ""It's so neat, the way those menus drop down . . . and I love the Apple menu, with that Calculator, and that devilish Puzzle . . . and that cute little Trash Can!""I didn't have the heart to tell this new Mac user that he was crediting Frank's program with standard features of the Mac operating system.* Good P.M.s, like good criminal lawyers, must sometimes be actors, making their case with conviction and passion when they're representing a loser.I'll never forget the hardware gadget that instantly fried my laptop. It wouldn't even start. In hysterics, I called the P.M.He told me to calm down. Sure, a few of these units had caused this fiery surprise. But big deal -- the design problem had been fixed. ""It's still the best product of its kind,"" he insisted. And when my review appeared, he called to chew me out, saying I'd been overly harsh because my own personal machine had been nuked.But the punch line came several years later. I ran into that P.M. at a tradeshow. Of course, his old company didn't exist and he had moved on. He grinned and threw his arm around my shoulders.""Wow, was that gizmo a turkey, or what?"" he laughed.""Yeah,"" he said, ""I couldn't tell you at the time, but your review was right on. I wouldn't have used one of those units on my own computer if you paid me!""'"

"'07-09-06,'1','The most eye-opening comments came from General Jones and other members of the commission, which provided some of the most complex and detailed analysis of military operations in Iraq presented to date on Capitol Hill.General Jones, in his opening statement, declared: “The Iraqi security forces, as a whole, cannot yet defend the territorial integrity of Iraq.” But he quickly added: “This is not necessarily an alarming conclusion.”He continued: “Improvement has been noted in the internal security missions — for example, in denying a safe haven to terrorists. And this improvement is likely to continue in the near future.”And he said that a major shift in strategy and reduction in American troops might be feasible as soon as early next year. “Size and mission of coalition military forces could be altered in the near future as the Iraqi Army and the police force continue to develop,” he said.”But General Jones also acknowledged that the grim political situation was hampering military efforts and remained the biggest obstacle to the eventual withdrawal of American troops.In addition to providing the progress report on the Iraqi security forces that Congress had requested, the commission also offered an array of suggestions intended to “help in trying to arrive at a way ahead that will enable success in this critical mission.”Those suggestions included steps to improve the image of the United States military, so it would be seen less as an occupying force and more as working for the transition to Iraqi sovereignty.To that end, General Jones said the commission urged the establishment of an “Iraqi-Coalition transition headquarters” that would focus on military, political, economic and legal issues and would “show visible and consistent progress toward transition, which is a crucial message that people need to understand.”Senators in both parties expressed gratitude for the commission’s findings. “I would hope the president would take into consideration the valuable findings that you made,” said Senator John Warner, Republican of Virginia, who together with Senator Robert S. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, sponsored the law creating the commission.But the hearing also served as a platform for senators in both parties to restate their long-held positions on Iraq. “President Bush said we would stand down as Iraq forces stood up,” Senator Byrd said. “We have yet to see much standing up.”Democrats, including the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, pressed the commission on why the Iraqi security forces had not been able to take on more responsibility more quickly.Mr. Levin, who has been working to broker a deal on legislation that would require at least a modest withdrawal of troops, focused repeatedly on the aspects of the report suggesting that a reduction of forces in the near future is not only possible but prudent, as Iraqi forces take on more responsibilities.“The assumption of that greater responsibility by the Iraqi forces, you’ve indicated should lead to a reduction in the number of our forces,” Mr. Levin asked General Jones. “So far, are we together?”Republicans, in turn, focused on the positive developments and General Jones indicated he was together with them on that point, too.“We can’t just ignore the good news,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. “And that is that you find that the Iraqi armed forces are increasingly effective and capable of assuming greater responsibility for internal security of Iraq.”'"
"'07-09-06,'1','So in early 2006, Mr. Solomons and Jason Berkowitz, a co-founder of Hyrian, started the Hyrian OnDemand division, geared to recruiting for companies with 50 or more employees. To make it economical, Mr. Solomons said he divided the process into pieces. “Teams of our employees are devoted solely to advertising and copyrighting, others to coordinating and prescreening of candidates. There are teams that do interviewing and dealing with clients and others that concentrate on networking to contact potential candidates.”As a result, OnDemand could handle greater volume, Mr. Solomons said, and he developed a variety of prices. To deliver a senior staff employee like an information technology specialist earning $100,000 and more, Hyrian charges $5,900. For an employee, earning up to $18 an hour, it charges $1,900. And if called upon to attract and hire a chief operating officer or other senior executive, its fee is $9,500. “Volume of business reduces the risk that a single assignment will fail to achieve a hire and you’ll lose all your time and effort. Reduction of risk reduces prices,” said Mr. Solomons, who is now 36, repeating a lesson from the long-ago dinner table. With growing business, Hyrian OnDemand is adding to its own work force of 250.Customers use Hyrian OnDemand to save time, said Christopher Campbell, president of Asset Smart Software, a Santa Monica, Calif., company that began 31 years ago with programs for the aerospace industry and now has software that manages properties worldwide for global companies. Business is brisk so Asset Smart is expanding its work force to about 20 employees from a dozen. The recruiting service “saves us the effort of canvassing resumes, interviewing candidates. It is very time consuming,” Mr. Campbell said.A larger Hyrian customer, Akeena Solar Inc., of Los Gatos, Calif., has 170 employees and a human resources department. But Tom Gerner, director of that department, uses the recruiting service because, he said, it has “an infrastructure, a capability to contact and examine potential employees on a national and worldwide basis.” He added, “They charge about what we would have to pay to do the job and this saves our people for other work.”As Hyrian’s success shows, the personnel recruitment field is thriving in these times of low unemployment and the beginning of baby boomer retirements. Mr. Solomons would not disclose the company’s revenues but acknowledged that it was a reasonable assumption that the firm’s annual revenue is more than $25 million. based on the fact it has 250 employees.Leaders of the executive search field cite several other factors for the thriving recruitment business. Robert Rollo, a partner of Heidrick & Struggles, one of the largest recruiting firms, credits the Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed in the wake of Enron’s collapse six years ago with increasing the need for professional recruiting. “The greater liability placed on chief financial officers and senior executives makes the hiring process a lot more critical,” said Mr. Rollo, who has been in recruiting for 25 years.Robert Bellano, managing director of cFour Partners Worldwide, a firm based in Santa Monica, Calif., noted that the growth of venture capital and private equity financing for high-technology companies, plus globalization, had increased the demand for his company’s services. “Often we need to hire highly specialized senior people on a global basis for critical technological and financial positions,” Mr. Bellano said.Daniel Conway, managing director of Focal Point Partners, a Santa Monica investment bank, agreed. “Frequently, private equity funds need someone right away to fill a critical position at a company they’ve invested in. The funds are glad to pay the fees of recruiters who deliver.”Mr. Solomons said baby boomer retirements should create a constant need for recruiter services. A study, “The Aging of the U.S. Work Force,” by Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, raises the question of whether labor shortages may occur as vast numbers of workers now age 55 to 64 retire with fewer younger workers available to replace them. But Mr. Solomons sees a trend of “mobility” as even more meaningful.“The generations of younger workers don’t value stability as the older workers did,” he said. “Their attitude is, ‘My career is my product and I’m going to the highest bidder.’ ” he said.'"
"'07-09-06,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 — The Homeland Security Department has failed to meet even half its performance expectations in the four years it has been in existence, Congressional auditors have concluded in a draft report obtained by The Associated Press.The department disagreed with the findings of the report, particularly with the way auditors defined and measured progress. The report, prepared by the Government Accountability Office, is to be released Thursday.The department’s primary mission is to prevent terrorist attacks and to minimize the damage should an attack take place. But the only area in which auditors saw significant improvement was maritime security, the report said.The report measures progress in 14 mission and management areas. Auditors identified 171 performance expectations and found that the department had achieved fewer than half.The department has had success developing plans, but has not always been able to carry out the programs, like its efforts to identify places where people illegally enter the United States, the report said.'"

"'07-09-06,'1','In July, The New York Times reported that tens of thousands of financial advisers are working hand in hand with insurance companies to market themselves to older Americans using credentials like registered financial gerontologist, certified retirement financial adviser and certified senior adviser.Many of these titles can be earned quickly from for-profit businesses and sound similar to established credentials, like certified financial planner, that require far more study, as well as deep background checks.This is the first time a Senate committee has called for a universal standard on these issues, said staff members affiliated with the committee.Last year, 44 percent of complaints received by state security administrators were filed by older consumers, and almost half of those concerned complicated insurance products like annuities, according to data collected by the North America Securities Administrators Association.Annuities are insurance contracts that offer buyers monthly or yearly income in exchange for one large lump-sum payment. Some regulators have been sharply critical of annuities that do not begin paying for years or that are tied to stock returns.“Most of these annuities are completely unsuitable for most seniors,” said Joseph Borg, the chief Alabama securities regulator and president of the securities administrators association, in an interview before his testimony. “Half the time, the agents who sell them don’t understand them. But they know insurance companies will pay high commissions, and that seniors will listen if the salesmen call themselves senior experts or certified advisers.”Gary Bhojwani, president of Allianz Life Insurance of North America, one of the largest annuity companies, testified that the company’s average customer had a net worth of more than $500,000, excluding the home, and owned annuities as only a portion of their investment portfolio.“We believe we have a valuable product to offer, and we’ve instituted policies to make sure they are only sold to suitable buyers,” Mr. Bhojwani said. “We’ve offered a benefit to seniors who might otherwise outlive their savings.”Mr. Bhojwani also testified that Allianz would begin prohibiting sales agents from using many titles that imply an expertise in senior finances and that the company would enhance scrutiny of sales practices, including contacting all new customers over 74 years old to make sure they understand what they have purchased.At least two other insurance companies that are among the nation’s largest sellers of annuities — ING USA Annuity and Life Insurance Company, and Aviva USA — have recently told sales agents they may not use titles like certified senior adviser.The most pointed questions at the hearing were directed at Edwin Pittock, president of the Society of Certified Senior Advisors.“This group says they don’t train financial advisers, but then throughout the Web site it says ‘certified adviser’ over and over,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. “When I look at this group’s materials, they talk about marketing and marketing and marketing, but very few chapters involve any education of financial expertise whatsoever.”Mr. Pittock testified that the group required title holders to tell potential clients that the designation did not imply expertise in financial affairs. He added that the group had revoked the C.S.A. designation from 37 of the 12,000 title holders because of misconduct.“Only 37 titles revoked?” asked Mr. Kohl. “That’s almost zero. It sounds like they have to be really egregious violations before anything happens.”'"
"'07-09-06,'1','“That is not the type of performance you would expect from a hedge fund with that type of resources and size,” said Bradley H. Alford, the former managing director of Duke University’s endowment, who now runs Alpha Capital Management in Atlanta.Tribeca has about $2.4 billion in assets, with roughly $1.5 billion of that Citigroup’s money.Fund executives expect to return $500 million to investors over the next few weeks, a person involved in the matter said.That will allow Citigroup to take control of the fund, though it has not been decided whether its money will be transferred to Old Lane or invested elsewhere, this person said. About $400 million in convertibles and Asian securities, belonging to both Citigroup and other investors, is expected to remain with the bank’s alternative investment group.Citigroup also said it was establishing a “feeder fund” to allow individual investors in the bank’s global wealth management division to gain access to Old Lane. Previously, Old Lane took money only from institutional investors.Citigroup executives suggested in a memo that the primary reason for closing Tribeca was related to strategy.“We believe that we can best serve our clients by offering a single multistrategy hedge fund platform,” wrote John Havens, who was a founder of Old Lane with Mr. Pandit and is president of the alternative investment group. “These are the first steps in creating a nimble organization, driven by performance and service.”Tribeca Capital Management, which Citigroup began in 2004, had been troubled by bloated costs and weak results since it was founded. It has had four managers over the last three years. And it waxed and waned as a corporate priority.But in the last two years, as rivals like JPMorgan Chase reaped windfalls from their hedge funds, executives said that bolstering Tribeca and the overall alternative investment unit at Citigroup vaulted to the top of the list.Yet the company’s chairman and chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, did not leap to a decision. The job was left vacant for more than a year, after the departure of Michael A. Carpenter in March 2006. Only in April did he recruit Mr. Pandit, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, and his Old Lane partners.Over the summer, Mr. Pandit and his people have had frequent discussions with several of Citigroup’s top executives, including Mr. Prince; Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary who is chairman of the bank’s executive committee; and senior top officials in the investment banking and wealth management divisions.The announcement yesterday was the first major initiative. About 50 of Tribeca’s 90 employees, including portfolio managers and support staff members, were told that their jobs were being eliminated, a person close to the situation said. Most of the layoffs will be in New York.With a new management team in place, Old Lane’s partners will run the hedge fund’s operations. And in a memo to employees, Mr. Havens said that the company had “numerous single-strategy products” in place and would roll out new products shortly.Tribeca, which had about 25 trading strategies, will contribute about four strategies that will be incorporated into future fund offerings, a person briefed on the situation said.'"
"'07-09-06,'1','Early yesterday, an index that tracks signing of contracts for sales of existing homes tumbled 12.2 percent for July, to its lowest level in more than six years, the National Association of Realtors reported. The trade group said its members were reporting that buyers of homes were having a tougher time obtaining financing.Pending home sales dropped by nearly 21 percent in the West, which has been hit hard by a spike in interest rates on jumbo mortgages — those for amounts higher than $417,000.“The fact is that housing troubles are still building,” said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, an investment firm in New York. “To say that we have bottomed is very much premature. The effect on economic activity will grow in the second half of the year and into 2008.”The Fed report released yesterday said that the credit crisis had made it more difficult for people to obtain mortgages and that “the weakness in the housing market deepened” in most of the Federal Reserve districts. But it also said that credit remained readily available for most consumer and business borrowers and that, outside of real estate, the convulsions in financial markets had had “limited” effects on economic activity.In a speech Friday at the Fed’s annual symposium in Wyoming, the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the central bank would place more weight than usual on anecdotal reports because the incoming statistical data might not be timely enough to measure a broad economic impact of the credit crisis that began with failing subprime loans.But Fed officials made it clear last week that they were very worried about the housing market, where the news was gloomy, and the readings from other areas were mixed rather than buoyant.“They are going to take the beige book statement that it’s limited only to the housing area with a grain of salt,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR Inc., a research firm in New York. “There is only one wound on the body, but how big is the wound and what impact does it have on the rest of the body?”Mr. Shapiro’s firm expects the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate, now at 5.25 percent, by 0.25 percentage point later this month and by a total of 0.75 percentage point by the end of the year. That forecast is in line with trading in the futures market.There have been only a few signs that the housing market’s problems are spilling into the economy as a whole.The beige book reported that retail sales were “modest to moderate” in most of the country, but inventory was “at or above desired levels” in districts that mentioned it. “Several retailers reported that they planned to or had already heavily discounted merchandise to move inventory,” the report said.A crucial reading on the economy that is likely to play a big role in the Fed’s decision on interest rates will come tomorrow when the Labor Department releases employment figures for August. Yesterday, a privately compiled payroll report from Automatic Data Processing showed that corporate payrolls grew by just 38,000 in August, down from 41,000 in July and 143,000 in June.Many forecasters say the economy will be able to weather a surge in mortgage defaults and falling home prices if jobs remain plentiful and wages continue rising. Experts acknowledge, however, that employment is a lagging indicator of the economy’s health and that many corporate sectors would be hurt if consumer spending deteriorated significantly.“The job market has been a stalwart of strength,” said Mr. Stern of Bessemer Trust, who does not expect a recession. “We are dependent on companies continuing to create jobs.”Among the S.&P. 500 stocks, 422 fell, 76 rose and 2 were unchanged; all but 3 of the 30 Dow companies fell. Financial stocks accounted for more than a third of the losses in the S.&P. 500. Information technology, industrial and consumer discretionary stocks accounted for a third of the decliners.Citigroup and Bank of America led the financial sector down as concerns mounted about big institutions’ involvement in off-balance-sheet borrowing in the short-term debt markets and investments in assets like mortgage bonds.A Securities and Exchange Commission official testifying before Congress said the commission was looking into such structured investment vehicles, which have had an increasingly hard time borrowing money by selling commercial paper, a type of short-term debt.Technology shares were led down by Apple, which cut the price of its new iPhone by $200 and stopped selling a lower-end version of the device just two months after introducing it. Shares of Apple fell 5.2 percent, and shares of AT&T, the service provider for the phone, lost 1.4 percent.More broadly, the beige book noted that manufacturing activity expanded, except in automobiles and building materials. But demand for business loans was either steady or declining in the New York, Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis districts.Given the turmoil and volatility in the financial markets in the last month and a half, some market specialists say the Fed may be forced to be freer with a rate cut than it normally would be.“It would be psychological,” said Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Robert W. Baird & Company. “It would leave room for further rate cuts if needed. There is no guarantee that lower rates will help this housing situation. The important thing is that it stabilizes other areas like the stock market.”Following are the results of yesterday’s Treasury auction of 4-week bills:'"
"'07-09-06,'1','The most serious flaw, the comptroller said, was the failure to create a five-member oversight board mandated by city law in the early 1980s. The board would oversee the 221 licensed horses, 293 drivers and 68 licensed carriages that provide horse-drawn rides to the public.“We have been complaining about these issues for a long time, and we haven’t gotten much of a response,” said Elizabeth Forel, president of the Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages, an advocacy group based in Manhattan.She added, “I think the whole industry has been neglected by the two agencies, by the mayor’s office and by the City Council.”The 18-page audit found “no coordination between the department of health and the Department of Consumer Affairs,” said John Graham, the deputy comptroller who led the investigation.The health department reviews and approves certificates of health stating that horses are able to work, while consumer affairs oversees the licensing of horses, drivers, carriages and stables.Although carriages informally gather in several areas on Central Park South, no formal hack stands have been legally designated.The horse-drawn carriage has long been one of New York’s last links to its slower-paced, romantic past. But without designated water spigots, shade or proper drainage, the horses end up in a most uncharming setting: standing in filthy water and their own waste, the report says.“Central Park South is a spectacular thoroughfare, but it was never set up for horses,” Mr. Graham said.Mr. Thompson, the comptroller, said that the city “should consider creating an actual concession within Central Park to house both carriage and pleasure horses.” This would, he said, “keep the horses away from city traffic and allow their health and welfare to be more easily monitored.”Last year a horse named Spotty was put down after bolting in Midtown Manhattan and running into a car, critically injuring the carriage driver. And in September 2006, Juliet, a 17-year veteran of the horse-drawn-carriage trade, collapsed before a crowd of onlookers and died later in her Hell’s Kitchen stable.One owner defended the care of the horses, saying most stables showed admirable concern for their animals. “The horses for the most part are very well taken care of,” said David Sansoucie, director of operations at Chateau Stables Inc. in Manhattan. “But one rogue stable can ruin it for the whole industry.”Mr. Sansoucie has seven carriages at Central Park South and more than 16 horses that pull them. “Our own standards are very high,” he said. “Our horses have a better health care plan than most people.”The audit was an outgrowth of previous reports on the city’s animal control agency. The report found that in 6 of 143 cases, licenses were improperly issued by the Consumer Affairs Department without receiving health certificates from the health department.Beyond this, the audit found that when they were compared with the previous year, 57 of 135 certificates of health “exhibited differences of information,” Mr. Graham said.Although the horses had the same license numbers, their descriptions varied from year to year “in age, color, breed, name and, in one instance, gender,” Mr. Graham said.He added, “The high incidence of misidentifications was troubling to us.”Ms. Forel said the finding was evidence of “switching horses — or that is just very bad record-keeping.” The Horse & Carriage Association of New York, which represents owners, did not return repeated calls for comment yesterday.During the time of the audit, which covered July 2005 to March 2007, no veterinarian from the health department ever examined the condition of horses in the field as required, the report said. And though Consumer Affairs Department inspectors are required to inspect every carriage three times a year, they only did so twice a year during the time of the audit, according to the report.In a statement yesterday, the health department said that the city “is acting on the audit’s recommendations,” adding that inspections would be increased and that it would establish an advisory board in the fall.Earlier, the department said that the report “understates the extent of our existing inspectional program” and that veterinary inspections of the stables are performed.Some monitoring of the horses is done by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, at its own expense. The society has no formal agreement with the city to do so.The audit did not evaluate the work of the society, which said in a statement that it was “glad the city recognizes the need for improvements with respect to the carriage horses.”Without a formal agreement, the health department and Consumer Affairs Department “have no control over the A.S.P.C.A.’s voluntary monitoring activities,” Mr. Thompson said. “Everything is being done on an ad hoc basis, and that doesn’t work. Let’s establish a formal contract with formal guidelines.”The report by a team of three auditors set out a list of recommended improvements for the agencies to consider, but did not set any penalties because the comptroller does not have the power to do so.“We can take agencies to task publicly for what they don’t do,” Mr. Thompson said.On Central Park South yesterday, some drivers said they were being unfairly stigmatized.“If I treated Mario badly I wouldn’t make any money,” said Ozzy Teke, a driver in a hack line near Columbus Circle. He was referring to his 7-year-old Belgian draft horse.Mr. Teke said he waters the horse four times during a nine-hour work shift, at two troughs, near Avenue of the Americas and Fifth Avenue.“Look at him, he’s happy,” he said.'"
"'07-09-06,'1','The Uvas had become marked for death by the Bonanno, Gambino and Colombo crime families.The couple were gunned down on the morning of Dec. 24, 1992. Several bullets crashed through the windshield of their car, striking each of them in the head three times. The killings took place not far from their Queens home and Mr. Pizzonia’s social club on nearby Liberty Avenue.Mr. Pizzonia was charged with the killings, but in the end a jury found him guilty only of racketeering conspiracy for participating in planning the killings.Joseph R. Corozzo, Mr. Pizzonia’s lawyer, pointed out the government’s disdain for Mafia members yesterday, but he cited what he said was its willingness to offer freedom or lesser charges to those who snitch on — or lie about — a bigger fish.At trial, Mr. Corozzo cast doubt on the government’s case, picking apart the testimony of its star witnesses, who were mostly Mafia defectors, bookies and criminals, one of whom is in the federal witness protection program. The jury returned a not-guilty verdict on the more serious charges.Prosecutors, arguing for the maximum sentence, reiterated yesterday that Mr. Pizzonia had boasted of putting an end to the Uvas. They reminded the judge that trial testimony had indicated that when another crime family tried to take credit for the killings, Mr. Gotti told the bosses of that family that it was “our Skinny Dom,” as Mr. Pizzonia is known, who killed the couple.By yesterday afternoon, the fireworks that had preceded the day had faded. There was no commotion as the judge read Mr. Pizzonia’s sentence.Mr. Pizzonia was seated at a large conference table in Judge Weinstein’s courtroom, directly opposite the judge. Mr. Corozzo sat to his left. The prosecution team sat to the left of Mr. Corozzo, and in the three-row gallery behind Mr. Pizzonia sat his wife and two sons and other supporters, mostly stoic old Italian men with clean-shaven faces and work-worn hands.Before the judge rendered the sentence, he likened Mr. Pizzonia’s life to a work of cinema, a film with a split screen and a single actor portraying two roles, masterfully at times.On one side of the screen, Judge Weinstein said, you have the church member who was quiet, generous and courtly. But on the other is a hardened criminal who has been “a lifelong member of a vicious gang.”“How much credit can be given to the worthy side?” Judge Weinstein asked. “In this case, not much.”'"
"'07-09-06,'1','Speculation about a 787 flight-test delay had been mounting for months. At the Paris air show in June, Scott E. Carson, chief executive of Boeing’s commercial aircraft division, indicated that the company expected to have the first 787 flying by the end of September — already a month later than a previous August goal. At the time, Boeing attributed the delay to a shortage of fasteners that hold the plane’s huge fuselage, wing and tail sections together.Mr. Bair said yesterday that in addition to the fastener shortage, the company and its production partners had run into unanticipated snags involving production of certain specialized parts for the plane as well as the programming of its flight-control software.He described every new aircraft development program as a “voyage of discovery” that often involved hiccups that cannot be anticipated even by state-of-the-art computer modeling software and logistics experts.“We underestimated the complexity” of the production process, Mr. Bair said. “We didn’t simulate missing thousands of fasteners, so we were surprised by that. It wasn’t something that was on our radar screen.”Production of the 787 is being spread across a global consortium of industrial partners, part of a strategy that Boeing says will cut costs and spread the financial risks of the project.The Dreamliner is also the first large commercial jet to be made largely from so-called composite materials — high-technology plastics aimed at making the plane more fuel efficient and cheaper to maintain than traditional aluminum aircraft.Yet despite the plans to use new materials and largely untried manufacturing processes, Boeing had always envisioned an ambitious flight-test schedule for the Dreamliner. The company originally planned a window of about nine months from first flight to first delivery — two months less than it took to test its last new commercial plane, the 777.The delay announced yesterday left the company just six months to test and certify the six planes in the testing program.“It was already a very aggressive flight-test program,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm in Virginia. “Now it’s an extremely aggressive one.”That said, Mr. Aboulafia and others remained willing to give Boeing the benefit of the doubt that it will meet its promised delivery deadlines.“I am disappointed that we haven’t seen a first flight by now,” said Howard Wheeldon, a senior strategist at BGC Partners in London. “But this is a large public company. They can’t afford to be arrogant and mislead in any way.”'"
"'07-09-06,'1','Mr. Kelly attributed the increase in citizen complaints to the city’s 311 hot line, which went into operation in 2003, providing a convenient way to express displeasure with the police.Andrew Case, a spokesman for the board, which employs 147 investigators, said its most recent records showed that 60 percent of the civilian complaints were being dismissed before they were completely investigated — but only because those who made those complaints decided not to follow through. He said none of those cases would have been dropped if those who had complained, mainly through calls to 311, had been willing to appear and make formal statements at the board’s office in Lower Manhattan, as city rules dictate.And Franklin H. Stone, the chairwoman of the board, which was established as an oversight agency outside the Police Department in 1992, said that the board had fulfilled its City Charter mission “extraordinarily well.”The civil rights group said the system of police conduct review was rife with problems resulting from obfuscation by the police, and a failure by the board and its staff to challenge the authority of top police officials.Among its recommendations were that the city appoint a new inspector general to monitor the conduct of the police and the performance of the Civilian Complaint Review Board. And it criticized the current system of prosecuting officers when the board substantiates civilian cases. A legal unit of the Police Department now handles the prosecutions; the civil rights group suggested having prosecutors outside the department take the cases.“The commissioner blatantly disregards C.C.R.B. recommendations time and time again,” Ms. Lieberman said. “It is ironic that a Police Department that pursues zero tolerance on the streets does not pursue zero tolerance in its own ranks.”The report said that investigators for the board were often handicapped by the police’s delays in turning over documents or evidence, and that officers named in complaints frequently failed to show up for interviews.When discipline of officers is ordered by the department, it rarely fits the severity of their misconduct, the group said. “In recent years, there has been a radically more lenient policy,” said Robert A. Perry, an analyst for the civil rights group who was in charge of the study released yesterday. In most cases, the discipline involves having a description of the officer’s misconduct included in his or her personnel file, verbal reprimands from the precinct commanders, or, in more serious cases, suspensions or lost vacation days.The report found that the proportion of cases in which officers received the lightest penalty — a note in the file — had risen to 74 percent in 2006 from less than 25 percent in 2000. In the same period, it said, the proportion of officers who were suspended or lost vacation days dropped to 5 percent from 34 percent.Mr. Case said some of the criticisms raised in the report, including the one about lenient discipline, had been made by the board itself. The board “has reported publicly and often on the decreasing severity of the department’s discipline,” he said.Questions about the board’s recommendations were referred by a spokeswoman for the mayor to Mr. Case. He said appointing a new inspector general might have little impact.“At what point do you stop and say the people that are in place need to get the issues resolved,” he said.Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman, said the report yesterday ignored the resources being committed to monitoring the conduct of officers in cooperation with the Civilian Complaint Review Board and through the police internal affairs unit.“True to form, the N.Y.C.L.U. has distorted or ignored the facts to reach its predetermined conclusions,” Mr. Browne said. He said about 1,000 members of the department were assigned to internal investigations, roughly the same number assigned to counterterrorism and intelligence.'"
"'07-09-06,'1','A former Morgan Stanley finance vice president and her husband, a former hedge fund analyst at ING Investment Management, pleaded guilty yesterday to conspiracy and insider trading as part of a federal crackdown.The couple, Jennifer Wang and Ruben Chen of Englishtown, N.J., each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and three counts of insider trading in Federal District Court in Manhattan.“I feel deeply sorry for my conduct,” Ms. Wang said in court. “I understood what I did was wrong.”Prosecutors this year have stepped up efforts to combat insider trading. In May, a former Morgan Stanley compliance officer, Randi Collotta, and her husband pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges in an unrelated case. And last month, a former Goldman Sachs associate pleaded guilty to making more than $6.7 million through insider trades.Ms. Wang, 31, and Mr. Chen, 34, were arrested on May 10 for trading in the securities of Town and Country Trust, Glenborough Realty Trust and Genesis HealthCare, based on information that Ms. Wang had learned from Morgan Stanley. They earned more than $600,000 from December 2005 to March 2007, prosecutors said.According to the complaint, Morgan Stanley was advising its subsidiary, Morgan Stanley Real Estate, on the acquisition of Town and Country and Glenborough. Ms. Wang learned about the firm’s failure to acquire Town and Country and the successful purchase of Glenborough before the news became public.'"
"'07-09-06,'1','The iPhone was first sold on June 29. A number of recent analysts’ reports have noted that it is selling well and is, indeed, outselling its smartphone competitors. But Mr. Jobs said that if the company had waited past the Christmas buying season to reduce prices it would have been forced to delay for another year reaching a broader consumer market. “We’re feeling like being more aggressive,” he said.Chetan Sharma, a telecommunications industry analyst based in Issaquah, Wash., said, “They’re trying to get the next demographic to bite into it.”Another breakthrough Apple product, the original Macintosh, initially sold briskly in 1984 and then stalled abruptly. The Macintosh market did not regain its luster until 1986 with the introduction of the Macintosh II. Apple’s market share among computer makers remains small, in part because of the premium price it places on its Macs. (Apple’s market share in music players has not suffered a similar fate, however.)On Wednesday, Apple executives insisted that the price cut had been planned long ago and that the strategy had been conceived in part to keep the iPhone’s pricing in line with its new iPod Touch, a music player that looks like the iPhone but lacks the phone-calling ability. The sharp price cut, however, suggested that even Apple, which has long lived in a pricing bubble insulated from other personal computer makers, is not immune from the brutal pressures of the cellular phone business.Mr. Jobs said the company was making a “total refresh” of the iPod line, and he demonstrated a series of new features that showed how Apple was turning the music player into a hand-held computer.Mr. Jobs displayed the new flagship iPod Touch, which will sell for $299 for an 8-gigabyte model and $399 for one with twice the capacity.Slightly thinner than an iPhone, the new device has touch-screen controls and a built-in Wi-Fi antenna that allows it to connect directly to the Internet. It also has a browser, which makes it more of a hand-held computer than any other music player.Users will be able to connect to a new iTunes Wi-Fi store where they can download songs directly to their music players without having to connect to a computer.Another feature of the iPod software will be the ability to alert a user entering a Starbucks coffee shop to the music being played there. Then, a tap on the screen will download the song from iTunes.Howard Schultz, Starbucks’s chairman, said Starbucks stores in the United States are being equipped to manage this process. He said that stores in Seattle and New York City would have the ability by Oct. 2 and that other stores across the country would get the service over the next two years.In other announcements, Apple introduced a new iPod Nano, chunkier than before, but with a bigger screen for viewing video. Mr. Jobs said he still hoped that Apple could salvage its relationship with NBC, which had said it would not sell its programs on iTunes. The two companies could not resolve differences over pricing.“The other networks are thrilled,” Mr. Jobs said, “because we actually promoted NBC shows a lot last year and we were getting ready to promote them this year for the new season. Unfortunately that’s not going to happen. I think its a loss for both us and NBC, and I hope it gets put back together. But I don’t think that selling TV shows for a lot more than we are makes any sense. You can watch them for free on TV.”'"
"'07-09-06,'1','OMAHA, Neb. Sept. 5 (AP) — Four of the nation’s biggest microwave popcorn makers are working to remove a flavoring chemical from their products linked to a lung ailment in popcorn plant workers while reassuring consumers about the safety of the snack.Several of the companies discussed their plans Wednesday, a day after a leading lung research hospital warned that consumers also might be in danger from the buttery flavoring diacetyl.The three companies that sell Orville Redenbacher, Act II, Pop Secret and Jolly Time microwave popcorn said they planned to change the recipes for their butter-flavored microwave popcorn to remove diacetyl.Diacetyl has been linked to cases of bronchiolitis obliterans, a rare life-threatening disease often called popcorn lung.ConAgra Foods Inc., General Mills and the American Pop Corn Company all promised to make the change because of safety concerns. Together those companies accounted for more than 80 percent of the market for microwave popcorn over the last 12 months, according to the research firm Information Resources Inc.'"
"'07-09-06,'1','In May, she joined the 16 women in the Senate to appeal publicly for Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi’s release. In June, she met in the White House with refugees and exiles from Myanmar.In the interview on Wednesday, she called for a new vote on a Security Council resolution, eight months after one sponsored by the United States was vetoed by Russia and China as meddling in Myanmar’s internal affairs.“In fact, the United States thinks that it is an issue for the Security Council, both because of the human rights abuses that are going on in Burma, as well as the instability of the government,” she said. (Mrs. Bush, like the United States government, does not recognize the military government’s decision to rename the country Myanmar and uses the country’s traditional name, Burma.)Mrs. Bush, 60, disputed the notion that hers was an unorthodox role or one that seemed out of character. She noted that she had traveled extensively with — and without — her husband and had previously spoken out on matters of policy and politics.“I think this is sort of one of those myths: that I was baking cookies and then they fell off the cookie sheet and I called Ban Ki-moon,” she said in the interview, held in her office in the East Wing, where the bookshelves are filled with the trappings of her more familiar public persona: children’s books.Still, Mrs. Bush has come late to a cause that is, for most Americans, fairly obscure.“As I’ve lived here longer, I realize I became more aware of a chance to speak out about these issues that especially concern me,” she said. “And I wanted to take advantage of that.”It remains to be seen whether Mrs. Bush’s advocacy has a meaningful effect. A previous involvement in foreign policy earned her a dose of criticism. In Egypt in 2005, she praised President Hosni Mubarak’s “very bold step” toward democracy for holding an election that was widely denounced as a sham.Josef Silverstein, professor emeritus at Rutgers University, said Mrs. Bush’s public positions would likely have little effect on Myanmar’s government, which has severely repressed the democratic opposition since ignoring the results of parliamentary elections 17 years ago.He said more than public declarations from an unelected person was necessary.“It can’t be the statement of a first lady,” he said. “It just doesn’t carry any weight in Burmese corridors.”Although Myanmar’s government has withstood criticism and a decade of sanctions, Mrs. Bush argued against resignation on the issue.“So ‘why bother,’ I guess, is the question people ask,” she said. “But I think the answer is, ‘Why not?’ I mean, why not continue to put pressure on the regime in any way we can?”'"

"'07-09-06,'1','As an Army captain deployed in the Sadr City section of Baghdad from 2004 to 2005, I supervised a team of Iraqi translators who worked with my unit in the 1st Cavalry Division. When we arrived in March 2004, there were about 90 Iraqis who had worked with the previous unit.A month later, on April 4, when the Mahdi Army, the militia of the cleric Moktada al-Sadr, initiated open hostilities against American forces, all but about 15 of the translators quit because of the danger to them and their families. These remaining had to live on our base and shuffle their families secretly from Baghdad.These translators accompanied our patrols, exposing themselves to the same risks and discomforts as our troops. In spite of precautions, four translators were brutally murdered by the Mahdi Army.The bottom line is that we could not have operated without our Iraqi translators. As a nation we owe them every opportunity to rebuild their lives here in the United States.'"
"'07-09-06,'1','For the most part the ex-soldiers in the film — the title refers to the day they sustained, and survived, their injuries — are willing to share memories of what happened to them and to talk about their lives. Three of them — Ms. Halfaker; Jacob Schick, 24, an ex-corporal in the Marines; and John Jones, 29, a former Marine staff sergeant — said in telephone interviews that they had concluded the documentary would provide a valuable service. “I just thought it was important to get my story out,” said Mr. Schick, whose leg was amputated above the knee. “I want the American people to see this is what it’s like.”Ms. Halfaker said: “When I first got injured, I wouldn’t talk as much. I didn’t want to acknowledge the reality of it. But then I saw the value of bringing some awareness of the things that are going on in Iraq. I think it was a little bit therapeutic.”On the face of it Mr. Gandolfini makes for an unlikely questioner, as he acknowledged. But his fame, and the familiarity of his character, Tony Soprano, put the soldiers at ease. Mr. Gandolfini was “really respectful with us,” Mr. Schick said. “He didn’t want the cameras on him.”Mr. Gandolfini is barely seen in the film and only occasionally heard. He insisted on that, Sheila Nevins, the president of HBO’s documentary division, said. “He played a tough guy on TV, but Jim knows these are the real tough guys,” she said.The film sprang from a visit Ms. Nevins and Mr. Gandolfini made to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. “He wandered the halls,” Ms. Nevins said. “Everyone knew him. They’d show him their Purple Hearts. I could see him internalizing the whole experience.”At the time HBO was coming up to the premiere of the documentary “Baghdad E.R.,” which chronicled the extraordinary efforts of military medical personnel and the lives they were saving. The film was at first widely praised in the military. But just before a screening in Washington the Pentagon refused to allow military personnel to appear at the HBO event. Ms. Nevins said she concluded that the Pentagon had decided it was an antiwar film.She has no hesitation in declaring herself personally opposed to the war, but she argued that “Baghdad E.R.” presented military doctors heroically. And in the visit to Walter Reed, Ms. Nevins saw a follow-up: a look at some of the lives those doctors saved.She said all was set for production until military officials stepped in, two weeks before shooting was to start, and made Walter Reed off limits to the filmmakers. “There was no explanation why,” Ms. Nevins said.Of course she suspected similar fears of an antiwar message. And they were not entirely unwarranted. But Ms. Nevins said she was personally overwhelmed by what she saw and heard from the veterans. “I didn’t really understand patriotism until we made this film,” she said.After losing access to Walter Reed, Ms. Nevins said, “I got to thinking about how we had the operating theater in the first film. And here we heard all about the theater of operations. And Jim was kind of an Off Broadway guy.”Ms. Nevins put all the theater references together and wound up renting a small downtown performance space in Manhattan, creating an understated theatrical look for the interviews: a stage, a minimal set of just a couple of chairs, a few lights.Mr. Gandolfini “didn’t pretend to be a journalist,” Ms. Nevins said. “But in that moment where Dawn talks about not being able to hold a child, he just waited, like a good actor in a great scene.”The soldiers quickly found a comfort level with Mr. Gandolfini. Mr. Jones, who has two prosthetic legs and feet, had reason to be home with Mr. Gandolfini, for his lieutenant would project DVDs of “The Sopranos” on a bathroom wall when stationed in Iraq.“We began to base ourselves off Tony Soprano and all his gang,” he said. “We’d talk about the godfather” — his commanding officer — “and the lieutenant would tell us to go out and put a hit on a guy.”Mr. Gandolfini said he wanted to do something for the injured vets: “I think these guys are so ignored.” Not that the experience has made him feel especially good about his contribution. “If somebody gets hurt, and you take them to the hospital, should you feel good about it?”The film includes video shot by insurgents, of whom Mr. Gandolfini said: “You hear them saying prayers after they blow up a jeep. It makes you want to pick up a gun and kill somebody.”The soldiers themselves express a range of feelings, from anger to emotional distress. They all acknowledge living with constant pain, physical as well as psychological. One subject, Dexter Pitts, 22, a former Army private, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.“It’s day to day,” Mr. Jones said. “You’re emotional. You have mood swings. I’ll get up in the morning, and it’s O.K., and come home really ticked off. You fight depression.” But he manages to get on ice skates with two prosthetic legs and skate around Bryant Park in Manhattan with his two young children.Mr. Schick said: “I’m a Christian guy. I try to deal with it as best as I know how. Some days you think: Man, what could I have done differently? At the same time I believe there’s a reason for this. God’s not done with me yet.”One reason, he said, was to win this battle. “I’ve got the rest of my life to beat my enemy,” Mr. Schick said. “Every day I just have to get out of my bed, and I beat him.”'"
"'07-09-06,'1','Nikolay Davydenko is the only man who has yet to drop a set at the United States Open this year. He seems undistracted by an investigation into irregular gambling patterns in one of his matches earlier this summer, and he certainly did not seem ruffled by a tired and combustible Tommy Haas.Davydenko defeated Haas, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, and became the third Russian in three matches yesterday to advance to the semifinals in straight sets. The other two were Anna Chakvetadze and the 2004 women’s champion, Svetlana Kuznetsova.Davydenko remained quick-footed and tight-lipped throughout the match as Haas, of Germany, grew desperate trying to find a weak spot in Davydenko’s court coverage.“At times he makes you try to do too much,” Haas said. “He got to me a little mentally. Every time I tried to do something differently to fight my way out of it, he came up with an answer.”Davydenko, who lost to Roger Federer in the semifinals of last year’s tournament, addressed several questions about the gambling investigation, which is reportedly focusing on the unusual amount of money wagered on his lower-ranked opponent at the Polish Open last month. Davydenko eventually dropped out of the match because of injury.'"

Gold, long considered a safe haven, was up 0.7 percent.For market specialists, the employment report, which showed big losses in manufacturing and construction jobs, virtually guaranteed a cut in the next Fed’s benchmark rate, now at 5.25 percent, at the next meeting of policy makers on Sept. 18.The futures market this afternoon was predicting that the Fed would cut rates by half percentage point, to 4.75 percent, up from the quarter point cut they were predicting yesterday. Investors believe the Fed will have to cut rates to 4.5 percent by the end of the year.Wall Street and many housing industry officials have been clamoring for a rate cut for much of the year. In recent days, Fed officials have suggested they are poised to respond to the crisis in the credit markets that started in late July and escalated in August. But policy makers have also noted that they did not yet see broader problems in the economy as a result of the turmoil in the housing and credit markets.“They have been trying everything at their disposal before going for what the market perceives as the magic bullet of a rate cut,” said Douglas M. Peta, chief market strategist at J. W. Seligman & Company, an investment firm in New York. “Only after some time has passed and we have gotten new data, only then they are they going to be cutting. This is the last step providing them with cover to cut.”Over time, lower interest rates should ease borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, but in the nearer term, market specialists agree that any cut may do little to improve the outlook for the economy. People who are having a tough time refinancing a mortgage or businesses who cannot sell bonds may remain locked out of the debt markets for some time to come.For investors, the key concern going forward will be how much will consumers cut back. Until now, they have continued to spend in spite of the trouble some are having with their mortgages and falling home prices. But if the job market weakens significantly from here, that will likely change.“If people have jobs, they pay their bills,” Mr. Peta said. The question is “will weakness in employment lead to weakness in spending?”Spending by consumers, of course, drives corporate profits, which so far this year have defied expectations of a major slowdown. If other reports confirm the weak reading in today’s employment report, analysts are likely to reduce their expectations for profits and stocks could suffer as a result.The Wall Street consensus expectation for earnings growth for the fourth quarter is 11 to 12 percent, notes Robert C. Doll, vice chairman at BlackRock, the asset management company. He expects profits will grow somewhat slower than that, but he does not think that the economy will fall into a recession, which would require the gross domestic product to shrink for two quarters in a row.'"
"'07-09-07,'0','Gerry McCann’s sister, Philomena McCann, told Sky News that the police had suggested Ms. McCann had killed her daughter by accident.“They are suggesting that Kate has in some way accidentally killed Madeleine, then kept her body, then got rid of it,” she said. “I have never heard anything so utterly ludicrous in my entire life.”The police wanted to ask 22 questions that, under Portugese law, they could not pursue unless she was declared a suspect, Ms. McGuinness said. She said that Gerry McCann, the child’s father, was still being treated as a witness.The Portuguese police today confirmed only that there were now two formal suspects in the case but declined to name them. The other formal suspect is Robert Murat, a Briton who lives with his mother near the compound from which Madeleine disappeared. He has maintained his innocence and has not been charged.The police in Portimao called in both parents for fresh questioning after they received the results of forensic evidence collected a few weeks ago from the McCann’s holiday apartment and from other locations, including the rental car, according to news reports. The evidence, which included specks of blood found on the apartment wall and items of clothing, was tested in a British laboratory. Portuguese police officials could not be reached for comment today.Oligario Sousa, a spokesman for the police investigation, said that the investigators were “very happy” with the results from the forensic lab in Britain “because they mean they can go further with the case.” He did not give details of what the police had learned from those tests.Kate McCann is only the second person to be named a suspect in a case that has received unprecedented publicity but which has produced few concrete leads. Madeleine disappeared on May 3 from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, a seaside town in the Algarve region of Portugal. Her parents said they left her asleep with her twin siblings while they ate in a restaurant in the same compound about 100 yards, or 91 meters, away.Kate McCann was greeted by a mob of shouting and whistling onlookers as she arrived for questioning Friday morning at the police station in Portimao, a town about 15 kilometers, or 9 miles, from Praia da Luz. The questioning followed an 11-hour session Thursday from which she emerged looking tired and drawn.Gerry McCann was filmed by television crews arriving at the police station this afternoon.Madeleine’s disappearance convulsed the British public and sparked an outpouring of support from celebrities including J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, and David Beckham, the British soccer star. More than £1 million, or $2 million, has been donated to the McCanns cause.The McCanns, both doctors and committed Catholics, launched a high-profile campaign to keep Madeleine’s face on posters and her name in the headlines, crisscrossing Europe and meeting with Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican.The campaign has helped fuel dozens of sightings and false alarms from Spain to Belgium and Morocco, but none have produced concrete leads.Gerry McCann has chronicled their ordeal on an Internet blog, discussing their morning jogs, his frequent trips to rally support and the couple’s time with their two year-old twins, Sean and Amelie. The couple has given increasingly frank interviews about their guilt at leaving their daughter unprotected.A clutch of journalists has closely followed their lives in Praia da Luz, where they swore they would remain until Madeleine’s fate was discovered, filming the couple as they escorted the twins to day care and made frequent visits to the whitewashed church near the seafront.The McCanns have maintained their innocence throughout the case and angrily denied local press speculation that they were implicated, saying last month that they intended to sue a Portuguese weekly that claimed they had killed Madeleine.“Anyone who knows anything about the 3rd May knows that Kate is completely innocent,” Gerry McCann wrote on his blog Thursday. The McCanns have held regular meetings with the police, which they said were intended to brief them on developments in the case, but Gerry McCann wrote in the blog that Thursday’s session was only the second time Kate had been questioned.“We will fight this all the way, and we will not stop looking for Madeleine,” he wrote.Messages of support streamed in Thursday and Friday to the Web site.Ms. McGuinness reiterated the McCanns’ plea Friday that the hunt for Madeleine continue.“We’ve got every hope that she may still be alive,” Ms. McGuinness said. “I know that Kate prays every day that today may be the day that she is reunited with her daughter Madeleine.”'"
"'07-09-07,'0','The jobs report all but guarantees that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark short-term interest rate when its policy-making committee meets on Sept. 18. A quarter-point reduction to 5 percent remains the most probable move, although a half-point cut now cannot be ruled out, economists said.The weakness of the employment data seemed to change the terms of the debate over the health of the economy. The chances of a recession over the next year now seem to be somewhere between one-quarter and one-half, economists interviewed today said.“I think at least people need to start thinking about the housing market not just as some ring fence problem which is off on its own, and the rest of the economy is doing just fine,” said Nigel Gault, chief United Economist with Global Insight, an economic research firm in Lexington, Mass. “They need to start worrying about the health of the broader economy.”The Bush administration tried to defuse concerns that the weak jobs numbers hinted at a wider economic slowdown. In an interview with Bloomberg Television today, Henry M. Paulson, the Treasury secretary, said the report was “not totally surprising.”“There will be news that isn’t always good news,” he said. “But I feel quite strongly that we have a resilient economy.”For months, Fed officials and Wall Street forecasters have been predicting that the housing slump would slow the economy, but that other strengths — like corporate earnings, growth in other countries and strong wage growth — would keep the slowdown from being severe. That could still happen; in both the 1980s and 1990s economic expansions, employment fell at least once before quickly reversing course.“The financial turmoil and extended problems in housing put the risks for the economy clearly to the downside — no question,” said Mickey Levy, chief economist for Bank of America. “But there are also factors that suggest a longer period of slower growth, but not recession.”One of the most worrisome signs in the jobs report was the government’s revision to its employment data for June and July. The new numbers show just under 70,000 jobs created in each of the two months, down from an average of almost 110,000 according to its initial estimates.In 2005 and 2006, the average monthly job growth was slightly above 200,000.The sharp slowdown this year suggests that some employers have already begun to see a downturn in their business and others believe that one is on the way. With falling house prices in most of the country and rising oil prices, consumer spending has slowed modestly in recent months.State and local government agencies, many of them dealing with budget shortfalls connected to the housing slump, have also cut an average of 27,000 jobs a month over the last three months. But economists said the declines in government employment, especially in schools, may have reflected seasonal quirks that made the job market look worse last month than it truly was.Hospitals, doctors’ offices, restaurants and retailers all added jobs in August.But the bright spots were few and far between. Employment in the finance sector — which includes real estate agencies and accounts for about 8.5 million of the country’s 138 million jobs — was flat in August, which could be a sign that the government numbers have not yet captured some of the mortgage-related job cuts now occurring.The surveys that made up the Labor Department report measured employment from Aug. 12 to Aug. 18, when the credit squeeze and subsequent stock market turmoil were under way but not fully felt. Since then, some large lenders like Countrywide and Lehman Brothers have continued to lay off workers. And just today, IndyMac Bancorp, a large mortgage lender, said it would be cutting about 1,000 jobs over the next several months.“There probably was not that much influence in the data from the credit shock,” said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. “So I think more weakness in the economy is likely. The economy is clearly losing momentum.”The extent to which the economy continues to lose momentum will determine the Fed’s course of action. The price of a futures contract tied to Fed policy shows that the central bank will probably cut the benchmark rate, now at 5.25 percent, to 4.5 percent by the end of the year. But a growing number of economists are saying that might not be soon enough.Mr. Gault of Global Insight, who is forecasting a half-point cut on Sept. 18, said it would send “an important message that the Fed sees there are real problems here, there’s a real threat, and it needs to have a response that’s commensurate to that threat.”Although the unemployment rate held steady at 4.6 percent, the percentage of adults with jobs fell to 62.8 percent, from 63 percent in July and a peak of 63.4 percent in December. The number of people who were neither working nor looking for work — and thus considered neither employed nor unemployed by the government — rose by almost 600,000 in August.“That’s a sign of economic weakness,” Mr. Anderson, of Wells Fargo, said. “Perhaps people just gave up trying to find jobs.”The number of people with part-time jobs who said they would prefer to full time has also been rising in recent months. In August, the Labor Department classified 4.5 million workers as “part time for economic reasons,” up from 4.3 million in July.Wage growth, which often lags behind job growth, did continue at roughly its recent pace. Average hourly earnings for rank-and-file workers — who make up about four-fifths of the work force — have increased 3.9 percent over the last year, to $17.50. Inflation has been running at about 2.5 percent a year.Wall Street had eagerly awaited the jobs report because it was the most significant economic data released since financial markets began to tumble in early August. If the jobs report had been merely lackluster, it might have been welcomed by investors as a sign that a Fed rate cut all but certain and the economy was still growing at a healthy pace.The reversal in job growth, however, was far different from the gain of roughly 100,000 jobs that Wall Street was expecting, raising worries that corporate profits will weaken as the market upheaval moves beyond the housing and financial sectors.“The big question on all of our minds is whether the financial market contagion would reach the labor market,” said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. “And it appears it has with a vengeance.”'"
"'07-09-07,'0','Quarterback Drew Brees was 28 for 41 for 192 yards, but he was picked off 2 times.The Saints’ Reggie Bush was held to 38 yards on 12 carries.A long early drive by the Saints was halted when Bush was stuffed for a three-yard loss by Raheem Brock — Colts fans did not see too many runs stopped for losses last season — and the Saints wound up missing a 52-yard field goal attempt. It was an omen for the night to come, when the Saints’ offense produced only one field goal.It took the Colts more than 13 minutes to get on the board for the first time, an unusually long stretch for a team that prefers to strike quickly. But once the Colts got the ball late in the first quarter, they taught their former teammate, cornerback Jason David, a quick lesson about what life is like playing against Marvin Harrison when the results count. David, who left the Colts in free agency, had surely lined up against Harrison hundreds of times during Colts practices.On Thursday, he was alone covering Harrison, who lined up on the left side of the formation instead of his usual spot on the right. Manning quickly spotted the mismatch. When David’s feet got tangled, Harrison slipped behind him and headed for the back of the end zone, where Manning hit him for a 27-yard touchdown strike to give the Colts a 7-0 lead.But if that play gave the night the promise of the usual pinball numbers these teams put out, it quickly fizzled. The Saints were forced to punt after three downs. Bush, one of the N.F.L.’s most electrifying players, was stopped repeatedly.The Saints’ only touchdown of the first half came, of all things, by way of their overshadowed defense. David made amends for his earlier gaffe when he caught receiver Reggie Wayne in a quick embrace after Wayne caught a short slant pass from Manning at the Saints’ 41-yard line. But this was no hug between friends. David reached in and knocked the ball from Wayne’s hands, then picked it up and returned it 55 yards for the touchdown to tie the score.The Saints, by yardage, were the top-ranked offense in the league last year, better even than the Colts. But they were sloppy Thursday night, plagued by dropped passes and bad timing. Bush rarely flashed his talents, and the Colts’ defense looked as if it wanted to prove that last year’s postseason performance was not a fluke. When Adam Vinatieri kicked a 33-yard field goal, the score at the half was tied at 10-10.The Colts’ game plan in the Manning era has been to get a lead, then unleash a quick defense against opponents who are forced to throw. In the second half, the formula worked to perfection, with Manning hitting on two big plays — one to Harrison, another to Wayne (he was being defended by David on the play) — within 3 minutes 40 seconds, giving him a rhythm that is almost impossible to stop once it gets started.Manning’s brilliance is quickly spotting openings in the defense and exploiting them. When Harrison ran by cornerback Mike McKenzie, Manning struck with a 42-yard pass that put the Colts at the 2-yard line. Joseph Addai ran it in for the touchdown.The Saints went three-and-out, with Bush stopped twice on runs. When the Colts got the ball back, it took them just four plays, including a 28-yard touchdown pass to Wayne on the deep left sideline, to bury the Saints. With the Saints forced into the Colts’ trap, Brees was compelled to pass. And on third and long, his pass intended for Marquis Colston instead was intercepted by Freddy Keiaho at the Colts’ 42-yard line. A 31-yard pass to Wayne on the next play set up another Vinatieri field goal that ballooned the lead to 17 points.Football is not a game for sentimentalists, and even Dungy knows when to pick on a player. Dungy probably knew better than anybody that David was not capable of staying with the Colts receivers. So, in the fourth quarter, Manning again went David’s way, hitting Wayne with a 45-yard pass as he sprinted past David for another touchdown.'"
"'07-09-07,'0','The Town of Rye has failed to comply with its own policies for the purchases of goods and services, and as a result, may have spent more than was necessary, according to a audit released this week by the state comptroller’s office. The report said, for instance, that the town paid $971,009 to eight vendors but had not issued requests for proposals, which are a standard practice. The document further stated that the town did not get written quotes for purchases totaling $110,493 from three vendors, and for four public works contracts totaling $294,017. The report, which examined the period from Jan. 1, 2005, to Sept. 30, 2006, said the town supervisor had not properly overseen the director of purchasing to ensure compliance with local rules and state laws. The supervisor, Robert A. Morabito, said, “I understand the concern of the comptroller’s office, but over the period they examined, there were hundreds of small jobs, 95 percent of which had written or verbal quotes from at least two or three vendors per job.”'"
"'07-09-07,'0','The rebate, at least, was enough to mollify some early iPhone customers like Kevin Tofel, a blogger in Telford, Pa., who writes about mobile phones at a blog called jkOnTheRun. Mr. Tofel was so annoyed with the surprising iPhone price drop that he was planning to make T-shirts that read, “I was a $200 iPhone beta tester for Apple.”“I just felt so used as a consumer,” he said. “They hyped up the iPhone for six months and built up our expectations, and then they grabbed our extra $200 and ran.”But Mr. Tofel was pleased to hear about the store credit. “I think it was probably the best compromise from a P.R. standpoint and the right thing to do for consumers,” he said. “I’m sure they are taking a lot of heat but they are listening to their customers.”Mr. Jobs defended the price cut as the right thing to do and, referring to his 30-year history in the high-tech business, lectured his readers about the risks and rewards of buying into a fast-changing and volatile market for consumer technology products. “This is life in the technology lane,” he wrote.While the iPhone price cut follows the general pattern of falling prices, quickly knocking a third off the price of a high-profile product is unusual for any consumer electronics company, let alone Apple.The price of consumer electronics is always going down thanks to intense competition and the steady decrease of the cost of electronic parts. The pricing is largely determined by Moore’s Law, the observation made by Intel’s co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors on a silicon chip doubles roughly every 18 months. Because this rate of change is described by an exponential curve, it dictates not only that prices fall, but also that they fall at an increasing rate.For example, the average price of a 42-inch high-definition television has declined to $1,522 from $1,844 so far this year, an 18 percent drop, according to the research firm iSuppli. Analysts said they expected a 25 percent drop for the year, but it has been more in years past.Mobile phones tend to be more prone to price declines because the pace of product introductions is faster than for televisions or DVD players. Motorola, for instance, introduced the ultrathin Razr phone for $499 with a two-year service contract in early 2005. Six months later, Motorola realized it had a hit on its hands and dropped the price to $199 in an effort to aim at more mainstream buyers. By the end of 2005, the price was $99.Ken Dulaney, a vice president at Gartner Research, said that in general starting high and dropping the price slowly was a smart strategy. By starting the price high, manufacturers can gauge early demand and reap greater profit from early adopters who are willing to pay any amount to be the first with a particular device. “It’s probably a formula taught in business school,” Mr. Dulaney said.That must have been what Apple was counting on. But the size and speed of the price cut alienated some of Apple’s most loyal supporters.“My love affair with Apple is officially over,” wrote one iPhone owner on the Unofficial Apple Weblog site.Mr. Jobs said the cuts were precipitated by a desire to build demand aggressively for the product in the coming holiday shopping season. Analysts, however, wondered if it was indicative of sagging demand for the expensive phone.“I don’t think it’s a stretch to deduce from this that maybe the rate of sales weren’t meeting expectations, so they decided to drop the price,” said Charles Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. “Bear in mind that Steve Jobs said at the last earnings call that they expected to sell a million devices in the following quarter. Maybe they recognized the trajectory wasn’t going to get them there at that price.”For many customers, though, all was forgiven after learning of the $100 store credit. “My first reaction was ‘Grrrr,’ ” said Lou Hawthorne, an early iPhone buyer in Mill Valley, Calif. “Then again, I want Apple to be successful. I’m also tempted to say I’ve gotten $200 in value since the release.”Rob Enderle, president of the Enderle Group, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif., was skeptical of the store credit.“A $100 credit could be perceived as adding insult to injury,” said Mr. Enderle, noting that store credits are seldom well received. “It’s a way to make you go buy something else, and gives the company a chance to make more money.”But Mr. Enderle might be underestimating the sheer power of Apple loyalty. The company’s fans have in the past overlooked overheating computers, iPods that are easily scratched and batteries that cannot be replaced easily or inexpensively.“I’ll forget about the unexpected credit long before I forget Jobs’s letter, which I found thoughtful in both senses of the word,” Mr. Hawthorne said. “Gestures like this remind me that Apple’s success is not an accident.”'"
"'07-09-07,'0','Chakvetadze was less prescient about her own career. Her mother, Natalia, started her playing at 8 years old in Moscow. “When I was 10, I was a weak tennis player; I was worst in my group,” she said. “No one really wanted to teach me. My parents always believed in me. I never felt I would be a top-10 player.”She said she wanted to stay in Moscow to train, comfortable with her coach and her club conditions. A decade later, Chakvetadze ascended to a career-high No. 6 rating and reached the semifinals in the Australian Open and the French Open before losing to Maria Sharapova.Sharapova, the No. 2 seed, was on track to be Chakvetadze’s quarterfinal opponent this tournament, too. But Agnieszka Radwanska upset her in the fourth round.It is clear that Chakvetadze and Sharapova, who left Russia at 9 to train in Florida, operate in different worlds.“No, actually I don’t speak with her, I never speak with her,” Chakvetadze said, adding that Sharapova is very private. Chakvetadze held a relaxed interview yesterday in the garden outside the players’ lounge while her father, Djambuli, was lying happily on a nearby bench, cellphone to his ear.Chakvetadze, who has spent time in the Russian neighborhood of Brighton Beach this tournament, carries a similar exuberance and innocence after a strong summer on the hardcourts.She won a tournament at Stanford and then defeated Williams in three sets at San Diego. In California, she connected with Robert Lansdorp, who has coached Sharapova and Lindsay Davenport, and the two worked to improve her serve.Chakvetadze does not possess a booming serve or powerful ground strokes, relying instead on her slice backhand, and quick feet and mind that draw comparisons to Martina Hingis. As much as she is tired of that comparison, Chakvetadze acknowledges that studying psychology at Moscow University has helped her break down her opponents. Like Henin, she has not dropped a set in this tournament.But hardly anyone is talking about Chakvetadze. “Of course if I improve my game, people know me,” she said.Kuznetsova, 22, comes in with the edge of experience, having made three semifinals in Grand Slam tournaments. But the contrast to the top half of the women’s draw was stunning; Henin and Williams have each reached 16 semifinals and won 6 major titles.“I think it was unfortunate that the upper draw was very, very strong and we had to play each other,” No. 3 Jelena Jankovic said Wednesday after losing to Williams in three sets. “Whoever wins from that top will win the whole tournament.”Henin, the 25-year-old reigning French Open champion, knocked off Serena Williams in the quarterfinals. She is trying to become the first woman to defeat both sisters in the same Grand Slam event and win the title.It has been four and a half years since she has played Venus. Henin has lost the last six of their seven meetings. All were before she won her six titles, including the 2003 United States Open.Venus, 27, has not made the semifinals here since 2002, when she lost to Serena in the final. She is attempting to win consecutive Wimbledon and United States Open titles for the first time since 2001, playing with renewed aggressiveness and the good health that marked her early years.Asked Wednesday if she could boost her Grand Slam trophy tally into double digits, Williams smiled. “Definitely,” she said. “I look forward to the future because I love winning and I love competing.”It seems that Chakvetadze has arrived on a scene that is not changing any time soon.'"
"'07-09-07,'0','Wall Street shook off early uncertainty to close moderately higher yesterday as mixed economic reports made investors more optimistic about the chances of a cut in interest rates.The market was uneasy after the Mortgage Bankers Association said the percentage of homeowners beginning the foreclosure process reached a record 0.65 percent in the second quarter — the third consecutive quarter that the figure set a record. Though investors want growth to be slow enough to merit a rate cut when the Federal Reserve meets Sept. 18, they do not want to see the economy weaken to the point of recession.But investors gleaned some reason for optimism from comments by Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who said inflationary pressures were “increasingly well behaved,” and that the Fed was “listening carefully” to signals about business conditions. William Poole, president of the St. Louis Fed, made similar comments earlier in the day.“They didn’t explicitly say they were going to cut rates, but some of the talk from the day gave reason to believe they may be leaning that way,” said Todd Salamone, director of trading at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 57.88, or 0.44 percent, to 13,363.35.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 6.26, or 0.43 percent, to 1,478.55, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 8.37, or 0.32 percent, to 2,614.32. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.35, or 0.04 percent, to 792.92.'"
"'07-09-07,'0','“It’s a perfect storm for real estate agents,” said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online brokerage in Seattle. “Not only have unprecedented numbers flocked to the profession, but at the same time you have the mortgage meltdown, the housing bubble bursting, and online competitors attacking the commission structure.”Traditional real estate agents, who depend entirely on commissions, “are beset on all sides,” Mr. Kelman said.Indeed, membership in the National Association of Realtors, the national trade group and lobbying organization for the sales side of the housing industry, increased by 163,000 in 2005, to almost 1.3 million members, but grew by only 6,000 in the first six months of this year.When an entry-level middle-class home in major markets on either coast lists at $500,000 and pays out a 6 percent sales commission, it is easy to see how an agent could get excited. In reality, the agent’s commission, after splits with other agents and the brokerage company, is closer to about 1.5 percent. Even so, sell 10 homes a year, and you are making a fine living.The problem is that when everyone else jumps into the field, few new agents can hope to sell more than one or two homes a year. According to the National Association of Realtors, agents earn an average of $49,000 a year.That is an income Randy Haddadin would have welcomed. Mr. Haddadin, 38, moved to Miami Beach in December 2003 from Washington, after leaving a job in information technology. He promptly got his real estate license.Mr. Haddadin had a few disadvantages. He was new to the business and new to Miami Beach. And newcomers have an especially difficult time in a business that requires constant networking, most crucially during slowdowns.“I didn’t really go out and network like I should have,” Mr. Haddadin said, with a tinge of self-recrimination. Even if he had distributed bushels of business cards, he said, there was nothing he could have done about the bad timing. “It wasn’t a time for someone not from this area to start,” he said.Mr. Haddadin is now weighing his options. He might seek a job in information technology again, or perhaps help a friend open an Italian restaurant in Miami Beach, while selling real estate on the side.Chang-Tai Hsieh, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the economics of real estate, said he was not surprised to see that agents in South Florida were getting out. “When the price of housing goes up, you have people jump in, and when the price of housing falls, people jump out,” he said.Professor Hsieh said this was generally true across the nation. In areas where housing prices have fallen significantly, such as Miami, the number of agents falls commensurately. If a market remains relatively steady, he said, so does the number of agents.And for those who stay in the business, the 80-20 rule applies. “Eighty percent of the business is done by 20 percent of the people,” said Jay Costello, president of Hill & Company, a brokerage in San Francisco. And those, he added, tend to be well-established, well-connected agents.Some who want to stay in the business are taking a second look at working for commissions. “People who used to turn up their nose at working for us are now drilling holes to get into the building,” said Mr. Kelman of Redfin, which pays a salary and a bonus based on customer satisfaction.He said that during the first six months of 2007, Redfin received 2,000 résumés and hired 34 agents, bringing the total at Redfin to 40. Mr. Kelman says he expects to hire 35 to 50 more agents in the next year.Even some people who were making a good living as real estate agents are adjusting their careers. Edie Narrido got her license in 2002 in San Francisco, and after two unsteady years, she started to do well. “I was peaking,” she said, “but I noticed the market was slipping.”In 2005, in search of more stable work, Ms. Narrido went to work for a sales and marketing company that helps developers sell newly built residential units. She still works for a commission, but the income is much steadier. And as she watches the San Francisco market slow down, she said, she has no regrets.“In the resale industry, you have no idea where your next sale is going to be,” said Ms. Narrido. “It’s like trying to look into a crystal ball.”It was intuition that prompted Sonia Montana, 48, to abandon real estate three years ago and take a job selling life insurance in South Florida. For some reason she cannot pinpoint, she said, she decided it was a good time to get out.“When I moved to insurance, everyone said: ‘Are you crazy? You’re doing so well,’ ” recalled Ms. Montana, who works for New York Life in Weston, Fla., 20 miles west of Fort Lauderdale. Now those people, many of them former colleagues, are looking for ways to get out.“I’m amazed that I was right,” she said.In areas still bracing for a more significant downturn, an exodus is anticipated.“I think we’re going to see a lot of that in the upcoming year,” said Kathleen McDonough, who has been an agent for nearly 14 years in Montclair, N.J., one of the last areas in that state to be affected by the real estate slowdown. “But I can see there’s trouble ahead,” she said. “I think among the less experienced agents, or agents who might consider retirement, I can see a lot of attrition.”The thinning of the ranks is welcomed by those who plan to stick it out.“It’s great for people like me,” said Tamara Krause, an agent in Boston who said she has no intention of giving up. “Because a lot of those people who just got in are now getting out.”'"
"'07-09-07,'0','James E. Jackson Jr., a civil rights activist, former official of the American Communist Party and defendant in a case that led the Supreme Court to rule that the Smith Act of 1940 did not prohibit the advocacy of violent revolution, died on Saturday in Manhattan. He was 92 and lived in Brooklyn.The death was announced by his daughter Harriet Jackson.Mr. Jackson was one of 21 Communist Party members who were indicted in 1951, at the height of the McCarthy era, for, among other things, teaching classes on violent revolution. The case was front-page news around the country.He was one of six of those defendants whose conspiracy convictions under the Smith Act were unanimously reversed by a federal appeals court in 1958. The reversal was based on Yates v. United States, a 1957 Supreme Court ruling in the overall case that the mere teaching or advocacy of an overthrow of the government did not constitute a “call to action.”Most of the 21 defendants had been convicted and imprisoned. But Mr. Jackson and five others went into hiding — “roaming the country like during the underground railroad,” his wife, Esther Cooper Jackson, said on Wednesday. Mr. Jackson did not see his family until 1956, when he surrendered and, with his colleagues, was convicted of conspiracy.The next year, with the Red Scare somewhat subsiding, the Supreme Court issued its Yates v. United States decision, stating that the Smith Act “requires more than the teaching and advocacy of an abstract doctrine that the government should be overthrown by force and violence.” The appeals court overturned the convictions, ruling that the government had failed to prove that the defendants had urged people to “do something” rather than “believe in something.”'"
"'07-09-07,'0','TRENTON, Sept. 6 (AP) — New Jersey’s Supreme Court rejected on Thursday a class-action lawsuit against Merck & Company over the drug maker’s withdrawn painkiller Vioxx.The ruling is a huge legal victory for the company, which faces nearly 27,000 individual lawsuits from people claiming that Vioxx, once a widely used arthritis treatment, caused heart attacks and strokes.The state’s highest court, reversing two lower court decisions, ruled that a nationwide class was not appropriate for the lawsuit. The suit had been brought by a union health plan on behalf of all insurance plans that paid for Vioxx prescriptions, or about 80 percent of all Vioxx sold.A lawyer for the New Jersey union said that because the state’s consumer fraud law allows for triple damages, the case could have cost Merck $15 billion to $18 billion. The company’s annual revenue last year was $22.6 billion.Had the class action been allowed to proceed, it also would have been a major setback to the company’s strategy of fighting the Vioxx lawsuits individually. Of the cases that have reached verdicts, Merck has won nine and lost five. A new trial was ordered in one case, and two others ended in mistrials this year.Shares of Merck, which is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., rose more than 2 percent, to $50.47, Thursday.“We were thrilled with the decision,” said John Beisner, who argued the case for Merck.Christopher A. Seeger, lead lawyer for the plaintiff, the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 68 in West Caldwell, N.J., said he would pursue separate claims on behalf of individual health plans. He said that the high court did not rule that the state’s consumer fraud law could not be applied to health plans from other states, so those claims could still be pursued in New Jersey, with the possibility of triple damages.'"
"'07-09-07,'0','WASHINGTON, Sept. 6 (AP) — Worker productivity rebounded in the April-June quarter, growing at the fastest pace in nearly two years, while wage pressures eased, the Labor Department reported Thursday.Both developments are likely to reduce inflation worries.Productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, increased to an annual growth rate of 2.6 percent in the April-June quarter, the department said, better than the 1.8 percent increase originally reported in estimates.Wage pressures, as measured by unit labor costs, slowed to an annual growth rate of 1.4 percent; the rate of increase had been initially estimated at 2.1 percent.Rising wages are good for workers, but if those gains are not accompanied by increased productivity, they can lead to inflation. If productivity is growing, businesses can pay their workers more out of the increased output rather than by raising prices.In other economic news, the number of newly laid off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits fell last week for the first time in seven weeks.'"
"'07-09-07,'0','“I’m really happy that the people are looking at me in that way and are talking positive things about me,” Djokovic said. “My goal is to be No. 1 player of the world. I’ve been working for that all my life. And still I’m just 20, so I have a lot of time left. And of course priority is to play tennis, and the rest of the things are coming naturally.”Djokovic has launched himself into the top echelon of the rankings with a spectacular season. He reached the semifinals of the French Open, where he lost to Nadal, then reached the semifinals of Wimbledon before a bad back and an infected blister on his foot forced him to retire, again against Nadal. He also charged through a hardcourt tournament in Montreal earlier this month, defeating Andy Roddick, Nadal and No. 1 Roger Federer.Now, with Nadal having fallen in the fourth round to Ferrer, Djokovic faces a different challenge in his first United States Open semifinal.“I am going to be a favorite in that match, looking at the stats, the rankings,” Djokovic said. “But I think everything is open and anything can happen.”Djokovic did show signs of fatigue from his long summer in his match against Moyá. He was growing frustrated at times in the first two sets. It was when he reached the tie breaker in the second that he played his best.When Moyá reached a set point on Djokovic’s serve, Djokovic missed his first serve. Instead of being careful to get the second one in, he fired a 118-mile-an-hour serve that caught Moyá off-guard. Djokovic saved the set point and later grabbed the momentum for good.“I think he does everything well,” Moyá said. “I would say the best is when he has to raise his game, he does. When he’s in a difficult situation is when he’s playing his best. That only happens when you’re a big champion.”Moyá, 31 and a longtime Tour veteran, said he saw a bit of Djokovic’s imitations once he reached the locker room. “That’s a gift, and he does it very well,” Moyá said. “So if he doesn’t succeed in tennis, maybe he has a good career in that.”Djokovic said he did not begin sharing his imitations until after he had started climbing in the rankings, so players would not take his humor the wrong way before they knew him. He said the players have taken their ribbings in the proper spirit.He said there was one player he has had trouble imitating.“Well, the untouchable one, Roger,” Djokovic said, referring to Federer. “He’s too perfect for my style. Plus, I don’t have a long hair.”“I hope he doesn’t hear this,” he said.Too late. Clearly, everyone is paying attention to Djokovic.'"
"'07-09-07,'0','“The rehabilitation has been slow,” he said in a recent interview. “That’s been tough for me because there’s not a lot of time to do that. It’s a gradual thing, and that’s what I have to work on.”This week, Westhoff returned to using the crutches he had discarded a couple of months ago. He was out on the practice field Thursday during special-teams drills, pacing in the middle of the action while barking commands, using his right crutch to direct traffic.His players, who love his frank and fiery demeanor, conceded that it would be strange to have Westhoff in their ears Sunday, communicating through a headset, but not in their faces.“When he’s in that huddle, he gets you ready to play,” said Brad Smith, who returns kicks and also recorded 11 tackles on special teams last season as a rookie. “You can tell he believes in what he’s saying. He believes in the guys out there that they’re going to do the job.”With Westhoff perched in the press box, the two special-teams captains: linebacker Brad Kassell and kicker Mike Nugent, will stand in for him on the field.“It’s hard to replace that guy,” Kassell said. “This group’s very easy to look over because they do most of the patrolling themselves.”Justin Miller, who made the Pro Bowl team as a kick returner last season, said, “As individuals we all understand the goal ahead and what we have to get accomplished, and he’ll still be very much involved.” He laughed. “We’ll probably all have headsets on by the end of the game, and he’ll be talking to us.”Sunday’s game will feature two of the best special-teams units in the league. Under Brad Seely’s tutelage, the Patriots’ Laurence Maroney finished second in the N.F.L. last season with a 28-yard kickoff-return average. The previous season, the Patriots averaged 44.6 yards a punt to rank fourth in the league.For the Jets last season, Miller averaged 28.3 yards a return with two touchdowns, Nugent converted his final 18 field-goal attempts, and the punt-coverage unit did not allow a return of more than 18 yards.In the first regular-season meeting between the teams in 2006, the Jets’ Bryan Thomas blocked a 29-yard field-goal attempt in the final minutes to give the offense one final chance to send the game into overtime or win it outright. The possession ended when Chad Pennington threw an interception to seal the Patriots’ 24-17 victory.“Mike Westhoff does a great job with them,” New England Coach Bill Belichick said. “They do a good job in every phase of the game. Their field-goal rush is one of the best in the league. We have a lot of respect for each and every play in the kicking game that we go against because they are dangerous on every single one of them.”Westhoff has spent this week the way he normally does, standing in the thick of things, cajoling and emphatically correcting his players so that on Sunday, no matter where he is, they will all be in the right place.The Patriots have outscored the Jets by 106-71 in winning three of their last four meetings dating to the penultimate game of the 2005 season. The Jets have not defeated the Patriots at the Meadowlands since Sept. 11, 2000. All of which means nothing to David Bowens, a defensive end who came to the Jets as a free agent from the Miami Dolphins. Bowens said each season is a new book. To accentuate his remark, he pointed to the book in his locker: “The Secret” by Rhonda Byrne, which is on The New York Times best-seller list. The book stresses better living through positive thinking, and Bowens said he has “applied it to how I approach football.”'"
"'07-09-07,'0','MINDEN, Nev., Sept. 6 — A few years back, after six friends climbed Granite Peak in Montana, five of them pulled off their helmets to pose for a summit photo. The one who did not, Steve Fossett, told his friends that it was unsafe to remove the helmet, even after the climb was over.Patrick Arbor, one of Mr. Fossett’s companions on that and many other outdoors adventures, stared at that photo, on his desk in his Chicago office, on Thursday as he wondered where the renowned adventurer might be.Mr. Fossett, 63, who holds more than 110 aviation, boating and land-speed records, vanished Monday after taking off in a single-engine aerobatic plane for a recreational jaunt in northern Nevada. He was expected back a few hours later at the Flying M Ranch, an aviation resort owned by the hotel magnate William Barron Hilton, but never returned.“He’s absolutely not a reckless person, he’s a very cautious, methodical person,” said Mr. Arbor, a former Chicago Board of Trade chairman who has known Mr. Fossett for more than 30 years. “I have traveled all over the world with him. I kind of joke that traveling with him is like traveling with a wandering drugstore because he travels with all kinds of antibiotics and such. He takes risks, but not reckless risks.”Although the aircraft he flew, a blue-and-white Citabria Super Decathlon, is an aerobatic plane, friends said Mr. Fossett did not enjoy doing airplane tricks and was most likely scouting dry lake beds in the high desert region where he might try to break the land-speed record in a race car sometime in 2008.'"

No major daily newspaper would dare show veterans such disrespect. Yet we’ve heard so many put-downs of organized labor for so long that we hardly notice, let alone object.Taught to value low prices over fair wages, we’ve come to believe that our modest portfolios and high-priced homes will finance our children’s education and our retirement — if those pesky unions would just stop being so greedy and quit demanding living wages, health insurance and pensions.Get choked up on Labor Day? You bet. Dead miners, toxic toys and so many layoffs they’re no longer news are ample reason. Last century, the labor movement built America’s strong middle class, turning bad jobs into good ones, transforming hard-working men and women into proud homeowners and financially secure, retired parents of college grads. And they are still fighting that fight today.Oh, what most working Americans would give for steady jobs with health and retirement plans, paid sick and vacation days and decent hours. At least once a year on Labor Day, let’s rise to salute the labor movement’s many important contributions to the quality of life in the United States, instead of sinking to sling flip insults that, in the end, belittle us all.The writer is the author of “The Betrayal of Work.”'"
"'07-09-07,'0','Since the company had to make a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to get the additional money, and since it could not do that without Deloitte’s blessing, the additional money will not be coming.NovaStar says it will soldier on, cutting costs and hoping to get by. Since the stock is still trading around $6 a share, it appears that some investors think it can do so. But at current prices, the company has a market capitalization far below the dividend it is supposed to declare later this month.NovaStar holds a special place in the market not because of the problems it has encountered, which are similar to those of others in its business, but because of the long and bitter battle waged between investors who believed in the stock and those who did not.Before Overstock.com, Nova-Star was the stock of focus for those who believed their stocks were being sabotaged by “naked short sellers” who drive a company’s share price down by selling shares they had not bought or borrowed.It was NovaStar that Patrick Byrne, Overstock’s chief executive, pointed to when he began what he called his “jihad” against naked shorts. There is a suit pending by some NovaStar shareholders against major brokerage firms, charging that they aided naked shorting and thus cost the investors money.At last report, NovaStar had 9.5 million shares outstanding, and a short position of 8.1 million shares, a very high proportion. Overstock, by contrast, has a short position equal to less than a quarter of the shares outstanding. (It also has confounded the shorts by rising sharply this year.)In its prime, NovaStar appeared, to its fans anyway, to be a money machine. It was organized as a real estate investment trust, and it reported high taxable income that it paid out in dividends. The high yield attracted investors and made it easy to sell more shares, which it regularly did. Its shares were worth $1.8 billion.Critics asserted NovaStar used questionable accounting to produce those profits as well as other dubious business practices. One of its current problems is a $46 million judgment won by a competitor who said NovaStar conspired to drive it out of business.Accounting in the mortgage business is notoriously inexact. NovaStar, like many other companies, sold mortgages on terms that left it with some of the risk. Just how much profit it reported depended on a series of assumptions about those risks.“If our actual experience differs materially from the assumptions that we use,” NovaStar said in the annual report that Deloitte is no longer willing to certify, “our future cash flows, our financial condition and our results of operations could be negatively affected.”That warning was prescient. With mortgage defaults rising, it appears NovaStar paid dividends from ephemeral profits.The REIT status that helped make NovaStar attractive is now its albatross. The company’s last estimate said it would have to pay $157 million more in dividends to satisfy tax rules that require REITs to pay out profits to shareholders. In July, it talked of paying the dividend with preferred stock rather than cash.But that may be tricky. At current market prices, the entire company is worth far less than $100 million, so how can it give out preferred stock worth more than that?The $48 million July investment in NovaStar, made by funds affiliated with the Jefferies Group and the MassMutual Corporation, seemed bold at the time. Now it seems foolish, providing for the purchase of preferred stock convertible to common at $28 a share.The funds will not comment, but there is nothing — other than a fear of throwing good money after bad — to stop them from making a new investment, presumably on better terms. Perhaps significantly, Jefferies and MassMutual have not exercised their right to name two new NovaStar directors.Had Deloitte not rebelled at the last moment, NovaStar would have the extra $101 million. Without it, the battle for survival will be that much harder.'"

"'07-09-08,'0','Mr. Romney bristles when he is accused of shifting on the issue, as he has on abortion, pointing out that he has been consistent in personally opposing both marriage and civil unions between people of the same sex.On the stump, he usually makes a point of saying that he opposes discrimination against gays. But he refrains from details when pressed as to how he might fight it.Jonathan Spampinato, a Republican activist who is openly gay and worked as Mr. Romney’s deputy political director during the run for governor, says he always felt that Mr. Romney was comfortable with gays. When it came to gay rights beyond the issue of marriage, Mr. Spampinato recalls, Mr. Romney asserted during that campaign that there was only the smallest difference between himself, a supporter of domestic partnership rights like survivorship and hospital visitation, and his Democratic opponent, Shannon O’Brien, who backed civil unions.“He explained his position to Log Cabin club members early on,” Mr. Spampinato remembered, “by saying, ‘Regardless of what you call it, if you look at the benefits I support and the benefits Shannon supports, there’s probably a hair of difference.’ ”Calling Mr. Romney a flip-flopper on gay rights would be overly simplistic, Mr. Spampinato said. But he conceded that his old boss had promised the Log Cabin members that he would not champion a fight against same-sex marriage.“It’s definitely a shift in political priorities and strategy,” he said.Recollections by gay Republicans whom Mr. Romney courted and worked with during his campaign for governor, and in his unsuccessful run for the Senate in 1994, produce a portrait of a man they genuinely saw as their partner in their fight for broader acceptance.After the breakfast meeting in 2002, where the Log Cabin board unanimously decided to endorse him, he said in an interview with Bay Windows, a gay newspaper, that he would use his bully pulpit as governor to lobby legislators for domestic partnership benefits.“Those kinds of things I think I can generate a great deal of public support for,” he said, “and therefore create pressure for legislators that otherwise might not think in those terms.”And, in the aftermath of the Massachusetts court decision, Mr. Romney, though aligning himself with the supporters of a constitutional amendment, did order town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Some members of Log Cabin Republicans say that in doing so, he ultimately fulfilled his promise to them despite his own moral objections.But far more express a sense of outrage at what they deem a betrayal in his current positioning.“I didn’t see him necessarily carrying the flag with missionary zeal” for gay rights back in 2002, said Richard Babson, a Log Cabin member who was at the breakfast meeting. “But I also didn’t see him carrying the flag with missionary zeal for the other side.”Mr. Romney’s eldest son, Tagg, 37, says that back in the early 1990s, he told his father privately that he was thinking about becoming a Democrat.His father sat him down to dissuade him, taking him through the differences between Republicans and Democrats. Tagg Romney says he does not remember his father’s talking about abortion, another issue that has troubled his candidacy, but he does remember being warned that Democrats would lead the country toward same-sex marriage.“He thought it was very wrong to discriminate,” Tagg Romney said. “But where Democrats are going, they’ll eventually want to extend marriage to gays. I said, ‘No way.’ ”Even as early as 1994, when Mr. Romney challenged Edward M. Kennedy for a Senate seat, there were some Log Cabin members who harbored reservations about him. The Boston Globe published an article quoting several people who said Mr. Romney had delivered an address at a Mormon gathering that year in which he called homosexuality “perverse.”For all of that, some activists were optimistic about him. Log Cabin members had been very supportive of William F. Weld, the Republican incumbent as governor, who was fiscally conservative but moderate on social issues. Many members of the club believed Mr. Romney would be similar, especially after meeting with him.“He couldn’t have been more kind and interested in understanding gay rights,” said Rich Tafel, who was executive director of Log Cabin’s national organization at the time. “He struck me as a business person who just wanted to understand this issue, and he wanted to communicate that he wasn’t antigay at all.”Leaders of the group worked with Mr. Romney’s Senate campaign to draft a letter, which he eventually released, about his commitment to gay rights. He declared that he would go beyond Mr. Kennedy’s considerable record on the issue. He pledged his support for federal legislation that barred discrimination against gay men and lesbians in employment, and praised President Bill Clinton’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy for the military as a first step toward “gays and lesbians being able to serve openly and honestly.”“If we are to achieve the goals we share, we must make equality for gays and lesbians a mainstream concern,” he wrote. “My opponent cannot do this. I can, and will.”'"
"'07-09-08,'0','There was no comment from many Democrats whose campaign coffers had been enhanced by Mr. Hsu — Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois, Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, and others, who have said they would give the money he donated to charities. Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, who had called Mr. Hsu “one of the best 10 people I’ve met,” said yesterday that he was “disappointed,” and would give the $38,000 he had received to charity.Other friends who have recently seen Mr. Hsu described him yesterday as a broken man. “He was extraordinarily distraught,” said one who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for Mr. Hsu. “He said he had not been hiding out, but had been leading a life that was highly visible.” Another friend said Mr. Hsu was “in bad shape,” adding: “It was obvious he was under stress and strain. At some point, he seemed to be confused.”Mr. Hsu’s lawyer in San Francisco, James J. Brosnahan, said that “in the last 36 hours, a great many friends of Norman Hsu have expressed concern about his mental health and well-being.” He added: “The strain he has been under during the last week has been enormous, and perhaps unbearable. We will be getting him the best medical care available.”Details of the latest accusations were sealed by the court. But the tale of his double life as a businessman-donor and as a fugitive has emerged in outline in recent days. It all began, according to the California Department of Justice, with latex gloves that did not exist.Mr. Hsu, who was born and raised in Hong Kong and came to the United States at 18 to attend the University of California, Berkeley, started several sportswear companies in the 1980’s, but his career hit a low in 1989 when he began raising cash from investors in a plan to buy and sell latex gloves.In 1991, he was charged with stealing $1 million from 20 investors in what the California authorities called a Ponzi scheme. In February 1992, he pleaded no contest to one count of grand larceny in an agreement that called for three years in prison. But he failed to appear for sentencing on June 10, 1992.Investigators believe he fled to Hong Kong and worked in the garment trade. At some point, Mr. Hsu, a naturalized American, returned to New York and in 2003 made the first of some $600,000 in contributions to federal, state and municipal campaigns. He also gave about $100,000 to the New School in New York, and became a board member with a scholarship in his name. He has since cut his ties to the university.While Mr. Hsu made no secret of his political, university and business associations, he also listed nonexistent businesses and addresses that were mail drops. So questions about the source of his money and his rise in influential circles remained when news of his past began to emerge last month. On Aug. 31, he surrendered in California on the fugitive warrant in the 1992 case, posted $2 million in bail and was ordered to appear again last Wednesday. That was the hearing he skipped.'"
"'07-09-08,'0','A videotaped message by Osama bin Laden, the first in nearly three years, compares the Iraq war to American blunders in Vietnam, criticizes the Democratic Party for failing to pull American troops from Iraq, and urges Americans to embrace Islam.Details of the video emerged yesterday, the same day that the director of the Central Intelligence Agency gave a public warning about Al Qaeda’s gathering strength and unapologetically defended his agency’s campaign to kill and capture the group’s operatives worldwide.The video, timed to the approaching sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, shows the leader of Al Qaeda with a black beard, and his references to news events appear to date the tape to within the past few months.The 26-minute video does not contain any direct warnings of an impending attack, focusing instead on the Iraq war and the “terrorism” of Western leaders, including President Bush, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. Mr. bin Laden vowed to “continue to escalate the killing and fighting” in Iraq.President Bush, speaking in Sydney, Australia, said, “Iraq is part of this war against extremists,” The Associated Press reported. “If Al Qaeda bothers to mention Iraq, it’s because they want to achieve their objectives in Iraq, which is to drive us out.”'"
"'07-09-08,'0','The current system logs statistics for every match played at the Open. On the show courts, statisticians and radar operators record additional information, such as serve speed and location.Last year, I.B.M. began producing DVDs for the players that synchronize match data with video. The DVDs have become popular as a training tool because they allow players and coaches to browse key moments of a match, point by point. None of these innovations would be possible without Broder’s software, CHUMP, which stands “for chair umpire,” he said with a grin.The chair umpire uses a device to record how each point ends. That information is fed to the statistics room, then transmitted to the Open Web site and scoreboards around the center.“Those of us who did this professionally could see the day when it would look like this,” Broder said. “And as the technology caught up with the ideas, we got to where we are now.”It takes 10 days to get the center wired and ready for the tournament. After that, the system pretty much runs itself, although there are occasional mishaps.When something goes down, he said, “it’s usually because of something stupid; someone runs a cart over our wires, something like that.”A PERFECT MATCH There are doubles specialists who make their living, and sometimes garner a little fame, away from the singles spotlight. And there are players who hope to find a regular partner they can count on to have a shot at winning a major title.Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Julian Knowle of Austria accomplished that goal yesterday, capturing the men’s doubles title with a 7-5, 6-4 victory against the Czech team of Lukas Dlouhy and Pavel Vizner. It was the first Grand Slam title for both men.Aspelin and Knowle, seeded 10th, got together earlier this year when Jürgen Melzer, who Knowle had teamed with, injured his wrist. Aspelin had been playing with different partners from tournament to tournament.“I was looking for a partner for the season, also for the next couple weeks,” Knowle said. “Immediately, it worked pretty well.”LOOKING INTO GAMBLING Officials for the four Grand Slam tournaments, the men’s and women’s tours and the International Tennis Federation have talked about creating a joint commission on gambling “similar to the approach that we’ve taken to doping,” said Larry Scott, the chief executive of the WTA Tour.“This has now risen to a level where we think we’re working together to pool resources,” Scott said yesterday. In the wake of the ATP’s investigation into suspicious betting in a match in Poland last month involving Nikolay Davydenko, who is in the Open semifinals, Scott said he had not been made aware of suspicious activities involving betting and the WTA Tour.

"'07-09-08,'0','But Mr. Levkovich cautioned that investors might have been drawing overly broad conclusions about the economy based on data for just one month.In a classic move away from risk, investors rushed into Treasuries yesterday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction from the note’s price, fell to its lowest level, at 4.37 percent, in more than a year and a half. On Thursday evening, the yield was 4.51 percent.The price of the 10-year note rose 1 3/32 yesterday, to 103 1/32.For market specialists, the employment report, which showed big losses in manufacturing and construction jobs, virtually guaranteed a cut in the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate, now at 5.25 percent, at the next meeting of policy makers on Sept. 18.The dollar fell against most major world currencies on anticipation of a rate cut and weakening economic conditions in the United States. The Japanese yen gained 1.7 percent against the dollar and the euro was up 0.57 percent. Gold, long considered a safe haven, was up 0.7 percent.The futures market yesterday afternoon was predicting that the Fed would cut rates by half a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, up from the quarter-point cut they were predicting on Thursday. Futures activity also showed that investors were expecting the rate to be cut to 4.5 percent by year-end.Wall Street and many housing industry officials have been clamoring for a rate cut for much of the year. Many investors were looking to the jobs report, the most significant economic data released since financial markets began to tumble in early August, to provide an impetus for a cut.A lackluster jobs report would have spurred a cut while also offering some assurance that the overall economy was still growing. But the loss of jobs raised some concerns among investors that corporate profits and wage income will weaken as the market turmoil expands beyond the financial and housing sectors.In recent days, Fed officials have suggested that they are poised to respond to the crisis in the credit markets that started in late July and escalated in August.But policy makers have clearly noted that they did not yet see broader problems in the economy as a result of the turmoil in the housing and credit markets.“They have been trying everything at their disposal before going for what the market perceives as the magic bullet of a rate cut,” said Douglas M. Peta, chief market strategist at J. W. Seligman & Company, an investment firm in New York.Now that the latest data shows some weakness in the economy, the Fed will move ahead with a rate cut, Mr. Peta said. “This is the last step providing them with cover to cut.”Over time, lower interest rates should ease borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, but in the nearer term, market specialists agree that a rate cut will not provide much of a lift to the economy. People who are having a tough time refinancing a mortgage or business executives who cannot sell bonds may remain locked out of the debt markets.For investors, the primary concern going forward will be how much consumers will cut back. Until now, they have continued to spend in spite of the trouble some are having with rising mortgage rates and falling home prices. But if the job market weakens significantly, that is likely to change.“If people have jobs, they pay their bills,” Mr. Peta said. The question, he said, is: “Will weakness in employment lead to weakness in spending?”Spending by consumers, of course, drives corporate profits, which so far this year have defied expectations of a major slowdown. If other reports confirm the weak reading in yesterday’s employment report, analysts are likely to reduce their expectations for profits, and stocks could suffer as a result.Wall Street expects that earnings will increase at an 11 percent to 12 percent pace in the fourth quarter, notes Robert C. Doll, vice chairman at BlackRock, the asset management company.He expects profits to grow somewhat slower than that, but he does not think that the economy will fall into a recession, which occurs when the gross domestic product shrinks for two consecutive quarters.The next few weeks will be important, because September is the busiest month for investor conferences held by public companies. So far, the tenor of such meetings has been reasonably positive, especially among technology and energy companies, Mr. Doll said, noting that it is considerably dimmer at financial services firms.“Generally, what we are hearing is reasonably good news,” he said.September is also a month in which the markets have generally not fared well.Optimists believe exports and growth in technology, health care and energy will offset the impact of the credit markets to keep the economy and corporate profits growing.“Certainly anything with a housing-related component has some severe job issues,” said Mr. Levkovich of Citigroup. But the outlook is much better for “metals and mining and energy, industrials, education and health care — there are a lot of people employed in those industries.”Stocks on Wall Street, however, may move on news closer to home, he noted.“Wall Street has a tendency to do a little navel gazing,” Mr. Levkovich said. “It’s no secret that there will be some head count reduction around Wall Street.”'"
"'07-09-08,'0','“People need to start thinking about the housing market not just as some ring-fence problem which is off on its own,” said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at Global Insight, an economic research firm in Lexington, Mass. “They need to start worrying about the health of the broader economy.”Stocks fell broadly and sharply, as investors digested the idea that the economy had been weakening significantly even before the mortgage crisis hit financial markets last month. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down more than 1.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped almost 250 points.The unemployment rate held steady at 4.6 percent in August, but economists said that was at least in part a fluke of the survey as more people stopped looking for work and were therefore not counted by the government as unemployed.“If the economy is not headed toward recession, it is very close to one,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com.The Bush administration tried to defuse concerns that the weak jobs numbers hinted at a wider economic slowdown. In an interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said the report was “not totally surprising.”“There will be news that is not always good news,” he said. “But I feel quite strongly that we have a resilient economy.”For months, Fed officials and Wall Street forecasters have been predicting that the housing slump would slow the economy and that other factors, like corporate earnings, growth in other countries and strong wage advances, would keep the slowdown from being severe.That could still happen; in the economic expansions of both the 1980s and the 1990s, employment fell at least once before quickly reversing course.“The financial turmoil and extended problems in housing put the risks for the economy clearly to the downside, no question,” said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. “But there are also factors that suggest a longer period of slower growth, but not recession.”One of the most worrisome signs in the jobs report released yesterday was the government’s revision to its employment data for June and July. The new numbers show just under 70,000 jobs being created in each of the two months. Initial estimates had been an average of almost 110,000 a month.In 2005 and 2006, the average monthly job growth was slightly above 200,000.The sharp slowdown this year suggests that some employers have already begun to see a downturn in their business and that others think one is on the way. With house prices falling in most of the country and oil prices having risen, consumer spending has slowed modestly in recent months.State and local government agencies, many of them dealing with budget shortfalls connected to the housing slump, have also cut an average of 27,000 jobs a month over the last three months. But economists said the declines in government employment, especially in schools, may have reflected seasonal quirks that made the job market look worse last month than it was.But the bright spots were few. Employment in the finance sector, which includes real estate agencies and accounts for about 8.5 million of the country’s 138 million jobs, was flat in August, which could be a sign that the government numbers have not yet captured some of the mortgage-related job cuts now occurring.The surveys that made up the Labor Department report measured employment from Aug. 12 to Aug. 18, when the credit squeeze and subsequent stock market turmoil were under way but not yet fully felt. Since then, some large lenders like Lehman Brothers have continued to lay off workers.And just yesterday, two mortgage lenders, Countrywide Financial and IndyMac Bancorp, said they would shrink their work forces. Countrywide said it would cut as many as 12,000 jobs over the next three months, and IndyMac Bancorp said it would trim 1,000.“There probably was not that much influence in the data from the credit shock,” said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. “So I think more weakness in the economy is likely. The economy is clearly losing momentum.”The extent to which that continues will determine the Fed’s course of action. The price of a futures contract tied to Fed policy indicates that the central bank will probably cut the benchmark rate, now 5.25 percent, to 4.5 percent by the end of the year. But a growing number of economists are saying that may not be soon enough.Mr. Gault of Global Insight, who is forecasting a cut of half a point on Sept. 18, said it would send “an important message that the Fed sees there are real problems here, there’s a real threat, and it needs to have a response that’s commensurate to that threat.”Although the unemployment rate held steady at 4.6 percent, the percentage of adults with jobs fell to 62.8, from 63 percent in July and a peak of 63.4 percent in December. The number of people who were neither working nor looking for work, and therefore were not classified as employed or unemployed, rose by almost 600,000 in August.“That’s a sign of economic weakness,” said Scott Anderson, a senior economist at Wells Fargo. “Perhaps people just gave up trying to find jobs.”The number of people with part-time jobs who said they would prefer to work full time has also been rising in recent months. In August, the Labor Department classified 4.5 million workers as “part time for economic reasons,” up from 4.3 million in July.Wage growth, which often lags behind job growth, continued at roughly its recent pace. Average hourly earnings for rank-and-file workers, who make up about four-fifths of the work force, have increased 3.9 percent over the last year, to $17.50. Inflation has been running at about 2.5 percent a year.Wall Street had awaited the jobs report because it was the most significant economic data released since financial markets began to tumble in early August. If the jobs report had shown merely lackluster growth, investors might have welcomed it as a sign that a Fed rate cut was all but certain and that the economy was still growing at a healthy pace.The reversal in employment, however, was far different from the gain of roughly 100,000 jobs that Wall Street had been expecting, raising worries that corporate profits and wage gains could weaken as the market upheaval moves beyond the housing and financial sectors.“The big question on all of our minds is whether the financial market contagion would reach the labor market,” said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute. “And it appears it has with a vengeance.”'"
"'07-09-08,'0','When L.S.U.’s previous mascot died in May of kidney failure at age 17, representatives of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals asked the school not to get another live tiger. PETA argued that tigers need to roam over hundreds of miles, not square feet, and that wild animals become stressed in stadiums filled with tens of thousands of people.Meanwhile, in June, Louisiana became the 50th state to ban cockfighting. In July, the California Supreme Court effectively prohibited the sale of soccer shoes made from kangaroo hides. And the National Basketball Association continues to experiment with synthetic materials for its basketballs.Public sensitivity about the treatment of animals has been acutely evident in the past year, with the outpouring of grief after the death of the 2006 Kentucky Derby champion Barbaro and the national outrage aimed at the N.F.L. quarterback Michael Vick after he acknowledged his involvement in dogfighting.“These are manifestations of increasing concern about well-being and the ethic that if you are going to use animals, there should be a compelling reason,” said Wayne Pacelle, the chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States.Referring to cockfighting and dogfighting, he said: “The idea that cruelty to animals is wrong has become a bedrock principle in American culture.”Twenty-five or 30 years ago, the news media and law enforcement officials might have looked the other way at an athlete involved in dogfighting, said Jay Coakley, an emeritus professor of sports sociology at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.“The sheriff may not have made a bust, or may have tipped him off and given him chance to cover up his tracks,” Coakley said.In 1992, Jackie Sherrill, then the football coach at Mississippi State, got off with an apology and a warning after he had a bull castrated to motivate his players for a game against Texas, whose mascot is a longhorn steer named Bevo.Public attitudes appear to have changed since then. Louisiana State Senator Arthur J. Lentini of Metairie, a New Orleans suburb, led the effort in Louisiana to ban cockfighting, in which roosters are fitted with spikes for slashing duels. Some Louisiana legislators said that cockfighting was a Cajun tradition and a rural economic lifeline.Lentini said, “I felt it was very detrimental to the image of this state to be the only remaining state that permitted this activity in which animals are hurt for the amusement and wagering of human beings.” The ban takes effect in August 2008.Last year, the soccer star David Beckham switched from soccer shoes made from kangaroo skin to a synthetic alternative after a campaign by animal-rights groups. In July, the California Supreme Court banned the sale of kangaroo-skin shoes in settling a lawsuit.Response to the court decision has been mixed. While animal-rights groups celebrated, officials in Australia protested, saying that kangaroos are no longer endangered and need to be culled for proper conservation. A bill that would permit products made from kangaroo hides is pending in the California Legislature.“Consumers should not be intimidated by the scare tactics of extremists who have a long-term agenda of banning the use of nonendangered animal products,” Warren Truss, Australia’s trade minister, said in a statement after the court ruling.The Vick case, too, has come to be viewed by some in a more nuanced way. Vick, who has been suspended by the N.F.L. and faces a possible prison sentence, has been widely criticized. Yet some observers say that Vick has been subjected to greater outrage and punishment than players who have committed violence against people in shootings, incidents of domestic violence or fatal traffic accidents.The L.S.U. case represents perhaps PETA’s most visible attempt to dissuade universities from using live mascots. L.S.U. has kept live tigers since 1936. About three dozen schools keep live mascots. Others have discontinued the practice as being inhumane or too costly for appropriate care.Southeastern Louisiana University, located east of here in Hammond, once housed a live lion during football season in an arrangement with the Audubon Zoo of New Orleans. The arrangement ended in 1972 when the university, which lacks a veterinary school on campus, realized it could not provide suitable care, Christina Chapple, a Southeastern spokeswoman, said.“Everybody was excited, then the reality of keeping a live animal on campus set in,” Chapple said. “We weren’t set up to handle that.”When L.S.U.’s previous tiger mascot died, PETA sent a letter to the school saying that large carnivores “suffer extremely” in captivity because they are denied the opportunity to engage in natural behaviors such as running, climbing, hunting, establishing territory and choosing mates. Most universities and all major professional teams use costumed humans, not live animals, as mascots, PETA said.“Keeping wild animals in captivity is cruel,” Lisa Wathne, a PETA captive exotic animal specialist, said in an interview. “As grandiose as Mike’s expensive habitat may look, it is inadequate for a tiger. The whole idea of carting this animal to a sporting event with screaming people is stressful to any wild animal.”Previously, PETA and other animal-rights groups criticized the conditions in which Baylor University kept a pair of black bear mascots. In 2005, the university opened a $1 million upgraded habitat. That same year, the University of South Carolina ignored PETA’s request that it stop using Gamecocks as a nickname, given that cockfighting is illegal in the state.Cockfighting is “certainly not condoned by the university,” Russ McKinney, a South Carolina spokesman, said in an e-mail message. He said the school had a strong connection to the term Gamecock, which was the nickname given to a leader of the state’s resistance to the British during the Revolutionary War.In L.S.U.’s written response to PETA, O’Keefe, the chancellor, said that instead of being cruel and inhumane, the school’s habitat was “far better” than most found in zoos. (At the Indiana rescue facility, Mike VI shared with four other tigers a 20-foot-by-30-foot outdoor cement enclosure and never saw grass, Dr. David G. Baker, the L.S.U. veterinarian who is the tiger’s caretaker, said in an interview.)O’Keefe, noting that tigers were endangered, said that efforts to preserve the exotic cats “will need to be conducted in captivity.” The campus enclosure will allow Mike VI to roam, O’Keefe said, while keeping the animal safe from injury, poachers and infection. L.S.U. also plans to build an education center to inform the public about global conservation issues, he said.The tiger will not enter the football stadium for at least L.S.U.’s initial two home games, Baker said. First, it will attend soccer games in a portable cage to become acclimated to smaller crowds. When it does attend football games, the tiger will not be sedated or forced into its trailer, Baker said. And no one will be allowed to bang on the trailer or poke the animal in an attempt to make it roar, he said.The previous tiger mascot “was obviously not stressed” in the stadium, Baker said, seeming almost to fall asleep as it circled the field. The mascot always leaves the stadium before kickoff.Referring to PETA officials, Baker said, “According to them, humans don’t have the moral authority to eat, own, exhibit or experiment upon animals. I don’t share that religion.”'"
"'07-09-08,'0','Detectives Oliver and Isnora face manslaughter charges, which could 25 years in prison. Detective Cooper faces two misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, which could bring a year in prison. Detective Paul Headley and Officer Michael Carey, were not indicted.Steven R. Kartagener, who is representing Detective Oliver, said the judge’s refusal to dismiss the charges was a disappointment, but no surprise. It represents “no factual decision as to who should be believed here, or what the truth of the situation actually is,” he said.In the motion to dismiss charges against the three officers, their lawyers fleshed out their version of the episode: Detective Isnora and another undercover detective tried to engage in “small talk” with exotic dancers, anticipating a prostitution arrest. After two hours, neither had been solicited, and Detective Isnora “began to feel somewhat uneasy about his safety,” the memorandum said.Shortly afterward, another dancer complained that someone in the club was harassing her, and a “heavy-set fellow” in a White Sox hat indicated that he had a gun and would handle the problem. Detective Isnora alerted the rest of his team and prepared to make a gun arrest.After Detective Isnora left the club to retrieve his weapon, badge and bullet-resistant vest to make the arrest, he saw a “loud argument” involving Mr. Bell, his friends and a woman who “told the group of men that she was not going to go to a hotel room with them, where they wanted to have sex with her.”The driver of a black sport utility vehicle, who was standing with the woman, “directed unpleasant comments in the direction of Guzman and Bell,” prompting Mr. Guzman to say, “Get my gun, get my gun.”At that point, the memorandum states, Detective Isnora was convinced that Mr. Bell and his friends “were intending to drive back to the Kalua Club, to do a drive-by shooting of the driver of the black S.U.V.”He followed them and stepped in front of Mr. Bell’s parked car to prevent them from doing so, yelling repeatedly, “Police, don’t move,” according to the memorandum. The car “bolted out from the curb” and struck Detective Isnora, who believed he saw Mr. Guzman reach into his waistband for a gun.Detective Isnora began firing, and so did four other officers. The shooting lasted “a total of 10 to 12 seconds,” the document said.Sanford A. Rubenstein, a lawyer who represents Mr. Guzman, Mr. Benefield and Mr. Bell’s fiancée, Nicole Paultre Bell, said the description of Mr. Bell and his friends pressing a woman for sex outside the club was “another myth that is being promulgated along the same lines as the fourth-man myth.” Some accounts have said there was a fourth man near the car when the shooting occurred.'"
"'07-09-08,'0','THE Motion Picture Association of America’s home page this week showed a big picture of Batman swooping out of the sky, wings outstretched. “The Magic of the Movies,” the caption read.But while the picture was the dominant element on the home page, nearly every item was about movie piracy — how bad it is for the industry and how severe the penalties can be. There was even an item bragging about how many arrests had been made and how many pirated DVDs had been seized (81 million since last year). That Hollywood film studios just finished their best summer ever at the box office wasn’t mentioned.Thus the headline on an Ars Technica article: “Movie biz obsesses about pirates even as it plunders box office booty.” And at Techdirt.com, Mike Masnick wrote that though the industry group is “constantly screaming about how piracy is killing the movie industry, putting poor stagehands and grips out of work, you’d be hard pressed to see the problem when you hear that the box office take this summer passed $4 billion for the first time ever.”Both of the technology news sites, along with many bloggers, used the record numbers to call on Hollywood once again to change its antipiracy strategy. Rather than treating their customers as criminals, they say, movie studios should work harder to make moviegoing and DVD-viewing more enjoyable experiences.Piracy is, of course, a huge problem, wrote Nate Anderson of Ars Technica (arstechnica.com). “It’s just that the level of concern is out of proportion to how well the industry is actually doing.” Studios, he added, should “make it easy for users to buy and use the legitimate product.”“Think of how much more they could earn by adopting smarter business models to combat piracy in the marketplace, rather than the courts.”'"
"'07-09-08,'0','Nothing exotic about this menu: it’s comfort food that wins the hearts of prospective opera fans. Or so hopes New York City Opera. The “Opera-for-All” concert at the New York State Theater on Thursday night read like a tasting menu for City Opera’s fall season, with bits of Mozart, Massenet and Mascagni, lots of Puccini and a little up-to-dateness in music by Bernstein, Barber and Richard Danielpour.At only $25 a seat, the house was pretty much full. City Opera’s pit orchestra was on stage, and its chorus sometimes crowded in from the wings. A small army of young singers, a generally svelte and handsome lot, seemed to have in its sights the cliché of overfed divas and divos assuredly held by some of Thursday’s novitiates in the audience.George Manahan was a busy man: conducting, introducing singers and providing setups for opera scenes ranging from as far back as Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” and Handel’s “Agrippina” in the 18th century to Barber’s “Vanessa” and Mr. Danielpour’s “Margaret Garner” closer to the present. People seemed eager to have a good time, and I doubt that newcomers realized how much richer these young artists might have sounded in a hall whose dead acoustics did not work so hard against them.It’s perhaps best to leave individual reports to critics who will write later about the complete operas. This was an evening more for noticing than for criticizing. Michael Chioldi’s secure and elegant Scarpia in the Te Deum from Puccini’s “Tosca” was not easy to ignore. Though not very elegant musically, Brandon Jovanovich’s tenor certainly leapt out over the acoustical barriers of his surroundings as Turiddu in Mascagni’s “Cavalleria Rusticana.” It was a shame that the chorus singing around him had such a muddled, mailed-in quality.In the excerpt from “Margaret Garner” it was nice again to come across Gregg Baker, almost a generation removed from his colleagues onstage but still a distinguished presence. Aaron St. Clair Nicholson’s drinking song from “Don Giovanni” had fine agility. Mardi Byers, Julianna Di Giacomo, Ariana Chris, Jennifer Tiller, Anna Maria Chiuri, Susan Nicely, Rebecca Ringle, Jennifer Rivera, Tracie Luck and Lisa Daltirus were the female soloists.Bruce Sledge, Eric Margiore, Peter Castaldi, Carl Tanner, Dinyar Vania and Brian Mulligan were the other men.'"

"'07-09-08,'0','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 7 — A court on Friday ordered the arrest of Shahbaz Sharif, the brother of the former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, as the two men planned to return to the country from exile on Monday.Their return was expected to be a catalyst in the campaign to oust the president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who is seeking re-election this year.Opposition leaders denounced the court’s move as politically charged and vowed to give the brothers a rousing welcome upon their expected return at the Islamabad airport.The government of Nawaz Sharif was toppled by General Musharraf in a bloodless coup in 1999. In 2000, Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif, his younger brother and the former chief minister of Punjab, the most populous province, were forced into exile in Saudi Arabia.Last month, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that both brothers — who are currently in London — were free to return.'"
"'07-09-08,'0','Given his druthers, Mr. Mieses said, he would have stuck to the moral issues that are traditional for Pentecostal churches, preaching the virtues of sobriety and abstinence, warning against drugs, gangs and Satan. Events have made the tradition untenable, he said. While Mr. Mieses’s church in neighboring West Hazleton is named Buenas Nuevas for the “good news” of the Gospel, much of the news for him and thousands of other Hispanics here has been decidedly bad.In the summer of 2006, Hazleton enacted an ordinance punishing landlords who rented to illegal immigrants and employers who hired them. The mayor, Louis J. Barletta, blamed illegal immigrants for a variety of crimes, and the CNN anchor Lou Dobbs regularly extolled the crackdown to his national audience. A federal judge struck down the ordinance in July, ruling that it had illegally exceeded federal laws, but the mood here remains tense and fractious.“We are involved not so much by choice but because we’re forced to be involved,” said Mr. Mieses, 44, who was born in the United States to Dominican parents. “We want to keep the lines of church and politics separate, but we are affected by what has caused fear in our people, fear of being persecuted for being Latinos. I’d rather be encouraging people, inspiring people, but we have to make the Gospel relevant to the world.”The almost begrudging political awakening of Mr. Mieses and his congregation typifies a national trend among Hispanic Pentecostals.After decades of attracting members who had been born and raised Roman Catholic, and in the competitive process stimulating a charismatic style of Catholic worship in largely Hispanic parishes, the Pentecostal churches are now engaging in immigrant advocacy in a way long associated with the Roman Catholic Church in the United States.The national debate on immigration has seen Hispanic immigrants more than any other type pilloried as criminals and parasites. In response, churches that avoided politics altogether, or mobilized only on “family values” issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, have joined the immigration fray on the liberal side.“This issue has galvanized even the most conservative churches, because it is personal,” said Prof. Arlene Sánchez Walsh of Azusa Pacific University in Southern California, the author of “Latino Pentecostal Identity: Evangelical Faith, Self and Society” (Columbia University Press, 2003). “Their members are being picked up in immigration raids; they are seeing their families divided due to deportation of parents and not children. And, most of all, those churches that have sister denominations in Mexico, for example, do not see themselves as separate from those churches.”Mr. Mieses has lived out the transformation. As a convicted drug dealer serving a prison sentence in his native Massachusetts, he embraced Pentecostal Christianity nearly 20 years ago precisely for its focus on morality and personal salvation. He ultimately earned a college degree and met his future wife — whom he proudly notes was a virgin until marriage — at Lancaster Bible College in the Amish country of central Pennsylvania.Another college classmate brought Mr. Mieses to Hazleton to help set up a Spanish-language service at a local Pentecostal church. At that point in the late 1980s, Mr. Mieses recalled, the city had so few Hispanic residents that he could spot them on the street, so much the better for one-to-one evangelism.Then the combination of inexpensive housing and ample factory jobs brought an influx of Hispanics to Hazleton, raising the city’s total population to 31,000 by 2007 from 23,000 and constituting one-third of the total. By 2003, Mr. Mieses had gathered enough followers to buy a former Protestant church for $80,000. Two other Hispanic Pentecostal churches also operate in Hazleton, in eastern Pennsylvania south of Wilkes-Barre, and Mr. Mieses joked that his was viewed as “heathen” because its female members can wear makeup, earrings and pants.While no members of Buenas Nuevas have been arrested or deported for being in the United States illegally, Mr. Mieses said, several of them, including his brother-in-law, have been stopped and interrogated by the police despite being citizens. Even more, he said, have been on the receiving end of bigoted comments in supermarket checkout lines. A barber once refused to allow Mr. Mieses into his shop for a haircut; going bald lately, he has taken to shaving his head.Taken together, such events made it impossible for him, Mr. Mieses said, not to discuss immigration and not to offer practical aid to immigrants in the form of English and citizenship classes. Tellingly, those classes are taught by Mercedes Cruz, who was born a Roman Catholic and who had previously offered similar programs at St. Gabriel, a Catholic church here that has been supportive of Hispanic residents.“That’s why the church is here,” Ms. Cruz said of the classes at Buenas Nuevas. “We need to serve each other. We need to help our brothers. How are we going to talk about our Lord if we are not examples?”'"
"'07-09-08,'0','SINCE this decade began, the United States has fought two wars, gone through one recession, endured the collapse of a bubble in technology stocks and is living through a crisis in subprime mortgages that is making it difficult for many people and companies to borrow money.And the stock market has gone, well, nowhere.The Standard & Poor’s index of 500 stocks ended the 1990s at 1,469.25. It ended August at 1,473.99, a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent.Looking at price movements by themselves can be misleading. To get a fuller picture, one should consider both the total return — assuming dividends are reinvested — and the corrosive effects of inflation.As is shown in the accompanying chart, the simple price return so far in this decade is the worst since the 1930s, when the Great Depression occurred. But the inflation-adjusted figure for total return is actually worse than in the 1930s, when a combination of deflation and high dividends from those companies that survived the Depression bolstered returns.But it is better than in the 1970s, when high inflation wiped out the apparent gains in share prices. On an inflation-adjusted basis, an investor in the S.& P. 500 is down 8.1 percent in this decade, or 1 percent a year, compared with a decline of 1.5 percent a year in the 1970s.'"

"'07-09-09,'0','The Value of Earnings Lost, Plus a Common Sum for SufferingTHE fund to compensate families of those killed on 9/11 paid about $2 million, on average, for each of the 2,280 dead.The fund used three measures to set payments:1. Economic loss. 2. Set amounts for pain and suffering: $250,000, plus $100,000 for each surviving spouse and child. 3. Subtract any life insurance paid.Last, the fund's special master, Kenneth R. Feinberg, had discretionary power to adjust payouts, often adding to the awards for low-income applicants and subracting from the high end.Mr. Feinberg, a Washington lawyer, said the government's generosity was unlikely to be repeated.""I believe the 9/11 fund is not a precedent for anything,"" he said. ""How do you justify giving $2 million, on average, to 9/11 victims and nothing to victims in Oklahoma City? Nothing to Katrina victims? It was a very emotional Congressional response to an unprecedented historical event.""Mr. Feinberg is now directing a privately backed fund for victims of the shootings at Virginia Tech in April. Families of the 32 killed will be eligible for a uniform sum: $180,000.The Value of Experience LostTHERE is economic damage from a wrongful death: the value of a person's lost work life.Then there is the loss of life's experience - the daily satisfaction of living. Presumably, says the Chicago economist Stan V. Smith, people cherish life itself much more than their work.""We value our being far more than we value our doing,"" he said. So why give the loss of work a dollar value but not the loss of daily experience?Mr. Smith has tried. He coined the term ""hedonic damages"" for lives and experiences lost.""As economists, we can't say there's a limit to the value of life,"" he said. ""But there may be an average value that juries can consider.""That average, Mr. Smith figures, is around $4 million.Mr. Smith says that people unknowingly set a value on their own lives by what they are willing to pay to reduce their everyday risk of death.Say a certain home safety feature costs $50. If research shows that for every 100,000 of those devices in use, one life is saved, then the implied value of that life is $5 million:The more people are willing to pay for safety features, the more they are implicitly valuing their lives. Mr. Smith has calculated value-of-life figures for numerous purchases, based on their costs and how much they reduce the risk of death.PURCHASED ITEMS AND IMPLIED VALUE OF ONE LIFE:The law creating the Sept. 11 fund provided for hedonic damages. But while common in injury cases, so far few states recognize it as a consideration in wrongful-death cases. Critics scoff at the notion of putting a dollar amount on enjoyment of life, calling it a costly ploy to inflate damage awards.ON Feb. 1, an American soldier - who was married with three children - was killed in Iraq.The benefits to this serviceman's family, depending on how long each member lives and whether he or she goes on to college, could amount to about $1.9 million over their lifetimes.Military families face a complicated death-benefits structure that evolves as children grow up and spouses retire or remarry. Bradley J. Snyder, the emeritus president of Armed Forces Services Corporation, which advises families, urges them to use benefits counseling provided by the military to avoid losing money owed to them. Mr. Snyder calculated the benefits to this soldier's wife and children:This assumes his wife will live to age 80. The annual benefit will start at $62,808, but decline to $12,804 after the children reach 18. When she is 62, it will rise to $23,904.The soldier's base pay had been about $36,000 a year.'"
"'07-09-09,'0','A spokesman for the Portuguese police, Olegrio de Sousa, said the McCanns had the legal right to return home as they have not been charged with any wrongdoing. They will have to notify the Portuguese police if they plan to leave their home for more than five days. Their departure made the investigation “a little more complicated” because it implied delays each time the police needed to talk to the McCanns, Mr. Sousa said in a telephone interview.Mr. McCann said the decision to leave Portugal was driven by the desire to “reintroduce the twins as much as possible to an ordinary life in their home country” and for the McCanns “to consider their response to future actions in relation to the events of the last few days which have been so deeply disturbing.”The McCanns say Madeleine vanished from the apartment where she was sleeping with her siblings while they ate at a nearby restaurant on May 3.Family friends and associates said this weekend that the police had told the McCanns that new evidence suggested that they might have killed Madeleine by accident and tried to hide the body. The only other suspect in the case is Robert Murat, a Briton who lives close to the spot where Madeleine vanished. He has not been charged.The McCanns’ return to Britain amid swirling suspicion brought to a bitter close their highly publicized stay in this town, where overwhelming local sympathy for their plight gradually waned as some residents tired of their presence and Portuguese news reports became increasingly lurid.The couple were greeted by a pack of cameras and journalists as they left their villa, grim-faced, in the early hours of today and pursued by vehicles and photographers riding on motorbikes. Journalists who boarded the EasyJet flight to Britain with the family said the first two rows of the plane were reserved for them.Justine McGuinness, a spokeswoman for the McCanns, said that they had been planning to leave Portugal even before events took a sudden turn last week and that they were due to go on Monday, when the lease on their rented villa expired.The couple originally swore that they would not leave Portugal until they were reunited with their daughter and used Praia da Luz as a base for a high-profile publicity campaign that raised millions of dollars and drew support from, among others, J.K. Rowling, the “Harry Potter” author, and Pope Benedict XVI. The couple regularly attended the local church, were reported to be learning Portuguese and refused to comment on news media suggestions that the police investigation was a shambles.But they became uncomfortable in recent weeks under the increasingly harsh glare of the local press, which reported that they might be implicated in Madeleine’s death. A family friend, Clarence Mitchell, said in a telephone interview from Britain that the McCanns hoped to “get away from some of the media pressure” by returning to England.Mr. Mitchell, a British government official who became friends with the McCanns when he worked with them as a media liaison adviser in May, said the couple felt “frightened and isolated” after they were told they were suspects. The McCanns were “livid” with the Portuguese police, whom they even suspected might be trying to frame them, he said, and believed they would be better placed to clear their name with the help of British lawyers and close support from friends and family.Family friends and associates said the McCanns had been told by the police that traces of Madeleine’s DNA had been found in a rental car they hired 25 days after she was reported missing.'"
"'07-09-09,'0','RICHMOND, Va., Sept. 8 (AP) — Jimmie Johnson locked up his spot as the favorite for the Nextel Cup title, while Dale Earnhardt Jr. was locked out of Nascar’s Chase for the championship.Johnson easily raced to his series-best sixth victory of the season, winning Saturday night at Richmond International Raceway to shore up the top seed in the Chase. Johnson, the defending Nextel Cup champion, will start the 10-race title hunt on top of the standings and with the momentum of two consecutive victories.He will face 11 challengers. Earnhardt, Nascar’s most popular driver, will not be one of them.Earnhardt will watch the Chase from the sidelines for the second time in three years, failing to race his way into the event. He ran in the top three late, but his fifth motor failure, with a few laps to go, sealed his fate.He finished 30th, and was clearly dejected as he shared a brief hug with the crew chief Tony Eury Jr. The two are leaving Dale Earnhardt Inc. at the end of the season and will join Hendrick Motorsports.“We deserved to be in the Chase,” he said. “We love racing. We’ll be all right.”Earnhardt started the race as the only driver mathematically eligible to race into the Chase, but the odds were stacked against him. Kevin Harvick, the driver on the bubble, had to finish 33rd or worse, combined with a flawless Earnhardt run, for Earnhardt to make it.'"
"'07-09-09,'0','In New York, she never lost a set in this tournament, nor did she lose her serve during the championship match, as she became, at 25, the first woman to beat both Serena and then Venus Williams in the same Grand Slam event and win the title.“The quality I played in the last few matches was amazing,” Henin said. “I had a tough draw and I had a lot of things to prove to myself and not to anyone else. I’ve been so consistent for two weeks, so calm. It’s just great what I did and I’m really proud of it.”She won the match by racing to the net, lofting a soft backhand lob-volley that dropped modestly over Kuznetsova’s head. It was an unremarkable winner, but telling for a final that was as lopsided as the two halves of the women’s draw.With the Williams sisters having gone home to heal and the defending champion Maria Sharapova long forgotten after her third-round upset, this prime-time final lacked the glamour and rancor of a big-time rivalry.But Henin, a 5-foot-5 ¾-inch, 126-pound featherweight with a heavyweight game, emerged in a class by herself. She had won the 2003 Open title, but she said last night that she felt she was a better player now.On match point, she dropped her racket and immediately looked to Rodriguez.“The first thing she did was look in my eyes; that was the best gift she could give me,” he said. Coming to the box, he said, “that was a second gift.”Through Henin’s divorce and her reconciliation with her family members — who were back in Belgium — she saw her tennis transform along with her personality.She was not even bothered, she said, when the broadcaster Dick Enberg stumbled over her name, forgetting to omit “Hardenne.” She said it was part of her life, although she has moved on.“I didn’t really know what to expect from this season when it started badly for me,” she said. “The fact that I have my family back helps me a lot. I feel at peace with myself. I hate to fight with people. Today was a big day for Carlos and I; we know how hard it’s been.”She never argued with Rodriguez during this tournament, displaying a relaxed confidence. “I see somebody completely different,” said Rodriguez, who at 5-7 and wearing a white baseball cap mirrors his pupil’s stature and look. “I fight a lot with her to say: ‘Come on, let’s show what you are to the people. Don’t put a wall in front of you.’ ”Asked who and what she was now, Henin smiled and said, “Whew, that’s pretty personal,” but then she answered.“I could feel a big difference this time in the States when I came here,” she said. “People were coming much more easily to me. I think I look more open. I look myself. I can be a funny person. I’m a normal person.”On the tennis court, she is anything but normal. Henin did not lead the tournament in any statistical category. She had just 21 aces this tournament, her fastest serve topping out at 117 miles an hour. But her precision, from her timely serves to her wicked one-handed backhands, reflected her invincibility.From the start, Henin was primed for the title. She broke Kuznetsova’s serve in the first game and won four straight games. Kuznetsova committed 29 unforced errors.“To beat Justine, she’s No. 1,” Kuznetsova said. “When she plays her best game, I have to play my best game. I didn’t play my best game, so that’s why I lost.”Henin was serving for the match, at 5-3 in the second set, when she double-faulted twice and faced three break points. She fought them all off, pumping herself up with cheers in French: “Allez!”And where does she go from here? By winning her seventh Grand Slam title, Henin moved one title ahead of Venus and just one behind Serena among active players. But she still has not won Wimbledon.“The question is now, you have in your hands the possibility to be the champion of the champions,” Rodriguez said he told Henin. “You can achieve 10, 12, 13, you can do that, it’s up to you.”Henin smiled and said: “Who knows what’s going to happen in next few years? When I was a little girl, I was dreaming of winning just win one Grand Slam, and I’ve won seven. All these numbers that are talking to me give me more confidence. It’s more than a dream.”'"

"'07-09-09,'0','The F.B.I. declined to say exactly what data had been turned over. It was limited to people and phone numbers “once removed” from the actual target of the national security letters, said a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a continuing review by the Justice Department.The bureau had declined to discuss any aspect of the community of interest requests because it said the issue was part of an investigation by the Justice Department inspector general’s office into national security letters. An initial review in March by the inspector general found widespread violations in the F.B.I.’s use of the letters, but did not mention the use of community of interest data.On Saturday, in response to the posting of the article on the Web site of The New York Times, Mike Kortan, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said “it is important to emphasize” that community of interest data is “no longer being used pending the development of an appropriate oversight and approval policy, was used infrequently, and was never used for e-mail communications.”The scope of the demands for information could be seen in an August 2005 letter seeking the call records for particular phone numbers under suspicion. The letter closed by saying: “Additionally, please provide a community of interest for the telephone numbers in the attached list.”The requests for such data showed up a dozen times, using nearly identical language, in records from one six-month period in 2005 obtained by a nonprofit advocacy group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that it brought against the government. The F.B.I. recently turned over 2,500 pages of documents to the group. The boilerplate language suggests the requests may have been used in many of more than 700 emergency or “exigent” national security letters. Earlier this year, the bureau banned the use of the exigent letters because they had never been authorized by law.The reason for the suspension is unclear, but it appears to have been set off in part by the questions raised by the inspector general’s initial review into abuses in the use of national security letters. The official said the F.B.I. itself was examining the use of the community of interest requests to get a better understanding of how and when they were used, but he added that they appeared to have been used in a relatively small percentage of the tens of thousand of the records requests each year. “In an exigent circumstance, that’s information that may be relevant to an investigation,” the official said.A federal judge in Manhattan last week struck down parts of the USA Patriot Act that had authorized the F.B.I.’s use of the national security letters, saying that some provisions violated the First Amendment and the constitutional separation of powers guarantee. In many cases, the target of a national security letter whose records are being sought is not necessarily the actual subject of a terrorism investigation and may not be suspected at all. Under the Patriot Act, the F.B.I. must assert only that the records gathered through the letter are considered relevant to a terrorism investigation.Some legal analysts and privacy advocates suggested that the disclosure of the F.B.I.’s collection of community of interest records offered another example of the bureau exceeding the substantial powers already granted it by Congress.“This whole concept of tracking someone’s community of interest is not part of any established F.B.I. authority,” said Marcia Hofmann, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which provided the records from its lawsuit to The New York Times. “It’s being defined by the F.B.I. And when it’s left up to the F.B.I. to decide what information is relevant to their investigations, they can vacuum up almost anything they want.”Matt Blaze, a professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania and a former researcher for AT&T, said the telecommunications companies could have easily provided the F.B.I. with the type of network analysis data it was seeking because they themselves had developed it over many years, often using sophisticated software like a program called Analyst’s Notebook.“This sort of analysis of calling patterns and who the communities of interests are is the sort of things telephone companies are doing anyway because it’s central to their businesses for marketing or optimizing the network or detecting fraud,” said Professor Blaze, who has worked with the F.B.I. on technology issues.Such “analysis is extremely powerful and very revealing because you get these linkages between people that wouldn’t be otherwise clear, sometimes even more important than the content itself” of phone calls and e-mail messages, he said. “But it’s also very invasive. There’s always going to be a certain amount of noise,” with data collected on people who have no real links to suspicious activity, he said.Officials at other American intelligence agencies, like the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, have explored using link analysis to trace patterns of communications sometimes two, three or four people removed from the original targets, current and former intelligence officials said. But critics assert that the further the links are taken, the less valuable the information proves to be.Some privacy advocates said they were troubled by what they saw as the F.B.I.’s over-reliance on technology at the expense of traditional investigative techniques that rely on clearer evidence of wrongdoing.“Getting a computer to spit out a hundred names doesn’t have any meaning if you don’t know what you’re looking for,” said Michael German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. “If they’re telling the telephone company, ‘You do the investigation and tell us what you find,’ the relevance to the investigation is being determined by someone outside the F.B.I.”'"

Out of office, one day he decided to replace every light bulb in his house with a compact fluorescent. But when he went to his local hardware store in Chappaqua, N.Y., he couldn’t find bulbs in a lot of the shapes and sizes he needed. “So I literally picked up the phone and called Jeff Immelt” — the C.E.O. of General Electric — “and I said, ‘I’m trying to be a good customer. I’m trying to buy American, support G.E. I like your eco-initiatives. But I can’t fill half these sockets. What am I going to do?’ And he said, ‘Well, make me a bigger market, and I’ll make whatever bulbs you want.’ “It’s a charming story, if somewhat tarnished by the fact that, through a spokesman, Immelt said he had no recollection of the conversation.

"'07-09-09,'0','Reputation is one such intangible asset; ask Mattel about its value, after its third recall of toys this summer. Or JetBlue Airways, which built a stellar reputation for customer service but neglected to fortify its computer network. When that network failed in the winter and stranded thousands of customers, the company’s stock price and good name both took tremendous hits.What’s more, the market is demanding that companies prove that their business conduct is environmentally and socially conscious — not on the basis of ideology, but because to do otherwise exposes them to financial risk.The vulnerability of a global economy to cataclysmic risk, from terrorism to pandemics and extreme weather, is also pushing companies to disclose processes and strategies they have to ensure continuity after a disaster.But because accountants have found it impossible to determine the value or the risk of such assets with certainty or objectivity, official financial accounting rules give intangibles a wide berth.Instead, each company makes its own valuation of intangibles, guided only by very general accounting standards. “There is not the rigor and uniformity that governs the valuation of ‘tangibles.’ In all cases, there is little relationship to market value,” said Mr. Kossovsky, who is also the executive secretary of the Intangible Assets Finance Society, an advocacy group that is working to develop new standards and practices for monetizing intangible assets.Yet today’s markets are being transformed by intangibles, and a growing number of companies are scrambling to find the methods that will help them better use, develop and communicate about them. “In the last three years, investors have been looking at how social and environmental issues translate directly to market value,” said Jed Emerson, a senior fellow at the Generation Foundation (the philanthropic arm of Generation Investment) who is credited with developing an approach to assessing intangibles called the blended value proposition.“Mainstream business is less and less able to function without paying attention to these things,” Mr. Emerson added. “Ten years ago, at the World Economic Forum, the talk was all about opening new markets and currency exchanges. Today, it’s about AIDS and education systems in South Africa, and things that you wouldn’t have historically heard major C.E.O.’s voicing concern about.” Stakeholders in emerging markets “want to know how investment translates to jobs, environmental concerns, etc.”Over the past couple of decades, finance experts and strategists have developed many methods to better value various intangibles — methods that corporations and governments are widely adopting.For example, one of the earliest approaches, the “triple bottom line” (for “people, planet and profit”), was ratified early this year as the standard for urban and community accounting by the United Nations International Council for Local Environment Initiatives. According to the consulting firm Bain & Company, a more recent approach to valuing intangibles, called the balanced scorecard, was being used in about 57 percent of international companies by 2004.As yet, none have been adopted as a standard by the official financial accounting bodies. But it is only a matter of time until they do, according to Sara Olsen, founding partner of the Social Venture Technology Group, a San Francisco firm that specializes in developing nonfinancial valuation methods.Ms. Olsen noted that leading business schools are already training students in these new, inclusive valuation methods, and that many companies are also busy teaching others how to credibly analyze their own intangible assets.Leading public companies recognized the value of the process some time ago. In April, Fast Company magazine teamed up with the S.V.T. Group and the social investment strategy firm HIP Investor to rate the human and social impact of 21 companies that say they have sustainability practices in place, including Wal-Mart Stores, United Technologies and McDonald’s.“I would put money on it, that within a generation this will be a commonly accepted management practice,” Ms. Olsen says, with its own standards body like the Financial Accounting Standards Board that maintains, updates and oversees enforcement of best practices for valuing intangibles.Many who have been working in this area agree. Not only is the change inevitable, they say, but it is well under way.“Some people think the logic of econometrics was handed down by God, but it’s actually the result of 40 or 50 years of economists and accountants arguing about corporate performance,” said Mr. Emerson of the Generation Foundation. “We’re now at the early stages of evolving that process. Today it’s a very different conversation, and all these efforts to capture value more wholly — at the corporate level, across companies, and at the broader level of society — are positive examples of innovation.”'"
"'07-09-09,'0','While companies like SunPower have benefited from government tax policies, there has been a long-term gain for consumers. “Government tax breaks for solar have encouraged technology advancement,” he said.Generating electricity from garbage doesn’t have quite the aesthetic appeal of coaxing current from sunbeams, but it’s a good business for the Covanta Holding Corporation, said J. Michael Horwitz, a partner and senior research analyst at Pacific Growth Equities in San Francisco. Covanta, based in Fairfield, N.J. contracts to buy trash from local municipalities and then burns it to create steam that powers turbines. Electricity derived from municipal waste qualifies for federal tax credits, though the credits are just half those for power generated from wind, solar and geothermal sources.In January, Covanta refinanced nearly $1.3 billion in debt at lower interest rates, saving an estimated $39 million a year in debt service. The company also raised $136 million in a secondary stock offering. (Pacific Growth Equities was one of several underwriters.)Covanta has been active on other fronts as well, recently taking on a joint venture partner in China. It has also acquired two businesses that produce energy from wood waste.Some promising companies focus on products that reduce electricity demand. Cree, based in Durham, N.C., is a manufacturer of light-emitting diodes, which are slowly emerging as a low-power alternative to conventional lighting. Costs of L.E.D.’s are still prohibitively high for most lighting applications, but they are coming down, said David Carlsen, a co-manager of the Buffalo Science and Technology fund, which holds Cree shares.Cree has invested heavily in research and manufacturing to accelerate cost reductions, he said. Its capital spending has been running at 20 percent or more of revenue.In March, Cree acquired Cotco, a company based in Hong Kong that packages L.E.D. lights into lighting products sold directly to customers.The deal also gives Cree a stronger international presence and allows greater marketing insight into customer needs.“It provides a lower-cost packaging solution and a sales outlet in developing markets,” Mr. Carlsen said. He expects L.E.D. lights, currently used widely in building signs, to find new applications as prices decline. L.E.D. lights use a small fraction of the energy of incandescent and fluorescent bulbs and need far less frequent replacement.In areas of the developing world that lack an established electrical grid, L.E.D.’s could find favor, running household lighting powered by solar sources, said Robert Wilder, who created an index of alternative energy companies that is licensed by PowerShares WilderHill Clean Energy, an exchange-traded fund. “Because of their low power requirements, L.E.D.’s can be used off the grid,” Mr. Wilder said.WITH electricity consumption rising, many utilities are facing a choice: find ways to reduce demand or build new generating plants. Often, it is only demand at peak hours that needs to be supplemented. One company that offers a demand-control solution for its utility customers is Comverge, based in East Hanover, N.J. The company went public in April.Comverge contracts with Pacific Gas & Electric, Nevada Power and other utilities to lower their peak-time demand by installing specialized residential thermostats. These can shut down air-conditioners and other power-hungry equipment for brief periods during peak hours of electricity use.“On the margins, it’s a very easy way for utilities to reduce the amount of electricity the region is using,” said Mr. Bush of RBC Capital.Comverge should produce $60 million in revenue this year, up from $34 million in 2006, Mr. Bush said. Having gone public months before, Comverge had the cash and stock to finance the purchase in July of Enerwise Global Technologies. The acquisition will allow Comverge to expand its demand-control efforts from residential to commercial and industrial utility customers.Mr. Bush says he expects Comverge, which has been running losses, to achieve profitability next year.'"

"'07-09-09,'0','If Jim Cramer and Donny Deutsch stand for the voices of business success on CNBC, imparting years of experience to the stock-tip-hungry masses, Mr. Ratigan represents young Wall Street in the eyes of the network.“The guy in the Porsche in the left lane going fast, that’s who Dylan is — the engine that powers it all,” said Jonathan Wald, a senior vice president of business news at CNBC. “He does appeal to women, not in a frat boy way, but he’s an attractive guy who smells of success.” (He does drive a Porsche.)That the stock market itself has not smelled much like success in recent weeks hasn’t dampened the appetite for business news. Quite the contrary: viewers anxious about their portfolios have helped raise CNBC’s business-day lineup to its best August ratings in five years; the top-rated weekday program was Mr. Ratigan’s “Call,” averaging 114,000 viewers ages 25 to 54.Mr. Ratigan sees it as his mission to inject virility into cable. There are exceptions, he said, like Mr. Cramer and CNN’s Jack Cafferty, “but as a general cultural phenomenon, political correctness and gender-neutral hypersensitivity has become so pervasive that it has made the landscape in American TV cable bland, predictable and uninteresting.”Never mind his proclivity for gardening and cooking at his Manhattan loft, or what he calls his “man crush” on Johnny Depp’s Jack Sparrow character. (“He truly lives life in the present tense,” Mr. Ratigan noted.)Mr. Ratigan, 6-foot-2 and 215 pounds, played football in high school and was on the crew team in college. He fishes. He is trained as a glider pilot, has competed in the Baja 1,000, an off-road car race in Mexico, and worked in the pits at the Daytona 500.Many viewers think Mr. Ratigan is older than his 35 years. There is the gray-flecked, slightly receding hairline, and the creases that are etched in his forehead. He is well aware of this. “I could pass for 21 when I was 16,” he said. But, he added, “I’ve achieved things at a relatively young age that most people associate with an older person.”He is an impeccable self-promoter. Every few days, this reporter received a text or e-mail message from Mr. Ratigan: “Forgive me if I am too forward in offering this, but since I arrived at CNBC in 2003, no one has co-created more new shows — “Bullseye,” “On the Money,” “Fast Money” and “Fast Money MBA Challenge” — than I have. All but “Bullseye” are still on the air.”Mr. Wald of CNBC said that when the company was hiring talent in August 2005 for “On the Money,” a program on which business news intersects with popular culture, Mr. Ratigan was a natural choice. “Dylan was the only one I could imagine sitting down and getting to the heart of the issues our audience cares about and not boring everyone else to tears,” Mr. Wald said.Robert J. Thompson, a television scholar at the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, agreed that Mr. Ratigan puts on a show. “Business news is getting really close to falling into the same stylistic category as sports,” Professor Thompson said. “There’s a certain type of spectator sport to this, and I think CNBC better than others has managed to do to finance news what the Food Network did to food, and what ‘Extreme Makeover Home Edition’ did to home improvement.”Being labeled a showman doesn’t exactly bother Mr. Ratigan. Entertaining is what he likes to do most. His bottom-of-the-soul ambition is to be the host of a late-night talk show. He wouldn’t mind succeeding Conan O’Brien.Mr. Ratigan, who grew up in Saranac Lake, N.Y., got into television in a roundabout way. He had nothing planned after graduating from Union College, in Schenectady, N.Y., where he spent two years partying intently, he said, and then sobering up. “The first half of my college years were spent drinking and doing any variety of drugs, and the second half was spent driving around crack heads and drunks to A.A. meetings.”He moved to New York City and took a job as a parking garage investigator, responsible for ensuring that employees weren’t stealing from the owners. But fate had other plans for him. He was staying with a friend who was dating Susan Bloomberg, the former wife of Michael R. Bloomberg, the future mayor. Ms. Bloomberg suggested Mr. Ratigan work for her ex-husband at Bloomberg L.P., the financial information company.His first job was rewriting press releases. Eventually he became a reporter, then an editor. When the company sought talent for its burgeoning TV network, Mr. Ratigan auditioned, despite having no training, and won a position. He went to CNBC in September 2003 to star on “Bullseye,” a panel show about the markets. The reaction was mixed. One critic dubbed Mr. Ratigan “Larry King on steroids.” The show was canceled in 2005. (Mr. Cramer’s “Mad Money” took the time slot.)“The network wanted to go in a different direction, and the ratings stunk,” Mr. Ratigan said.Soon after, he and Mr. Wald came up with the idea for “On the Money.”“We ran stories that weren’t covered in other parts of the day — showbiz, pop culture, a lot of hard-hitting interviews,” Mr. Wald said. Mr. Ratigan anchored the show until January 2007, and then went to “Fast Money,” which he helped create.As for his personal life — he was engaged twice but never married — the blogosphere buzzes, and not always favorably. On a Web site dedicated to fawning over TV anchors, one blogger relayed a story about Mr. Ratigan not paying for dinner during a date. The story, he admitted, was true, adding, “I know it sounds like the dog ate my homework, but I really left my wallet at the office.”He swears he doesn’t read the blogs but his friends, mostly college buddies, think otherwise.Derek Evans, a film producer and a former college roommate, said of his friend: “For the longest time Dylan would not let me pay for a dinner and I couldn’t figure out why. So I asked some of our friends and they said, ‘Someone wrote in a blog about him not paying for dinner and now he won’t let anyone else pay.’ ”'"

"'07-09-09,'0','“How Eminent Should Domain Be?,” by Joseph Berger (column, Sept. 2), highlights the effort of Councilman Nicholas J. Bianco to stop the abuse of eminent domain in Yorktown, but it also underscores the substantial work that remains to be done by tristate legislatures. While small pockets of protection against the forcible acquisition of property for private development do exist, almost all home and small-business owners remain vulnerable.In the two years since the United States Supreme Court’s decision providing its imprimatur to such a procedure, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have failed to pass any substantive restrictions on what the court had previously called the “despotic power.”Given the amount of abuse occurring in these states, this is unfortunate. Only when the government no longer has the ability to rob Peter to pay Paul, like in Yorktown, will everyone truly be safe.Eminent domain is a club that intimidates the little guy into knuckling under for the developers and the politicians. We’ve seen this in Peekskill, whose Common Council has approved takings and holds this threat over others.Downtown Peekskill property and business owners whose property was “blighted” to clear the way for “redevelopment” are in limbo. Who in his right mind would start a business or buy a commercial property knowing that the location might not exist the next year?'"
"'07-09-09,'0','Parents who move to Connecticut from elsewhere in the country often find it a bizarre experience to ready their children for their first day of school at the end of August, sometimes just one or two days before the Labor Day weekend. If they have children of varying ages, they are likely to encounter different schedules for schools in the same town, but all start before the holiday weekend.As traditions go, this one is absurd. Students begin to settle into an academic routine, then stay home for three days — just enough time to forget their locker combinations and get back in the habit of sleeping late.State Senator Thomas Gaffey has said he will introduce a bill prohibiting cities and towns from starting school before Labor Day. He is also considering proposing a statewide school calendar, one that would impose general guidelines for all districts.This is causing howls of protest. The move would be a direct challenge to the cherished concept of home rule.But the idea has merit and should not be rejected out of hand. Ours is a small state with 166 school districts, all of which have their own ways of operating. There should be far more unity among them, beginning with general guidelines for schedules to help hold down the statewide cost of bus transportation.Once upon a time there was at least a plausible excuse for requiring students to return to school in August. The Connecticut Mastery Tests were given in September, and teachers needed as much time as possible to prepare students. But state law changed the date two years ago, and now the tests are given later in the school year.'"
"'07-09-09,'0','And, perhaps most damning for cars that are supposed to have flair and style, retractable hard tops dictate bizarre proportions. This is especially the case with four-seat convertibles, where the area between the back seat and the rear wheels is stretched to house the folded roof, resulting in proportions that recall a hyperextended Slinky. If the Sebring’s rear deck were any longer, it would have a steam catapult and arresting wires.I concede that the G6 manages to avoid this problem. It is actually quite handsome, with taut lines and a hunkered-down stance that suggests it is poised to attack. So how does the G6 get around the top-storage conundrum? It offers no trunk space whatsoever.While other convertible designers fret about where to store the top, Pontiac said, “Easy! Put it in the trunk, with the spare tire.” Like many hardtop convertibles, the G6 has a divider in the trunk that must be secured before the top will retract. But most other cars divvy the space so the roof gets its share and your bags get what’s left. In the G6, the space above the divider belongs to the top, with the space beneath dedicated almost completely to the spare tire.With the top down, there’s room under there for a sheet of paper or a pack of gum, but not both at the same time.I tried to stash my empty messenger bag in the trunk with the top down, and while it fit, I learned the hard way that when the top’s down, you should just pretend the trunk lid is welded shut.When I raised the top, it snatched my modest cargo and attempted to incorporate it into the roofline, with poor results. This was my own fault, but seriously, how many people are going to rent one of these and eventually end up with a bag of Official Fort Lauderdale Bikini Inspector T-shirts folded into the headliner? I suggest signing up for the damage waiver insurance.The Sebring is available with either a soft top or a hard one, although both use the same frame — and thus the soft top provides no stowage advantage. I drove the midline Sebring Touring model ($28,745) with an optional cloth roof. (Amazingly, the base convertible has a vinyl top, for older drivers who really miss their Cordobas.)The ragtop Sebring offers the worst of both worlds — none of the sound insulation or gee-whiz factor of a hard top, but with all the awkward styling and inefficient use of space.About that styling: the Sebring’s sheet metal exudes the excitement, ferocity and sleek visceral energy of a dozing manatee. There is so much room between the tires and the fenders that the car looks as if it was dropped from a C-130 and is midway through the rebound skyward. And the ribbed hood? The last time I saw ribs this disturbing, they were on the steam table at an $8.99 all-you-can-eat buffet.All previous Sebring convertibles hewed to a policy of stylistic conservatism. They were agreeable if not memorable. This one is the opposite.One ergonomic bright point: At least the Sebring puts the top-control switch on the dash, next to the steering wheel. (You can also lower the top with the key fob, which is a nifty trick.) Pontiac puts its switch in a shoulder-stressing position up above the rear-view mirror, where your natural inclination is to rest your fingers across the top of the windshield header — directly in the path of the closing roof — while your thumb’s on the button. I suppose we should just be glad Pontiac didn’t locate the switch somewhere even more inconvenient and dangerous, such as on a hot exhaust manifold or inside the mouth of a cobra.Behind the wheel, the Pontiac comes across as sportier than the Chrysler, but neither car’s mission statement seems to include driving thrills. The base G6 GT ($29,400) wrings 217 horsepower from its 3.5-liter V-6. Those ponies are hitched to a four-speed automatic transmission whose yawning chasms between gear ratios exaggerate the car’s considerable curb weight of 3,855 pounds — which is 440 pounds more than the G6 GT coupe.The G6’s motor is so overmatched that the cruise control can’t hold a speed on hilly highways. The motor races going uphill and then sends you hurtling over the crest at extralegal velocities — up to 10 miles an hour faster than your chosen speed. If you doubt this, I have a video I could show you, once I’m done showing it to the Maine traffic court where I’m contesting a speeding ticket that I received under exactly those circumstances.Despite the G6’s modest power, there’s an abundance of torque steer, a sideways tug of the wheel under acceleration and a penalty I associate with more powerful rides. Getting torque steer from 217 horsepower is like eating a 1,200-calorie cheeseburger that tastes like a stale rice cake — all the penalties of an indulgence, minus the pleasure.Torque steer isn’t much of a problem on the Sebring Touring, given that its midrange V-6 puts out 186 horsepower — only 13 more than the bare-bones 4-cylinder model — and, like the G6, is saddled with a four-speed automatic transmission. The Limited model steps up to a 235-horsepower V-6 mated to a six-speed automatic, but the base price rises to $32,345, and that’s with a soft top.The folding hardtop is a $1,995 option, and by then you’re in the territory of the Saab 9-3 convertible. (The lame-duck 2007 Saab has been carrying buyer incentives of $4,000 to $5,000 in the Northeast.)Speaking of more palatable options, unless you’re obsessed with a hardtop, I don’t see why you’d prefer either of these cars over the $31,140 Ford Mustang GT Deluxe convertible, which has a 300-horsepower V-8 and a usable trunk. And if you must have a retractable hardtop, the Volkswagen Eos offers a much more upscale experience for less than $30,000.It seems to me that in the G6 and Sebring, both Pontiac and Chrysler blew their budgets on glitzy Transformers tops, to the detriment of the vehicles beneath. But the Pontiac at least looks good, and for some people that’s all that matters for a car like this.As for the Sebring, all I can say is that the old one had a soft top and calculatedly banal styling, and it was the best-selling convertible in America in 7 of the last 11 years. What was wrong with that?'"
"'07-09-09,'0','THE state’s largest utility, Connecticut Light & Power, says that 1,400 customers have asked to have their meters tested after receiving suspicious bills. For Jill Gregori, the business manager for the Stafford public schools, the bills were too high. For James Fortini, who lives and works in Norwalk, they were too low.From July 2006 to April, Mr. Fortini’s electricity bills for the four-bedroom cape he lives in with his wife and two teenage sons went from about $200 a month to a low of $9 and a high of $54.Mr. Fortini, who works for Norwalk’s Department of Public Works, said that after he called several times about the low bills, C.L.&P. finally suggested that he had tampered with the meter.“But I don’t know how to do that,” he said. “Then they said it was broken for a year, and we owed $2,400, and they would come out and turn off the power unless we made an arrangement.”In Stafford, from November 2006 to July, during the final phase of construction of a $21.8 million elementary school, the empty building drew average monthly bills of $7,000 to $8,000, while the fully populated middle school that is about the same size averaged $7,500 a month. “How could a building sitting empty use so much power?” Ms. Gregori said. “C.L.&P. finally checked the meters last spring, but their answers have always been the same — that there’s nothing wrong with the equipment.”'"
"'07-09-09,'0','DUNNE: In cost-plus the contractor draws up a budget and charges for labor and materials, with an added fee for profit. The price of the entire project is not known, but the client can see all costs. In fixed-price, there’s an agreement to do the entire project for a set sum. The client has no idea what he’s being charged for, but he knows the final cost. SYLVESTER: If you’ve got detailed construction documents, I’d get a fixed price. Cost-plus, or time-and-materials, works better if you don’t have the plans or are going to make significant changes. LICHT: I recommend a fixed price. If someone says it will be X dollars, you know it will be X dollars. With a time-and-materials contract, you need to keep an eye on what you are being charged for. FANUKA: Time-and-materials contracts are bad because the contractor is obligated to go as slow as possible, because he’s making money every day he is there.Why do I hear buzzing when I use the dimmer on my light, and what can I do about it?Paster: There are many kinds of dimmers, and each is designed for a specific kind of light fixture. You need to make sure the dimmer is compatible with the light, or you’re going to hear buzzing. DiSalvo: With incandescent lighting, meaning the common light bulb, the humming can be caused by the metal wire in the center of the bulb — the filament — vibrating when a dimmer is used. If you have the right dimmer for your type bulb, try changing the bulb itself. Some bulbs buzz more than others. Slovak: You can find buzzing either at the bulb or on the dimmer itself. Buzzing at the dimmer is a red flag. It could be a fire hazard. You need tto call an electrician.How do you install kitchen cabinets so they don’t fall off the wall or sag?Fanuka: If the wall is Sheetrock, then you’ll need some kind of wood ground, either plywood blocking or wooden columns, behind the wall, to screw the cabinets into. If you have a plaster, cinder block or brick wall, you’ll use a plastic anchor, which is a kind of screw that comes with its own sheath that is screwed directly into the wall and will expand to catch the plaster or cinder block or brick. Licht: Some contractors put the plywood just behind where they think they are going to put the cabinet, but I plywood the entire wall. It costs more, but you could put five million pounds on those cabinets and they won’t sag. Reetze: There should also be a ledger strip, which is a piece of wood about 1.5 inches wide that goes around the bottom of the cabinet. That will help support the weight and stabilize the cabinet.I want to install an in-ground outdoor pool. What time of year should I do it?Sylvester: You can do it whenever you want, spring through autumn. Most people do it whenever they get their permits from their municipality, but a spring start gives you the most warm weather to work with. Slovak: Personally, I think there’s no better time to dig than off-season, fall into winter. And you’ll probably get a better price. Dunne: Do it in the fall. Get the pool and the curb done so that in the springtime you are just looking at marble dusting and the conditioning of the pool.What options do I have for replacing the doors in my house?Fanuka: There are three grades of doors: solid wood, solid core and hollow core. Stay away from hollow core doors. They warp and they don’t buffer sound. The other two are fine. Paster: If it’s just a matter of how they look, you can usually replace the doors in the frames you already have. But if you dislike the frame or the doors aren’t swinging right, you might need to replace the whole casing. If so, you should buy a prehung door that is hanging off its own jamb. Dunne: A quick and easy, though not always cheap, spruce-up for your door is just to replace the hardware. If you do replace the door, don’t forget to replace the knobs and hinges, too. If you don’t, your new door will look cheap.What kind of home security system is best?Licht: There are two types: hard-wired and wireless. My feeling is that hard-wired is best — you have less of a chance of failure or of being disconnected — but if you can’t rip into the walls, then wireless is better than nothing. Fanuka: I like a system that is hard-wired and has a power backup and backup cellular service. That way, if someone cuts the power, you are still in business. Instead of getting one of those five-year plans with a security company, where they give you the hardware with the contract, buy your own system and pay month to month. You’ll get better quality at a better price. DiSalvo: The first question is, Who is going to be using the system? Are there children or staff involved? If there are valuables, you might want motion sensors in certain places. But I try to keep it as simple as possible. We all tend to forget how these systems work.'"
"'07-09-09,'0','My house was built in 1923, in a small town 20 miles west of New York City, in a development that consists of several hundred homes — mostly three- and four-bedrooms in Dutch colonial style — on land that had been fruit orchards for the better part of 150 years. Walking home from the train station on some evenings, I’ve tried to imagine how it must have felt to hike through the neighborhood in the 1920s, not long after its transition to suburbia, just after the first families began moving in. Actually, I’ve seen some photographs. Set like large wooden blocks in a nearly barren landscape, the rows of houses evoke a desolation akin to what I’ve experienced in subdivisions stamped out by big home-building companies all over the United States — places that aren’t neighborhoods yet but outposts, lonely agglomerations of houses holding on for dear life to the hems of their metro areas.And yet people bought houses in my town anyway, and they kept buying as the century progressed and the metro area engulfed it. Settling here must have taken a considerable amount of optimism, I’ve always thought, but new arrivals kept paying more and more (even after inflation). Recently, I drove over to the county archives to go through old deed books, aware that we seem about to fully enter an era of depreciation, to trace the arc of appreciation of my house.Anyone who has ever dug through public real estate documents can tell you that finding one deed in an oversize, musty ledger leads to an older deed in a different musty ledger, and as you step back in time trying to match buyers and sellers — actually, deed “grantors” and “grantees” — you meet families you never knew who paid handsome sums for a place you know quite well. For just a single New Jersey county, the deed histories fill a small library, hinting at how oceanic the ebb and flow of property has been in this country over the past hundred years. Many of the deed records for my own house included sales prices in the margins; less fortunately, these were noted in a financial shorthand, so my conversion to dollars, done largely with the help of the county register’s office, is somewhat approximate. Still, the timeline goes something like this: In December 1922, my quarter-acre lot was sold by two brothers named Trimpi to Arthur Sauer, the developer, for around $2,200. A short while later, in April 1923, the lot and finished house were sold to John and Mabel Haselmayer for around $17,500. The Haselmayers didn’t stay long. In 1926, they sold to Laura Baldwin — the price was unrecorded — and Baldwin and her husband in turn sold to the Dunaways in 1929, just a few months before the stock market crash, again for an unrecorded amount. The Dunaways sold to the Mentzes in 1948 for about $20,500. Forty-five years passed before Margaret Mentz sold to the Hymans, in 1993, for $211,000.My wife and I are the property’s eighth owners in 85 years. We bought it in 2001 for $425,000. If we sold it now — a questionable proposition in this market, I think, seeing as how buyers are scarce and prices stalled — I’m not sure how we’d do. Housing economists often describe prices as sticky, since sellers typically take a long time to reduce their asking prices in periods of slack demand. A year ago I might have hoped we’d sell our house for 60 percent over what we paid; today I might say 50 percent. Next year, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s closer to 45 percent. If that turned out to be the case, then it’s likely that the houses of the newest generation of homeowners — those, like me, who have never really known a down market — will have become unstuck at last. What’s worse, if home markets seem unstuck here, they may be even more so elsewhere. Driving along the highways outside Denver this summer, I passed one fallow farm field after another with its billboard summoning buyers to a Shangri-La that wasn’t yet built but would assuredly be “starting” in the low $200,000s. At the moment, it’s difficult to imagine these communities will start anytime soon. Will they ever?Now that we’ve become accustomed to the idea that buying a house means buying into a market as well as a neighborhood, it’s unnerving to see things unwind. There aren’t many upsides to what’s happened over the past few months, with some lenders going bankrupt and many borrowers who assumed too much risk or debt facing a difficult future. Still, one of the more depressing aspects of the housing run-up was the widespread conflation of a house’s price and its value. If there is a possible benefit to the slump, it may be that we’ll emerge with a different understanding of the value of our homes, regarding them less as investments (perhaps burying the presumption, at least until the next boom, that they’re as reliable as stocks and bonds) and more as something all too ordinary. That is, as places to live.I say this in part because I tend to believe that houses are immensely valuable for their intangible benefits (a sense of place, community and stability), while being much more complex investments than we acknowledge. When we calculate appreciation, for instance, we almost always discount the steady and substantial costs of upkeep and improvements, especially on older houses. We assume large income tax benefits, even when they are eroded by property taxes. We forget that inflation matters (the $425,000 we paid for our house, for example, would be about $500,000 today). Finally, we overlook the historical data, which suggest that trends in housing prices have been mostly unremarkable over the 20th century. Robert Shiller, the Yale economist, who has been one of the most astute longtime observers of the housing market, concluded in 2005 that during the past hundred years, prices have mostly been flat or declined, with just a few exceptions. These were after World War II (when the Mentzes enjoyed a substantial gain on their home), in the late 1990s (when the Hymans enjoyed a similar increase) and in the past five years (when my wife and I enjoyed the boom).'"
"'07-09-09,'0','And it’s not just the fact that those Russians who profited most obscenely from their country’s conversion to capitalism have so much money to spend; it’s the way they spend it. They tend to make up their minds quickly — often in a day — and they are not exactly hagglers; it’s not at all uncommon for them to pay more than the listed price, simply to take a property off the market in a quick and low-profile way. One house Newall sold recently, on a private basis, was shown to a select client list, half of whom were Russian; another sale took place after a one-hour “negotiation” over a cup of coffee in a hotel restaurant. It sold to a buyer from a former Soviet republic (Newell was characteristically cagey about saying which one) for more than $40 million, or about $12 million in excess of what the flabbergasted seller originally thought he could get for it.With stories like that in the air, some prospective London-area sellers have taken to renovating their houses with extravagant Russian tastes in mind before putting them on the market in the first place. By the same token, some homeowners who didn’t necessarily consider themselves sellers at all are offered such astonishing prices for lock, stock and barrel that they find themselves moving out on short notice, taking nothing but their suitcases and a huge check. “Usually they are cash buyers,” says Tatiana Baker, a native Russian now employed in the London office of Knight Frank’s chief competitor, Savills. “Which is helpful.”The cash, it should be noted, is sometimes of controversial provenance. Between 1998 and 2004, an estimated $102 billion in capital was taken out of Russia, primarily by oligarchs who had bought at auction vast sections of formerly state-owned industries, often at suspiciously reasonable prices. (The oil company Yukos, for instance, was bought in 1995 for a reported $350 million; just two years later it was valued at $9 billion. Its original chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, is now in a Siberian prison.) And while that capital’s influence makes itself felt all around the world, it concentrates disproportionately in London, where foreign capital has long been accommodated with particular warmth.“British immigration policy has always been based on economics,” says John Tincey, the national vice chairman of Britain’s Immigration Service Union. “Essentially, if you’re coming to the country with money to spend, you’re very much welcomed with open arms. And then about five years ago, the Labor government instituted a special policy for people who were coming here to invest large sums of money in the U.K., basically to give them a clear and speedy path to visas. We also have quite a benign tax system — that is, if you are wealthy enough to afford a good tax lawyer to explain it to you.”“Ever since the ’70s,” says Trevor Abrahmsohn of Glentree International, another high-end brokerage, “just as you would go to Italy to buy leather goods, so you’d go to London to buy a property. It’s a comfortable place to be. Especially if you are in a politically unsafe place and want to park your money somewhere safe.”Real estate agents who act on behalf of buyers are a relatively new phenomenon in Britain; their fees — as little as 1.5 percent of the purchase price — are somewhat lower than those fetched by their counterparts in the United States, and the agents seem eager to legitimize their services by going the extra mile for their clients. Knight Frank, Savills and a handful of others compete to educate prospective Russian buyers who may or may not know the first thing about Britain’s system of property ownership or its emblems of social status. The agencies’ primary solution to that culture gap is to go out and hire individuals who have already bridged it.Tatiana Baker, who emigrated from St. Petersburg less than a decade ago, was hired this year by Savills after a stint at the real estate arm of Harrods. She is sharp, skeptical and immaculately put together. She speaks English with a heavy accent, which still gives her a leg up on the 50 percent of her Russian clients who don’t speak it at all. “I know Russian language, Russian culture,” she shrugged. “I know what’s best on the market. I just don’t waste their time but take them straightaway to the best thing. I don’t try to sell them anything, like some agents do here; it doesn’t work with Russians. If you try to sell them some rubbish, they will just walk out; and then they don’t trust you anymore, they just go to another agency.” The quickest sale she ever made to a fellow Russian took 20 minutes — though that was for a mere $1.3 million, she says, “so I wouldn’t say big amount.”Grace Margolies at Knight Frank is the child of a Russian mother and an English father; she grew up in the Soviet Union and emigrated at age 9. Like Baker, she has a foot in both cultures and feels a similar determination to reaffirm her own Russianness by not letting her Russian clients down. Once they get to know and trust you, she says, they will deal only with you. They are not likely, for instance, to call your office and ask if you’re there — they want your mobile number, and they’ll use it at any time. “You never know when they come,” Baker says. “Usually they phone me like one hour before they arrive and say: ‘We’ve got two days. Will you show us some properties?’ ”The ultrarich of all nationalities, of course, tend to want what they want when they want it; still, all the agents seem to agree that the wealthy Russian is, in terms of impulsiveness, unsurpassed.“Russians don’t mind paying list to take a place off the market,” Newall says, “and they want to be able to move in right away. Indians will haggle more. And an Englishman, no matter how rich, would do a lot more due diligence.”“Instantaneous” was the adjective chosen by Abrahmsohn of Glentree, who offered a longer perspective on the Russian phenomenon by virtue of having been in the London luxury-home business since the Saudis came to town in the mid-1970s. “The Russians are very easy to deal with,” he says, “provided you don’t insult their intelligence.”And also provided that you don’t violate their anonymity. What characterizes the Russian buyers — at least the superrich ones — above all else is the desire to keep a low profile, or as low a profile as one can maintain while living in a $50 million house.They would rather overpay for a property privately than risk being publicly outed as a bidder on it. Some prospective buyers have even made Newall sign confidentiality agreements, a practice Baker considers redundant; the Russian community is so tightly knit, she says, that if you betrayed a client’s confidence even once, your career would be pretty well shot.But agents have no choice except to take confidentiality as seriously as their clients do. Which is why none of them, for the purposes of this article, would do what real estate agents love to do: brag about their biggest recent sales. Newall mentioned a few monetary figures — an $84 million deal the preceding weekend, another sale for $32 million the week before that — but no names or addresses; and Margolies, immediately after telling me one flat-hunting anecdote so bland it could have described hundreds of people, asked me nervously to take it off the record for fear the buyer would recognize himself, in which case, she implied, the repercussions for her career would be profound.Currently under construction, and due to open in 2010, is an apartment building at 1 Hyde Park that promises to be among the most expensive real estate in the world; both Baker and Newall are involved in its sales, but far from talking it up, they were reluctant to discuss it at all. “I’m not supposed to tell too much about it,” Baker said nervously. Hard to think of a better measure of the Russian influence on their business than that.Bicultural agents like Baker and Margolies are, of course, still the exception in the business. Newall, who speaks no Russian, is a sort of Sammy Glick of British real estate; though he looks young, it was still astonishing to learn that he is only 22, having been recruited last year from a brokerage job in relatively sleepy Newcastle. He is unmarried, which is a good thing, because his hours are indefinite: his mobile phone is never off. “If somebody wants to see me anywhere in the world, I go,” he says. “When they want to see you, they want to see you now, not when it fits into your diary.”As a specialist in the country market, Newall will book a helicopter and show a Russian client 10 or 12 properties in a day that way. (The Russians are mad for commuting by helicopter, he says; every Knight Frank brochure now contains coordinates for landing a helicopter on large estates.) He estimates that he spends only 15 to 20 percent of his working hours in the office. The rest of the time, he is flying high above the English countryside or being squired to fancy restaurants by clients’ chauffeurs or meeting over a drink in the bar at Claridge’s or the Ritz. “It’s a strange job,” he allows, “because when you’re with them, you’re one of them; you’re living the life of a billionaire. And then you go home.”Newall took me on a tour of Oakland House, a Regency-style mansion in a gated community in Surrey called St. George’s Hill that is now about one-eighth Russian-owned. (Everything is posh around St. George’s Hill; our car was stopped for a moment by a funeral cortege featuring plumed horses pulling a glass hearse.) Oakland House’s current Russian owner has never actually lived there — he lives next door — and it is now for sale again, with an asking price of about $16 million. On the ground floor, just to the right of the octagonal, cupola-topped reception hall, is a wine-storage room that, but for the lack of a window, would make a respectable Manhattan studio apartment. Just past the kitchen lies an indoor swimming pool that resembles one in a high-end health club, with changing rooms and a large and very Russian-looking sauna. An elaborate, cutting-edge system of reflectors and transom-size skylights provides an evenly distributed amount of natural light in nearly every room. There are also touch-screen controls operating not only the lights, underfloor heating and a sound system, but also a network of security cameras, inside and outside the house.Suitable, in other words, for a Russian. A fine line, of course, runs between national character and national stereotype. And the superrich, to use Knight Frank’s designation, are a kind of country all their own, whose customs (hyperdecisiveness, expecting others’ schedules to conform to theirs and the like) transcend mere geographic boundaries. Still, the agents I spoke to all referred confidently to Russian likes and dislikes, and there were some generalities they could agree upon. The Russians are not interested in some Anglophilic, theme-park-style immersion in Merrie Olde England; instead, they want what’s newest and latest and, more often than not, biggest. No Sir Christopher Wren-era snugness for them: they like their rooms large, their ceilings high and their unexpected domestic amenities — a squash court, say, or a full working cinema — as lavishly au courant as possible.A London flat designed to appeal to a Russian buyer must be, in the term of the trade, “fully dressed” — even if it’s a brand-new space, it should look as if people with unlimited means and excellent taste are already living there. Margolies took me to a vacant apartment on Park Street in Mayfair that looked as if some very well-to-do family had heard us coming and run out the back: the dining room was set for a five-course meal, the surface of every table was covered with books and magazines and objects of every description and even the bathrooms were completely stocked.I resisted the temptation to open the drawers in the bedrooms, but I would not have been at all surprised to find clothes there. It should look, Margolies said, as if “you could walk right in there with your suitcase” — in part because, if a client likes the place well enough, he or she might well do exactly that.But more than anything else, the Russians are, in Margolies’s phrase, “hot on security.” Ground-floor flats are out. Twenty-four hour surveillance and interior motion sensors are in. Privacy and secrecy are paramount; this, it turns out, is one of the deal-breaking aspects of the magnificent Pavilion — the fact that you can look out your window and see houses and a public walking path just across the Thames. “They’re brought up with this idea,” Newall says, “that there’s always a risk.”The Russian affinity for England is centuries old. Lenin spent time in London before the 1917 revolution, and when that plot succeeded, much of Russia’s displaced aristocracy fled there as well. Russian culture has always held the notion of a British education in special regard, and for decades Russia’s ruling class has sent its young scions to boarding school abroad. Newall himself attended Harrow with some of them.But the more immediate attractions for the rich are England’s relative political and economic stability and the business-friendliness of its tax laws. Unlike, say, the United States, England doesn’t tax the income of resident foreigners unless they bring that income into the country.Combine these circumstances with the fact that London is not much more than three hours by air from Moscow, and you have the makings of a cultural surge, but it wasn’t until the collapse of Soviet-era restrictions on international travel that the dam really burst. More than a thousand Russians are now granted British citizenship every year. Visa applications at the British Embassy in Moscow were up a reported 25 percent this past May in comparison with the same month last year. Estimates of London’s current Russian population run as high as 300,000, most of them resident aliens.Thirty years ago, when oil-rich Arabs bought a few high-profile London residences, there was a somewhat xenophobic outcry against what some saw as the auction of pieces of Britain’s heritage; by now, though, the waves of foreign investment are a fact of London life. “I wouldn’t say that there is a feeling on the street of great resentment of Russians in particular,” says Tincey, of the Immigration Service Union. “Though obviously there’s lots of concern about immigration here, the concern tends to come at the lower end of the economic scale.”Some Russians assimilate more flashily than others. In 2003, the young Russian oil tycoon Roman Abramovich raised the Russian profile in London considerably by buying the Chelsea soccer club and then going on a Steinbrenner-like spending spree that two years later brought the club (now nicknamed Chelski) its first league championship in 50 years.But the Russian rich are hardly all wannabe Englishmen. This is in part because they divide their time among residences all over the world but also because they keep a sharp and critical eye on developments back home and are unshy about wanting a say in their motherland’s future.As in Lenin’s day, London has become a seat of Russian political opposition to the government of Vladimir Putin, though with obvious differences this time. Lenin would have been unlikely, for instance, to stage a protest by sending 100 silver limousines to park in front of the Russian Embassy, as one tycoon did to protest what he said he felt was the hounding of Russian businessmen by Putin’s government.But that’s not to say that the stakes are frivolous — as the world was reminded last November by the spectacular death-by-polonium-210 of the former Russian spy and fierce Putin critic Alexander Litvinenko. The poisoning is thought to have occurred in a London bar.It may seem like a billionaire’s folly to buy an ultraexpensive home in a foreign country and live in it seldom, if ever, as many do, but there are some good reasons for it. Some of the lavish homes Abrahmsohn sold to Middle Eastern clients in the mid-’70s have never been lived in, and yet the value of those homes has gone up exponentially. One man’s louche whim is another’s shrewd investment.When Abrahmsohn got started in 1974, the king of Greece had recently been deposed, and so there was an influx of wealthy Greeks looking for a refuge for themselves and their money; then came the Arabs; then the post-shah Iranians; then Nigerians; Indians; Americans in the ’80s, when the dollar was worth much more than it is now; then the Japanese.So who’s next? “The Chinese buyer is certainly something we’re anticipating but haven’t yet seen,” Abrahmsohn says. And Newall says that buyers from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are a significant presence in the ultrarich market already.Of course, London’s attractive political stability is a little more fungible than it used to be. Newall and I spent awhile discussing the “ring of steel,” Londoners’ nickname for the city’s network of police security cameras, of which Newall heartily approves. “Another terrorist attack here,” he said, “would seriously affect the flow of wealth into this country.” Less than two weeks after Margolies showed me the apartment on Park Street, an unexploded car bomb was discovered nearby.The Russians’ dominance of the high-end market isn’t likely to wane anytime soon, but there is a date that the agents have circled on their calendars. In the coming year, Russia will hold two nationwide elections, the first for the Duma, or Parliament, and the second for the presidency, currently held by Putin — the man who has referred to rich expats as criminals who are “hiding from Russian justice.” For now, though, London will gladly keep catering to them. “Home sellers love it,” Margolies says of the Russian factor. “Other buyers sometimes have a tough time with it. But that’s capitalism for you.”Baker, too, thinks the Russian presence in her business will stay strong at least until those elections, which will either make it safer for wealthy Russians to keep their money in Russia or not. “Unfortunately, in Russia, everything business is politics and everything politics is business,” she says. “Whenever people feel a little bit danger in politics, they start buying property abroad. I don’t know what will happen then. I just know that for two years I am going to be very busy.”'"
"'07-09-09,'0','IN the mid-1990s, when Jérôme Bel began to choreograph his austere, stripped-down pieces, he was an anomaly in his native France, where dance — aided by generous government financing — was still leaning rather strongly toward the theatrically excessive. Mr. Bel’s terse, literal pieces were a kind of French reinvention of the 1960s Judson Church aesthetic in New York: everyday movement, no décor, and music and lighting produced only by the most commonplace means.But his work also openly evinced a postmodern self-awareness about the nature of performance, and his clever, funny negotiation of the fine line between the ordinary and the theatrical has made him a cult figure on the European dance scene for the last decade.Like many such figures he hasn’t had much of his work staged in the United States. His best-known piece, “The Show Must Go On,” famous for the uproar that ensued when two critics came to blows at its Paris premiere, was presented at Dance Theater Workshop two years ago. From Nov. 7 to 10 the same theater will present “Pichet Klunchun and myself,” which Mr. Bel choreographed in 2005 in collaboration with Mr. Klunchun, a traditional Thai dancer.Mr. Bel likes literal titles and content; his second piece was called “Jérôme Bel,” because, he said, “we’re not characters, we’re ourselves.” In “Véronique Doisneau” a Paris Opera Ballet soloist (Ms. Doisneau) talked about her life and career, and danced bits and pieces of works she had dreamed of dancing, or had actually danced. So “Pichet Klunchun” is likely to be what Mr. Bel says it is: a “physical demonstration and verbal debate” between two dancers of wildly different backgrounds.Perhaps it is inaccurate to call Mr. Bel a choreographer, since the idea of dancing or performance, rather than the steps or actions, is the point of his work. But his skill at asking audiences to consider what they are looking at and his ability to underpin his work with rigorous structure make for a theatrical experience that is both entertaining and thought provoking. As Brigitte Lefevre, the director of the Paris Opera Ballet, said when she commissioned a work from Mr. Bel: “I do not think that dance is so important in your work, but I do think that your work is important for dance.”'"
"'07-09-09,'0','No less bloody? That’s good to know. Next time I talk to my sister-in-law, an emergency medicine doctor serving at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, I’ll tell her we have it just as rough here at home. Norman Podhoretz is practically dodging I.E.D.’s on his way to Zabar’s.Unlike Podhoretz, for whom “World War IV” is largely an excuse to insult his old foes on the left and titillate himself with fantasies of civic violence, Michael Ledeen has written an actual book on the Middle East. In particular, he is passionate about Iran. If Podhoretz is vague about whom exactly America is fighting, Ledeen is precise: everything traces back to Tehran.“The Iranian Time Bomb” has its strengths. On the topic of Iran’s repression of women and ethnic minorities, for instance, it is genuinely moving. But Ledeen’s effort to lay virtually every attack by Muslims against Americans at Tehran’s feet takes him into rather bizarre territory. He says the 1998 bombings of the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania “were in large part Iranian operations,” which would come as news to the 9/11 Commission, which attributed them solely to Al Qaeda. He says Shiite Iran was largely behind Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a man famous for his genocidal hatred of Shiites. He claims that “most” Iraqi insurgents are “under Iranian guidance and/or control,” not just Shiite warlords like Moktada al-Sadr, but Sunni militants as well — the very people who say they are fighting to prevent Iranian domination. In Ledeen’s view, in fact, Sunni-Shiite conflict — the very thing that most observers think is tearing Iraq apart — is largely a mirage, because Iran controls both sides. And Al Qaeda is a mirage too, a mere front for the regime in Tehran. “When you hear ‘Al Qaeda,’ ” Ledeen writes, “it’s probably wise to think ‘Iran.’ ” Not surprisingly, he thinks the mullahs were probably behind 9/11.If this kind of statement sounds oddly familiar, it should. It’s the 2007 equivalent of the claims made in 2002 and 2003 about Iraq. The years between 9/11 and the Iraq war gave rise to a cottage industry — led by Ledeen’s colleague at the American Enterprise Institute, Laurie Mylroie — charging that Saddam Hussein was the hidden mastermind behind a decade of jihadist terror. While refuted by the 9/11 Commission and mainstream terror experts, these claims had a political effect. They offered cover for top Bush administration officials who were predisposed to believe Iraq represented the real terror threat.In some ways, Ledeen’s aim is similar. The mullahs in Tehran, he maintains, are global revolutionaries, indifferent to the self-preservation that restrains normal states. If they get a nuclear weapon, they will use it, quickly. Where Ledeen differs is in his proposed solution. Somewhat surprisingly (and unlike Podhoretz) he doesn’t counsel military action against Iran. Rather, he proposes an aggressive but nonviolent American campaign for regime change. And then his book falls apart.There are two well-known arguments against Ledeen’s position. The first — made by, among others, the journalist Laura Secor after extensive interviews with Iranian dissidents — is that American support for regime change would backfire, by allowing Tehran to paint the dissidents as American tools. Incredibly, Ledeen never addresses this. He says that antigovernment Iranians differ over whether America should help them “openly or secretly,” but skips the larger question of whether they want American help at all. The closest he comes is an acknowledgment that on a recent trip to the West, the famed Iranian human rights activist Akbar Ganji opposed “American pressure on the mullahs.” Ledeen explains this by hypothesizing that Ganji must have had his spirit broken in jail, a slander for which he provides no evidence.The second argument against regime change is that even if it succeeds, a democratic Iran will still want the bomb. (After all, Iran’s nuclear program has already survived one ideological revolution; it began under the shah.) Ledeen states that “lots of people say ... the Iranian people really want their government to have nuclear weapons — but there is no reliable polling data to support it.” That’s it. After that, he simply drops the subject.One day, prominent conservatives will offer not merely new foreign policies for the post-Bush era, but a new style of foreign policy argument: lighter on character attacks and unsubstantiated generalizations, heavier on careful reasoning and empirical evidence. And when they do, they may find “World War IV” and “The Iranian Time Bomb” instructive, as object lessons in the kinds of books not to write.'"
"'07-09-09,'0','Museum directors and curators increasingly sense opportunity — and profitability — in the low test scores that characterize Americans’ familiarity with their country’s history. ( “What do you call the high school history teacher?” asked Roy Rosenzweig, a professor of history at George Mason University who directs the Center for History and New Media there. “Coach.”)Jokes aside, for “The Presence of the Past,” his 1998 book with David Thelen, Mr. Rosenzweig asked nearly 1,500 people, “What word do you associate with history in high school?”Yet Mr. Rosenzweig argues that if memorizing dates and place names hold little appeal, history museums still rate very highly with the American public. “What people say they’re excited about in terms of history museums is contact with real stuff of the past,” he explained.They also want to find themselves — spiritually, socially and intellectually — among all that material, said Terry L. Davis, president and chief executive for the American Association for State and Local History, a national trade association for history organizations.“In the visitation research that’s been done for many years,” Ms. Davis said, “the thing that we hear most is that people want to see something about themselves and that they trust information the museums are giving them even more than they trust what schools are telling them and even the stories their grandmothers are telling them.“People want to see themselves in the exhibit. And the research done at individual museums suggests that when they do find themselves there, they fare much better.”The list of museums that have opened recently or are now under construction is expansive, seemingly catering to almost every interest. In the last two years alone the newcomers have included the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle, Va.; the National World War I Museum in Kansas City, Mo.; the Abraham Lincoln Museum in Springfield, Ill.; the American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar in Richmond, Va.; the Museum of the African Diaspora in San Francisco; the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Ky.; the Museo Alameda in San Antonio; the Arab American National Museum in Dearborn, Mich.; and the Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas. And “Quest for Freedom” is a new program that links more than 20 historic Underground Railroad sites in Pennsylvania.Some old stalwarts — Colonial Williamsburg, Jamestown, Yorktown and Mount Vernon — have been given major overhauls; a new visitor center is scheduled to be completed next year at Gettysburg.The Rocky Flats Cold War Museum is in development just outside Denver, and ground has been broken for the New Mexico History Museum in Santa Fe. The National Museum of the United States Army, at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, expects to open in 2013. And by 2015 the Smithsonian plans to open the doors of its National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall.The American Association of Museums does not track attendance nationally. And though the Smithsonian prefers not to categorize its museums, the visit statistics on the Smithsonian’s Web site indicate that its seven history museums currently open to the public, including the National Air and Space Museum and its Steven F. Udvar-Hazy branch, attracted more than five times the number of visitors to its seven art museums between January and July of this year.Most of the new history museums make major investments in multimedia or interactive exhibitions. At the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, for example, fans can learn to “float like a butterfly and sting like a bee” in its “Train With Ali” exhibition, which offers shadow boxing, rhythm drills and the opportunity to feel the strength of the boxer’s punch against a heavy bag. The experience may be priceless, but the price tag for the museum was $80 million.At the National Museum of the Marine Corps, visitors can ride a Higgins Boat toward an assault landing on the island of Iwo Jima, feel the chill on Toktong Pass in Korea as they hear the advancing Chinese soldiers or step off the clanging ramp of a CH-46 helicopter fuselage into the steamy jungle of Vietnam, complete with the sounds of whirring rotors and ricocheting bullets. The cost of providing these sensory history lessons: $87 million and growing.At the Abraham Lincoln Museum, which opened on April 19, 2005, visitors stroll through a replica of the 1860s White House, where a quill pen springs to life and writes the Gettysburg Address in thin air. In the museum’s television studio Tim Russert reports on the 1860 election, with campaign commercials, no less. The installations cost $90 million.As Bob Rogers, the founder of BRC Imagination Arts, which created the Lincoln attractions, said in a 2005 review of the museum in The New York Times, “There is nothing we wouldn’t do to get people in.”But not every institution, particularly the community-based sites that make up around 80 percent of history museums in the country, can afford to stop at nothing to attract a crowd.More to the point, should they?“Sometimes I think what we might call the bells and whistles go too far,” said James M. McPherson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who serves as an adviser to both the Gettysburg Foundation and the American Civil War Center.But even Mr. McPherson, a crusader for the preservation of historical sites, does not deny the benefits of mixing entertainment with education in the museum field. “The positive feeling is that it seems to be very successful in attracting visitors and viewers from all age levels and all kinds of backgrounds of historical knowledge,” he said. “I don’t really know whether it works, but if 3,000 people a day are going to the Lincoln Museum, and if even 1 percent are inspired by Lincoln, it may be having a positive impact.”While the American Civil War Center draws on new technologies in its inaugural exhibition, as will the Gettysburg visitor center when it opens next year, the results are more subtle, melding images with words to poignant effect. Mr. McPherson said he hopes this approach proves as emotionally and intellectually stimulating as the more flamboyant exhibitions.It is a constant refrain repeated by historians, curators and directors: After all the stops are pulled out, they insist, the museum is finally about the story and about finding a better way to present it to the generations in whose hands the fate of these museums rests.“All museums are looking for ways to attract generation Xers and Yers, and the reasons for that are pretty simple,” said Ms. Davis of the American Association for State and Local History. “That’s the generation that’s going to be their larger share, not just as visitors but as board members and donors. Those are the people who are going to sit in the seats and make decisions for the future of museums.”Lonnie G. Bunch discovered the power of the story when, as president of the Chicago Historical Society, he created a program in which teenagers, tutored by the author Studs Terkel in the art of the oral history, interviewed their elders about growing up in the city. Previously untold stories, bolstered by 40 years of fresh research, will provide the core of what Mr. Bunch calls “the quintessentially American story” when the National Museum of African American History and Culture, of which he is director, opens in Washington.With more than 1,000 American veterans dying each day, Major General John P. Herrling, senior campaign director for the National Museum of the United States Army, is extending a project he began while overseeing the building of the National World War II Memorial. Thousands of veterans told professional interviewers their stories during the memorial’s four-day dedication in May 2004.“I think this is an important point,” said Colonel David Fabian, the Army museum’s communications director. “The museum is not the artifacts. It’s stories. Words. The artifacts will be there, but along with the artifact that has the bullet hole is going to be the story of that soldier and the battle that may have involved him. The story is the heart.”In the end, historians seem to agree, it may not matter in what form that story is presented.“In general I think any act of good will that is true to the historical record, that gets people interested in the past, is a good thing,” said Edward L. Ayers, president of the University of Richmond. He created the “Valley of the Shadow Project,” a digital archive of primary sources documenting the lives of people in Augusta County, Va., and Franklin County, Pa., during the Civil War. In 2002 it was honored by the American Historical Association as the best aid to teaching history.“Younger generations are going to be thanking us effusively for making the past sing in a way never before done,” he said. “The greatest danger is not that people get a version of history that is dramatized. It’s that people don’t pay attention to the past at all.”'"
"'07-09-09,'0','IF investors want a performance edge in their hedge funds, they may want to do a little background research on the managers: look for those who attended colleges with relatively high SAT scores.Funds run by such managers regularly posted higher returns, according to a study, “Investing in Talents: Manager Characteristics and Hedge Fund Performances,” which has been circulating since May as an academic working paper. Its authors are Haitao Li, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Michigan; Xiaoyan Zhang, an assistant professor of finance at Cornell; and Rui Zhao, a research associate in the portfolio management group of BlackRock Inc., the asset management company. A version is at http://ssrn.com/abstract=990753.To investigate the relationship between hedge fund returns and the academic credentials of their managers’ colleges, the researchers focused on more than 4,000 hedge funds that operated at some point from 1994 to 2003. They built a database that included not only the performance of each fund, but also the average combined SAT score, verbal and math, of the undergraduate college or university of the fund’s lead manager. After eliminating funds for which requisite data were unavailable, the database contained just over 1,000 funds.The researchers found a “strong positive relation” between a hedge fund’s performance and the average SAT score at its manager’s school. To put the relationship into context, the researchers offer this illustration: “Everything else being the same, a manager from an undergraduate institution with a 200-point higher SAT — for instance, from Yale University, with an SAT of 1480 at the end of our study period, instead of from George Washington University, with an SAT of 1280 — can expect to earn 0.73 percent more per year.”This higher return might not be all that noteworthy had it been produced with markedly higher risk. But the researchers were able to dismiss this possibility: the average hedge fund managed by someone who went to an institution with higher SAT scores incurred significantly less risk than one whose lead manager attended an institution with lower average scores.So, on a risk-adjusted basis, the manager who went to the school with higher scores is even further out front.'"
"'07-09-09,'0','Colorful interpretations of recent monetary policy abound, from both commentators and politicians. Depending on the storyteller, the policy reflects the triumph of the rich over the poor, an atonement for the sins of the Bush administration, a long-awaited comeuppance for the American economy, a continuing hangover from the dot-com bubble, or an inability of the professor (Ben S. Bernanke) to handle a real-world job (running the Fed).Journalists are especially likely to embrace narratives, if only because their editors and their readers clamor for them. Of course, if there are enough competing stories, some of them will fit or predict some real-world events, if only because of random luck.Nonetheless, Fed watchers should resist the tendency to put all events into a simple or a morally plausible narrative. Monetary policy is a largely technical subject, and its ups and downs don’t usually fit into the kinds of emotion-laden stories that human beings apply to daily life. The “us versus them” tag registers in human memory, but monetary policy is not always or even usually about moral issues. As Freud famously noted, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.Financial market news, which is by nature unpredictable, suffers from distortion when it is crammed into the form of a simple story. Unlike most well-structured narratives, the zigs and zags of daily profit and loss defy simple categorization in terms of moral precepts.In the case of subprime mortgages, many investors did not foresee the risk of collateralized debt securities. In response to this crisis, the Fed has been trying to keep a steady hand and prevent a credit crunch. We don’t yet know how well the Fed has succeeded, or how well it could have done in the first place. And the storm has not yet fully passed.Of course, such an account of recent financial history sounds mundane and offers less human conflict. It’s less like the stories that people have gossiped about for thousands of years and thus will have less traction, even if it is a better guide to monetary policy issues.Debating Fed policy in terms of strong moral narratives makes it harder for the Fed to do a good job. For instance, if interest-rate cuts are portrayed as a bailout for hedge fund managers, it’s harder for the Fed to cut interest rates, if that turns out to be the appropriate policy. It also makes the public wonder — unjustifiably — who else might deserve a subsidy as well.Both President Bush and Congress are preparing plans to assist homeowners facing foreclosure. Many of these proposals are political pandering, designed to win votes by easing the pain of homeowners. Yet someone else is paying the bill, so protecting people from their mistakes in this way does not promote the general public welfare. In any case, these proposals should be evaluated on their (often slight) merits, rather than seen as a quid pro quo for another bailout already made.THE American public has a hard-enough time understanding relatively simple economic issues like the benefits of free trade, much less the Fed or monetary policy. So if the picture sticks that the Fed is a shill for hedge fund managers, or that it is treating homeowners unfairly, the pressure will mount for Congress to limit the Fed’s independence. Yet most economists, on a bipartisan basis, agree that relatively independent central banks have a better record of maintaining economic stability and keeping down price inflation.Wealthy financiers and hedge funds make for easy targets, especially when combined with the arcane field of central banking. But the real moral question is whether we will prove mentally tough enough. Can we resist the temptation to force financial markets and the Fed into oversimplified moral narratives? Or will we continue to blame Zeus for lightning strikes?The question of our mental strength and discipline is also a story — and I hope it has a happy ending.'"
"'07-09-09,'0','STOCKHOLM has recently declared itself the “Capital of Scandinavia,” and for the moment at least, none of the other style-conscious Viking superpowers is mounting much of a challenge. With discount airlines like Ryanair bringing the rest of Europe to what is still technically just the Swedish capital, Stockholmers no longer fill weekend flights to Copenhagen for a dose of the international high life. The Swedish version of a good time is all about high glamour, haute cuisine, more high glamour and having fun. The local penchant for cunning design and cozy interiors remains undimmed as candles blaze in the city's increasingly refined restaurants. But waves of immigrants have seasoned the Swedish stew, and albondigas and kefta are the new meatballs in town as tapas, kielbasa and sushi roll out on menus across the city. And in a possible upside to global warming, summer seems to arrive earlier and stay around longer, making the charms of this floating city linger into autumn.Whether it's a whiteout of winter snow or the radiance of midnight sun, Swedish painting is all about the unique qualities of Nordic light. The banker Ernest Thiel (1859-1947) was a visionary collector whose other hobbies included thumbing his nose at the priggish society that surrounded him. Thielska Galleriet (Sjotullsbacken 8; 46-8-662-5884; www.thielska-galleriet.se), set in Thiel's former home — a charmingly oddball Art Nouveau manse near the far end of Djurgarden — remains the showcase for his outstanding collection of Nordic masters, including a dozen works by Edvard Munch. Admission is 50 Swedish kronor, or about $7 at 7.01 kronor to the dollar.Once a royal hunting ground, the island of Djurgarden still provides treats fit for a king. Rosendals Tradgard (Rosendalsterrassen 12; 46-8-545-812-70; www.rosendalstradgard.se) is an organic garden that has operated since 1984 in the former greenhouses of the 19th-century Rosendal Palace. Locals stop in for specimen petunias in spring but come year round for fragrant coffee and scrumptious baked goods like carrot cake with a half-inch of tangy frosting (36 kronor) or to sip a frosty Nils Oskar organic beer (50 kronor) in the garden.Given Stockholm's overheated restaurant scene, it's rare for a place to stay on the local radar for more than a few years, yet P.A. & Co. (Riddargatan 8; 46-8-611-0845), a clubby brasserie, still fills with media and fashion types who come to sup on hearty fare like beef à la Rydberg (285 kronor) and spaghetti Bolognese (125 kronor) and then linger until it's time to slip off to the posh bars of Stureplan. Of the latter, Riche (Birger Jarlsgatan 4; 46-8-545-035-60) has two distinct lounges that divide along the age barrier — fresh meat and the leftovers — according to die-hard regulars.Stockholm's sky-high style quotient has moved shopping to the top of most visitors' to-do lists, and tony Ostermalm remains the redoubt of designer boutiques. In spring 2006, the designer Filippa K started Ease (Grev Turegatan 12; 46-8-678-6500; www.filippa-k.se), a boutique selling silk-and-cashmere-blend yoga apparel and other body-conscious women's clothing. Transportable treasures from the iconic housewares depot Svenskt Tenn (Strandvagen 5; 46-8-670-1600; www.svenskttenn.se) include Josef Frank's “Klover” candlesticks in brass (925 kronor) or a slouchy “Weekend” bag (1,700 kronor) in one of the sassy signature botanical prints to carry the retail haul home in.'"
"'07-09-09,'0','“Historically in tennis, you felt like you had to sit on your thumbs during changeovers or keep silent during matches, but now the fans are able to express themselves,” Kantarian said. “That’s good for everybody. It helps the athletes because it helps the adrenaline. People can also better connect with the athletes. To a large degree, that’s what brings people into the sport.”In the upper tiers of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center stadiums, fans often did not wait for the changeovers to come and go. Even closer to the court, spectators stood, walked in and out, talked on cellphones and dealt with crying babies. During night matches, they took flash photographs. Some fans conversed with players, as several women did with Andy Roddick when he was on the court.Here, it is all about keeping fans entertained, beyond the tennis. In 2001, the tournament added video screens to occupy the crowd and began piping in music.“This is not the cathedral of tennis like Wimbledon is,” said the broadcaster Jim Courier, a four-time Grand Slam tournament champion. “This is a stadium filled with New York’s corporate elite, who are not necessarily hard-core tennis fans but are here more for the spectacle. So the energy is naturally going to be different, especially at night when there is what I call a Heineken-ized crowd.”With matches played late into the night, beer and alcohol sales continue, and the crowd can become raucous. Partisan gatherings can also be rowdy.At several matches featuring Jelena Jankovic and Novak Djokovic, fans waved Serbian flags and sang Serbian songs in the top tier of the stadium. During Jankovic’s quarterfinal match against Venus Williams, fans violated etiquette by shouting while Jankovic served, and between her first and second serves.She complained, and the chair umpire warned the fans. But they showed up for Djokovic’s match the next night, just as unruly.“It’s great that people are not afraid to yell here, but there are times when it’s not appropriate because it’s distracting,” Jankovic said. “But it’s O.K. We love it in New York. Here, it’s crazy, like you are performing on Broadway and you know you are part of the show.”For the chair umpires and supervisors, keeping that show going without upsetting the game or its outcome can be a challenge.It is like being a parent, said Michael Morrissey, one of the tournament’s Grand Slam supervisors and a former chair umpire. The officials do not want to scold too soon or too often.“We used to be very persnickety about spectators sitting down during play, but a few years ago, we began to take a more liberal view of what the fans can and cannot do,” Morrissey said. “It was less, ‘Quiet please,’ because that sounded like we were treating them as naughty children. We were killing the energy. Now, I guess the issue is, ‘Are the players being disrupted by it?’ If not, then we let it go.”Djokovic said the fans in the United States are living in the “modern era of tennis” where there is more interaction with players.“The noise can get irritating when you are losing, when you are down, when you are nervous,” he said. “It’s a real challenge to play here if the fans are supporting the other guy.“But this could be the best place in the world if the fans are on your side. It’s a strange place, but it’s really something special.”'"
"'07-09-09,'0','WHAT businessman would not desire a 34-foot-long ballroom in his penthouse, with a barrel-vaulted, hand-painted silver leaf ceiling topping out at nearly 20 feet? Or a private 1,800-square-foot terrace?Those are some of the unusual features of the apartment that Andrew Farkas, the real estate investor and developer and a scion of the family that owned the Alexander’s department store chain, gave up last month when he sold his prewar condominium on West 57th Street. The price, according to property records, was $18 million.The buyer is Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the leveraged-buyout investor who specializes in troubled companies.Mr. Ross was briefly married to Betsy McCaughey Ross, a lieutenant governor of New York under George E. Pataki. Mr. Ross bankrolled her campaign for governor, as a Democrat, in 1998, but then withdrew his support in the middle of the campaign, and after the election announced that they were divorcing.The apartment, just off Seventh Avenue, has three stone fireplaces and 5,800 square feet of space, and is opposite Carnegie Hall.Mr. Farkas is the chairman of the Island Capital Group, a real estate investment firm that he founded about the time that the Insignia Financial Group, a global real estate services company he headed, merged with CB Richard Ellis in 2003.But in the game of real estate dominoes, Mr. Farkas gave up his penthouse on the 13th floor for a more down-to-earth place, the 22 ½-foot-wide limestone town house at 12 East 73rd Street, with a rear yard rather than a terrace, which was once part of the Lycée Français. He paid $23 million last April to J. Christopher Flowers, who operates a private equity investment fund, to buy the partially renovated house.'"
"'07-09-09,'0','THOUGH many luxury real estate brokers in New York will admit, at least off the record, to a touch of anxiety about the impact of setbacks in the national housing market — the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and plummeting home prices — they still expect a robust fall selling season for the most expensive homes.Inventory is low, and some aggressively priced co-ops and condominiums are getting their asking prices.Just two years ago, Moby, the downtown disc jockey and rock musician, spent $4.5 million for a two-bedroom co-op spread over four floors atop the south tower of the El Dorado at 300 Central Park West at 90th Street. The apartment had some extraordinary features — multiple balconies with huge park views and a crisp renovation, for example — and some stark limitations: lots of stairs to climb, including a narrow circular staircase, and limited space on each floor.Moby, also known as Richard Melville Hall, decorated it with antique and period furniture, and Art Deco lighting, and a few months ago set an asking price of $7.5 million.Now brokers say the apartment went into contract in August at about the asking price.Joan McArdle of Prudential Douglas Elliman, who marketed the apartment along with John Edwards of the Corcoran Group, would not discuss the sale, because the deal has not yet been approved by the co-op board.And then across town, the penthouse apartment of Jerry Berns, an owner and the greeter for many decades at the “21” Club, was sold in late August for the asking price of $7.5 million, according to property records. Mr. Berns, who died in December at age 99, had lived in the building since it was converted to a co-op in 1958. He paid $1.3 million for the penthouse seven years ago.'"
"'07-09-09,'0','One of the most troubling lessons of the Iraq invasion is just how empty the Arab dictatorships are. Once you break the palace, by ousting the dictator, the elevator goes straight to the mosque. There is nothing in between — no civil society, no real labor unions, no real human rights groups, no real parliaments or press. So it is not surprising to see the sort of clerical leadership that has emerged in both the Sunni and Shiite areas of Iraq.But this is not true in northern Iraq, in Kurdistan. Though not a full-fledged democracy, Kurdistan is developing the key elements of a civil society. I met in Erbil with 20 such Kurdish groups — unions, human rights and political watchdogs, editors and women’s associations. It is worth studying what went right in Kurdistan to understand what we still can and can’t do to promote democratization in the rest of Iraq and the Arab world.The United States played a critical role in Kurdistan. In 1998, we helped to resolve the Kurdish civil war — the power struggle between two rival clans — which created the possibility of a stable, power-sharing election in 2005. And by removing Saddam, we triggered a flood of foreign investment here.But that is all we did. Today, there are almost no U.S. soldiers or diplomats in Kurdistan. Yet politics here is flourishing, as is the economy, because the Kurds want it that way. Down south, we’ve spent billions trying to democratize the Sunni and Shiite zones and have little to show for it.Three lessons: 1) Until the power struggle between Sunnis and Shiites is resolved, you can’t establish any stable politics in southern Iraq. 2) When people want to move down a progressive path, there is no stopping them. When they don’t, there is no helping them. 3) Culture matters. The Kurdish Islam is a moderate, tolerant strain, explained Salam Bawari, head of Kurdistan’s Democracy and Human Rights Research Center. “We have a culture of pluralism,” he said. “We have 2,000 years of living together with people living around us.” Actually, there are still plenty of Arab-Kurdish disputes, but there is an ethos of tolerance here you don’t find elsewhere in Iraq.While visiting Kurdistan, I read a timely new book, “Democracy’s Good Name: The Rise and Risks of the World’s Most Popular Form of Government,” by my friend Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign affairs expert at Johns Hopkins University. It is highly relevant to America’s democracy project in Iraq and beyond.'"

"'07-09-10,'1','He came away with a pledge from President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan, who has a record of showing disdain for the United Nations, to enter peace talks with Sudanese rebels here in Tripoli next month under the auspices of the United Nations and the African Union.And he gained promises from Colonel Qaddafi and Idriss Déby, the president of Chad, to try to persuade Sudanese rebel groups over whom they have influence to participate in the talks.Rebel groups have held talks with the government before with only limited success. But as Mr. Ban saw it, the promises he got on this trip were a triumph of his bent for personal engagement.“It has been my firm belief, sort of my lifestyle and personal philosophy, that sincerity and honesty is the key to everything in diplomacy,” he said Sunday in an interview in his seafront Tripoli hotel.He acknowledged that this left him open to criticism that he appeared indecisive and naïve. “I know it makes me look too modest, but in the end, even with people who are involved in conflicts, I have been able to make some personal relationships on the basis of trust,” he said. “It may take time, but I’m not a person who excels with a very brief time.”Mr. Bashir’s agreement to new talks followed a one-on-one meeting Monday night, with no aides present, in Khartoum. It was the third time this year that Mr. Ban had subjected Mr. Bashir to his brand of friendly arm twisting. While Mr. Ban was greeted during the trip at palaces and airports with red carpets, sharp-cadenced military displays and African dancers of the kind that welcome heads of state, he has none of the authority that they do.“Unlike national governments, the United Nations does not enjoy much power in terms of resources,” he said. “We only work on the basis of a higher moral ground and a very sincere, genuine commitment to engage in dialogue.”His aides say Mr. Ban is as deliberate and earnest in exercising his influence in private as he is in public. “It isn’t as if he plays buddy-buddy with Bashir, grabs his arm and chats his up about the latest rugby match,” said one of his Darfur specialists, speaking anonymously because he was giving a personal assessment. “He is all talking points.”The United Nations often suffers from a reputation for ineffectiveness and delay from the collision of high expectations and institutional limitations, and no situation has better illustrated this crippling reality than the continuing crisis in Darfur.Many people have looked to the United Nations to stop the bloodletting in Darfur, and say the organization has been slow to act. Mr. Ban declared on taking office that he would make Darfur his top international priority, a bold move given the outside hopes and Sudan’s resistance to international involvement.At the time of his election last fall, Mr. Ban was expected to devote himself to a businesslike overhaul of the creaking United Nations management. Whether he will accomplish that goal remains to be seen, but he has made more than 20 overseas trips in an effort to practice personal diplomacy.In his appearances, he is still hampered by a wooden style of delivering speeches and an overdependence on bureaucratic references to United Nations programs and numbing bromides about the international community. But while his personal efforts at persuasion seem to have been the hallmark of his first months in office, he remains characteristically modest and measured in assessing it.“We have made credible progress,” he said of his African trip, “but I would not claim a solid achievement because it is progress on commitments, and these commitments must be realized in action.”'"
"'07-09-10,'1','PROVO, Utah, Sept. 9 (AP) — The body of a Brigham Young University student missing for more than a week was found in a canyon Sunday, the authorities said, and investigators were trying to determine how she fell to her death.The body of the woman, Camille Cleverley, 22, was found at the base of a 200-foot cliff east of Bridal Veil Falls in Provo Canyon, said Sheriff James O. Tracy of Utah County.Mr. Cleverley’s father, Joel, identified her at the scene, Sheriff Tracy said, and it appeared that she had been dead for several days.Capt. Cliff Argyle of the Provo Police Department said that the body had injuries consistent with a fall, but that it was too early to rule out foul play. “How she ended up there, we’re not sure,” Captain Argyle said.The authorities had been searching mountain trails and the Provo River for Ms. Cleverley, believing she may have parked her bike and hiked one of the many trails leading into the Wasatch Mountains. A bicycle believed to be hers was stolen from a bike rack near the popular hiking spot last Sunday and turned over to the police.Search and rescue crews and hundreds of volunteers then focused on areas around the waterfall. Searchers spotted the body Sunday afternoon.'"
"'07-09-10,'1','Administration officials have strongly encouraged insurance companies to participate in Medicare and have urged beneficiaries to enroll in private plans. Some plans, known as Medicare Advantage plans, cover a wide range of services, including doctor’s visits and hospital care. Others provide only prescription drug benefits.The purpose of the audits is to determine whether insurers correctly calculated their costs and premiums and delivered the services promised to Medicare beneficiaries. Insurers typically receive fixed monthly payments, set in advance, for serving Medicare patients. Drug plans can receive extra payments if their costs exceed their expectations.Likewise, if private plans hold down costs, they are supposed to share some of the savings with beneficiaries and the government.In 2003, Medicare audited 49 of the 220 organizations participating in the program. Auditors found significant errors at 41 companies, but Medicare officials took no action on the findings. As a result of the errors, the auditors said, insurers kept “$59 million that beneficiaries could have received in additional benefits, lower co-payments or lower premiums.” The report did not identify the companies.Paul Caban, assistant director of the financial management team at the Government Accountability Office, said the Medicare agency’s response was puzzling. “What is the value of conducting these audits if you do not act on the findings?” Mr. Caban asked.“Congress required audits for good reason,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee. “There’s a lot of taxpayer money being spent, and we need to know where it goes. We also need consequences for spending that isn’t proven to serve beneficiaries.”Mr. Grassley said Medicare officials had done “a poor job of bringing accountability here,” and he added, “I want to see concrete action to fix this.”Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said the Medicare agency “is not doing its job to protect beneficiaries.”In separate action, the Bush administration is vigorously pursuing money that it says is owed to insurance companies by Medicare beneficiaries. The Medicare agency has sent letters to more than 135,000 people saying they still owe premiums for prescription drug coverage provided in 2006. In most cases, the premiums were supposed to have been withheld from monthly Social Security checks, but the government withheld the wrong amounts or nothing at all.Kerry Weems, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said, “I am intently focused on this matter and will make it a priority to correct the errors and minimize them in the future.”Insurers submit bids to Medicare each year, saying how much they expect to be paid to provide specified benefits. If the government accepts these proposals, it signs contracts with the insurers.The Medicare agency contends that it does not have the legal authority to force insurers to return money to beneficiaries or to the Medicare trust fund when auditors find “errors, incorrect or unreasonable assumptions or other misstatements” in company bids.The Government Accountability Office insisted that Medicare officials “had the authority to pursue financial recoveries,” but did not use it.Medicare hires private firms to conduct many audits. Insurers said that in many cases the auditors were not well versed in the intricacies of Medicare. Moreover, they said, Medicare has not provided clear guidance on how to define important items like administrative costs.Medicare officials said they found significant errors in bids from 18 of the 80 organizations audited last year. But the Government Accountability Office said “there is a low probability of the audits identifying intentional misrepresentations,” because Medicare relies heavily on actuaries who prepare the bids to certify their accuracy.Under a 2001 law, every federal agency is supposed to have a program for “recovering any amounts erroneously paid to contractors.”The Bush administration told the Government Accountability Office that “general federal contract laws do not apply to the payments made under Medicare contracts.”'"
"'07-09-10,'1','When President Bush recently announced a plan to help beleaguered homeowners avoid foreclosure, one of his aides made a point of saying, “We are not using the b-word” — bailout.But a bailout it is. A government bailout is aid to people or industries in financial distress. It shields them from the full losses they would incur if left entirely to the vagaries of the market. A bailout is justified when remedial assistance averts even greater harm to the economy.Mr. Bush’s plan meets those criteria. Its most direct relief measure would allow an additional 80,000 at-risk homeowners to refinance their loans through the Federal Housing Administration, on top of 160,000 already eligible. Though not likely to be aggressive enough — some two million homeowners are now headed for default — the refinancing effort is a good first step. Properly executed, it would help families and communities that could otherwise be ruined, with devastating effects on consumer spending, tax revenues and state and local governments. Also important, Mr. Bush’s plan shows a rare willingness to work with Congress on getting more help to people who need it.Similarly, the Federal Reserve’s recent efforts to grease the financial markets, a k a Wall Street, also amount to a bailout. The meltdown in the market for subprime-mortgage-related debt — a market fostered by Wall Street — has sharply curtailed lending, threatening a cascade of business and financial failures. To parry the threat, the Fed has lowered its lending rate, injected tens of billions of dollars into the markets, and also allowed banks to funnel extra billions to clients who presumably would otherwise fail and in the process wreak havoc on the markets and the economy.Indeed, the Fed’s ongoing bailout of Wall Street added to the political pressure to help ailing homeowners. It was simply too unseemly for the government to take steps that aid Wall Street bankers without aiding the far more vulnerable people caught up in the same crisis.Now, policy makers from Mr. Bush on down must acknowledge the bailouts for what they are — government interventions in private markets to correct for something that has gone very wrong. They may be squeamish about using the “b-word” because of its negative connotations. They can call their actions “responses” if that makes them and edgy markets feel better.'"
"'07-09-10,'1','“I didn’t say that he loved me,” she said. “He said he was in love with me.”“Did you believe him?” one of Thomas’s lawyers asked.“Didn’t know what to think,” she said.“There’s a chance that he meant it, in your mind?” the lawyer asked.“He could have,” she answered. “I am not a psychoanalyst. “In his deposition, Thomas was asked if he found Browne Sanders attractive.“I’m not attracted to her, no,” he said, adding that he never told anyone during an open Knicks practice in 2005 that he found it hard to concentrate around her because of her looks.“No,” he said, “I’ve never said that.”In court papers, Browne Sanders said that her complaints about Thomas’s behavior were not taken seriously and that the Garden retaliated by firing her in January 2006.Thomas and Dolan have countered that Browne Sanders, a former star basketball player at Northwestern who joined the Knicks in 2000, could not adjust to working with Thomas after his hiring in late 2003. They also said that her performance dropped off significantly after she was given additional responsibilities in 2005 and that she concocted the sexual-harassment accusations when she felt that her job, which paid more than $200,000 a year, and bonuses, was in jeopardy.The Garden said Browne Sanders’s lawyers had demanded $6.5 million to avoid a trial and that it proposed severance worth $300,000. She is suing Thomas, Dolan and the Garden for damages of $9.6 million.If testimony over the next few weeks matches the tenor of the depositions given by Browne Sanders, Dolan, Thomas and others, the trial before Judge Gerard E. Lynch will offer an unseemly picture of the inside workings of a team that is trying to rekindle an aura of respectability.During Thomas’s deposition, for example, he was asked about the profane language Browne Sanders said that he directed at her. In one instance, she said, he spewed expletives at her.One of her lawyers asked him, “Did you ever refer to Ms. Sanders as a ho?”In one instance, Thomas was pressed to describe how he approached Browne Sanders for a hug, one that she said she turned away from.“I think I put my left hand on her,” he said. “I guess it would be her right shoulder and I said, ‘Hey, Nuch, how you doing?’ And I went to give her a kiss on the cheek, and you know, that is when I got that reaction.”In her account, Browne Sanders said she resisted him and that he said, “What, I can’t get any love from you today?”It is a portrait of executive-suite strife and pettiness that no league wants on public display, let alone so soon after the scandal that has focused on the actions of a former referee, Tim Donaghy, who pleaded guilty last month to two felony counts of conspiring with gamblers. An N.B.A. spokesman last week declined to say whether Commissioner David Stern or any other league officials had urged Dolan and Thomas to settle privately with Browne Sanders.“Bottom line, it’s going to get ugly,” said Mike Paul, an image consultant who specializes in assessing the reputations of sports figures in crisis. “She is prepared to have her reputation sullied to get her case heard. She is not prepared to back down. She’s not willing to walk away with nothing.”A crucial element of the case is whether the Garden can show that Browne Sanders was fired for flagging competence — although from 2002 to 2005 she received bonuses that totaled $217,500 — or whether it violated federal law by dismissing her for claiming harassment. Depositions from Dolan; Hank J. Ratner, the Garden’s vice chairman; and Barry Watkins, its chief spokesman, seek to establish that Browne Sanders could not handle the budgeting aspect of her job and could not adapt to the way the company did its business.“I really felt that there was that disconnect that, you know, she wasn’t getting it,” Ratner said. He added, “She didn’t have, I think, the real financial skills needed, and she was very territorial.”Browne Sanders, who was recently named an associate athletic director at the State University of New York at Buffalo, has seized on a statement by Dolan to prove that she was fired in retaliation for her harassment complaints.In his deposition, Dolan said that she “could have continued on doing her job” if she had not disrupted the Garden’s investigation by asking other employees to recall incidents that would build her case, an activity she said was legitimate. Browne Sanders said a subordinate told her of vile comments by the Knicks’ Stephon Marbury that she said were influenced by Thomas’s attitude to her.Dolan said that Browne Sanders’s “tampering” was the “last straw” that “led me to the conclusion that her employment at the company was over with.”Joanna Grossman, a professor of law at Hofstra University, said that retaliation could lead to monetary damages as severe as those that might be levied for harassment accusations.“It’s often the case where retaliation is often easier to prove than the underlying claims,” Grossman said.The Garden’s timing in firing Browne Sanders to conclude its in-house investigation of her accusations, she said, “makes for a pretty good case for retaliation.”Dolan also said Browne Sanders’s work was declining, but in asserting that he fired her for tampering, he raised a potentially more inflammatory rationale for her dismissal than what the Garden claimed when she filed her lawsuit and what it told the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The commission ruled in Browne Sanders’s favor, but Lynch disallowed the ruling as evidence in the case. He also granted the defense’s motion to use as evidence that Browne Sanders filed an sexual-harassment grievance when she worked at IBM.Lynch offered a skeptical view in an order last month about the fact that Browne Sanders did not file a formal complaint against Thomas until December 2005, well after she contended the harassment began the previous February. But he also wrote that a “reasonable jury” could infer that the Garden “had a stronger motive to retaliate than most employers” because of its public profile, and a “stronger motive to protect Thomas, who may have been perceived as a critical contributor to the team’s success.”'"
"'07-09-10,'1','SYDNEY, Australia, Sept. 9 — The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting here limped to a close on Sunday, with a heavily compromised agreement on tackling climate change and few answers on how to advance the global trade agenda.At the top of the agenda at this year’s meeting of the Pacific Rim group — whose 21 countries include the United States, China, Russia, Australia and Indonesia — were global warming and the stalemate that has paralyzed the trade talks that began in Doha, Qatar, in 2001. On both fronts, there was only limited success.“The world needs to slow, stop and then reverse the growth of global greenhouse-gas emissions,” the leaders said in a joint statement on the climate.But the agreement sets no timetable for stemming the increase in carbon dioxide emissions after 2012. That is when the binding terms of the Kyoto Protocol — the treaty adopted by most industrialized countries, but rejected by the United States and Australia — expires.The APEC leaders hope that by 2030, for every 1 percent of growth in national output, the increase in carbon dioxide emissions will be held to 0.75 percent.'"
"'07-09-10,'1','Asked what kind of reception he expected in Pakistan, he said, “I have a mission that is much more important than any reception — to restore democracy in the country and restore the rule of law. So it is a very noble mission that I have.”Before departing from London, Mr. Sharif told his brother, Shahbaz Sharif, who faces arrest in Pakistan on murder charges, that it was not necessary for him to return to Pakistan. Shahbaz Sharif faces five counts of murder in cases that were recently reopened by the Pakistani government, but had been planning to return to Pakistan on Sunday on a separate plane from London.Nawaz Sharif served as prime minister twice in the 1990s, and leads an opposition faction of the country’s governing party, the Pakistan Muslim League. He has consistently been one of the most vocal and defiant opponents of General Musharraf, who is considered an important ally of the United States in its effort to curb terrorism.Pakistani officials had been tight lipped about their strategy prior to Mr. Sharif’s return. “I can’t say,” Sheik Rashid Ahmed, the minister of railways, told Dawn News, a television news channel.Ahsan Iqbal, the information secretary of Mr. Sharif’s political party, said Sunday that “Islamabad seems under siege.” Officials of Mr. Sharif’s party claim that more than 2,000 party workers have been detained in recent days. Government officials say the number is exaggerated.Security was increased in Islamabad and an adjacent city, Rawalpindi, on Sunday. Police officers were stationed at intersections leading to the Islamabad airport and other entry points to the city. Barbed wire was strung and barricades were set up around the airport. By midnight, local reporters were told to vacate the airport premises.Mr. Sharif’s arrival plans had been seen as a catalyst to the anti-Musharraf campaign, analysts here say. General Musharraf’s popularity has decreased considerably in recent months as he tries to seek re-election after eight years in power, and there have been increasing calls for a return to democracy. He also is under pressure to step down as chief of the military in order to run for a new term.Mr. Sharif, whose second term was marred by accusations of corruption and authoritarianism, is riding a wave of popularity for his tough stance against the military’s role in politics.In 1999, Mr. Sharif was sentenced to life in prison, but the next year, General Musharraf arranged for Mr. Sharif, his brother and their families to live in exile for 10 years in Saudi Arabia.Pakistan’s attorney general, representing the government, presented documents showing that the Sharif brothers had promised to leave Pakistan and not engage in political activities for 10 years in return for their release from prison. But the chief justice ruled that the documents did not amount to an agreement because they were signed only by the Sharif brothers.Mr. Sharif has denied that he agreed not to return to the country for 10 years. On Saturday, he said at a news briefing in London that the agreement was only for five years and he vowed to return home, saying, “My country needs me,” news agencies reported.'"
"'07-09-10,'1','Djokovic saluted the crowd and thanked his family and friends box, which included the 2006 women’s Open champion, Maria Sharapova. He will walk away wondering what happened, and how it happened so quickly.To have one set point against Federer is remarkable.To have five set points against Federer -- and lose them all on your own serve in one game -- is inexcusable. Djokovic knew it. And yet, he could do nothing about it.When Djokovic squandered his set-point opportunities in the 12th game of the first set, and then another two set points in the 12th game of the second set, Federer wasted no time schooling him in the ways of a 12-time Grand Slam champion.He came to the court wearing his tuxedo black shorts, evening attire a bit out of place considering the sun had not yet set. As usual, Federer was planning ahead.He has now won eight of his last 10 finals in Grand Slam events, the only two losses coming to Rafael Nadal at the French Open the last two seasons.But Nadal left in the fourth round here, leaving No.3 Djokovic to sprint to his first final appearance while capturing the hearts of the New York fans along the way.In the first set neither player produced stirring tennis with breathless rallies or blistering groundstrokes. The two were feeling each other out from the baseline, dealing with nerves that fluttered like the wind, and taking pace off the ball until the other made a mistake.Federer’s rare imperfections on his usually indefensible forehand set the intrigue for the day. Intrigue turned quickly to drama and unraveled to tragedy for Djokovic.Despite going to his third deuce, serving at 6-5 for the match, Djokovic hit a backhand that fluttered wide. Federer had his first break point; Djokovic double-faulted to send the first set to a tiebreaker.Unlike when Djokovic executed his thrilling second-round escape in five sets from Radek Stepanek, he could do little right in this tiebreaker. When he hit an error on his backhand, he screamed out in Serbian. When Djokovic netted a backhand on the next point, evening the tie break at 3 points apiece, he slammed his racket to the court in disgust.The vibration dampener, a yellow smiley face, popped out of his strings and tumbled to the court. When he affixed it back on the racket, the face might as well have been upside down. Djokovic again double-faulted, this time on set point for Federer.If Federer was not playing his best tennis on this day, he was playing his best points when it mattered. And Djokovic allowed him to do so.Djokovic broke Federer’s serve in the fourth game of the second set and ran to a 4-1 lead only to give it back with the careless strike of his backhand.Sitting down for the changeover, Djokovic shook his head, pantomiming the stroke that failed him.Djokovic had two more set points once again, in the 12th game of the second set. Federer came back with an ace to erase the first. On the second, Djokovic’s forehand was called long and he challenged. When the instant replay flashed on the screen and the call was magnified, so, too, was Djokovic’s agony.One millimeter separated the ball back from the baseline, a fitting emblem for the narrowest margins that Federer only needed and Djokovic only squandered.'"
"'07-09-10,'1','At nearly 4 a.m. on Sunday a guy by the name of Tommy Hottpants was the subject of the last official portrait at the last weekly Misshapes party at Don Hill’s. Posed against a stark white wall, Tommy Hottpants, a sometime D.J. and nightlife promoter, wore a white T-shirt and mugged suggestively for the camera.His was one of the 800 snapshots that Scott Meriam took throughout that night and morning, documenting the crowd at the reigning downtown It party. Hundreds more fill a new picture book, “Misshapes,” released by MTV Press. “It’s like a yearbook,” Mr. Meriam said.That’s especially true because most of the regulars who made Misshapes the hot party are only a few years out of school. In 2002 Geordon Nicol, 23; Greg Krelenstein, 28; and Leigh Lezark, 23 — self-styled D.J.’s known more for their post-new-wave aesthetics than their turntable skills — started their nightlife careers with a one-off at Luke & Leroy. Since then Misshapes has worn its mantle as the ur-hipster party as snugly as (of course) a pair of skinny jeans. Though the Misshapes themselves will go on, as in-demand D.J.’s (up next: London fashion week), and as a marketing juggernaut (a clothing line is in the works), the weekly party came to a neon-tinged end in the SoHo nightclub on Sunday.“It’s a good night — David Byrne and Cindy Sherman are inside,” Mr. Nicol said on one of his many trips to fetch his V.I.P. friends from the half-block-long line outside. “I’m happy. I’m celebrating.”So was everyone else. There was nary a symmetrical haircut or wide pantleg to be seen. (Also scarce: body fat.) In line the kids passed their time smoking, checking one another out and eating free ice cream distributed from a truck sponsored by the clothing brand Diesel. Mark Hunter, the party photographer better known as the Cobrasnake, bopped around snapping photos of people like Andrew Tatreau-Sherwood, 19. Mr. Tatreau-Sherwood had a broken foot, but that did not hinder his style. Decked out in shorts and a bow tie, he had sheathed his crutches in gold lamé, made from a pair of American Apparel leggings snipped in half. Ms. Lezark, who has become a designer muse with mentions in Vogue, teetered around in an expensive-looking black frock and shiny gray booties.“They came to New York and they set it ablaze,” Jimmy Webb, 50, the wiry manager of the East Village punk boutique Trash and Vaudeville, said of the trio. “I was around for the Studio 54 days, and this is the only thing that ever matched it.”'"
"'07-09-10,'1','A spokesman for the Portuguese police, Olegário Sousa, said in a telephone interview that the McCanns had every legal right to return home because they had not been charged. They are required to notify the Portuguese police if they plan to leave their home for five days or more, he said.Mr. McCann said the couple wanted to return their 2-year-old twins “as much as possible to an ordinary life in their home country” and to consider their next move “in relation to the events of the last few days, which have been so deeply disturbing.”The McCanns say Madeleine was snatched from the apartment where she was sleeping while they ate at a nearby restaurant. However, family friends and associates said this weekend that the police told the McCanns that new evidence suggested that they might have killed Madeleine by accident and tried to hide her body.Family friends and associates said the McCanns were told by the police that traces of Madeleine’s DNA were found in a rental car they hired 25 days after she was reported missing. Mrs. McCann’s sister-in-law, Philomena McCann, said Friday that Mrs. McCann had been offered a plea bargain, Sky News reported.Steven A. Drizin, a law professor and the legal director of the Center on Wrongful Conviction at Northwestern University in Chicago, suggested that the Portuguese police were using a tactic called “minimalization,” which involves suggesting a parent killed their child by accident.“A classic interrogation tactic is to suggest to parents that they didn’t mean to kill their kids and the killing is an accident and that the parents have panicked and covered it up,” he said, adding that the strategy has been linked to both false and true confessions.The McCanns’ return to Britain amid swirling suspicion was a bitter close to their highly publicized stay in this town, where overwhelming sympathy for their plight gradually faded as some residents tired of their presence and Portuguese news reports became increasingly lurid.The couple initially said that they would not leave Portugal until they were reunited with their daughter and used Praia da Luz as a base for a publicity campaign that raised millions of dollars and drew support from celebrities.Justine McGuinness, a spokeswoman for the McCanns, said in a telephone interview that they had been planning to leave Portugal even before events took a sudden turn last week. She said they had intended to go Monday, when the lease on their rented villa expired.Clarence Mitchell, a British government official who became friends with the McCanns when he worked with them as a media liaison adviser in May, said the couple felt “frightened and isolated” after they were told they were suspects. Mr. Mitchell, who no longer has any role in the McCann matter, said in a telephone interview that the McCanns were “livid” over the actions of the Portuguese police and believed they would be better placed to clear their name with the help of British lawyers and friends.Michelle Oberman, a law professor and expert in infanticide at Santa Clara University in California, said Mrs. McCann, a physician who is a general practitioner, appeared to be too well integrated socially to fit the profile of a mother who would kill her child. “It’s not that she’s a doctor, it’s how integrated she seems to be into a community and into a relationship,” Ms. Oberman said.Mr. Drizin concurred. But he said: “We need to be cautious on relying too much on profiles as well. We need to see where the evidence leads us.”'"
"'07-09-10,'1','“Even if he takes me to jail, and in return my country gets liberated from the scourge of dictatorship, it is not a big price to pay,” he said, referring to General Musharraf. “I am happy and willing to pay that price.”Even so, he looked shocked and at a loss for words as he was served with a warrant for his arrest on money laundering charges, and then was pushed and pulled by police and plainclothes intelligence officials through the throng of supporters and journalists who had accompanied him.“I am amazed by this fabricated case,” Mr. Sharif said as he was shoved through the crowd. “I’m amazed, I’m shocked.”A retired military officer who serves now as a court official, Lt. Col. Azhar Mahmud Qazi, said he served the arrest warrant on Mr. Sharif. He said the charges were the result of a three-year investigation surrounding a paper mill owned by Mr. Sharif, and the amount involved was about $31.5 million.Government officials who arrested him said at first that he would be sent to prison, but declined to say where. Later, they confirmed that Mr. Sharif had instead been put on a plane to Saudi Arabia, where Saudi officials have not allowed him to hold press conferences and have discouraged him from speaking to reporters.Tariq Azim Khan, Pakistan’s state minister for information, said Mr. Sharif had chosen to go to Saudi Arabia today instead of remaining in Pakistan under arrest.“He arrived and was brought to the lounge, where he was served with a warrant which was pending,” Mr. Khan said. The warrant was issued by the National Accountability Bureau, the main agency that investigates corruption, he said.“While he was being taken to detention, he was offered if he wanted to avail the opportunity to go to Saudi Arabia as per the agreement,” Mr. Khan said. “He opted to go to Saudi Arabia. We arranged a special flight, and he flew out of Islamabad. And I understand, the flight has just landed in Saudi Arabia.”Mr. Sharif’s lawyers condemned his arrest and deportation as illegal, and warned that repercussions would be felt in the courts and across the country.“The whole episode was very unlawful, and was a clear contempt of court,” said Amjad Malik, a British lawyer accompanying Mr. Sharif. “It is a violation of the law of Pakistan. It is a criminal offense to kidnap someone and take them out of the country. It is a sad day. They have really treated the man contemptuously.”The action seemed certain to draw the government into another clash with the judiciary, which has found new independence under the recently reinstated chief justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry. “It is a spot on the Musharraf regime,” Mr. Malik said “It shows they have not learnt.”Last week, the National Accountability Bureau refused to issue an arrest warrant for Mr. Sharif, in view of the Supreme Court ruling, deciding instead that Mr. Sharif should be allowed to return and then could be called to attend the court, he said.Mr. Sharif’s arrival had at first proceeded calmly. A senior police official boarded the plane on arrival, welcomed Mr. Sharif to Pakistan and saluted him. After lengthy negotiations to have police withdrawn from the pavement area around the plane, Mr. Sharif emerged, waved to a crowd of onlookers and boarded a bus that carried him to the V.I.P. lounge in the airport terminal building.It was there, before he passed through immigration, that he was arrested and taken back out onto the airport tarmac an hour later.The government took stringent security measures before Mr. Sharif landed. Army rangers cordoned off the airport perimeter and stood on rooftops. Police officers halted all vehicle traffic within four miles of the Islamabad airport and manned a series of five search points on each approach road. Only passengers having tickets for domestic flights were allowed to pass through the barricades, and then only after boarding special buses; no private vehicles were allowed inside the airport.Supporters of Mr. Sharif clashed with police on the main Islamabad highway leading to the airport and in different parts of the nearby garrison town of Rawalpindi. Clashes were also reported in different cities across the province of Punjab. Police fired tear gas canisters and used baton charges to disperse the supporters.Mr. Sharif has upset the political scene in Pakistan by trying to force his return. His strong opposition to General Musharraf, and his broad popularity as leader of a faction of the Pakistan Muslim League, is expected to strengthen the opposition and threatens to fracture the ruling party.The events today seemed likely to further galvanize the lawyers’ movement, which has already declared General Musharraf’s continued rule unconstitutional.It has also added to the vulnerability of a power-sharing deal being negotiated between General Musharraf and the former prime minister and opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto, a deal that has been quietly encouraged by the American and other western governments to bolster General Musharraf’s position and encourage him to ally himself with moderates rather than religious hard-liners. That deal appears to be foundering amid intense opposition from the ruling party.Mr. Sharif has criticized that deal, which has largely been negotiated in secret, as proof of the lack of democracy in the country. He won quick support from a public weary of military rule, deteriorating law and order and rising prices.In an interview on the plane from London, Mr. Sharif said his mission was now to get General Musharraf removed from power.“It’s a final battle now between dictatorship and democracy,” he said. “Civil society is there now, struggling for the restoration of the rule of law; the judiciary is today independent. I think it is about time that we put an end to this menace of dictatorship, because it had inflicted so much damage to my country.”He warned that any attempt by the government to prevent his return would amount to contempt of court. “Mr. Musharraf does not believe in the rule of law,” he said. “He tries to bulldoze everything that comes in his way.”He called on the Bush administration to cease propping up General Musharraf. “President Bush is somehow supporting an individual who today has become a symbol of hatred in Pakistan, a man whom everybody in Pakistan wants to get rid of,” he warned. “I don’t know why Mr. Bush is still supporting this man. He must not equate Pakistan with Mr. Musharraf. He should have his friendship with the people of Pakistan, not with an individual who is becoming more and more unpopular in the country.”He said he planned to mobilize public support to end General Musharraf’s rule in the same way the chief justice, who was suspended by General Musharraf in March, used rallies across the country to finally win back his job in July.“Nobody expected the chief justice to be reinstated by popular will,” Mr. Sharif said “The angry public who came out on the streets made it possible. The people’s power is there, and no dictator can withstand that power. I think I am going to mobilize that power further, mobilize the people further, to fight a decisive battle against dictatorship. This is my mission now.”He said he knew his return would annoy General Musharraf, who is trying to organize his own re-election in the coming weeks.“Look at the way that this dictator is afraid of one man,” he said. “He is holding the gun; I am talking about democracy. He is afraid of a man who talks about democracy.”Mr. Sharif heads the All Parties Democratic Movement, a recently formed association of opposition parties, which has called for a conference of all political parties to agree on an interim government and on conditions for free and fair elections.“I go back with a message of hope,” Mr. Sharif said before his arrival. “I go back with a message of national consensus, of national reconciliation, and I think Mr. Musharraf should respond positively to this message.”Yet on the streets, his party encountered violence.At 11:20 a.m. around 90 supporters of Mr. Sharif marched towards the airport. Holding the flags of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz and portraits of Mr. Sharif, they shouted, “Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,” and “Musharraf dog.”“We are here for the sake of democracy,” said Abdul Shakeel Satti, 49, holding a green colored flag.Soon, they found themselves facing more than two dozen policemen in riot gear. As the police charged Mr. Sharif’s supporters, some tried to stand their ground, but were beaten by police and forced to flee. . The crowd then dispersed, its flags and placards discarded and trampled on the ground.'"
"'07-09-10,'1','“This is an unprecedented request that warrants further briefing,” the presiding judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote of the A.C.L.U.’s motion.And Judge Kollar-Kotelly suspended the usual presumption of secrecy surrounding the court’s work, ordering the Justice Department to file its brief in public and to seek permission if it wanted to file anything under seal.Lawyers for the A.C.L.U. said their request was a modest one. Large parts of the decisions may well be properly classified, they said. All they asked was that the court make an independent assessment of what may be disclosed.The Justice Department, judging from the tone of the brief it filed Aug. 31, was taken aback by that suggestion. The A.C.L.U., the government said, “requests that this court second-guess the executive branch’s classification decision.” And the executive branch had decided, the brief continued, that “no part of any documents can be released without harming national security.”A little sheepishly, the brief conceded that there had been exceptions. In January, for instance, Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales described aspects of orders the court had issued that month.But those disclosures, the brief said, were “in the interest of informing the public debate.” Perhaps coincidentally, they were also made just before a federal appeals court in Cincinnati was to hear arguments on the legality of the surveillance program.The brief did not mention another set of even more detailed disclosures last month from Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence. In an interview with The El Paso Times, Mr. McConnell seemed to do precisely what the Justice Department said the secret court may not. He disclosed in general terms the substance of the court’s decisions.“So the second judge looked at the same data and said, ‘Well, wait a minute — I interpret the law, which is the FISA law, differently,’ ” Mr. McConnell said, according to a transcript of an interview on the newspaper’s Web site. He was referring to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that established the secret court.“And it came down to,” Mr. McConnell said of the second decision, “if it’s on a wire and in a foreign country, you have to have a warrant.”It is one thing to argue that a judge’s mechanical application of a straightforward statute may be kept secret. It is another, lawyers for the A.C.L.U. say, for whole lines of sometimes conflicting precedent to be established in the dark.“Having secret bodies of law is antithetical to our constitutional democracy,” said Melissa Goodman, a lawyer with the civil liberties group.If the secret court is having doubts about the state of national security litigation, it is not alone.Last week, judges on two ordinary federal courts expressed frustration and anxiety about the Bush administration’s approach.On Wednesday, Judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr. of Federal District Court in Washington pressed the government for actual justifications in opposing a freedom of information suit seeking executive branch documents concerning the spying program. “Essentially saying ‘because we say so’ is an inadequate method,” Judge Kennedy wrote.The next day, Judge Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in Manhattan struck down recent revisions to the USA Patriot Act, saying the deference the law required courts to give to the executive branch could amount to “the hijacking of constitutional values.”In the case before the secret court, the A.C.L.U. will submit its response to the government’s brief on Friday, sending it to Room 6725 in the Justice Department. There is no word on whether the court will hear arguments or where that might happen.But a spokesman for the Federal District Court in Washington said Friday that the secret court was in the midst of a relocation, out of the Justice Department. The secret court, with interesting timing that may signify a fresh approach, is moving to the courthouse.'"

"'07-09-11,'1','A German spy drops from a black Focke-Wulf reconnaissance plane over Cambridgeshire. His silk parachute opens with a rustle, and for twelve minutes he floats silently down. The stars are out, but the land beneath his feet, swaddled in wartime blackout, is utterly dark. His nose bleeds copiously.The spy is well equipped. He wears British-issue army landing boots and helmet. In his pocket is a wallet taken from a British soldier killed at Dieppe four months earlier: inside are two identity cards, which are fake, and a letter from his girlfriend, Betty, which is genuine. His pack contains matches impregnated with quinine for ³secret writing,² a wireless receiver, a military map, £990 in used notes of various denominations, a Colt revolver, an entrenching tool, and some plain-glass spectacles for disguise.Four of his teeth are made from new gold, paid for by Hitler¹s Third Reich.Beneath his flying overalls he wears a civilian suit that was once of fashionable cut but is now somewhat worn. In the turnup of the right trouser leg has been sewn a small cellophane package containing a single suicide pill of potassium cyanide.His name is Edward Arnold Chapman. The British police also know him as Edward Edwards, Edward Simpson, and Arnold Thompson. His German spymasters have given him the code name of Fritz or, affectionately, Fritzchen‹³Little Fritz.² The British secret services, as yet, have no name for him.

"'07-09-11,'1','The cost of employer-sponsored health insurance premiums has increased 6.1 percent this year, well ahead of wage trends and consumer price inflation, but below the 7.7 percent increase in 2006, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported today.Because doctor and hospital costs continue to rise at an even faster rate, the modest slowdown in insurance inflation mainly reflects cutbacks in coverage by many health plans, which have found ways to make employees pay more for their care. Industry experts said that without those measures, premium costs would have risen by 9 percent or more.The total average annual cost for family coverage premiums rose to $12,106.“For that kind of money, you could buy a compact car every year,” said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Foundation, a nonprofit group that produces the widely watched annual survey. He noted that health costs had increased 78 percent since 2001, more than four times as fast as prices and wages.The 2007 increase was the smallest annual rise since 1999, when health premiums rose 5.3 percent.Kaiser did not attempt to project 2008 costs for health premiums. But a number of research houses are forecasting increases for next year that range from 6.7 percent by Mercer Health and Benefits; 9.9 percent by PriceWaterhouse Coopers; 10.5 percent by the Segal Company and 11 percent by AON Consulting.The costs of hospital and doctor care seem to be “outpacing premium increases,” said Jon Gabel, a principal investigator for the Kaiser survey. That could squeeze insurance company profit margins, which have been running at 6 percent to 7 percent, he said.'"
"'07-09-11,'1','Like their manager, the Mets are careful not to publicly discuss a second consecutive trip to the postseason, but facts are facts. There are 19 games to play, and they hold a six-game lead over second-place Philadelphia, which defeated Colorado, 6-5, in 10 innings. With the Phillies due here for a weekend series, this is a big week for the Mets. If they even split these six games, they could be in position to clinch the National League East before autumn arrives. And once they do, whenever that is, it will be time for Randolph to begin planning a rotation that will need four starters for the opening round.Barring any injuries, the first three will be Orlando Hernández, Tom Glavine and Pedro Martínez. Despite his 14 victories and 3.42 earned run average, Pérez is hardly a certainty. The next three weeks, more or less, represent a tryout period for him and John Maine, the other contender, and the Mets learned last night that Pérez is still as unpredictable as ever.Pérez, who has issued five walks in each of his last three starts, allowed only two and struck out seven while holding the Braves’ diluted lineup to five hits in seven innings. Pérez attributed his success to maintaining a consistent arm slot. In previous starts, he had altered his mechanics, including picking up the unseemly habit of dropping down when facing left-handed hitters.The Braves did not score until the seventh inning when, one strike away from leaving unscathed, Pérez grooved a fastball that Brian McCann crushed for a two-run homer.“He was real good,” Randolph said of Pérez, who defeated the Braves for the fourth time in five starts this season. “Real good, man.”His signature moment came in the sixth when pitcher Tim Hudson singled and Pérez walked Yunel Escobar to begin the inning. After retiring Edgar Renteria, Pérez picked Hudson off second base for out No. 2 and then snuck a back-door slider past Matt Diaz to end the inning.“I told him you need to look at the tape and continue to pitch like this,” Carlos Beltran said.The Mets opened the first inning with two singles off Hudson, taking a 1-0 lead when Beltran’s one-out fielder’s choice scored José Reyes, and proceeded to go 13 up, 13 down — including seven consecutive groundouts to second base — before Paul Lo Duca singled with one out in the fifth. He was stranded at first, but Hudson did the Mets a huge favor by walking Reyes to lead off the sixth.Heading into last night, Reyes had one hit in his last 17 at-bats, dropping his average (.288) to a place where it had not been since the third game of the season, and he had not walked in his last eight games, either. To that end, Reyes said he had been receiving tutorials from Luis Castillo, whom Randolph calls the prototypical No. 2 hitter, for reasons Castillo was about to reveal. He took a 1-0 pitch so Reyes could steal base No. 75 and then bunted Reyes over to third base. Up came Wright, who said he was hoping that Hudson would leave up one of his trademark sinkers just enough so he could hit it in the air for a sacrifice fly. On a 2-2 pitch, Wright pounced on a knee-high fastball and crushed it into the left-center field stands for his career-high 28th home run, starting another round of the M.V.P. chants that have become commonplace within the last few weeks.“It’s a great feeling, but you can’t buy into it,” Wright said. “It’s still early.”But it’s getting early late. Even if he does not want to admit it, Wright’s candidacy, like Pérez’s rotation hopes, like his team’s playoff aspirations, are growing stronger every day.Carlos Delgado’s strained right hip flexor will keep him out for at least another week, Willie Randolph said. Delgado, who sustained the injury last Tuesday in Cincinnati, said his hip still feels tender and bothers him when he rotates his torso. “You just hope he has a speedy type of recovery and that he’s a quick healer,” Randolph said. ... The Mets set a major league record for most 40-year-old players used in a season when Jeff Conine, acquired last month from Cincinnati, became their sixth. He joined Moises Alou, Julio Franco, Tom Glavine, Orlando Hernández and Sandy Alomar Jr. According to Trent McCotter of the Society for American Baseball Research, the Mets surpassed the 1947 Chicago White Sox, who were the only other team to have as many as five.'"

The report, from unidentified sources, emerged as the police prepared to hand to a Portuguese district attorney their files on the case of Madeleine, who vanished while on vacation in Portugal on May 3. Partial results from earlier DNA tests had led the police to declare the McCanns suspects in the case last week. The couple say they are innocent. A police spokesman, Olegário Sousa, declined in a telephone interview to comment on the reported DNA match, which suggests that either Madeleine’s body or something that came from her body, like skin or hair, had been in the car.'"

"'07-09-11,'1','Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, who is chairman of the committee, countered that district tests would have to be approved by the federal Education Department, which he said would safeguard against any watering down of standards.The law, a signature initiative of the Bush administration that passed in 2001 with bipartisan support, requires schools to test all students annually in reading and math in grades three to eight and to show all students progressing toward 100 percent proficiency regardless of background. Schools in high poverty areas that fail to show sufficient gains face potentially harsh penalties, including possible closing.The proposals for changing the law, which has so far tagged 10,000 high poverty schools for state and district intervention, move away from relying solely on test scores in math and reading as a gauge of school progress. They would allow schools to include test results in other subjects, as well as indicators like attendance, promotion, performance in advanced placement courses and graduation rates to demonstrate academic strength.The draft has also come under criticism from Education Secretary Margaret Spellings and Congressional Republicans.Mr. Miller said he was not discouraged by the opposition, and indeed, many witnesses praised the proposals as offering much-needed flexibility to the law.“I think we’re doing well,” Mr. Miller said after the hearing. “It’s not easy, but that’s not a surprise.”Leaders of the teachers’ unions — Reg Weaver, president of the National Education Association, and Toni Cortese, executive vice president of the American Federation of Teachers — told the committee that they would not support the bill in its current form and that they objected to a proposal to count student test scores in granting pay bonuses.Mr. Weaver’s testimony produced the sharpest exchange of the day, when Mr. Miller accused the unions of reneging on an earlier agreement to support the measure when it was incorporated into a 2005 bill proposed by Democrats and that was never adopted by Congress, which was then controlled by Republicans.But Mr. Weaver and Ms. Cortese disputed that account, saying that while they supported the 2005 bill over all, they had expressed concerns about any provisions that would mandate test scores be included in determining pay.'"
"'07-09-11,'1','Intel shares climbed in early trading yesterday, immediately after the report, but then declined 12 cents, to close at $25.35. Shares of A.M.D. rose 33 cents, or nearly 3 percent, to close at $12.94.Intel’s stock has rallied in recent months, from about $19 a share six months ago, and many investors say they believe that the company is reclaiming its technological leadership over A.M.D., which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif.After several consecutive quarters of losing market share, Intel in recent quarters has released a host of new multicore processors, including its first quad-core chip, while A.M.D. has suffered from pricing pressure and a short-term inventory glut. In July, A.M.D. reported a $600 million loss for the second quarter, its third loss in a row. The company is also still struggling to absorb ATI Technologies, the graphics chip maker it acquired last year for $5.6 billion.But A.M.D., which has lately been gaining back market share as it works off inventory, is banking that its latest server chip will help it return to profitability. The new chip uses so-called quad-core technology, where four processors are placed on one piece of silicon, allowing greater performance and energy efficiency. A.M.D. executives said yesterday that they expected the company to have a strong second half.Intel’s report and A.M.D.’s optimism appear to have somewhat quashed fears that widening problems in the housing market might damp purchases of large consumer products like home computers — at least for now.“There isn’t a lot of evidence that there’s been an impact on the computing market,” said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. “All the signs are the market is doing well.”Ashok Kumar, an analyst with the CRT Capital Group in San Francisco, agreed that the computer industry had not yet seen any fallout from the mortgage crisis, but he said the economic climate could make it hard to forecast sales later in the year. He said demand for notebook computers continued to be strong, particularly in emerging countries. Microprocessors used in notebooks have a higher average selling price than chips for desktop computers, so the impact on revenue is greater.Tom Beermann, an Intel spokesman, said the revised forecast was “based on what we’re seeing worldwide in terms of strength in revenues from chipsets and microprocessors,” but he would give no further details.Intel is scheduled to release its third-quarter report on Oct. 16.'"
"'07-09-11,'1','They have posted her personal e-mail address, phone numbers and street address online. One Canadian “9/11 debunker” surreptitiously taped a phone conversation with her, questioning her about the photo, and then uploaded it to his Web site.“It’s just gotten so bad, I’m just fed up with it,” Mrs. McClatchey said. “This thing has become too much of a distraction in my life. I have a husband and a new business to deal with, too.”The photo is considered legitimate by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Smithsonian Institution, which used the photo in an exhibition on Sept. 11; and the Flight 93 National Memorial, which has used the photo in pamphlets.“We have no reason to doubt it,” said Special Agent Bill Crowley, a spokesman for the Pittsburgh F.B.I. office, which oversaw evidence collection in Shanksville.Along with the rest of the nation, Mrs. McClatchey was watching the coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington when she was shaken from her couch by a blast just over a mile away. She grabbed her new digital camera and took just one picture from her front porch.The photo shows a sloping green farm field with a brilliant red barn in the foreground. Hovering above the barn in a brilliant blue sky is an ominous dark gray mushroom cloud. Mrs. McClatchey titled the photo “The End of Serenity.”Barbara Black, acting site manager for the Flight 93 memorial, said, “What makes the image so powerful is that it’s this serene scene in Pennsylvania, this typical red barn, green trees, and then this terrible cloud above it that changed our life here forever.”At the temporary memorial site, Flight 93 “ambassadors,” local residents who volunteer to tell visitors what happened here, always start the story by showing people Mrs. McClatchey’s photo.From the beginning, Mrs. McClatchey said, she tried to use the photograph to help remember the 40 passengers on Flight 93. She sells copies to people and lets them choose whether $18 of the $20 fee goes to the Flight 93 National Memorial or the Heroic Choices organization (formerly the Todd Beamer Foundation).To ensure that she controlled distribution of the photograph, in January 2002 she copyrighted it. To “protect the integrity of the photo,” Mrs. McClatchey said, she filed suit in 2005 against The Associated Press, saying that it violated her copyright by distributing the photo to its clients as part of an article. The lawsuit is pending.Mrs. McClatchey’s neighbors here defended her against the accusations of the people they called the “Internet crazies.”The McClatcheys “are as good neighbors as you could possibly have,” said Robert Musser, who owns the red barn that is so prominent in Mrs. McClatchey’s photo.To accommodate visitors who will show up on Sept. 11 to recreate the picture, and who eventually find their way to the Mussers’ 94-year-old barn, they have tried to spruce it up this past week, adding a touch of paint. They plan to spend thousands in the near future to shore up the foundation on one side so the barn will endure for years to come.“Here this barn could fall down, and it’s in the picture that’s so famous,” said Mr. Musser’s wife, Phyllis. “We have to do something.”'"
"'07-09-11,'1','One Bush administration official, declining to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue, said the deportation was “not necessarily the worst thing that could happen.” While the United States is loath to appear publicly as if it is interfering in Pakistan’s politics, the Bush administration has been urging General Musharraf to agree to a power-sharing deal with another former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto.The power-sharing pact was viewed within the Bush administration as a way to both shore up General Musharraf’s rapidly flagging support in Pakistan and stop him from exercising emergency powers, as hard-liners within his party have urged.A deal appeared close two weeks ago but stalled as some of General Musharraf’s backers in Pakistan balked at the idea, American and Pakistani officials said.The Bush administration official said that one hope now was that General Musharraf’s strong move against Mr. Sharif would enable him to stand up to Mr. Sharif’s allies in Pakistan and go ahead with the power-sharing deal.Mr. Sharif’s return had been expected to further upset Pakistan’s political scene and galvanize the political opposition, which has been led by a lawyers’ movement that has already declared General Musharraf’s continued rule unconstitutional. Without his presence, the opposition may center on the courts, rather than political rallies. In an interview during the flight from London, Mr. Sharif, the strongest opponent of military rule in Pakistan, had warned that he might be arrested. He nevertheless looked shocked as he was served with a warrant for his arrest on money laundering charges, and then was pushed and pulled by police officers and plainclothes intelligence officials through which the throng of his supporters and journalists who had accompanied him.“I am amazed by this fabricated case,” Mr. Sharif said as he was shoved through the crowd. “I’m amazed, I’m shocked.” Azhar Mahmud Qazi, a retired lieutenant colonel and a court official representing the National Accountability Bureau, which is the main corruption investigation body, said he served an arrest warrant on Mr. Sharif, charging him with money laundering. He said that the charges were the results of a three-year investigation surrounding a paper mill owned by Mr. Sharif, and that the amount involved was about $21 million.Government officials who arrested him said he would be sent to prison. But later, Tariq Azim Khan, the state minister for information, said Mr. Sharif, given a choice, had decided to go to Saudi Arabia instead.“While he was being taken to detention, he was offered, if he wanted, to avail the opportunity to go to Saudi Arabia as per the agreement,” Mr. Khan said. “He opted to go to Saudi Arabia. We arranged a special flight and he flew out of Islamabad.”Mr. Sharif’s lawyers condemned his arrest and deportation as illegal, and warned that the repercussions would be felt in the courts and across the country.“The whole episode was very unlawful and was a clear contempt of court,” said Amjad Malik, a British lawyer accompanying Mr. Sharif. “It is a violation of the law of Pakistan. It is a criminal offense to kidnap someone and take them out of the country.”He added, “It is a sad day — they have really treated the man contemptuously.”The court has found new independence under the recently reinstated Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, whom General Musharraf tried, and failed, to remove this year. “It is a spot on the Musharraf regime,” Mr. Malik said. “It shows they have not learnt.”The National Accountability Bureau had last week refused to issue an arrest warrant for Mr. Sharif, in view of the Supreme Court ruling, deciding instead that Mr. Sharif should be allowed to return and could then be called to attend a court hearing, Mr. Malik said.After Mr. Sharif arrived, lengthy negotiations finally succeeded in having the police withdrawn from around the plane. Mr. Sharif then emerged waving to the crowd and boarded a bus to the V.I.P. lounge in the airport terminal. There, before he passed through immigration, he was arrested and taken back out onto the airport tarmac an hour later.The government took stringent security measures before Mr. Sharif landed. Army rangers cordoned off the airport perimeter and stood on rooftops. The police closed down all traffic within a distance of four miles around the Islamabad airport and manned a series of five search points on each of the approach roads. Only passengers having tickets for domestic flights were allowed to pass through the barricades after boarding on special buses. No private vehicles were allowed inside the airport.Supporters of Mr. Sharif clashed with the police on the main Islamabad highway leading to the airport and in different parts of the nearby garrison town of Rawalpindi. Clashes were also reported in different cities across Punjab, the most populous province. The police used tear gas and baton charges to disperse the supporters.Mr. Sharif heads the All Parties Democratic Movement, a recently formed movement of opposition parties, which has called for a conference of all political parties to agree to an interim government and conditions for free and fair elections.He has criticized the prospect of a power-sharing deal between General Musharraf and Ms. Bhutto, which has largely been negotiated in secret, as proof of the lack of democracy in the country, and won quick support from a public weary of military rule, deteriorating law and order and rising prices.In an interview on the plane from London, Mr. Sharif said his mission was to get General Musharraf removed from power.“It’s a final battle now between dictatorship and democracy,” he said. “Civil society is there now struggling for the restoration of the rule of law. The judiciary is today independent. I think it is about time that we put an end to this menace of dictatorship because it had inflicted so much damage to my country.”He warned that any attempt by the government to prevent his return would amount to contempt of court. “Mr. Musharraf does not believe in the rule of law,” he said. “He tries to bulldoze everything that comes in his way.”He called on the Bush administration to stop propping up General Musharraf. “President Bush is somehow supporting an individual who today has become a symbol of hatred in Pakistan, a man whom everybody in Pakistan wants to get rid of,” he warned. “I don’t know why Mr. Bush is still supporting this man. He must not equate Pakistan with Mr. Musharraf. He should have his friendship with the people of Pakistan, not with an individual who is becoming more and more unpopular in the country.”He said he planned to mobilize public support to end General Musharraf’s rule in the same way that Chief Justice Chaudhry used countrywide rallies after he was suspended in March, finally winning back his job in July.'"
"'07-09-11,'1','Dog walking: good for you, good for your pet.Not so good for birds, apparently.Australian researchers have found that walking leashed dogs along woodland paths leads to a significant reduction in the number and diversity of birds in the area, at least over the short term.Peter B. Banks and Jessica V. Bryant of the University of New South Wales surveyed birds along woodland trails near Sydney shortly after dogs were walked on them or after people walked alone. All kinds of dogs were involved, big and small, purebred and mutt. As a control, they also surveyed birds on trails that no one, human or canine, had recently walked on.Dr. Banks said the study was an outgrowth of his interest in predator-prey interactions. “Here you have a predator that is being walked through the bush quite regularly,” he said.The researchers chose trails in places where dogs were banned and in other areas where dog walking was common, expecting different results in each. “We thought that where there was regular dog walking birds would get used to it,” Dr. Banks said. “Well, they didn’t.”Regardless of the type of area, dog walking led to a 35 percent reduction in the number of bird species and a 41 percent reduction in overall bird numbers, compared with the control. (People walking alone caused some disturbance, but less than half that caused by people with dogs.)The study, published in Biology Letters, provides support for park managers and others on the same side of what can be a heated debate over dogs in natural areas.'"
"'07-09-11,'1','At Sheri’s Ranch, a legal brothel about an hour’s ride outside of Vegas, the women have to respond like Pavlov’s dog to a bell that might ring at any hour of the day or night. It could be 4 a.m., and the woman might be sleeping. Or she might not be feeling well. Too bad.When that electronic bell rings, she has five minutes to get to the assembly area, a large room where she will line up with the other women, virtually naked, and submit to a humiliating inspection by any prospective customer who happens to drop by.“It’s not fun,” one of the women whispered to me during a tour of the brothel.The first thing to understand about prostitution, including legal prostitution, is that the element of coercion is almost always present. Despite the fiction that they are “independent contractors,” most so-called legal prostitutes have pimps — the state-sanctioned pimps who run the brothels and, in many cases, a second pimp who controls all other aspects of their lives (and takes the bulk of their legal earnings).They are hardly empowered. Years of studies have shown that most prostitutes are pushed into the trade in their early teens by grown men. A large percentage are victims of incest or other forms of childhood sexual abuse. Most are dirt poor. Many are drug-addicted. And most are plagued by devastatingly low levels of self esteem.And then there are the armies of women and girls who are trafficked into the sex trade by organized criminals, both inside and outside of the U.S.That a city, a state or any other governmental entity in the U.S. could legally sanction the sexual degradation of women and girls under any circumstances, much less those who are so extremely vulnerable, is an atrocity. And if you don’t think legalized prostitution is about degradation, consider the “date room” at Sheri’s. That’s a small room where a quiet dinner for two can be served. Beneath the tiny table is a couple of towels and a cushion for the woman to kneel on.The only one empowered in that situation is the john.Mayor Goodman’s concept of magnificence notwithstanding, Nevada’s legal brothels are not nice places. “The only place I’ve ever had a gun pulled on me was in a legal brothel,” said Melissa Farley, a psychologist and researcher who has studied the sex trade in Nevada for the past two and a half years.Ms. Farley, who is in her 60s and has the demeanor of a college professor, was threatened at gunpoint by a legal pimp who didn’t like her attitude. “I tried to change the look on my face in a hurry,” she said.Any honest investigation of the facts, as opposed to abstract theories, of prostitution — in any form — would reveal a horror show. That’s why the authorities in so many other countries that have given an official green light to prostitution, including Germany and the Netherlands, have been revisiting their policies.Legal prostitution tends to increase, not decrease, illegal prostitution, in part by creating a friendlier climate for demand. It tends to increase, not decrease, sex trafficking. And the recent explosion of prostitution in all its forms promotes the sexualization of girls at ever younger ages.Oscar Goodman should be viewed as a wake-up call. As a society, we should be offering help to the many thousands of women who would like to escape prostitution, and providing alternatives to those in danger of being pulled into it.'"
"'07-09-11,'1','The same talk was embedded in a 2003 play, also called “Trumbo,” in which Mr. Askin and Mr. Trumbo had Ed Harris, Nathan Lane, Chris Cooper, Tim Robbins and other actors taking turns during the run playing the lead role, which mostly involved reading from Dalton Trumbo’s remarkably stage-ready personal letters.Having moved those words to the beginning of their documentary — which includes interviews and clips, along with readings by Mr. Strathairn and Mr. Lane, as well as others like Michael Douglas, Joan Allen, Liam Neeson and Paul Giamatti — the director and writer, in effect, declare peace, and clear the way for a look at a beleaguered human being in all of his messy contradictions. (Produced by Safehouse Pictures and Filbert Step Productions, the film isn’t yet set for commercial distribution.)“Things are still hotter than they ever needed to be,” Christopher Trumbo said of Hollywood’s obsession with the blacklist.“As human beings, we tend to personalize things,” Mr. Trumbo noted, speaking by phone on Saturday from his Ojai, Calif., home. “It becomes Hitler rather than Fascism.”Dalton Trumbo, of course, personalized plenty at the time. One of 10 who were jailed for contempt for refusing to answer questions before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947, he and hundreds of others were barred from working openly for Hollywood for more than a decade. During years when he lost his beloved ranch in the Southern California mountains, lived in Mexican exile and worked under assumed names, he wrote letters of deep gratitude to those who supported him, like the producer Sam Zimbalist (“Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”), and freely excoriated those who did not.Among his detractors, those who contributed to his fiscal crunch came in for the roughest drubbings. In one 1948 letter — read on screen by Mr. Giamatti — Trumbo, the impoverished screenwriter of “A Bill of Divorcement” and “A Guy Named Joe,” told an official at the local phone company:“When we Reds come into power, we are going to shoot merchants in the following order: (1) those who are greedy, and (2) those who are witty. Since you fall into both categories, it will be a sad story when we finally lay hands on you.”But over the long haul, his son said, Trumbo settled on the view that an evil committee had simply exposed the weakness of many around him.Both Mr. Askin and Christopher Trumbo are now distant enough from those events to marvel at traits for which Dalton Trumbo most likely would have been remembered, even if his joining the Communist Party in 1943 and subsequent refusal to testify about it had never become an issue.Most striking, for Mr. Askin, was his subject’s urge to memorialize his thoughts in hundreds of private letters that were written and rewritten to professional polish, most in a style that invites precisely the sort of declamation they have been receiving from some of Hollywood’s most skilled actors. (Some were collected in “Additional Dialogue: Letters of Dalton Trumbo, 1942-1962,” published by M. Evans & Company in 1970.)“He couldn’t wait to get to the mailbox to get the replies,” Mr. Askin said, describing Trumbo’s approach to correspondence in a recent phone interview. “He relished the duel.”Many of the letters exist only because their writer, who died in 1976, kept a huge cache of carbon copies. His son — who had two sisters, Melissa, known as Mitzi, and Nikola — said the file was an outgrowth of Trumbo’s insistence on precision in his many battles.“It’s hard to remember what you said 20 years ago, if they’re going to call you on it,” Mr. Trumbo said of his father. “Given his nature, people were always doing that.”More than a few letters deal with Trumbo’s relentless struggle to regain the good life in the years before his credits on “Spartacus” and “Exodus” in 1960 helped break the blacklist.If a yearning for days when he was reputedly Hollywood’s highest-paid writer seemed contradictory for a card-carrying Communist, that was no more puzzling, Christopher Trumbo said, than his father’s seemingly casual decision to join the party in the first place.“It came as a complete surprise to my mother,” said Mr. Trumbo, who is working on a book about the blacklist. “They had talked about it and decided not to join.”Asked why Hollywood has often seemed less inclined than his father to set aside past sins, Mr. Trumbo said it was because so many were complicit in shutting out the relative few who were actually denied work for their political stance.“People feel guilty about it,” he said. “I think it’s because essentially the community itself recognized that it didn’t have to happen. And they let it happen.”'"

"'07-09-12,'0','Though the dollar had been falling against foreign currencies for much of the year, it has weakened significantly since Friday, when a government report showed that businesses reduced net employment by 4,000 in August. Now, investors widely expect that the Federal Reserve will cut its key short-term interest rate, now at 5.25 percent, when it meets next week. Some think that policy makers will cut the rate by as much as half a percentage point.“The payroll report was seen as a macro economic justification or the coup de grâce for expectations of a rate cut next week,” said Ashraf Laidi, chief foreign currency analyst at CMC Markets in New York.Currencies are influenced by a number of factors, chief among those are expectations for interest rates and inflation. If interest rates were indeed to fall in the United States and remain unchanged in Europe, as many investors are expecting, markets are likely to bid up the price of euros.The dollar has also been falling against the British pound and the Canadian and Australian dollars. The Japanese yen is up about 4 percent against the dollar for the year, though it has lost some ground in the last few days.The weakening dollar will be a boon to exporters whose goods and services will become more competitive on the world market. Exports have been one of the brightest spots in the American economy this year, growing at an annual pace of about 11.3 percent while imports have been growing at about 4.6 percent.Conversely, the depreciating dollar will make imports more expensive. Many investors believe energy commodities will be among those things.Already near records that it set just two months ago, oil prices have surged in recent weeks. The decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Tuesday to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day, a relatively small amount when compared to total production, appeared to make little difference. Analysts said that was largely because global demand for energy led by the fast-growing economies of China and India is growing far faster than overall production, especially among oil producers that are not members of OPEC.“The combination of robust long-term demand growth and lagging non-OPEC supply suggests that strong support for oil prices is set to remain a feature of the markets beyond 2010,” Adam Sieminski, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a research note.'"
"'07-09-12,'0','TOKYO, Wednesday, Sept. 12 — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan announced today that he would resign, ending a year-old government that has suffered a string of damaging scandals and a humiliating electoral defeat.Mr. Abe, whose support rating has fallen to 30 percent, cited the defeat of the governing Liberal Democratic Party in July 29 elections for the upper house of Parliament, and said he had instructed party leaders to search for a new premier. The L.D.P. still controls the more powerful lower house, which chooses the prime minister. “The people need a leader whom they can support and trust,” he said.He did not announce a date for his departure from office.Mr. Abe, 52, a nationalist who entered office as the youngest postwar premier, was facing a battle in Parliament over his efforts to extend Japan’s refueling mission in support of the American-led operation in Afghanistan.His resignation is a rapid fall from power for a prime minister who came into office a year ago with ambitious plans to repair frayed relations with Asian neighbors, revise the 1947 pacifist Constitution, and bolster Japan’s role in international diplomatic and military affairs.Mr. Abe initially met with success, but a string of scandals starting late last year quickly eroded his support. Four cabinet minister were forced to resign over the past nine months. His first agriculture minister committed suicide over a money scandal.'"

I was like, ‘Wow! this is great.’ ”The six-day, 600-mile race started on Kansas City’s Country Club Plaza, where fans applauded cycling heavyweights including Contador and the American Levi Leipheimer, who had to pause for several minutes early in the race to replace a chain.For their Discovery Channel team that has dominated international cycling for almost a decade and won eight of nine Tour de France titles, the race will be the its last on American soil.Discovery will soon disband, and other teams are eager to welcome its riders.In every town, spectators lined the roads, many holding signs greeting the riders and thanking them for coming to Missouri. In one town, excited youngsters spilled out of an elementary school just as the pack sped past.Dominguez said he thought he was finished when his legs began cramping.“Coming to that back stretch, I thought, ‘This climb is going to put a lot of guys in trouble,’ ” he said. “I was one of those guys.

"'07-09-12,'0','Still, while yesterday’s vote made it less likely that there would be drastic restrictions on the use of the drugs in kidney patients, the levels of use are unlikely to return to those common before the safety concerns took hold. Even while rejecting the F.D.A.’s proposed ceiling, most panel members recommended a treatment target lower than what some dialysis clinics and kidney specialists previously used.Moreover, the F.D.A. said it was proposing to remove assertions on labels that the drugs improved the quality of life for patients, saying the data to support such claims was inadequate. Amgen has proposed keeping some, but not all, the claims. The committee was not asked to vote on the matter.The panel’s outcome was “not as benign as the initial vote,” Jim Birchenough, a Lehman Brothers analyst, wrote in a note to clients.The drug most affected by the committee’s vote was Epogen, an Amgen medication used to treat nearly all the roughly 350,000 dialysis patients in the United States. It had sales of $2.5 billion last year.Johnson & Johnson sells the same drug under license as Procrit. Both Procrit and another Amgen drug called Aranesp are used primarily to treat cancer patients and kidney disease patients who are not undergoing dialysis.Yesterday’s panel, which met in Gaithersburg, Md., was far easier on Amgen than one in May that considered the safety of the drugs for use by cancer patients. After that meeting, Medicare sharply reduced its reimbursement for cancer use. The Medicare action resulted in a drop in sales that contributed to Amgen’s decision last month to cut its work force by 12 to 14 percent.The drugs work by raising the level of the body’s red blood cells, which carry oxygen to tissues. Epogen, first approved for dialysis patients in 1989, has become a mainstay for such patients.But safety issues arose when researchers tried to use the drugs not merely to correct severe anemia but also to try to raise kidney patients’ levels of hemoglobin — the oxygen-carrying component of red cells — to 13.5 or 14 grams for each deciliter of blood, nearly the level of a healthy person.Two clinical trials, one in dialysis and one in predialysis patients, showed that patients given additional quantities of the drugs to raise their hemoglobin to those levels suffered more heart problems and deaths than those treated with a hemoglobin goal of 10 or 11 grams a deciliter.In March, the F.D.A. changed the labels to say that the drugs should be used as sparingly as necessary to avoid blood transfusions and that hemoglobin levels should not exceed 12 grams a deciliter.But yesterday it proposed setting an upper target of about 11. The committee — in two 14-to-5 votes, one for dialysis and one for predialysis patents — rejected that idea, saying somewhat more flexibility was needed.Malazia Y. Scott, a kidney patient from Tuscaloosa, Ala., the patient representative on the panel, said, “At 11, I’m not in the bed, but I think most of the day is spent in bed.”Some panel members favored a range of 10 to 12 grams, which had also been proposed by Amgen. Still, that was lower than the 11-to-13 range that had been suggested by some kidney treatment guidelines.Many panel members said there was not enough data to distinguish the effects of 11 grams compared with 12 grams.The committee’s chairman, Dr. Richard Platt, decried the lack of data, saying it was “extraordinary” that 18 years after Epogen was first approved, doctors still did not know how to best use the drugs. He said the drugs’ developers should have conducted more thorough clinical trials.“As individuals and society,” said Dr. Platt, a professor at Harvard Medical School, “we should demand much better evidence much earlier on. We are in a very difficult situation here being asked to advise in the absence of data.”'"
"'07-09-12,'0','A judge threw the company’s case out, finding any fault was Entergy’s; the utility is appealing. But before the case against Mr. Seeber was dismissed, Judge Kearn A. Reese of state Civil Court ordered Mr. Seeber to make no mention of the injury case to anyone at Entergy except for two lawyers he designated.In his role as a self-styled consumer advocate, Mr. Seeber later sent a 400-page report to Mr. Leonard, contending that Entergy had filed fraudulent financial statements for two decades. (Yolanda Pollard, an Entergy spokeswoman, said the company conducted a thorough internal investigation and determined the fraud allegations were nothing but “propaganda.” Marcus V. Brown, a lawyer for Entergy, said the company never told Mr. Seeber about its findings because “we aren’t required to.”)On Monday, Mr. Brown established that in the 400-page report, there were passing mentions of the injury case on Pages 205 and 209. Entergy asked for a 45-day jail sentence as punishment for contempt of court.Judge Reece sentenced Mr. Seeber to 30 days on Tuesday but suspended all but 7 because Mr. Seeber showed that he had tried to remove references to the injury case from his report and that the two passing mentions were inadvertent.The judge said he would waive any jail time provided Mr. Seeber wrote a letter of apology to Mr. Leonard and other Entergy officials. He said the letter, due at noon Thursday, had to be acceptable to the court.Mr. Seeber’s lawyer, Philip C. Ciaccio Jr., asked whether Mr. Seeber would be allowed to revise his letter if the judge found it unacceptable.Mr. Seeber said in an interview later that he would write a letter apologizing for making any mention of the injury case in his report but that he would not apologize for raising the fraud allegations. He fears that unless he does so, Judge Reece will order him to jail.Mr. Ciaccio said that Judge Reece may not even have jurisdiction in the matter because Mr. Seeber won a summary judgment finding that he bore no responsibility in the 1996 injury case.Judge Reece said he agreed. But, the judge added, because Entergy is appealing that summary dismissal, and a decision has not been issued, he saw no reason to delay jailing Mr. Seeber if he deems his apology letter unacceptable.Court rules require people in litigation to deal directly with each other’s lawyers and not to independently approach people on the other side.Mr. Seeber said he was unaware of this when he represented himself initially. He said that after he hired lawyers and they explained the rule to him, he sought to comply. He said that he also understood that Judge Reece had said the order did not apply to his auditing business and the necessity of contacting Entergy about his audits and his suspicions of fraud, a point the judge confirmed during his remarks on Tuesday.Mr. Brown, the Entergy lawyer, elicited testimony from two TriStem employees that they reviewed the 400-page report and were instructed by Mr. Seeber to make sure all references to the injury case were removed.Lisa Pibil, Mr. Seeber’s office manager, held up the document, showing where one paragraph had been cut out with a knife. She said she neglected to review a compact disc that was included in the report, which contained the two passing references to the injury case.Repeatedly, Mr. Brown said that Mr. Seeber should have personally reviewed the report to make sure his instructions were followed and should not have assigned the job to subordinates.Judge Reece agreed. The judge said that “inadvertent error” was not an excuse because “when you are the captain of the ship, you are responsible for everything that happens to the ship.”Entergy no longer has the contract with the city. A visit to the site of the 1996 accident on Tuesday showed a corroded base where the pole was and a tangle of electrical wires coming out of the underground conduit, splayed on the sidewalk in front of the hospital. The 227-volt wires, wrapped in black tape, had electricity flowing through them, a voltmeter test showed.'"
"'07-09-12,'0','There will also be a premiere event next Wednesday, at which stars of the five CBS Monday series are to share the red carpet with the CTS. And a cast member of “C.S.I.: Miami,” Adam Rodriguez, will be paired with a CTS in five promotional spots to be interspersed among the premiere episodes of the CBS Monday shows on Sept. 24.The campaign, which has about as many facets as a Tiffany diamond, indicates what automakers and networks now believe is required to break through the clutter each fall, when the new automotive model year and the new TV season arrive simultaneously.The introduction of the redesigned CTS is “a very important launch for Cadillac,” said Liz Vanzura, global marketing director at Cadillac in Detroit, “and we’re searching for ways to get the word out, especially nontraditional ways that go beyond a 30-second TV spot.”TV spots, created by Modernista, are also part of the campaign, however. Several CTS commercials will make their debut on CBS on Sept. 24. Still, the emphasis is on unconventional methods to reach consumers, especially as potential car buyers spend so much time online weighing their choices.“With all the media fragmentation nowadays, the thought was, ‘How can we go beyond the typical?’ ” Ms. Vanzura said. “We’re experimenting with a lot of different media outlets to find the best way to reach our customers.”In addition to the CBS effort, Cadillac is developing unusual promotions for the CTS with the BET cable network, owned by Viacom; the FX cable network, owned by the News Corporation; msn.com, part of the Microsoft Corporation; and the Yahoo Web site. For instance, CTS sponsored a commercial-free presentation of the first episode of “Damages,” a new series on FX.The partnership with CBS is, however, the most intricate of the CTS introductory efforts. Although neither Cadillac nor CBS will discuss the budget, Cadillac has recently intensified its relationship with CBS, according to data from an ad-tracking service, the TNS Media Intelligence division of Taylor Nelson Sofres.During the first half of 2006, Cadillac spent $5.2 million to advertise on CBS, TNS reported, while for the first half of this year its spending rose 223 percent, to $16.8 million.Similarly, the CTS campaign is “the biggest automotive promotion we’ve done,” said George F. Schweitzer, president at the CBS Marketing Group unit of CBS in New York, “and the first time we’ve worked with one advertiser to launch a night.”There were several reasons, he added, for selecting the CBS Monday lineup, which in addition to “C.S.I.: Miami” is composed of four sitcoms: “How I Met Your Mother,” “The Big Bang Theory,” “Two and a Half Men” and “Rules of Engagement.”One reason, Mr. Schweitzer said, is the high profile of the Monday shows, which earn Nielsen ratings that are among the highest CBS draws all week. Another reason he offered was that the Monday shows have a considerable number of affluent viewers; “Two and a Half Men” is first among all CBS series in upscale viewers ages 25 to 54, he said.The CTS campaign is among several from CBS in a nontraditional vein. For example, for a new Tuesday drama, “Cane,” CBS ran an ad in Rolling Stone magazine with a “peel and taste” strip for Lucia Duque Gold, the fictional rum made by the show’s characters. There is a group on facebook.com to promote “How I Met Your Mother.” And for “The Big Bang Theory,” the sole new series among the five on Monday, CBS teamed up with a company named Laundromedia to wrap washers and dryers in laundry centers with billboards.The ardor among Mr. Schweitzer for offbeat promotions was underlined last week when CBS agreed to acquire SignStorey, which operates digital video displays in supermarkets that play programming and advertising.“Our philosophy is to push our product out to as many eyeballs as we can,” Mr. Schweitzer said, invoking the network’s familiar logo.To network promotional experts like Mr. Schweitzer, it must be frustrating to have to spend so much time and money on attracting viewers in a YouTube world where amateurs spend nothing to lure huge audiences to wacky do-it-yourself video clips.“Is it daunting to compete with the skateboarding dog? Absolutely,” Mr. Schweitzer said, adding: “The good thing is that people still dig entertainment marketing and want to know what shows are coming. They treat it as program information, not like an ad.”'"
"'07-09-12,'0','In Baghdad, Iraq’s deputy health minister, Dr. Adel Mohsin, said that he was not aware of any cases on the Diyala border. But he said that further spread of the epidemic was “very likely” unless government agencies followed strict guidelines on water testing and maintaining sufficient levels of chlorination, which kills the bacteria.In a chilling reminder of how difficult it may be to maintain those levels, Dr. Mohsin said that chlorine imports had been severely curtailed as a result of recent insurgent bombs that had been laced with chlorine, which in concentrated form can be deadly.Dr. Hakki, of the Red Crescent, said that shallow wells contaminated by sewage around Sulaimaniya — which had at least two cholera outbreaks in the decades before the American-led invasion in 2003 — could have set off the epidemic. But problems that have developed since the invasion, like poor control of chlorination levels, have the potential to make this outbreak more dangerous, he said.“If the water has low chlorination, Vibrio cholerae will go through the central supply,” Dr. Hakki said, and the disease will spread “like a fire in a haystack.”Dr. Burhan Omar, deputy director of Kirkuk General Hospital, said that because of such problems, water purification plants themselves could be contaminated with the bacteria. Those plants, in turn, can “bring the disease from the northern parts to the middle and southern parts of Iraq.”In fact, if those plants are contaminated, the epidemic could hopscotch all the way to Basra, in the south, Dr. Omar said.Cholera is caused by infection of the intestine with the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. The infection can be mild or even have no symptoms, but about one in 20 infected people become extremely ill, with profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps. Without treatment, rapid loss of body fluids causes dehydration and shock, and a person can die within hours.Cholera does not usually spread directly from person to person, so casual contact with infected people is not risky, and quarantine is not necessary. But household members, who have closer contact, may contract it, and can sometimes avoid getting sick by taking the antibiotic tetracycline.People contract cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the bacteria, which comes from the feces of an infected person. Exposure to raw sewage and contaminated, untreated drinking water can cause epidemics. If treated water is not available, boiling will kill the bacteria. During epidemics, people need to avoid raw vegetables.The major human displacement caused by the Iraq conflict — people being driven from their homes or simply choosing to leave — is likely to be driving the epidemic, officials say.Fadela Chaib, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, said: “Frankly speaking, it’s possible that cholera will spread to neighboring provinces and even to Baghdad, because there is a lot of people movement. People can be carrying the bacteria in their bodies and show no symptoms, and the bacteria can stay in the body for 7 to 14 days and be shed, potentially contaminating other individuals.”She said the health organization had sent two truckloads of medical supplies to Erbil, in the north, including oral rehydration salts and intravenous fluids. The group is also testing water samples for contamination and helping the local government to distribute pamphlets and posters urging people to wash their hands and purify their water by boiling it or adding chlorine tablets to kill the bacteria.Although there are vaccines to prevent cholera, Ms. Chaib said they were “not efficient,” and the health organization did not provide them or recommend them, preferring to emphasize hygiene, clean drinking water, sanitation and education.Ms. Chaib said that health organization personnel were working in the north and that “it may be more easy for them to be in the north than in Baghdad, for example, because the situation in the north is more manageable than in the rest of the country.”Should cholera break out in Baghdad, it would be far more difficult to send in health workers and protect them.'"

"'07-09-12,'0','BEIJING, Sept. 11 (AP) — China’s monthly inflation surged to an 11-year high in August and the trade surplus grew, according to reports released here Tuesday, adding to pressure on the authorities to increase interest rates and slow the sizzling economy.The National Bureau of Statistics said prices rose 6.5 percent, driven by a 49 percent jump in the cost of pork and other meat from the month a year earlier.The trade surplus widened by 33 percent over August 2006, to $24.97 billion, the second-highest monthly level on record, the General Administration of Customs reported.This latest increase in the trade imbalance could add to pressure from the United States on the Beijing authorities to ease controls that critics say keep the Chinese currency, the yuan, undervalued, adding to the surplus. The Senate is already considering two measures that would impose sanctions if Beijing failed to take such action.China ran a $15 billion trade surplus with the United States in August, according to the customs figures. Exports to the United States rose 16.7 percent, to $20.9 billion; imports of American goods increased 15.5 percent, to $5.9 billion.'"
"'07-09-12,'0','Government ministers continued to say that Mr. Sharif had chosen to be deported rather than go to prison on charges of money laundering. They said he had agreed to fulfill an earlier agreement, in 2000, to go into exile in Saudi Arabia for 10 years in return for having a life sentence commuted.But Mr. Sharif’s lawyer, Fakhruddin Ebrahim, said he was deported illegally, especially in view of the recent Supreme Court ruling that said he should be allowed to return and remain in Pakistan.“He was abducted and forcibly deported,” Mr. Ebrahim said. “The government is a party to the abduction and has flouted the constitution and the Supreme Court.”Mr. Ebrahim filed two petitions on Mr. Sharif’s behalf at the Supreme Court, one for contempt of court and one to request that the court order the government to bring Mr. Sharif back to Pakistan so he could appear before the court and give his version of events.The chief justice said he would examine the petitions in two days after a detailed judgment from a previous hearing on the case was finished, Mr. Ebrahim said.Hamza Sharif, the nephew of the exiled former leader, said the government version, reiterated by Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, was a “blatant lie.” Mr. Sharif was marched on to a plane and told he was being flown to Karachi, the largest city, or Quetta, near the Afghan border, and was told midflight that he was actually being taken to Saudi Arabia, he said.“He never wanted to leave this country,” he said of his uncle. He said he had talked twice to his uncle and that on Tuesday he was in high spirits. He will remain in Saudi Arabia for the meantime in the hope that the government will be forced to bring him before the Supreme Court.Javed Hashmi, a vice president of Mr. Sharif’s party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, said the plane carrying Mr. Sharif was logged at the Islamabad airport as going to Quetta.But Mr. Sharif was told he was being taken to Karachi to appear before a court there. After an hour and a half, by which time the plane should have landed, he was told he was being taken to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hashmi said.Mr. Hashmi, a member of Parliament and a vocal opponent of General Musharraf, was placed under house arrest in his parliamentary lodgings on Sunday night, as were several leading members of the opposition parties. Mr. Hashmi was recently released after eight years in prison for his opposition. His daughter, also a legislator, was arrested too, but later released, he said.The opposition politicians detained were all members of the All Parties Democratic Movement, formed in July by Mr. Sharif to fight General Musharraf’s continued rule. They were all planning to go to the airport to greet Mr. Sharif on Monday morning and were either put under guard at their residences, or arrested at police checkpoints on the way to the airport.Hundreds of political activists have been detained for one month under a public maintenance order, but a few of them were released by Tuesday.The information secretary of Mr. Sharif’s party, Ahsan Iqbal, was transferred for one month to a jail in the southern town of Bahawalpur, said his son, Mohammed Iqbal.Liaqat Baloch, deputy leader of the coalition of religious parties, the Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal, was also placed under guard at his lodgings, but the police allowed journalists to see him. “At this stage, Musharraf is afraid of the political movement,” he said.'"
"'07-09-12,'0','FIFTY years ago this week, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a law providing voting protections for blacks known as the Civil Rights Act of 1957. While that act is hardly as well remembered as the landmark laws of the 1960s, it’s not because it wasn’t important: at the time, it had been 82 years since any federal civil rights legislation had been passed because a coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans had consistently blocked progress.What happened to break that logjam has been largely lost to history. Eisenhower complained in 1967 that if his critics felt “there was anything good done” in his presidency, “they mostly want to prove that it was somebody else that did it and that I went along as a passenger.” That has been especially true of his championship of civil rights.The “somebody else” in this instance was Lyndon B. Johnson, who in 1957 was the Senate’s Democratic majority leader. Historians have consistently credited Johnson for the bill’s passage. Yes, Johnson played a role, but hardly the one his advocates might imagine: Eisenhower and his attorney general, Herbert Brownell Jr., first proposed strong legislation, and it was Johnson and his Southern cronies who weakened it beyond recognition.Johnson wanted a cosmetic bill that would enhance his presidential ambitions without alienating his white Southern base. It was a balancing act, as even a weak bill depended on Eisenhower’s new legislative coalition, which formed after he persuaded the Republicans to abandon their longtime opposition to civil rights legislation. (Republicans provided 37 of the 60 yes votes when the final bill passed the Senate.)The Eisenhower proposal had four main parts. The first two — the creation of a civil rights commission to investigate voting irregularities and a civil rights division in the Justice Department — survive to this day. The other two pillars, unfortunately, became victims of politics. Part 3 proposed to grant the attorney general unprecedented authority to file suits to protect broad constitutional rights, including school desegregation. Part 4 provided for federal civil suits to prosecute voting rights violations.Senator Richard Russell of Georgia led the attack on Part 3, accusing the attorney general of conspiring “to destroy the system of separation of the races in the Southern states at the point of a bayonet.” Johnson eventually told Eisenhower he had the votes to kill the entire bill unless the president dropped Part 3. Eisenhower reluctantly capitulated.'"

Untreated mental illnesses can cause disabling and sometimes dangerous symptoms. And a lack of treatment during a critical period of learning and growth can have long-term effects on a child’s future and cause trauma to families.Parents should insist on a comprehensive evaluation by a doctor, such as a child and adolescent psychiatrist.

"'07-09-12,'0','The high costs and concerns about reliability, however, have been the biggest forces behind the shift away from tests on animals. Industry executives say that as much as 25 percent of the drugs tested on animals failed to show side effects that later proved serious enough to prevent the drugs from being marketed. To avoid such mistakes, companies often test products on multiple species and large numbers of animals.Concern about the costs and questionable benefits of animal testing has been growing since the 1970s, and the number of lab animals sacrificed in the United States has fallen since then by nearly 50 percent among the species tracked by the Department of Agriculture; the total was 1.18 million in 2005, the last year for which numbers have been reported. The government’s statistics are limited to cats, dogs, primates and a few other species and do not cover birds or fish, or the most common lab animals, mice and rats.“It’s hard to say whether the overall numbers are down or up,” said Martin Stephens, vice president of animal research issues at the Humane Society of the United States.Developing the alternative methods has turned out to be daunting partly because it takes years of testing to satisfy users and regulators that the results are as accurate or better than animal trials. Many researchers believe the caution is justified.David B. Warheit, who oversees research at DuPont on the potential hazards of new nanoscale materials, cited his own experience as an example. Nanoscale particles, so-named because they are measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter, are so tiny they can slip easily inside cells. That might pose novel hazards, and some reported tests of carbon nanoparticles, called fullerenes, had shown alarmingly that they killed various human cell samples in test tubes.But when DuPont researchers injected the fullerenes into the lungs of rats, the animals’ immune systems apparently removed them before any lasting damage was done. For various reasons, Mr. Warheit said, he believes the live-rat studies produced a more accurate reading on the risks than the test-tube experiments did.Still, in-vitro tests using human cells have been making headway. Analysts estimate that businesses spent $716 million last year for contract research at labs that specialize in such alternative techniques.The field is crowded with start-up companies like MatTek, Admet and Xceleron. MatTek, a small company in Ashland, Mass., grows human tissues for testing from donor cells. The tissues take up to four weeks to grow in the test kits in which they are shipped, said John Sheasgreen, the company’s president. Up to three types of cells might be combined in a single tissue to produce realistic behavior, he said.Admet owns In Vitro Laboratories, which charges up to $20,000 to screen a drug against liver cells and other human tissues for toxic effects. To get the same information from animals, a drug company would have to use much more of the drug, wait a lot longer and pay for the upkeep and eventual autopsies of the animals it used, said Albert P. Li, chairman of Admet. “We’re not making a huge profit,” he added, “but we’re making a living.”Charles River Laboratories, the world’s largest supplier of genetically engineered rodents for labs, also has a subsidiary called Endosafe, which provides an alternative to the testing of solutions in rabbits’ eyes for contamination with fever-producing bacteria. The test, which can be as cheap as $5, has not only replaced most rabbit testing in quality-control rooms at drug company factories but is also finding a market at dialysis centers as a check on water quality, the company said.“We are the fastest-growing division in Charles River with the highest margins,” said Foster Jordan, head of Endosafe. “There’s a business incentive to push this.”Other small companies, like Entelos, in Foster City, Calif., supply computer simulation programs for virtual testing. Such software incorporates hundreds of variables to simulate how humans who suffer from conditions like asthma, obesity or Type 1 or 2 diabetes will react to a new drug.But in many ways the alternatives are driven by a few giants eager to move from animal testing for scientific, business and image reasons. Procter & Gamble has spent $225 million developing and deploying alternative testing methods for a wide range of personal-care and pet food products over the last 20 years, said Len Sauers, the executive who oversees the work.And L’Oréal, the French cosmetics giant, says it has spent more than $800 million over the same period. That includes deals to buy Episkin and SkinEthic, two companies that make alternative tests.“This is not an area of competition for us,” said Patricia Pineau, L’Oréal Research’s spokeswoman, who said that its tissue testing products and services were sold at cost to other companies, including rivals like P.&G. and Unilever.Those cooperative impulses are being driven by European regulators, who have set 2009 as a deadline for all animal testing on cosmetics. Another push has come from European legislation, which requires companies to provide safety data for about 30,000 chemicals over the next 11 years. Estimates found that the program could require killing an additional 3.9 million animals, but regulators have responded by putting heavy pressure on industry to develop and validate alternatives.As a result, Mr. Stephens said, European regulators and industries have a 10-year lead in adopting alternatives in the United States, where there have been no similar government mandates to reduce animal testing. But American advocates who want to move from animal testing have been heartened by a recent study from the National Academy of Sciences, which was sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency.“The report says we now have the tools to look much more closely on how toxicity occurs, and that we have to do it on human cells,” said Rodger D. Curren, president of the Institute for In-Vitro Sciences, a nonprofit testing center in Gaithersburg, Md. The study concluded that over time, the use of animals for testing could be greatly reduced and possibly eliminated.'"

"'07-09-13,'1','The premise of our strategy is that securing the Iraqi population is the foundation for all other progress.For Iraqis to bridge sectarian divides, they need to feel safe in their homes and neighborhoods. For lasting reconciliation to take root, Iraqis must feel confident that they do not need sectarian gangs for security. The goal of the surge is to provide that security and to help prepare Iraqi forces to maintain it. As I will explain tonight, our success in meeting these objectives now allows us to begin bringing some of our troops home.Since the surge was announced in January, it has moved through several phases. First was the flow of additional troops into Iraq, especially Baghdad and Anbar province. Once these forces were in place, our commanders launched a series of offensive operations to drive terrorists and militias out of their strongholds. And finally, in areas that have been cleared, we are surging diplomatic and civilian resources to ensure that military progress is quickly followed up with real improvements in daily life.Anbar province is a good example of how our strategy is working. Last year, an intelligence report concluded that Anbar had been lost to al Qaeda. Some cited this report as evidence that we had failed in Iraq and should cut our losses and pull out. Instead, we kept the pressure on the terrorists. The local people were suffering under the Taliban-like rule of al Qaeda, and they were sick of it. So they asked us for help.To take advantage of this opportunity, I sent an additional 4,000 Marines to Anbar as part of the surge. Together, local sheikhs, Iraqi forces, and coalition troops drove the terrorists from the capital of Ramadi and other population centers. Today, a city where al Qaeda once planted its flag is beginning to return to normal. Anbar citizens who once feared beheading for talking to an American or Iraqi soldier now come forward to tell us where the terrorists are hiding. Young Sunnis who once joined the insurgency are now joining the army and police.And with the help of our Provincial Reconstruction Teams, new jobs are being created and local governments are meeting again.These developments do not often make the headlines, but they do make a difference. During my visit to Anbar on Labor Day, local Sunni leaders thanked me for America's support. They pledged they would never allow al Qaeda to return. And they told me they now see a place for their people in a democratic Iraq. The Sunni governor of Anbar Province put it this way: Our tomorrow starts today.The changes in Anbar show all Iraqis what becomes possible when extremists are driven out. They show al Qaeda that it cannot count on popular support, even in a province its leaders once declared their home base. And they show the world that ordinary people in the Middle East want the same things for their children that we want for ours -- a decent life and a peaceful future.In Anbar, the enemy remains active and deadly. Earlier today, one of the brave tribal sheikhs who helped lead the revolt against al Qaeda was murdered. In response, a fellow Sunni leader declared: We are determined to strike back and continue our work. And as they do, they can count on the continued support of the United States.Throughout Iraq, too many citizens are being killed by terrorists and death squads. And for most Iraqis, the quality of life is far from where it should be. Yet General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker report that the success in Anbar is beginning to be replicated in other parts of the country.One year ago, much of Baghdad was under siege. Schools were closed, markets were shuttered, and sectarian violence was spiraling out of control. Today, most of Baghdad's neighborhoods are being patrolled by coalition and Iraqi forces who live among the people they protect.Many schools and markets are reopening. Citizens are coming forward with vital intelligence. Sectarian killings are down, and ordinary life is beginning to return.One year ago, much of Diyala province was a sanctuary for al Qaeda and other extremist groups, and its capital of Baqubah was emerging as an al Qaeda stronghold. Today Baqubah is cleared. Diyala province is the site of a growing popular uprising against the extremists, and some local tribes are working alongside coalition and Iraqi forces to clear out the enemy and reclaim their communities.One year ago, Shi'a extremists and Iranian-backed militants were gaining strength and targeting Sunnis for assassination. Today these groups are being broken up, and many of their leaders are being captured or killed.These gains are a tribute to our military, they are a tribute to the courage of the Iraqi security forces, and they are the tribute to a -- an Iraqi government that has decided to take on the extremists.Now the Iraqi government must bring the same determination to achieving reconciliation. This is an enormous undertaking after more than three decades of tyranny and division. The government has not met its own legislative benchmarks, and in my meetings with Iraqi leaders, I have made it clear that they must.Yet Iraq's national leaders are getting some things done. For example, they have passed a budget. They are sharing oil revenues with the provinces. They are allowing former Ba'athists to rejoin Iraq's military or receive government pensions. Local reconciliation is taking place. The key now is to link this progress in the provinces to progress in Baghdad. As local politics change, so will national politics.Our troops in Iraq are performing brilliantly. Along with the Iraqi forces, they have captured or killed an average of more than 1,500 enemy fighters per month since January.Yet ultimately, the way forward depends on the ability of Iraqis to maintain security gains. According to General Petraeus and a panel chaired by retired General Jim Jones, the Iraqi army is becoming more capable, although there is still a great deal of work to be done to improve the national police. Iraqi forces are receiving increased cooperation from local populations, and this is improving their ability to hold areas that have been cleared.Because of this success, General Petraeus believes we have now reached the point where we can maintain our security gains with fewer American forces. He has recommended that we not replace about 2,200 Marines scheduled to leave Anbar province later this month; in addition, he says it will soon be possible to bring home an Army combat brigade; for a total force reduction of 5,700 troops by Christmas. And he expects that by July we will be able to reduce our troop levels in Iraq from 20 combat brigades to 15.General Petraeus also recommends that in December we begin transitioning to the next phase of our strategy in Iraq. As terrorists are defeated, civil society takes root and the Iraqis assume more control over their own security, our mission in Iraq will evolve. Over time, our troops will shift from leading operations, to partnering with Iraqi forces, and eventually to overwatching those forces. As this transition in our mission takes place, our troops will focus on a more limited set of tasks, including counterterrorism operations and training, equipping, and supporting Iraqi forces.I have consulted with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, other members of my national security team, Iraqi officials, and leaders of both parties in Congress.I have benefited from their advice and I have accepted General Petraeus's recommendations. I have directed General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to update their joint campaign plan for Iraq, so we can adjust our military and civilian resources accordingly. I have also directed them to deliver another report to Congress in March. At that time, they will provide a fresh assessment of the situation in Iraq and of the troop levels and resources we need to meet our national security objectives.The principle guiding my decisions on troop levels in Iraq is return on success. The more successful we are, the more American troops can return home. And in all we do, I will ensure that our commanders on the ground have the troops and flexibility they need to defeat the enemy.Americans want our country to be safe and our troops to begin coming home from Iraq. Yet those of us who believe success in Iraq is essential to our security, and those who believe we should bring our troops home, have been at odds. Now, because of the measure of success we are seeing in Iraq, we can begin seeing troops come home.The way forward I have described tonight makes it possible, for the first time in years, for people who have been on opposite sides of this difficult debate to come together.This vision for a reduced American presence also has the support of Iraqi leaders from all communities. At the same time, they understand that their success will require U.S. political, economic and security engagement that extends beyond my presidency. These Iraqi leaders have asked for an enduring relationship with America. And we are ready to begin building that relationship in a way that protects our interests in the region and requires many fewer American troops.The success of a free Iraq is critical to the security of the United States.A free Iraq will deny al Qaeda a safe haven. A free Iraq will counter the destructive ambitions of Iran. A free Iraq will marginalize extremists, unleash the talent of its people and be an anchor of stability in the region. A free Iraq will set an example for people across the Middle East. A free Iraq will be our partner in the fight against terror, and that will make us safer here at home.Realizing this vision will be difficult, but it is achievable. Our military commanders believe we can succeed. Our diplomats believe we can succeed. And for the safety of future generations of Americans, we must succeed.If we were to be driven out of Iraq, extremists of all strains would be emboldened. Al Qaeda could gain new recruits and new sanctuaries. Iran would benefit from the chaos and would be encouraged in its efforts to gain nuclear weapons and dominate the region. Extremists could control a key part of the global energy supply. Iraq could face a humanitarian nightmare. Democracy movements would be violently reversed. We would leave our children to face a far more dangerous world. And as we saw on September the 11th, 2001, those dangers can reach our cities and kill our people.Whatever political party you belong to, whatever your position on Iraq, we should be able to agree that America has a vital interest in preventing chaos and providing hope in the Middle East. We should be able to agree that we must defeat al Qaeda, counter Iran, help the Afghan government, work for peace in the Holy Land and strengthen our military, so we can prevail in the struggle against terrorists and extremists.So tonight I want to speak to members of the United States Congress. Let us come together on a policy of strength in the Middle East. I thank you for providing crucial funds and resources for our military, and I ask you to join me in supporting the recommendations General Petraeus has made and the troop levels he has asked for.To the Iraqi people: You have voted for freedom, and now you are liberating your country from terrorists and death squads. You must demand that your leaders make the tough choices needed to achieve reconciliation. As you do, have confidence that America does not abandon our friends, and we will not abandon you.To Iraq's neighbors who seek peace: The violent extremists who target Iraq are also targeting you. The best way to secure your interests and protect your own people is to stand with the people of Iraq. That means using your economic and diplomatic leverage to strengthen the government in Baghdad. And it means the efforts by Iran and Syria to undermine that government must end.To the international community: The success of a free Iraq matters to every civilized nation. We thank the 36 nations who have troops on the ground in Iraq and the many others who are helping that young democracy. We encourage all nations to help -- by implementing the international compact to revitalize Iraq's economy, by participating in the neighbors conferences to boost cooperation and overcome differences in the region, and by supporting the new and expanded mission of the United Nations in Iraq.To our military personnel, intelligence officers, diplomats and civilians on the frontlines in Iraq: You have done everything America has asked of you. And the progress I have reported tonight is in large part because of your courage and hard effort. You are serving far from home. Our nation is grateful for your sacrifices and the sacrifices of your families.Earlier this year, I received an e-mail from the family of Army Specialist Brandon Stout of Michigan. Brandon volunteered for the National Guard and was killed while serving in Baghdad.His family has suffered greatly. Yet in their sorrow, they see larger purpose. His wife, Audrey, says that Brandon felt called to serve and knew what he was fighting for. And his parents, Tracy and Jeff, wrote me this: We believe this is a war of good and evil, and we must win, even if it cost the life of our own son. Freedom is not free.This country is blessed to have Americans like Brandon Stout, who make extraordinary sacrifices to keep us safe from harm. They are doing so in a fight that is just, and right and necessary. And now it falls to us to finish the work they have begun.Some say the gains we are making in Iraq come too late. They are mistaken. It is never too late to deal a blow to al Qaeda. It is never too late to advance freedom. And it is never too late to support our troops in a fight they can win.'"

"'07-09-13,'1','This compelling, if morally wearying, story is told with a combination of sadism and brio on TMZ.com. The site not only breaks culturally significant news (the tirades — Mel Gibson’s anti-Semitic one and Michael Richards’s racist one — come to mind) but also attracts so much commentary that it has become a nationwide seminar on sociology. A consummate insider, TMZ is a collaboration between AOL and Telepictures Productions (both owned by Time Warner), yet it styles itself as indignant, even vengeful, about Hollywood’s wicked ways.“TMZ” the television show picks up where TMZ.com leaves off, embellishing and adorning the images with a thoroughness that still works best on fast-moving television.Much of what appears nightly on “TMZ” (shown on Fox and other stations) is timely, but still a rehash. After Britney Spears’s listless performance on MTV on Sunday night, for example, “TMZ” brought no new images, but merely contributed its own acid quips to the already deafening din. (She looked “like a circus pony shot up with horse tranquilizers,” the voice-over said. “I didn’t know they made stripperwear for Butterball turkeys.”)More significantly, “TMZ” uses zany graphics to turn videos into judge-jury-executioner cases against marginal personalities. They include Kirsten Storms of “General Hospital,” whose photograph is grotesquely animated to look as though she is blowing into a cartoon Breathalyzer, and Gary Dourdan of “CSI,” who as a hot-dog driver and apparent street enemy of the TMZ photographers, is baited into saying things that sound semistupid only after obscene amounts of editing. (Mr. Dourdan’s slurred pronunciation of his car’s model, “Charger,” say, is hardly a federal case; yet we hear it — slowed down to nonsense, recast as “Zsa-Zsa,” etc. — a half-dozen times.)Whatever his ideology, Mr. Levin has made pop art of evidentiary storytelling, in which scraps of video and audio are buffered with cartoony graphics that instruct viewers in how to decipher them. The words “allegedly” and “supposedly” can be heard in the narration, but rarely appear in the animation, much of which presents counterfactuals, cartoon images of people doing not just illegal or immoral things, but impossible things, like flying or bouncing on their heads.This is not a news show or a gossip show or a tabloid show. It’s horror and fantasy: the most recent volume in Mr. Levin’s far-out cosmology about demonic and extraterrestrial celebrities who feed on the souls of mortals.Yet another alumnus of the O. J. Simpson trial — he covered it as a legal analyst for KCBS-TV in Los Angeles — Mr. Levin appears to have learned heavy lessons from that trial. For one, like many hipster lawyers, he took the defense’s side in those heady days; now he nearly always sounds prosecutorial.Second, in a reputation-jeopardizing move, he once falsely accused Mr. Simpson’s prosecutor of a firing offense based on what he later excused as a misinterpretation of a video. These days, Mr. Levin prides himself on close attention to videos. He does not strut and bluster like the old Johnnie Cochran-F. Lee Bailey-Robert Shapiro band of lawyers. Instead, he appears to take his cues from Barry Scheck, the lawyer and DNA expert who is perhaps the only figure to emerge from the Simpson trial with his integrity intact. Mr. Levin presents himself as an affable detective: he attends to fine-grain details — the blurs on surveillance cams, the timers on videotape, the fine-print perks at celebrity preschools — to painstakingly build arguments.Each episode of “TMZ” so far has opened with Mr. Levin consulting with his underlings: he calls on them, and they report their photo findings. Typically, he’s thrilled. Michael Jackson’s father thrown out of a nightclub? Gold! Madonna buying a vibrator? Hilarious!This is a pleasant, inclusive way to introduce this morally dubious show: It makes you feel as though one day, with a little practice in his techniques, you could submit an incriminating video that Mr. Levin would find marvelous too. The underlings are also clearly not tabloid bottom-feeders. They’re an intelligent, witty, attractive group of young adults who look suspiciously as if they should be in college. Maybe that’s what TMZ now is.Produced by Harvey Levin Productions Inc., and paraMedia, Inc. in association with Telepictures Productions.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','This is all enjoyable, but almost immediately I began to think of the God of War games, which had similar epic story lines and similar melee combat.The God of War games showed a perfection rarely seen in video games, and as I played Heavenly Sword I kept noticing how it was so similar but fell short. Battles feel repetitive, button presses don’t always do what you expect, the music occasionally drowns out the dialogue, and Nariko’s hair blowing in the wind is a distraction; it looks like tendrils checking out the scenery. The story is uneven, with its best moments undercut by a plot that is at times poorly explained and internally inconsistent.The most interesting part of the game is what is least reminiscent of God of War: ranged combat. When firing an arrow or cannon ball, as you do once in a while, holding down a button lets you follow the projectile in slow motion, controlling its trajectory by tilting the PlayStation 3’s motion-sensitive controller. This allows for neat tricks like swerving an arrow into a torch and then into a barrel of gunpowder, creating a satisfying explosion. (The game does not explain what power allows you to do this.)The movement function of the controller has not been used well by many game makers since the PlayStation 3 was introduced, but Heavenly Sword shows that the controller can work nicely for guiding things through space.There is much else to recommend Heavenly Sword. The scenery is breathtaking, battles can be exciting, and the intelligent, cruel King Bohan — voiced brilliantly by Andy Serkis, who was the voice of Gollum in the “Lord of the Rings” movies — is one of the best video game villains ever. The game is frustrating because it seems as if it should have been a great game and as if its creators tried to make it a great game, but it managed to be only a pretty good one.While Heavenly Sword is an effort at a memorable epic, Stranglehold tries to be only a mindless action game with a lot of cool slow-motion sequences. In that it succeeds.Stranglehold is conceived as a sequel to the director John Woo’s 1992 movie “Hard Boiled,” and Mr. Woo is credited with shaping some of the game. As the story begins, a police officer’s death leads Inspector Tequila, voiced by the star of “Hard Boiled,” Chow Yun-Fat, to go on a rampage through Hong Kong with the mob as his target.The game manages to hit almost every action movie cliché, like the imperiled estranged daughter and the mob boss who fails to consider that if he invites the hero to his home for a shootout, the expensive furniture is going to end up as kindling. But Stranglehold hardly has a plot. The skeletal story exists so the police inspector can battle wave after wave of gun-toting bad guys.Stranglehold works hard to capture Mr. Woo’s cinematic violence. Jump onto a cart, and the game drops into slow motion as you roll through an alley firing your machine gun at attackers. Go into sniper mode and watch the bullet tear through your enemy in gory slow motion. The slow-motion device is highly reminiscent of the Max Payne games, also inspired by Mr. Woo’s films.Each time Inspector Tequila pulls off a stylish move like jumping off the wall and gunning down an opponent in midair, the player earns the ability to use special moves, the most powerful of them simply killing every visible attacker in a hail of bullets and doves (doves are apparently a Woo trademark).These big battles are occasionally interrupted by standoffs in which Inspector Tequila is surrounded by a handful of mobsters and must dodge bullets (in slow motion, of course) while firing. There are also places where you can take out enemies by shooting explosive barrels or props that support the platforms the enemies are standing on.Stranglehold can be a lot of fun, but there isn’t a lot to it. Four or five guys attack you. After you kill them, the doors fly open and some more guys run out. Kill them, and even more guys run out. Do that a few more times, then run into another room and repeat.With its hackneyed story, stylish action and Hong Kong setting, Stranglehold is most reminiscent of the 2003 martial arts game Rise to Honor, which is exactly the kind of game this new entry turns out to be: pleasant and forgettable. That’s fine; a game is better off being reminiscent of something vaguely pleasant than something almost perfect.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','Wait a minute — 160 gigs? That’s bigger than many computer hard drives. It’s enough to hold 40,000 songs, which would take about three solid months to play. If the battery could last that long, that is; Apple clocks the larger model at 40 hours of music playback, 7 hours of video. The smaller model gets 30 and 5 hours.Remember, the original 2001 iPod held 1,000 songs. At this rate of expansion, the iPod of 2010 will hold all six million songs on the iTunes store.The iPod Nano represents a far more radical redesign. The big change: it now plays video.Anybody familiar with the previous iPod Nano might wonder just how satisfying TV shows or movies would be on a screen the size of your thumbnail. The same thought must have occurred to Apple, because the new Nano has a much larger screen (two inches diagonal). With 320-by-240 pixels crammed into that space, it also has much finer resolution than the previous Nano — or indeed, than any Apple product in history — which makes video look incredibly sharp.Here’s the funny thing about physics, though: you can’t give something a bigger screen without actually making the thing itself bigger. So the Nano is wider and shorter than before.In photos, without any size reference, the result looks a little weird, slightly foreshortened; the rumor Web sites called it the Nano Fatty. Once you handle this iPod, though, you realize that that nickname is hilariously wrong; at a quarter of an inch thick, you could practically use the Nano as a letter opener.You just can’t conceive that anything this thin could contain a battery (good for 22 hours of audio playback), a screen and 4 or 8 gigabytes of memory (1,000 or 2,000 songs’ worth, for $150 or $200). You feel like you’re watching movies on a business card.With a $50 cable, the Nano can even play video on your TV. That’s surely a first for a machine the size of a Triscuit.You’d have to be a real Grinch to find fault with this sweet piece of engineering. But the headphone jack is on the bottom, so the Nano doesn’t sit level when you prop it up on a treadmill. And while the Nano’s face comes in five brushed-metal colors (is there an echo in here?), its back is now the same mirror-finish chrome as the larger iPods — and a fingerprint magnet.Both the Nano and the Classic come with three games, new illustrated menus and other software refinements.The most interesting iPod announcement of all last week, though, was the new iPod Touch, which will be available later this month.When the iPhone went on sale at the end of June, certain hackers tried to work around the AT&T contract requirement. They wanted the iPhone’s spectacular widescreen video playback, wireless Wi-Fi Internet features and its now-famous two-finger touchscreen operating system. They just didn’t want the phone.They needn’t have bothered. The new iPod Touch is exactly what they wanted: a dephoned iPhone.It looks almost identical to the iPhone, except much thinner (0.3 inches). It’s available in 8- and 16-gigabyte models, for $300 and $400.There’s the 3.5-inch touch screen; there’s the Home screen with tappable icons for Calendar, Clock and Calculator, Music, Videos and Photos. And there, praise be, is the Web browser.Yes, this iPod can surf the Internet, fast, in any wireless hot spot. All of the iPhone’s slick Web tricks are available: tap to open a link. Drag a finger to scroll. Double-tap to enlarge a page, pinch with two fingers to shrink it. Turn the machine 90 degrees to rotate the screen image.The YouTube viewer is here — and so, intriguingly, is an iTunes icon. For the first time, you can shop Apple’s music store wirelessly. You can browse or search the catalog, listen to 30-second samples, buy songs for $1 each — and download them directly to the iPod. When you return home, those songs are copied back to your Mac or PC. In fact, if the iPod’s download gets interrupted, your computer will download them automatically. It’s all smooth, speedy and satisfying.Now, as it set about slicing off the phone parts of the iPhone, Apple must have felt like a brain surgeon: you don’t want to cut too much.Some of the decisions were easy: since it’s not a cellphone, this iPod lacks a speaker, earpiece, SIM card, camera and Bluetooth. And since it can’t get online just anywhere, the Stocks, Maps, Weather and Mail programs are gone, too. (You can still easily access e-mail on the Web through services like Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo.)But the Apple scalpel may have slipped when it excised the volume buttons, which could be considered important controls on a music player. The earbuds have no iPhone-like clicker that pauses or switches songs, either. So the only way to pause, change songs or adjust the volume is to take the iPod out of your pocket and use two hands to summon the on-screen controls.In that regard, music playback is, oddly enough, the iPod Touch’s least successful feature. Meanwhile, though, TV and movies on the wide screen look spectacular. And having a full-blown Web-browsing machine in your pocket, with no monthly fee, is a tempting prospect indeed.Individually, Apple’s revamped 2007 iPod family members retain the simplicity that made their ancestors famous. As a group, though, the expanded lineup itself is more confusing; if you count the iPhone — now $400 instead of $600 — there are now five iPod models in 14 colors and various capacities. The key is to focus on what’s special about each one, like tiny size (Shuffle or Nano), storage (Classic), wireless Internet (Touch) or phone calling (iPhone).As usual, you’ll have to look elsewhere for players with a built-in radio, voice recorder or user-replaceable battery. Also as usual, you’ll have to pay Apple to replace aging batteries that no longer hold a charge: $86 for the Touch, $66 for the other iPods.Still, the iPods are the best players you can buy. Even if you’re one of those curmudgeonly bloggers who counts nothing but the specs, these iPods are nearly impossible to beat; there are other 160-gigabyte multimedia players, for example, but they’re much bigger and more expensive than the iPod Classic. And if you do value things like beauty, software elegance and trouble-free computer integration — well, good luck resisting that new Nano.So here they come, the new iPod family, all dressed up in their finest brushed metal and ready to set cash registers jingling. Merry Christmas!'"
"'07-09-13,'1','Greg Oden, the first player picked in the N.B.A. draft in June and the presumed savior of the Portland Trail Blazers, could miss his entire rookie season after undergoing surgery today on his right knee.Doctors discovered cartilage damage in the knee during exploratory surgery, and went on to perform a microfracture procedure meant to repair the damage and stimulate cartilage growth.Although that type of procedure has been linked to the sudden decline of several N.B.A. stars, notably Penny Hardaway, Chris Webber and Antonio McDyess, the Trail Blazers expressed optimism today about Oden’s prospects for recovery.“There are things about this that are positive for Greg,” said Dr. Don Roberts, the team physician, who performed the surgery. “First of all, he is young. The area where the damage was is small. And the rest of his knee looked normal. All those are good signs for a complete recovery from microfracture surgery.”Recovery will require six to 12 months, though, and the team announced today that Oden, who is 19, is “likely to miss the 2007-08 NBA season.”'"
"'07-09-13,'1','The federal government has rejected a request for nearly $12 million to reimburse Mississippi’s most populous coastal county for removing debris from Hurricane Katrina, citing concerns about the quality and cost of the work. The Federal Emergency Management Agency concluded that Harrison County paid “unreasonably high” costs for clearing storm-damaged trees and did not adequately document the work, according to a letter from the head of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency that was obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press. The agency’s decision not to cover about $11.8 million in debris removal costs is the result of an audit questioning the rates that the county paid contractors for the work. The agency also found discrepancies in bills that contractors submitted for debris removal.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','The judge also rejected a claim that Vermont’s standards would intrude into the sphere of foreign policy, which is the unique province of the federal government.Though the ruling by Judge Sessions did not deal directly with the California law, it is expected to embolden efforts in California — a state with a three-decade history of subduing polluting industries and serving as a template for other states — to further reduce the emissions that many scientists say contribute to climate change.In 2002, California adopted the first state law requiring auto manufacturers to begin reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. In 2004, it set standards for emission reductions.Vermont adopted the same standards, as did other states, including Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.Automakers sued to block the standards in Vermont and California. The Vermont lawsuit led to a trial in May and Judge Sessions’s ruling on Wednesday; the California case is pending.The federal Clean Air Act gives California the unique authority to set its own emissions standards and allows other states to adopt California’s rules instead of the federal rules. But the California standards require a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency.A request for a waiver in the case of the emission standards was made in December 2005, and the E.P.A. administrator has said he will make a decision by the end of this year.None of the state rules will take effect unless a waiver is granted.David Doniger, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group that supports the state standards, predicted that Judge Sessions’s ruling would “put a lot more pressure on E.P.A. to grant the waiver.”In a statement posted on the Web site of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which brought the lawsuit, Dave McCurdy, the group’s president, said an appeal was being considered.Mr. McCurdy also said, “The alliance remains committed to working with policy makers to make certain that the E.P.A.’s judgment is based on credible, sound scientific data as to what policies truly impact California, its citizens and global climate concerns.”Among other things, Wednesday’s opinion includes a lengthy analysis of why the federal Transportation Department’s authority over fuel-economy standards does not prevent states from adopting California’s controls over vehicle emissions.One central reason, Judge Sessions said, is that the California standards cover more than just fuel economy. They deal with carbon dioxide emissions, which are closely correlated with fuel economy, as well as other heat-trapping gases, including those in automobile air-conditioning units, which are not tied to fuel economy.“The district court’s opinion is a sweeping rejection of the auto industry’s claim that California and other states” lack authority to regulate heat-trapping gases, Richard J. Lazarus, a law professor at Georgetown University, said in an e-mail message.Professor Lazarus added that the ruling by the Supreme Court in April that the Environmental Protection Agency had authority to regulate such emissions “plainly emboldened” Judge Sessions, who “takes the further step of endorsing an actual exercise of such authority by the states.”But Patrick A. Parenteau, a professor at the Vermont Law School, noted that the decision might have jumped the gun, legally speaking, because the Vermont rules, pending the E.P.A. ruling on a waiver, have not yet taken effect.An appeals court could rule that Judge Sessions was premature in deciding the case — in legal parlance, that it was not ripe.But, while the question of ripeness could upend the Vermont case, the decision gives psychological momentum to the states aligned with California, which include Arizona, Florida, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington.Under the California law, the emissions reductions for cars in the 2016 model year could be 30 percent or more below current levels.California regulators have required that by 2012 emissions from cars and light trucks be reduced by 25 percent from 2005 levels. For larger trucks and sport utility vehicles, cuts of 18 percent were required.Experts from the auto industry testified in the Vermont case that, because of the engineering and economic difficulties associated with meeting these goals, few if any of their cars and trucks would be sold in Vermont by 2016.The judge noted many of the emerging technologies for reducing gasoline consumption and questioned the automakers’ pessimism.“It is improbable,” he wrote, “that an industry that prides itself on its modernity, flexibility and innovativeness will be unable to meet the requirements of the regulation, especially with the range of technological possibilities and alternatives currently before it.”He was also skeptical of an industry expert’s claim that 65,000 jobs would be lost nationwide if California and its allies prevailed.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','The lenders say the trade-off is the only way to offer low monthly payments initially because otherwise borrowers would flee when rates adjust upward and make the loan a losing deal. The fees usually equal several months’ interest, and they decline over a few years before disappearing altogether.Homeowners often think they can keep up with their rising payments or that they will simply refinance later. But the penalties can dash that hope, even if market conditions and their personal circumstances allow it.Now state governments, regulators and members of Congress are considering whether to rein in prepayment penalties, as consumer advocates suggest. “Borrowers should not be penalized for paying off their debt,” said Ellen Harnick, senior policy counsel to the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit group in Durham, N.C.Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said this week that he would introduce legislation to eliminate the penalties and make other changes in home lending practices.“About 70 percent of subprime loans have costly prepayment penalties that trap borrowers in high-cost mortgages, mortgages that strip wealth rather than build it, and these penalties keep borrowers from shopping for a better deal,” Senator Dodd said in a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee early this year. When interest rates were high in the 1970s, states took steps to protect consumers from onerous prepayment penalties. Such fees generally disappeared from standard loans. In the late 1990s, though, subprime loans to people with weak credit blossomed, and with those loans came a resurgence in prepayment penalties.A number of states limit the penalties, but only state-regulated banks are generally subject to those restrictions; mortgage companies and national banks are not.One state, Wisconsin, actually reversed course and allowed prepayment penalties by state-chartered institutions last year, just as the housing bubble was about to burst. Lenders contended that with lower initial payments, many more people would be able to afford homes and it would level the playing field among lenders.“You want to give pause before banning prepayment penalties,” said Kurt Pfotenhauer, senior vice president for government affairs at the Mortgage Bankers Association. “They save consumers’ money by lowering their interest rates.”Mr. Larson and his wife would seem to be good candidates now for a traditional loan. They both have steady jobs: he trims trees, she waits tables. Their fateful refinancing was used to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt accumulated when they traveled to Thailand, his wife’s native country, for their wedding.The $205,000 loan, which the Larsons signed in February 2005, required them to pay only interest at first, or $11,400 a year, with the 5.6 percent rate to reset after two years. Mr. Larson knew there was a prepayment penalty, but thought it expired in two years; it was actually three years. Now the Larsons’ payments have climbed to $19,000 annually, at a new rate of 9.3 percent.“It was a loan made with no regard for whether it would be affordable when the rate increased,” said Jordon Ash of Acorn Financial Justice Center, an organization in St. Paul that is trying to help the Larsons. The mortgage broker who advised the Larsons could not be found, and phone calls to the company, Ace Mortgage, were not returned.Mr. Larson worries that his creditworthiness is sinking as the couple struggle to make the monthly payments. By the time the penalty expires, he may not be able to refinance.“I had good credit,” he said. “Now it is going down because we can’t keep up. I feel like I am drowning.”Experts say that many borrowers do not really understand the implications of prepayment penalties — if they are aware they have them at all — and fall prey to sophisticated marketing. In a 2002 lawsuit by Acorn on behalf of a group of borrowers against Household Finance, Acorn said that lenders referred to the practice as “closing the back door” by making it too costly for borrowers to get out of loans with rising rates.The art of finding borrowers was carefully honed, according to the lawsuit. Among the techniques was sending a check and telling recipients they could have access to a small loan by cashing it. Those who did went on a hot list of prospects in a strategy referred to as target practice, according to the suit.The penalty “is just an added fee that means more money to the lenders,” said Melissa A. Huelsman, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in predatory lending law. “It is one piece of paper that a borrower signs in a stack of 50 papers. For many people, even if they saw the words, they wouldn’t understand them.”That was the case for Gertrude Robertson, a 91-year-old widow and nurse’s aide living in Seattle who took out an adjustable-rate mortgage of $450,000 in January.Even at her age, Mrs. Robertson was earning $3,500 a month, largely by caring for another elderly woman. Then the woman died. Mrs. Robertson’s income was reduced to her monthly Social Security payment of $1,500. Meanwhile, her loan ballooned to $475,000. Unable to make the payments, Mrs. Robertson is listing her home for $510,000.Mrs. Robertson’s mortgage includes a prepayment penalty of $14,400. A sale at her asking price would not only wipe out any equity but require her to write a check for about $8,600 to cover the penalty and other costs.Mrs. Robertson says her broker did not give her time to study the loan documents. “Some words I don’t understand,” she said. “When I heard the lady I used to work for tell someone that I was the ‘epitome of cleanliness,’ I went home and cried. I thought I was going to be fired.’ I didn’t know what it meant.”Last week, Ms. Huelsman persuaded a court in California to waive the prepayment penalty for Mrs. Robertson. She is seeking to have other fees thrown out as well. The loan was made by New Century Financial, now in bankruptcy protection.The loan servicer, HomeEq, prefers to work one-on-one with customers and does not comment on individual cases, a HomeEq spokeswoman said.A study by the Center for Responsible Lending shows that borrowers in minority neighborhoods received a disproportionate share of loans with prepayment penalties. The Pew Hispanic Center reported in 2002 that African-American families had a median net worth of just under $6,000. Hispanic families had nearly $8,000. For white Americans, the median net worth was $88,651.Waiting out the expiration of a penalty, especially a short one, does not sound so bad — until home prices turn south.That is what happened to Dorinda Weisman, a social worker in Elk Grove, Calif. In 2005 she borrowed $353,000 from Pacific American Mortgage to buy a home in Sacramento with a small down payment. The prepayment penalty, of $9,000, expired in just a year.“One of the things I always wanted was to own a house,” Ms. Weisman said in a telephone interview. “I was a single parent, and my son is a hemophiliac. I had been living in a middle-class African-American neighborhood that went downhill after the drugs came in.”By the time the penalty expired, her house had declined in value. Refinancing was no longer possible.Her interest rate had shot up to 9.8 percent from 4.75 percent. She says about 85 percent of what she brings home — her salary is $60,000 as a social service consultant with the state government — now goes to the mortgage.She is trying to negotiate a new loan with the help of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, a nonprofit home ownership organization based in Jamaica Plain, Mass.“Like a lot of people, the adjustable ate up her equity,“ said her mortgage broker, Antonio Cook of Toneco Financial. “She’s got to ride it out and sacrifice. I tell people, ‘I don’t care if you eat bologna sandwiches, just pay your bills on time.’ If she can ride it out, things start coming up good.”'"
"'07-09-13,'1','When a United States District judge sentences Michael Vick in December, he will be presented with recommendations from the federal government, Vick’s lawyers and the probation office, which serves as an independent adviser to the judge.After Judge Henry E. Hudson permitted a third-party brief in the case yesterday, he will have at least one more thing to consider: a 31-page document filed by a consortium of animal rights groups that argues Vick should be sentenced to 57 months in jail.Vick, who starred as the quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons, agreed last month to plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiracy stemming from a dogfighting kennel being run from a property he owned in Surry, Va. At the time, the federal government said it would advocate a sentence of 12 to 18 months if Vick continued to cooperate with authorities.But when Vick accepted his plea agreement Aug. 27, Hudson made it clear that he was not bound by the government’s recommendation and that Vick could not appeal his decision. Vick faces up to five years in prison.The N.F.L., which has suspended Vick indefinitely, has put off making a decision on the length of his suspension until after he is sentenced.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','The timing of the resignation was all the more puzzling because Mr. Abe had steadfastly refused to resign or to dissolve Parliament and call a general election after his party suffered a humiliating defeat in an upper house election over the summer. He also reshuffled his cabinet two weeks ago in what was presented as a fresh start.What is more, in a speech marking the start of the parliamentary session on Monday, Mr. Abe had laid out his agenda.“The way he resigned was unprecedented,” said Jun Iio, a professor of government at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies here. “Unfortunately, even though Abe had some successes as prime minister, he will be remembered for the way he resigned. Other prime ministers resigned after putting up a good fight and made the reasons for their resignation very clear. But the way Abe resigned suggests he lacked the qualifications to be prime minister in the first place.”Mr. Aso said that Mr. Abe first mentioned to him directly his desire to quit on Monday. Mr. Aso said he told Mr. Abe that “the timing“ was not appropriate, but that on Tuesday Mr. Abe repeated his desire to resign, and then again on Wednesday.“His intention did not change at all over three days,” Mr. Aso said in a separate news conference, deflecting questions about his plans to run in the next week election for party leader.Experts said pressure to call a general election soon — one must be held before September 2009 — is unlikely to diminish with a change of leadership.“A new prime minister will benefit from a bounce in the polls, but that is unlikely to be enough,” said Takeshi Sasaki, a political scientist at Gakushuin University and a former president of the University of Tokyo. “Since the last general election was in 2005, this will be the second government without the voters’ direct endorsement. So the next prime minister will likely be forced to dissolve Parliament and call a general election, probably late this year or early next year.”Possibly to deflect criticism of the sudden resignation, party officials said that Mr. Abe, 52, the first prime minister born after World War II, was suffering from poor health, though they provided no details. [On Thursday morning, Mr. Abe went to see a doctor at a hospital here, Japanese media reported.]Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party, has focused his attention on a contentious law that allows Japan’s naval forces to refuel American and other ships participating in the war in Afghanistan. The law is set to expire on Nov. 1.“There is no way that our thinking will change because of a change in the Liberal Democratic Party,” Mr. Ozawa said.Opinion polls indicated that most Japanese opposed extending the law. And Mr. Ozawa tapped into a general unease that, under Mr. Abe and his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, Japan has grown too close to the United States militarily, even to the point of possibly violating its pacifist Constitution.Mr. Abe, who became prime minister last September, gained popularity by championing the cause of a dozen Japanese abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and fanning, critics said, nationalist anger. As a lawmaker, he had long led efforts to revise school textbooks and present what critics said was a whitewashed version of Japan’s wartime history.Last spring, Mr. Abe said there was no evidence that the Japanese military had forced women into sex slavery during World War II, causing a furor in the United States, as well as in Asian and European countries. The comments built support for the eventual passage by the United States House of Representatives of a nonbinding resolution calling on Japan to acknowledge and apologize for the sex slavery.Mr. Abe’s cabinet was weakened by a series of money-related scandals and gaffes that forced four of his ministers to resign; a fifth committed suicide after being caught greatly inflating his office expenses.But it was Mr. Abe’s mishandling of a bookkeeping problem surrounding the national pension system that contributed the most to his party’s devastating loss in the upper house election. While the problem had existed for many years, Mr. Abe kept quiet after learning about it early this year. After opposition politicians exposed it in the spring, Mr. Abe first played down the issue, angering voters in a rapidly aging nation with a declining birthrate.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','The unusual case stems from work by Mr. Seeber and his firm, TriStem Consulting, which checks electricity bills for accuracy. He has recovered $20 million in overcharges from Entergy for the city government and is pressing a case to collect $5 million more that he says Entergy improperly charged Louisiana.In the 1996 case, Entergy, which had a contract to maintain the city’s streetlights, paid $3.2 million in damages to a fruit vendor who was injured when a corroded light pole fell on him. Entergy then sued Mr. Seeber, saying he was liable for the damages because, as the city’s electric bill consultant, he should have warned Entergy about the pole. The case was dismissed, and Entergy is appealing.Mr. Seeber contends that Entergy is trying to ruin his business. He has posted on the Internet what he says is a copy of an internal Entergy report that details a strategy to “eliminate the need” for the city to hire an electric bill consultant.Entergy said Wednesday that it had sought only technical changes in Mr. Seeber’s letter. The company also released a 2004 letter from Mr. Seeber, responding to its efforts to settle a different lawsuit. The letter quoted an Entergy lawyer as saying that the utility “never wanted to sit across the table” from him again. Mr. Seeber proposed a settlement of $10 million and a $25,000 monthly fee for five years.The 400-page report that Mr. Seeber sent to Entergy detailed suspicions of fraud in Entergy’s financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and shareholders. The company said it found no merit in the accusations but never told Mr. Seeber, who continued to send reports to Mr. Leonard.Mr. Seeber is not alone in raising questions about the integrity of Entergy’s financial statements. The FPL Group, a large Florida utility holding company, called off a merger with Entergy in 2001, principally because of what it said were “discrepancies in Entergy’s financial forecasts and Entergy’s repeated refusal to provide financial documents.” Mr. Leonard said at the time that the merger failed because of minimal due diligence by FPL and a personality dispute with the company’s chief executive then, James L. Broadhead.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','Writing in a 240-page decision, the judge also rejected a claim that the Vermont law would intrude into the sphere of foreign policy, which is the unique province of the federal government.Though the ruling did not deal directly with the California law, it is expected to embolden efforts in California — a state with a three-decade history of subduing polluting industries and serving as a template for other states— to further reduce the emissions that contribute to climate change.In 2002, California adopted the first state law requiring auto manufacturers to begin cutting carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases. Vermont adopted the same law, as did 12 other states, including New York.The auto manufacturers sued to block the laws in Vermont and California. The Vermont lawsuit led to a trial in May and Judge Sessions’s ruling today; the California case is pending.The federal Clean Air Act gives California the unique authority to set its own emissions standards and allows other states to adopt California’s rules instead of the federal rules. But the California standards require a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency.A request for a waiver in the case of the emissions law was made in December, 2005, and the E.P.A. administrator has said he would make a decision by the end of this year. None of the state laws will take effect unless a waiver is granted.David Doniger, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group that supports the state laws, predicted that Judge Sessions’s ruling will “put a lot more pressure on E.P.A. to grant the waiver.”In a statement posted on the Web site of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which brought the lawsuit, Dave McCurdy, the group’s president, said an appeal was being considered.Mr. McCurdy also said, “The alliance remains committed to working with policymakers to make certain that the E.P.A.’s judgment is based on credible, sound scientific data as to what policies truly impact California, its citizens and global climate concerns.”Among other things, today’s opinion includes a lengthy analysis of why the federal Transportation Department’s authority over fuel-economy standards does not prevent states from adopting California’s controls over vehicle emissions.One central reason, Judge Sessions said, is that the California law covers more than just fuel economy. It deals with carbon-dioxide emissions, which are closely correlated with fuel economy, as well as other greenhouse gases, including those in automobile air-conditioning units, which are not tied to fuel economy.“The district court’s opinion is a sweeping rejection of the auto industry’s claim that California and other states” lack authority to regulate heat-trapping gases, said Richard J. Lazarus, a law professor at Georgetown University, in an e-mail message.He added that a ruling by the Supreme Court in April that the Environmental Protection Agency has authority to regulate such emissions “plainly emboldened” Judge Sessions, who “takes the further step of endorsing an actual exercise of such authority by the states.”But Patrick Parenteau, a professor at Vermont Law School, noted that the decision may have jumped the gun, legally speaking, because the Vermont law, pending the E.P.A. ruling on a waiver, has not yet taken effect.An appeals court could rule that Judge Sessions was premature in deciding the case — in legal parlance, that it was not ripe — even though the auto industry argued for trying the case as if the laws were in effect.But, while the question of ripeness could upend the Vermont case, the decision gives psychological momentum to the states aligned with California, which also include New Jersey, Connecticut, Arizona, Maryland, Oregon, Washington, Massachusetts, Maine and Pennsylvania.Under the California law, the emissions reductions for cars in the 2016 model year could be as much as 30 percent or more below current levels.California regulators have required that by 2012 emissions from cars and light trucks be reduced by 25 percent from 2005 levels. For larger trucks and sport utility vehicles, 18 percent cuts were required.Experts from the auto industry testified in the Vermont case that, because of the engineering and economic difficulties associated with meeting these goals, few if any of their cars and trucks would be sold in Vermont by 2016.Judge Sessions noted many of the emerging technologies for reducing gas consumption and questioned the automakers’ pessimism.“It is improbable,” he wrote, “that an industry that prides itself on its modernity, flexibility and innovativeness will be unable to meet the requirements of the regulation, especially with the range of technological possibilities and alternatives currently before it.”He was also skeptical of an industry expert’s claim that 65,000 jobs would be lost nationwide if the California law took effect in all the states that have approved it.On the broader question of whether tailpipe emissions play a role in climate change, Judge Sessions wrote, “Evidence presented to this court also supports the conclusion that regulation of greenhouse gases emitted from motor vehicles has a place in the broader struggle against global warming.” About 40 percent of California’s greenhouse-gas emissions come from cars and trucks.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 (AP) — Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, on Wednesday recanted his claim that the new surveillance powers recently given to the government helped foil a terrorist plot in Germany.“Information contributing to the recent arrests was not collected under authorities provided by the Protect America Act,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement issued late in the day.Mr. McConnell had told the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Monday that powers granted by the act, hastily approved by Congress in early August before a monthlong break, helped stop the planned attacks. The law, which amended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, had been pushed strongly by Mr. McConnell and the White House.Mr. McConnell’s assertion that the new powers helped foil the plot in Germany had been disputed by Representative Silvestre Reyes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Reyes, Democrat of Texas, said on Tuesday that the intelligence used to capture the would-be terrorists was collected under the old version of the surveillance law, not the new one.“In fact, F.I.S.A., which you repeatedly claim is ‘outdated,’ was precisely the tool that helped disrupt this plot,” Mr. Reyes said. “The new law did not lead to the arrests of the three terrorist plotters, as you claimed.”The new surveillance law expires in six months. Many Democrats want to change it sooner, arguing that it gives the government far more power to eavesdrop than Congress initially understood.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','“All we need is a little money, my friends,” Mr. McCain said in a brief conference call with fund-raisers that he made from the bus between stops.He argued that his good reviews in the debate and the fact that voters were now beginning to tune in to the election had led to “the first significant bump in the polls.”But any momentum could drain away in mid-October if the campaign fails to show a robust bank balance when the next fund-raising figures are announced. And so far Mr. McCain has spent much of the month not raising money but discussing Iraq in the Senate and on trips like this one, trips that will continue in New Hampshire and South Carolina.“The bad news is that all of this is obviously taking away from fund-raising time,” Mr. McCain told the fund-raisers on their call. “We’ve got to show a pretty good quarter.”On the road, the campaign is drawing enthusiastic crowds. The tour began Tuesday in Sioux City in a hangar at Col. Bud Day Field, where Mr. McCain was introduced by Mr. Day, a Medal of Honor winner who nursed Mr. McCain back to health when they were both held prisoner in North Vietnam.Mr. McCain remarked on the imposing statue of Mr. Day that stands outside the airport. “I think the statue is kind of, a little bit too flattering,” he told the crowd. “I almost didn’t recognize him.”In Des Moines, Mr. Day introduced Mr. McCain as “my fellow jailbird from Hanoi.” He also served as a kind of character witness, reminding the crowds that Mr. McCain was offered an early release by the North Vietnamese but refused to go until everyone who had been shot down before him, or was sicker than he, was released.At each stop, Mr. McCain brought out a mounted copy of a full-page advertisement that MoveOn.org, a liberal group, took out this week in The New York Times, which questioned Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander in Iraq, asking if he was really “General Betray Us.” “It’s disgraceful,” said an angry-sounding Mr. McCain, who called on all the Democratic presidential candidates to denounce the advertisement as well.And in Des Moines, he took issue with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s remark that General Petraeus’s progress report required “a willing suspension of disbelief.”“It’s a willing suspension of disbelief that Senator Clinton thinks she knows more than General Petraeus,” Mr. McCain told the crowd, to applause.After extolling the virtues of running a “lean and mean” underdog’s campaign, Mr. McCain then had some praise for Mrs. Clinton — or at least her campaign.“I’d love to be in Hillary Clinton’s position,” he said. “She’s conducted a very good campaign, and she’s continued to increase her lead.”“Although I don’t know if I could take an $850,000 hit,” he added with a laugh, referring to the Clinton campaign’s decision to return $850,000 that was raised by Norman Hsu, a fund-raiser with legal troubles. “We might have to shut the doors.”'"
"'07-09-13,'1','“With some statistics and new detailed models, we will be able to say something more even to the destiny of our Earth (which, as we all know, has much more urgent problems by the way),” he said via e-mail.Dr. Silvotti and his colleagues reported their results today in Nature.In an accompanying commentary, Jonathan Fortney of NASA’s Ames Research Center in California wrote, “This system allows us to start examining what will happen to planets around stars such as our own Sun as they too evolve and grow old.”The star V 391 Pegasi is about 4,500 light years from Earth and is about half as massive as the Sun, burning helium into carbon. It will eventually sigh off another shell of gas and settle into eternal senescence as a white dwarf.Meanwhile, the star’s pulsations cause it to brighten and dim every six minutes. After studying the star for seven years, Dr. Silvotti and his colleagues were able to discern subtle modulations in the six-minute cycle, suggesting that the star was being tugged to and fro over a three-year period by a massive planet.“Essentially, the observers are using the star as a clock, as if it were a G.P.S. satellite moving around the planet,” said Fred Rasio of Northwestern University, who was not involved in the research.This is not the first time that a pulsing star has been used as such a clock. In 1992, astronomers using the same technique detected a pair of planets (or their corpses) circling the pulsar PSR1257+12. And only yesterday, X-ray astronomers from the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that they had detected the remains of a star that radiation had whittled down to planetary mass circling a pulsar in the constellation Sagittarius. Those systems have probably endured supernova explosions.The Pegasus planet has had to survive less lethal conditions, although it must have had a bumpy ride over its estimated 10 billion years of existence. Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington said, “Stellar evolution can be a wild ride for a planet that is trying to survive, especially inner planets like Earth.”When our own Sun begins to graduate from a hydrogen-burning main sequence star to a red giant, two effects will compete, the astronomers said. As the Sun blows off mass to conserve angular momentum, Earth will retreat to a more distant, safer orbit. At the same time, tidal forces between Earth and the expanding star will try to drag the planet inward, where it could be engulfed. The latter effect, in particular, is difficult to compute.As a result, Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute said of the inner planets, “Earth’s fate is actually the most uncertain because it is at the border line between being engulfed and surviving.”A particularly dangerous time for Earth, Dr. Silvotti said, would be at the end of the red giant phase when the Sun’s helium ignites in an explosive flash. In the case of V 391 Pegasi, that explosion sent a large fraction of the star’s mass flying outward.“This is another reason why the survival of a planet in a relatively close orbit is not trivial,” he said.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','Her predicament illustrates the hazards that await pop stars who depart the spotlight and then try to return where they left off. Ms. Spears all but suspended her career three years ago when she married a backup dancer, Kevin Federline, and fired her longtime manager. More recently, she has expressed a desire to run her own career, even while devoting time to a messy divorce with Mr. Federline and a child-custody battle.Little wonder that the question of how to breathe new life into her career was a polarizing one — particularly when MTV, where Ms. Spears had been a mainstay, extended an offer for her to perform at its annual gala.The idea received a mostly cool reception from Ms. Spears’s principal advisers at Jive. But Ms. Spears’s entertainment lawyer, Gary Stiffelman, figured she could benefit from MTV exposure, and pressed her to sign on. Mr. Stiffelman also helped steer Ms. Spears to a new manager, Jeff Kwatinetz, about a month ago to guide her through preparations for the appearance. Mr. Stiffelman and Mr. Kwatinetz declined to comment.Ms. Spears began a program of fitness training and choreography sessions to get ready, with executives from MTV and Jive receiving updates on her progress from her management. Shortly after the preparations began, though, Ms. Spears jolted the team by shaking up her coterie of advisers, ousting Mr. Stiffelman.Members of Ms. Spears’s camp say that although she expressed jitters about performing on television again, she showed a semblance of sticking to her regimen. But once Ms. Spears arrived in Las Vegas for the awards show weekend, everything ran off the rails. For starters, she was photographed partying with celebrities like Diddy until the wee hours.Roughly an hour before showtime, Ms. Spears insisted on a series of changes. She clashed with Ken Paves, the high-end hairstylist chosen to do her hair extensions. She also decided not to wear the custom-fitted corset designed for the performance, opting for a black bikini-style costume that revealed more of her body. Her physical appearance during her set also faced a barrage of criticism.Her performance is the second recent public embarrassment for one of Mr. Kwatinetz’s clients. A few months ago he was fired by the singer Kelly Clarkson amid a public battle she was waging with her label.For all the buzz about her televised missteps, Ms. Spears appears to be on solid footing in one sense: she has a hot song. Since “Gimme More” surfaced on the New York pop station Z100 two weeks ago, it has quickly earned a spot on the playlists of pop stations nationwide and turned into a hit on Web sites like YouTube.“So far, in the first two weeks, the reaction has been bigger than anyone expected,” said Sharon Dastur, the program director for Z100. She said that some listeners call to make negative comments about Ms. Spears, “but then they say, ‘When are you guys going to play the song again?’ ”Two ringtones based on the single can be bought exclusively on mtv.com; initially, demand was so heavy that the servers handling the orders crashed for several hours. And for better or worse, the performance has also prompted loose defenses of Ms. Spears online, where one fan created a Zapruder-like slow-motion replay video that laid the blame for her awkward dancing on a broken boot heel.It is not clear how far a hit song will take Ms. Spears, however, in the absence of other marketing efforts. Her advisers may be reluctant to risk further setbacks by pushing her to do additional performances or interviews.A spokeswoman for Jive Records said the company “is committed to releasing Britney Spears’s album on Nov. 13 and we’re excited about the new material.” Her last album, “In the Zone,” sold more than 2.9 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.Ms. Spears’s team is also eager to release a music video to counter the impressions left by the MTV debacle. But that may prove tricky, too: Ms. Spears oversaw her production of a gritty, stripper-themed clip for “Gimme More” that may jolt fans who are more accustomed to the slick, tightly choreographed videos that made her an MTV staple. The video is being tweaked with input from her advisers.Only a week before the awards show, there had been talk among Ms. Spears’s handlers of booking her to play a string of intimate theater performances to promote her new album. But after Las Vegas, all bets are off. Given Ms. Spears’s independent streak, the biggest challenge may be convincing her to commit to a supervised makeover.“The train wreck can’t be her shtick,” said Mr. Marose. He added, “So many people are pulling for her; they want to love her and she’s making it tough.”'"
"'07-09-13,'1','As Buddhism inches toward the pop culture mainstream, practitioners are taking its tenets of mindfulness, acceptance and compassion to populations in need of spiritual guidance, namely prisons and centers for troubled youths.Prisoners have been practicing meditation on their own through outreach programs for years. The Prison-Ashram Project began in 1973 and in 1989 the Prison Dharma Network was founded, an umbrella organization now encompassing over 100 prison volunteer groups from different Buddhist traditions. Donaldson’s 10-day course would mark the first time that an intensive retreat would be held in such a high-security prison in the United States, Ms. Phillips said.Along with her crew, Ms. Phillips documented the process: cushions and sleeping mats were laid down in a Donaldson gym, where the participating prisoners meditated in complete isolation. Convicts serving life sentences for gruesome crimes focused on their breath, much like the Buddha taught more than 2,500 years ago.“No one thought these guys could tolerate a 10-day meditation course,” Ms. Phillips said in a phone interview. But the prisoners did more than tolerate it.“We were finding that after this 10-day course, inmates were better able to control their anger and better able to conduct themselves,” said Dr. Ron Cavanaugh, director of treatment at the Alabama Department of Corrections, who worked with Ms. Phillips to bring Vipassana meditation to Donaldson. “The initial group had about a 20 percent reduction in their disciplinary histories.” After the course ended and the film crew returned to Massachusetts, the Dhamma brothers continued meditating daily, with a longer sitting once a week.But months later, in July 2002, they received word that they would no longer be allowed to sit, and Ms. Phillips would no longer be allowed to film.“The chaplain had reservations about inmates turning into Buddhists and losing his congregation,” Dr. Cavanaugh said. “He called the commissioner; the commissioner called the warden and told the warden to shut down the program.”The Dhamma brothers were now only a community in spirit. “I felt responsible,” Ms. Phillips said.“Perhaps in my greediness of making a film,” she added, “I had hurt these people. When you’re in such a state of deprivation anyway, and you’re deprived of things that are so helpful to you — it was absolutely devastating.”For the next four years Ms. Phillips corresponded by mail with the Dhamma brothers. “I didn’t think we’d ever get back in again,” she said.While Ms. Phillips and Mr. Cavanaugh continued to hope that the Vipassana courses could return to Donaldson and the Dhamma brothers, Ms. Phillips and her team — the editor and co-director Andy Kukura of Boston’s Northern Lights Productions and another director, Anne Marie Stein — resigned themselves to making a film that would be “a downer,” Mr. Kukura said.But in December 2005 Ms. Phillips received a call from Dr. Cavanaugh informing her that the administration had changed at Donaldson, the meditation program had been reinstalled and the film crew could come back.“It was the perfect way to resolve the film,” she said. “It would’ve been a film of failure — failure to do something meaningful in the prison.”Now her crew and the Dhamma brothers hope for more festival support (it’s already winning awards on the circuit, including a tie for best documentary at the Wood Hole Film Festival) and, eventually, a commercial audience for the movie. “Letters from the Dhamma Brothers,” an accompanying book of the letters the inmates sent to Ms. Phillips and the Vipassana teachers, is scheduled for publication in early 2008 by Pariyatti Press.“It appears that it was a miracle that this happened in the Deep South in one of the worst prisons in the country in the first place,” Mr. Stewart, the Vipassana teacher, said. “It also seems like a miracle that we’re back. But it’s just cause and effect. If the men hadn’t had this keen desire for self-improvement, I don’t think this would’ve happened.”'"
"'07-09-13,'1','It was the fifth day of the Toronto International Film Festival, just before a 3 p.m. screening of a new Johnnie To movie, when the stranger stopped dead in front of me. Having returned to the darkened theater, where the lights were too low to read by and almost to see, he had entered the wrong row. “I can’t take it anymore,” he declared morosely, shaking his head. “This festival is killing my love of cinema.”I felt for my befuddled stranger, lost in the dark and clutching a cup of megaplex coffee. It’s hard to know what and how to love when there are so many suitors. Now in its 32nd year, the Toronto festival has grown into an immense industrial happening, with 349 films from 55 countries. You may have already heard about some of these titles — “Atonement,” “Rendition,” “Elizabeth: The Golden Age,” “Reservation Road” — the ones with the supernova stars and name directors who pop up in the next day’s news and then, in the months leading up to the Academy Awards, every media outlet imaginable. For many of these movies, Toronto is just the beginning of the end, the launch site for the seasonal red carpet bombing.The movie that the lost man and I had come to see, “Mad Detective,” directed by Wai Ka- fai and the astonishingly prolific Mr. To, may not have restored anyone’s love of cinema, but it sent a jolt of energy through the audience, which laughed and twitched throughout this daft genre exercise. Even the credit sequence has its pleasures: to conjure up the mind-set of a murderer, the madman of the title repeatedly stabs a pig’s carcass, and then has himself zipped into a cloth suitcase and tossed down one flight of stairs after another. The ice cream man done it, he announces on tumbling free. Bullets, elegant mayhem and a homage to Orson Welles’s “Lady From Shanghai” follow amid circling cameras; bodies in fast, furious motion; and shattered film space.“Mad Detective” isn’t Mr. To’s finest hour and a half; it just reaffirms his status as an action master. It’s also precisely the kind of movie that’s guaranteed to play at Toronto, which has long been a showcase for global genre cinema alongside rarefied art-house fare and prestige Hollywood product. Nothing if not democratic, the festival has now become big enough to be all things to all movie people. Here, jostling side by side with industry executives and nonprofessional enthusiasts, aesthetes and fan boys, journeymen journalists and bloggers, long- and short-lead critics can each carve out a festival to their own choosing, finding the movies that matter, if only for 89 minutes and their next column.Among the films that made my festival were some that will open within the month, like Todd Haynes’s imaginative tour de force “I’m Not There,” a multiple-personality portrait of the artist formerly known as Bobby Zimmerman, as well as as a folkie, a sellout, a has-been and a born-again Christian. Other films, like “Happiness,” a touching South Korean melodrama from Hur Jin-ho about two lovers who meet at a hospice, may never make it into American theaters because it may not seem aesthetically daring or novel enough to warrant the risk. Non-martial arts Asian films generally don’t fare well at the American box office, even those that come with glowing reviews and that, like “Happiness,” cause an entire audience to break down audibly weeping.Because the Toronto is so large and functions both as a preview for the fall studio season and as an international bazaar, with goods from Germany, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia (the multinational provenance for the period epic “Mongol”), it affords an instructive view of the state of the American art and industry. More than any other major festival, Toronto makes clear the divide between those movies that matter aesthetically and intellectually — think the work of Hou Hsiao-hsien, the Dardenne brothers and Gus Van Sant — and those movies that matter largely because of their awards potential and the presumed interest to what remains of the discriminating, adult audience. Think “The Queen,” “Good Night, and Good Luck” and any number of films nominated for best picture in recent years.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','But too often he opts for something safe, even sappy. There is a mawkish aria early on for Edward Gaines, the owner of the Maplewood Plantation in northern Kentucky, where the story begins in 1856. Captivated by the attractive young Margaret’s singing, Gaines sings a wistfully lyrical and harmonically soft-focused recollection of his childhood, “I remember the curve of every hill.” This shamelessly manipulative music is meant to win sympathy for Gaines before he becomes Margaret’s brutal, if tormented, oppressor.In a telling scene in Act I, Margaret, rocking her new baby, has supper with her steadfast husband, Robert, and his wise mother, Cilla. Here, in a counterintuitive stroke, Mr. Danielpour evokes the intimate scene in compelling music of quiet anxiety, unstable harmony and subtly textured orchestral colors. Then Casey, the maniacal foreman of the plantation, appears with shocking orders. Robert is being sent to another plantation, while Margaret is reassigned to work as a domestic in the main house.When the stunned couple bid farewell, the scene is hopelessly sentimental. The fault may start with Ms. Morrison’s text. Margaret and Robert exchange loving vows: “Hold me,” “Hold on,” “Stay, sweet,” “Stay strong,” “Be my moonrise,” “Be my dawn.”Yet there is an abstract quality to these poetic phrases that another composer might have picked up on to create music of more ambiguity. Mr. Danielpour gives us a lulling, lyrically soaring, angelic duet, until Robert is dragged away. Nothing of the horror of this moment is captured in the music. When the duet ended, the audience here, seemingly untroubled, responded with polite applause.The City Opera is presenting the work in a new production, a handsomely simple staging by the director Tazewell Thompson. Donald Eastman’s set frames the stage with clapboard walls and tall columns, suggesting a plantation doorway and a farmhouse for slaves. The muted browns of Merrily Murray-Walsh’s costumes give the show the look of an old sepia photograph.The chorus, prepared by Gary Thor Wedow, sang robustly — two full choruses, actually: one of slaves and another of white Kentucky citizens. George Manahan conducted a supple, shimmering and, during the frequent bursts of propulsive music, articulate performance.The cast was excellent, especially four leads making their company debuts. The mezzo-soprano Tracie Luck brought a rich voice and vulnerability to the title role. The soprano Lisa Daltirus gave an intensely emotional performance as the wizened Cilla. The hardy baritone Timothy Mix did his best with the unconvincing role of Gaines. And the charismatic, powerful baritone Gregg Baker, a compelling Robert, seems on the brink of a big career.In the final scene, when Gaines arrives with a legal reprieve just in time to stop Margaret’s hanging, the distraught slave pulls the platform lever to kill herself anyway. The opera then concludes with a mystical ensemble that comes across as a major miscalculation.The chorus of slaves and white people combine to sing a hymnal plea for reconciliation: “Sweet Jesus, help us break through the night.” The music would have to be sublime to make this scene work. Mr. Danielpour’s comforting sonorities just turn the moment hokey.My reservations seemed not to have been shared by the audience, which gave the creators and performers a prolonged ovation.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','Georgia’s refusal to adequately fund the defense of capital cases is not an isolated incident. In fact, numerous studies have reported the same failure in the vast majority of death penalty states.The problem is particularly acute in “the death belt,” which includes Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, Missouri, and now (once again) Georgia, among others.Inadequate funding means inadequate legal representation and unfair trials. The climbing number of exonerations of innocent people makes it painfully clear that substandard representation is unacceptable.Many politicians love to proclaim their support for capital punishment, but then refuse to pay for a fair system. The Constitution guarantees criminal defendants effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial, and that costs money.The costs are much higher in capital cases. It’s an expensive fact of life — and death.The writers are, respectively, director and state strategy coordinator of the A.C.L.U.’s Capital Punishment Project.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','If the commissioner were to ask Mangini that question, the Jets coach can’t (and shouldn’t) say “no comment” or take the Fifth Amendment.In ruling on Michael Vick and Pacman Jones recently, Goodell cited the importance of the league’s integrity. But Vick and Jones were involved in criminal cases outside the pro football realm. The Patriots case is strictly a pro football crime subject to the commissioner’s jurisprudence.Goodell doesn’t have to wait for an indictment or a trial. He knows the evidence. He also knows that Belichick, often referred to as pro football’s latest genius coach, has copped a guilty plea.Not that spying is new to pro football. But the Patriots’ method was not only too high-tech, it had been discussed and denounced as blatant cheating.In baseball, stealing signs from a third-base coach is considered an art, but the 1951 New York Giants’ use of a telescope and a buzzer system to alert batters to the next pitch would have deserved a commissioner’s punishment had it been discovered and proved.Over the years in pro football, spying was usually confined to suspicion. Going back more than four decades, whenever a helicopter appeared anywhere above a Jets outdoor practice before a game with the Oakland Raiders, Coach Weeb Ewbank would blow his whistle.“Al Davis has somebody up there watching us,” Ewbank would say, referring to the Raiders’ general managing genius. “Don’t do anything until that copter leaves.”Harland Svare, the San Diego Chargers’ coach who had been a Giants linebacker, once looked up at a light fixture in the visiting team’s locker room at the Oakland Coliseum.“I know you’re up there, Al Davis,” Svare yelled. “I know you’re up there.”Told later of Svare’s accusations, Davis was willing to perpetuate his sinister reputation.“The thing wasn’t in the light fixture,” Davis said slyly. “I’ll tell you that much.”Ever since the Giants moved to the Meadowlands, their coaches have wondered if their practices at the outdoor field next to the stadium were being watched by spies peering through binoculars from a room in a nearby high-rise hotel. According to a Giants official, Coach Dan Reeves wanted to erect a wall to block that view.In 1998, when the Atlanta Falcons, with Reeves as their coach, were about to play the Giants, the Falcons were suspected of planting a spy in that hotel. Just in case, the Giants assigned a club employee with high-powered binoculars to survey the windows of the hotel and a nearby office building. No spies were spotted.Jim Fassel, the Giants’ coach at the time, solved the issue that week by taking the Giants inside the team’s practice bubble. The Falcons won, 34-20.Until now, all that spying was mostly mischief that usually was more smoke than fire. But what Belichick and the Patriots did (and got caught at) was a bonfire not normally associated with a model franchise.'"
"'07-09-13,'1','“Our goal has always been to be truly welcoming, truly tolerant, true to the Woodstock ethos,” said Rabbi Kligler, who came to the congregation in 1988 as a student rabbi and never left. “At the beginning, no one wanted to have memberships, there was no accounting system. Our challenge was to grow without losing our vision and spirit.”There were plenty of Jews in Woodstock, but no synagogue closer than Kingston until late 1986, when two refugees from Brooklyn, Laurie Schwartz and Nathan Brenowitz, decided to start one. First, they wanted to have a place where their son could learn to be Jewish — and they could learn along with him. Second, as Mr. Brenowitz noted, most of the Jews in town seemed to be Hindus or Buddhists, and they wanted a place with a Jewish identity that evoked the spirituality all their friends were seeking.They placed an ad in The Woodstock Times announcing their intentions to start a synagogue that attracted 70 responses. First they planned a High Holy Days ceremony in a single room at the Woodstock Children’s Center. Then as word spread, they thought they could do it in two rooms with the prayer leader straddling the doorway between them. In the end, they rented a tent and more than 250 people attended the first service.They operated for many years out of an abandoned flea market in nearby Saugerties. They contemplated a new building but worried that a traditional capital campaign might not be their thing. “The capital campaign consultants talked about a giving pyramid, with the big donors at the top,” Rabbi Kligler said. “That wasn’t going to work. We’re more like a giving mesa.”But they pulled it off. This is their second year in the new $3 million, 12,500-square-foot building (which actually is in Woodstock) with the 150 purple chairs in the sanctuary donated by the Catskill Mountain Christian Center in Margaretville. There will be about 1,500 people attending the High Holy Days ceremonies, the membership is now 375 families, and the new building means the rabbi no longer has to operate out of a trailer behind the old flea market.There have been at least two times of crisis. The first came when the congregation split over the rabbi’s suggestion that it affiliate with the Reconstructionist Movement, where he was trained (they decided to remain unaffiliated), the second the result of bitter political schisms after 9/11 and the second intifada over whether the synagogue was supporting Israel enough or supporting it too much (a few members quit, but life went on).THE congregation is still distinctive, proud to have sponsored the bat mitzvah of a transsexual member who had her bar mitzvah decades ago. But Rabbi Kligler figures that with Judaism facing a growing chasm between the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox on one side and those more comfortable with modernity on the other, its experience isn’t just its own.And though anyone can attend the High Holy Days services, those who’ve paid their membership dues get to park at the temple, a perk that might have been blasphemous in the old days, but no more.“We finally have a privilege for members,” the rabbi said. “It makes a big difference. People have joined, so they can park on site.”'"

"'07-09-14,'1','Mr. Douglas, giving his strongest screen performance since “Wonder Boys,” creates a portrait of a fanatic on a tear that is at once endearing and maddening, and not overplayed. Charlie’s quest is only the latest in a series of offbeat schemes in which he hopes to prove to himself and his daughter that he can amount to something on his own eccentric terms. An amateur musician, he plays the stand-up bass, and in the movie’s most poignant vignette he tells his daughter of the time he pawned his instrument and lost hope until he was able to retrieve it.The treasure in question is a chest of gold doubloons supposedly buried in the area by a 17th-century Spanish explorer whose journals Charlie studied while institutionalized. He is convinced he cracked a secret code in the journals that will lead him directly to the treasure. Armed with a metal detector and an old map, he undertakes the quest, which eventually leads him to a Costco where he imagines he has pinpointed the cache buried six feet under the concrete floor. Still undeterred, he determines to get it.At his behest, Miranda, who has been working double shifts at a McDonald’s, gets a job in the store as clerk, researches its security system and even steals a master key. Gathering sophisticated surveyor’s tools and digging equipment, Charlie organizes a late-night break-in with Miranda as his assistant and Pepper (Willis Burks II), a former member of his defunct jazz combo, playing lookout.Not the least of the story’s many holes is Charlie’s overnight acquisition of such expensive equipment, but no matter. “King of California” may look and feel realistic, but it is really a Don Quixote-like fable about nonconformity and pursuing your impossible dream to the very end.Miranda, for all the wretched parenting she has endured, trusts her crazy father’s visionary purity. A poised, resourceful girl who has bamboozled each of several child welfare agencies into thinking she is being supervised by one or the other, she begins to believe her father’s fantasies may not be pie-in-the-sky.As parent-teenager stories go, “King of California” runs pointedly against the grain. The exact opposite of Ms. Wood’s character in “Thirteen,” Miranda doesn’t run wild. She is the responsible one, but on her own terms. The child is caretaker to the parent, who may be mad but who is also a holy fool, and holy fools are worth protecting.“King of California” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.Written and directed by Mike Cahill; director of photography, James Whitaker; edited by Glenn Garland; music by David Robbins; production designer, Dan Bishop; produced by Michael London, Alexander Payne, Avi Lerner and Randall Emmett; released by Millennium Films.

"'07-09-14,'1','The only clues he has are some JPEGs his son e-mailed to him, the memory of a desperate late-night phone call from the war zone and some smeary, scrambled video recovered from Mike’s cellphone. These hectic, unfocused clips stand in jarring, pointed contrast to the neatly composed frames and carefully paced shots that make up most of Mr. Haggis’s film, and they pose an agonizing challenge: How do you extract meaning from such chaos?To his great credit, Mr. Haggis tries to coax an answer out of his story rather than imposing one on it from the start, as he did in “Crash.” That film, which owes its best-picture Oscar to the dedication of its cast and the obviousness of its themes, turned racial intolerance into fodder for a self-righteous, schematic allegory.While “In the Valley of Elah” has its share of overreaching and throat clearing — including clumsy references to the biblical story of David and Goliath, the source of its title — it is mostly free of moral grandstanding. (A brief scene in which Hank gives voice to some of his half-buried ethnic bigotry is more credible than any of the similar moments that make up most of “Crash.”)Not that the message of “In the Valley of Elah” is ambiguous or unclear. The message is that the war in Iraq has damaged this country in ways we have only begun to grasp. For some people this will seem like old news. Others — in particular those who pretend that railing against movies they haven’t seen is a form of rational political discourse — may persuade themselves that it is provocative or controversial.But however you judge the movie’s politics, and whatever its flaws, there is something inarguable, something irreducibly honest and right, about Mr. Jones’s performance. Hank exists on a continuum with the other lawmen he has recently played, in particular the Texas sheriffs in “The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,” which he directed, and Joel and Ethan Coen’s “No Country for Old Men,” which will be released later this fall.Like them, Hank carries around an innate sense of right and wrong, and Mr. Jones’s creased face, at once kindly and severe, is a manifest sign of his old-school temperament. Hank is the kind of man who shines his shoes every night, says grace before each meal and makes his motel-room bed according to military standards.It’s unlikely that a veteran M.P., whose service covered at least some of the Vietnam years, would entertain the illusion that all fighting men are Boy Scouts. But it is clear that Hank has both a general fondness for soldiers and a father’s assumption that he knows his own son. That may be part of why the grisly nature of Mike’s fate, and the possibility that some of his buddies were responsible for it, disturbs him so much. Something, he suspects, has gone terribly wrong with the institutions and the men he has always loved and trusted.At every point, as Hank nags and pushes Emily in her investigation, the movie registers the panic and dread that he fights to keep down. These feelings come through to some extent in the reactions of his wife, Joan (Susan Sarandon), whom he tries to protect, but more decisively, and more hauntingly, through the moods Mr. Haggis creates (with the crucial assistance of Roger Deakins, the cinematographer responsible for the movie’s austere, washed-out look, and Mark Isham, who wrote the eerie, sparingly applied musical score).Almost no violence takes place on screen, but there are times when “In the Valley of Elah” feels almost like a horror film. Its steady crescendo of suspense builds toward the revelation — and vanquishing — of some unspeakable, monstrous evil.But since the monster has no identifiable physical shape, it is not so easily defeated. While there are killers, liars and sadists to be found in this movie, there are not really any villains. And there is no reassuring conclusion. If it is anguished, even despairing, “In the Valley of Elah” is also compassionate. At heart it is a somber ballad about young men who remain lost in a dangerous, confusing place even after they come home.“In the Valley of Elah” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There are some violent scenes and a general atmosphere of brutality and fear.IN THE VALLEY OF ELAHOpens today in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Paul Haggis; written by Mr. Haggis, based on a story by Mark Boal and Mr. Haggis; director of photography, Roger Deakins; edited by Jo Francis; music by Mark Isham; production designer, Laurence Bennett; produced by Patrick Wachsberger, Steven Samuels, Darlene Caamano Loquet, Mr. Haggis and Laurence Becsey; released by Warner Independent Pictures.

"'07-09-14,'1','MOSCOW, Sept. 14 — President Vladimir V. Putin’s little-known choice for prime minister was confirmed by Parliament today, a day after the nominee, Viktor A. Zubkov, suggested that he might consider running for president next year.With Mr. Putin’s party firmly in control of Parliament, Mr. Zubkov easily won approval, 381 to 47. Before the vote, he championed Mr. Putin’s economic platform, declaring that he would work to tamp down inflation, revitalize the defense industry and extract more revenues from natural resources.On Thursday, Mr. Zubkov stoked speculation about whether he intends to be more than simply a caretaker prime minister and instead become a candidate in the presidential race next year. “If I succeed in doing something in the post of premier, if I manage to do something, then I do not exclude this alternative, maybe, as well,” he told reporters during a visit to Parliament.It was not clear whether Mr. Zubkov’s statement about the presidency was planned or was merely an off-the-cuff remark from an official unused to the spotlight. Before his nomination, Mr. Zubkov was the chief of a low-profile federal financial crimes agency and had attracted little if any attention in political circles.That changed on Wednesday, when Prime Minister Mikhail Y. Fradkov announced his resignation and Mr. Putin immediately put forth Mr. Zubkov. The two have longstanding ties that date from their days in the city government in St. Petersburg in the early 1990s.'"

Mr. DiNapoli’s audit, released on Wednesday, found that the authority did not adequately keep track of the money it raised.

"'07-09-14,'1','The shelves and safes in Mr. Rosado’s pawnshop are stocked with such secrets: Ms. Maynard’s hoop earrings, the diamond-studded watch that Danny Bautista turned in to pay parking tickets on his truck, the two gold bracelets Martin Baez gave up to pay his cable bill.Pawnshops thrive in the Bronx; 65 of the city’s 162 licensed pawnshops are there, the most of any borough, according to the city’s Department of Consumer Affairs. The stores have multiplied not only in the Bronx but across the city and the country.The number of pawnshops in the United States has grown to about 12,000 today, from 4,800 in 1986, according to John P. Caskey, an economics professor at Swarthmore College who is the author of “Fringe Banking: Check-Cashing Outlets, Pawnshops and the Poor.” The increase is part of the spread of check-cashing outlets and other alternative financial services that have become ad hoc banks for the so-called unbanked — the millions of Americans who do not have a bank account.New York City recently began to offer needy residents no-fee starter accounts and $50, through a partnership with eight banks and credit unions.In the South Bronx, where census data puts the median household income at $21,088, the pawnshop is a neighborhood institution. It is where people with jobs but neither checking nor savings accounts seek cash for an unexpected bill. Where people with debt or bad credit go for an immediate loan of a few hundred dollars without a credit check. Where people go to put their jewelry to work for them, sometimes pawning the same item over and over again.“Most of the people that come in here live paycheck to paycheck,” said Mr. Rosado, 40, the co-owner of Mr. Pawnbroker, at 1016 Longwood Avenue.“They’re all working-class people,” he said. “They can’t manage their money properly, or because of the economy the way it is, they can’t seem to catch a break. Pampers, light bills, the rent is due, car payment, oil bill. It’s for a mountain of things.”To spend time behind the counter of Mr. Pawnbroker is to glimpse the commerce of the city at its most primitive and fluid. For a place filled with small, precious things, the pawnshop and its customers carry heavy burdens. The story of Ms. Maynard’s earrings and their eventual fate — like the hundreds of thousands of other items that pass in and out of the city’s pawnshops each year — illustrates the murky ground between financial help and sentimental regret, between luxury and necessity, that the stores occupy.Mr. Rosado’s establishment is nothing like the seedy stereotype of a New York City pawnshop. It is a brightly lighted storefront in Longwood, near the hum of the Bruckner Expressway.On a wall behind the bulletproof glass that separates the public area from the back office, Mr. Rosado keeps pictures of his wife and three children. He seems prepared for the worst (16 digital security cameras, a panic button to summon the police, a center counter reinforced with a steel plate) but eager for the best (decorating for Christmas, inviting friends and relatives for visits).Mr. Rosado — his given name is Radames, but everyone calls him Jay — is a husky, goateed former construction worker, a Bronx-born New Yorker who, in June, took his first vacation in 11 years. He and his wife, Ana, were married on Valentine’s Day 2004; the next day, he was back at the shop. He has fired two workers over the years, one of whom was a young woman who regularly showed up late and who happened to be his eldest daughter.He got his first job when he was 9. He pestered his father to buy him a pair of sneakers, and his father, a building superintendent, took him not to a shoe store, but to a grocery. His father wanted him to earn the money for the shoes by running errands at the store.Mr. Rosado stumbled into this line of work. He had struck up a friendship with the owner of a Bronx jewelry store, which led to his working at and eventually managing a pawnshop on Southern Boulevard. “I thought I’d work there for like a week or so,” Mr. Rosado said. He stayed about nine years before opening his own shop in 2003.Many of Mr. Rosado’s customers on Southern Boulevard followed him to Mr. Pawnbroker. His one business is for two kinds of patrons: those interested in buying jewelry and those interested in pawning it.The front of the shop is for buyers. It resembles a typical jewelry store, with rings, necklaces, earrings and other pieces laid out in glass counters, on the walls and in a window display. Mr. Rosado deals only in jewelry, as do most pawnshops in the city.On display in recent months were a $500 necklace, a $6,500 diamond engagement ring and an elaborate rendering of the Last Supper on a hollow 10-karat gold medallion. There was a diamond-encrusted charm in the shape of a grenade and another with the skull logo of the comic book character the Punisher. There were earrings with images of Jesus Christ and rings emblazoned with the flag of Puerto Rico.Help for Life’s Ups and DownsLike much of New York, the pawnbroker and his customers are locked in a daily game of winning and losing. Someone brings a piece of jewelry to Mr. Rosado. He determines its worth and gives the customer a cash loan, usually about one-third of the item’s resale value. The item sits in one of Mr. Rosado’s three safes in the back office, waiting.The customer has four months to pay back the loan and interest. The National Pawnbrokers Association, of which Mr. Rosado is a member, says that the typical pawnshop loan is $75 to $100. State law limits interest rates charged at pawnshops to 4 percent per month for four months. Mr. Rosado charges 3 percent of the original loan per month.With Mr. Rosado’s rates, someone who received a $100 loan would owe $119 in four months — $12 interest plus a $5 service fee and a $2 vault charge. In other states where pawnshops flourish, like Florida and Texas, the interest rates are much higher. As a result, the number of licensed pawnshops in New York City is considered low by industry standards.If a customer does not repay the loan after an additional two-month grace period, Mr. Rosado takes ownership of the item.The customer’s loss is also measured in more subtle, personal ways.One day, a young man in need of money walked into Mr. Pawnbroker and pawned the medallion with the image of the Last Supper. It was round and encircled with cubic zirconias, and the man pawned it reluctantly, Mr. Rosado said. The medallion sat in the back office for months. The man never returned.Mr. Rosado eventually put it out for display, and a woman from the neighborhood bought it for $650. “She wears it every day,” Mr. Rosado said.The cheapest items at Mr. Pawnbroker are 25-cent sweets in the candy dispensers that occupy one of the shop’s corners. The most valuable item sits on a spinning mirror in the window display, bathed in light.It is a palm-size, intricately detailed 14-karat gold motorcycle that Mr. Rosado spent a month building. The headlight has a tiny diamond in the center. He is so proud of the item, a replica of a custom-made motorcycle featured on the reality television series “American Chopper,” that he put a close-up snapshot of it on his business cards. He figures the piece is worth $10,000, but is reluctant to sell it at any price. Someone offered $20,000 for it, but Mr. Rosado said he turned the offer down.The public area glitters like a 24-karat mirage. At first glance, the jewelry seems out of place in the South Bronx, home to some of the city’s highest rates of unemployment, crime, drugs and poverty. But the desire for pricey jewelry is as prevalent among the tenements of the South Bronx as it is in any neighborhood of the city.The pawnshops, jewelry stores, retail businesses and residents seem to feed off one another, in an endless cycle of buying, selling, bartering and pawning.The hoop earrings Ms. Maynard pawned did not travel far: she had bought them at a jewelry store on Southern Boulevard blocks from Mr. Rosado’s pawnshop, which is within walking distance from her apartment on Longwood Avenue.Late one Friday afternoon in April, a 59-year-old woman who lives around the corner from Mr. Rosado’s shop stepped inside, pawned one of her necklaces, walked down a few doors to the dry cleaners and paid for her clothes with some of the cash she had just received. “You pay all your rent, you pay all your bills, and then you’re broke,” explained the woman, a day care center cook who did not want to give her name.Another day, a 30-ish woman came in looking for a diamond ring that she said her brother, a drug addict, had stolen from their mother’s house. Mr. Rosado, who keeps a computer copy of customer IDs, found the ring and showed it to her. Seeing it, she calmed down, and said she would work it out with her brother.Mr. Rosado examines jewelry for signs that it was pulled or yanked off someone’s wrist or neck, and he often turns away people whose demeanor, items or stories of how they came to possess the jewelry make him suspicious. One man tried to pawn a $120,000 Breitling watch, and he refused it.All but a handful of the borough’s 65 pawnshops are concentrated in the 16th Congressional District, which includes the South Bronx and several neighborhoods to the north. According to 2005 census figures, it is the poorest Congressional district in the country, with 41.6 percent of the population living below the federal poverty level. Here, the ancient symbol of pawnbroking— three hanging gold balls — is almost a common sight.Some of Mr. Rosado’s customers frequent several pawnshops in the area. Others visit only Mr. Rosado. These loyal regulars drop in often, and have become as close to their pawnbroker as some people are to their priest or rabbi. He has attended about a dozen funerals for his customers.He has also, for his regulars, kept jewelry for months after the six-month holding period, making it easier for them by giving them more time and by freezing the interest.When Mr. Rosado opened his pawnshop in 2003, Leticia Flores was his first customer. She had been one of his steady clients at the pawnshop on Southern Boulevard. “I always asked for him,” she said. “I never gave my jewelry to nobody else but him.”Ms. Flores used to work for Teamsters Local 202, and over the years amassed an extensive collection of jewelry — more than $80,000 worth. She once pawned some of it to help her sister pay her mortgage, and to pay the lawyer after her husband was sent to jail. There were other reasons, too, she said. “Let’s say if it was near Christmas and I didn’t have enough money, I would pawn my jewelry and then go shopping”Ms. Flores has not pawned anything in a long time. Back in 2003, after Mr. Rosado opened, she pawned her engagement ring for about $650. It was not because she needed the money. It was to welcome him to the neighborhood.From Monday to Saturday, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Mr. Rosado sits in a tall chair behind the counter watching, listening to, guiding and occasionally arguing with his clients. One customer recently pawned about 50 items to help pay her mortgage. Another pawned jewelry for a bus ticket to Connecticut. One man needed cash to send to his son in Puerto Rico for his birthday.Martin Baez, 45, pawns his jewelry weekly. One day a few months ago, he traded two gold bracelets — one of them a gift from his deceased mother-in-law — for $170. “Right now, I got to pay a cable bill,” he said. “As long as I get that paid off on the first, I’m covered.”Danny Bautista, 30, left an expensive watch that was a gift from his girlfriend. He received $450, money that went to pay off parking tickets. About three months later he picked up his watch, paying a total of $504.50, and said he did not plan to come back. “I regret doing it,” he said of pawning the watch, “and I don’t want to do it again.”One day, a young woman brought in a 14-karat gold chain. As she took it out of her purse, she told Mr. Rosado that she had found it. Then she changed her story and said it was hers. Mr. Rosado declined it, and the woman left.“We’re not allowed to take anything that’s been found, stolen,” Mr. Rosado said. Some customers, like Ms. Maynard, tell him nothing about why they need the money.Ms. Maynard said she did not have a credit card or bank account, and said that Mr. Rosado did her a favor when he lent her $80 for those hoop earrings.“I’m glad it was there, because I needed that money,” she said. “I wasn’t in the street. I didn’t have to ask anybody for money, even family.”She pawned the earrings in early April. In July, she had not returned to pay off the loan and the interest. “I just don’t have the money to get them out,” Ms. Maynard said in front of her apartment building, a short walk from where her earrings sat — and remain still — in a drawer in Mr. Rosado’s safe.'"
"'07-09-14,'1','The renewed scrutiny has been driven by revelations about Mr. Debat after a French news Web site, Rue 89, reported this week that an interview supposedly with Senator Obama was entirely made up. Mr. Debat, who could not be reached last night, sent an e-mail message to ABC yesterday saying the allegations against him “are slanderous.”He told The Washington Post Wednesday that an intermediary had spoken with Mr. Obama. But representatives for Mr. Obama denied that he spoke with anyone connected to Mr. Debat.Subsequently, other figures whose interviews appeared under Mr. Debat’s byline in the French magazine Politique Internationale have come forward to say they never spoke to him. These included Mr. Clinton; Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg; Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman; Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft; and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.After his departure from ABC News in June, Mr. Debat continued to work as a senior fellow for national security and terrorism at the Nixon Center in Washington until he resigned his post late Wednesday. He was quoted as a knowledgeable source in an article in the The Sunday Times this month, saying that American military forces were planning attacks that would demolish “the entire Iranian military.” He has also been quoted by many newspapers and news services.Guillemette Faure, a reporter for Rue 89, said doubts had been raised about an ABC report, with Mr. Debat as a source, during the buildup to the Iraq war. The report said that Uday Hussein, a son of Saddam Hussein, had ordered two French ballet students at gunpoint to have sex in public.Mr. Ross said in a telephone interview yesterday that ABC News had spoken with a representative of the ballet group involved in the incident and was satisfied that it had happened and that Mr. Debat’s information about terrorist activities in Europe and Pakistan had always been supported by other sources.Mr. Ross said that French officials had alerted ABC in late May that Mr. Debat’s academic credentials might not be valid and that ABC fired him promptly after verifying the information.But Pascal Riche, the editor of Rue 89, said yesterday that ABC did not hear questions about Mr. Debat’s credibility first from French officials in May. He said “whistle-blowers inside ABC” had long expressed doubts about Mr. Debat. Mr. Riche said Rue 89 would have further reporting on Mr. Debat soon.Correction: September 15, 2007  An article in Business Day yesterday about ABC’s review of some news reports that had relied on information from a freelance journalist who was later found to have written fake interviews for a French magazine misstated the freelancer’s relationship with the Nixon Center in Washington. The journalist, Alexis Debat, resigned his post as a senior fellow at the center late Wednesday; he is not still working there. The article also misidentified a British newspaper that quoted Mr. Debat earlier this month as a knowledgeable source saying that American military forces were planning attacks on the Iranian military. It was The Sunday Times, not The Times of London.'"
"'07-09-14,'1','Mickelson, who struggled early, was three under through 12 holes.Twenty players did not complete the first round, and will resume play Friday at 8 a.m.More rain in the wake of Hurricane Humberto is expected to roll through the area Friday, so tee times for the second round have been moved up to 9 a.m.The wild cards — the weather, which has gone from drought to downpour, and the bumpy greens — could make for an interesting ride to the finish Sunday. And there is no guarantee Woods and Mickelson will be able to get through their rounds Friday, because heavy storms are predicted for early in the afternoon.Clark said the lack of pressure was probably a factor in his round.“Maybe that’s a good thing for me that the attention is somewhere else,” Clark said. “I don’t have a chance to win the FedEx Cup, so really it’s not about me, it’s about this tournament right now.“The guys out there fighting for the FedEx Cup have probably got a lot more on their minds than I do right now.”Clark had six birdies and an eagle and never seemed fazed by the rain delay in the middle of the afternoon. He called his eagle on 15 lucky because the ball struck the pin, which kept it from flying past and ruining his terrific round.The players were not helped by any running on the fairways because of the soft conditions, but they were able to fire darts at the soft greens. Woods took just two shots before rain halted play and then came out more than three hours later and sank a birdie putt. He also birdied Nos. 2 and 3, but then cooled off.“I made a couple of putts, I don’t know how,” Woods said. “I hit them up there and they bounced all over the place and somehow went in.”Padraig Harrington finished his round and was in second place with a 63. John Rollins got through his round with a six-under 64, good for a tie for third place with Mark Calcavecchia.Steve Stricker, who is second in the FedEx Cup standings behind Woods, was one over through 11 holes.'"
"'07-09-14,'1','Oil prices have soared nearly fourfold since 2000 because of several factors: increased demand from China and India, declining production in Venezuela and Mexico and supply disruptions resulting from political crises in the Middle East and Africa.Gasoline prices have periodically spiked in recent years because of high crude prices and disruptions and tight capacity at American refineries.A fast-moving but relatively weak hurricane, Humberto, formed in the gulf and hit Texas and Louisiana Thursday morning, causing power disruptions and shutdowns at three refineries in Texas. The shutdowns are expected to last only a day or two, but traders said they remained concerned that other storms could disrupt oil production in the gulf. September is the peak month for hurricanes.“It could have been a lot worse,” said Michael Rose, director of the energy trading desk at Angus Jackson in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Mr. Rose said he thought the $80.09 close was close to “the crescendo top” and within the next couple of months “I think we’ll go back to the 70s and then test the upper 60s.”Recent price swings in crude oil came after some hedge funds and other traders pulled out of the market, distracted by a credit squeeze. But many traders jumped back into oil in recent days as they sensed that prices might move higher.Not only are storms threatening production in the gulf, but the oil market was generally not encouraged by an announcement this week from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC said it would raise output by a relatively modest 500,000 barrels a day to put some downward pressure on prices, a tactic that has not worked so far.Energy analysts said the situation would be more worrisome if the summer driving season were not over. Gasoline demand has dropped in the last three weeks.“Once the latest storm threat passes, we may see pump prices drop with the autumn leaves,” said Tom Kloza, an analyst with the Oil Price Information Service.But traders said all bets were off if a serious hurricane hit the gulf, as Rita and Katrina did two years ago, crippling production and sending prices soaring. Traders expressed concern about a new Atlantic storm that the National Hurricane Center is calling Tropical Depression 8. Its path is unpredictable, but energy experts said as long as it gathered strength it would add to the pressure on energy prices.Crude oil broke briefly through $80 during the day Wednesday after the Department of Energy reported that American crude and gasoline inventories as well as refinery activity had fallen more sharply than expected. Wednesday’s close of $79.91, though falling shy of the psychologically important $80 mark, was itself a record.The October gasoline futures contract rose 3.04 cents, to almost $2.05 a gallon. The national average price for unleaded gasoline was $2.82 a gallon last week, 20 cents higher than a year ago.Heating oil futures have climbed more than 10 percent to record levels in the last month, and energy experts predicted they would keep rising over the next few days.Mr. Rose of Angus Jackson and other analysts, however, said that gasoline and heating oil should follow the price of crude downward this fall. “I think that by the time this all filters through, crude oil, heating oil and unleaded gasoline will all be lower in the next two months,” Mr. Rose said.Mr. Yergin said he believed that Persian Gulf suppliers would soon pump additional oil, relieving tight markets. He said some OPEC members were reluctant to pump too much oil at a time when the economy is weakening for fears of causing a collapse in the price of oil similar to one that occurred a decade ago.Oil producers are well aware that if they allow the price of oil to get too high, they could help tip the economy into recession.As high as oil prices appear to many consumers, experts noted that they are nowhere near the levels reached during the supply crisis in early 1980. Adjusted for today’s dollars, a barrel of oil then sold for the equivalent of almost $102.'"

"'07-09-14,'1','The licensing dispute between the estate of the reggae singer Bob Marley and the Universal Music Group took an ugly turn yesterday, with nobody getting together or feeling the least bit all right.At issue is an agreement struck last month for Verizon Wireless to become the exclusive provider of ring tones from the catalog of Mr. Marley, who died in 1981. Universal, a subsidiary of Vivendi, owns the rights to the music.Mr. Marley’s family promptly objected to the deal, calling it tantamount to an endorsement and saying that it required their approval. The family threatened to sue to block the arrangement.Yesterday, early in the afternoon, it looked as if Verizon Wireless was removing itself from the fray. The Marley family issued a statement that it would not follow through with plans to file a suit against the carrier for trademark infringement because Verizon had “ceded” to its demands and taken most of the 44 ring tones by the singer off the Verizon Wireless Web site. Sixteen ring tones remained on the site, songs from early in Mr. Marley’s career that are owned by companies other than Universal.But in announcing that Verizon had changed course, the family was less than conciliatory. In a written statement, Chris Blackwell, a longtime spokesman for the family, said that he was “infuriated that Verizon would go around the estate and initiate partnership with Universal” and that it was “disturbing that these companies refuse to give the musicians the respect they deserve.”'"
"'07-09-14,'1','Stocks advanced solidly yesterday, led by strong gains among the blue chips and the mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, which signaled a possible thawing in the credit markets with the announcement that it had lined up $12 billion in additional financing.“It appears that this credit crunch may not be as bad as some people thought,” said Kent G. Croft, president of Croft Leominster Investment Management, crediting the Countrywide news with lifting overall investor sentiment.While he warned further examples of credit distress were likely to pop up, he said much of the intransigence in the credit markets could ease as fear dissipates.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 133.23 points, or 1 percent, to 13,424.88. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 12.39 points, or 0.84 percent, to 1,483.95, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 8.99 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,601.06. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.45 points, or 0.31 percent, to 780.35.Government bond prices fell sharply as stocks advanced and investors grew more confident they could move out of the safest bets.

"'07-09-14,'1','Jagr said he was happy to hear the news of the Drury and Gomez signings, but he also understood the hard part of stockpiling stars.“Only one thing scares me,” Jagr said. “I don’t want it to be here like six years ago.”Before the 2004 lockout, when there was no salary cap, the Rangers bought some of the most expensive talent on the market, and went nine years without making the playoffs.Gomez and Drury certainly came with price tags that brought flashbacks to the era before the salary cap, more than $7 million each. Between them, they have won three Stanley Cup titles. They were accustomed to being offensive stars on their previous teams: Gomez with the Devils and Drury with the Sabres. Drury was Buffalo’s captain.But they also arrived saying the right things about fitting into a team with a dynamic captain, and a vocal assistant captain in Shanahan.“Once your goal is you want to win, everyone has to buy into that,” Gomez said. “When everyone buys into that, you leave the egos at the door. You’ve got to be just as happy for the next guy. No matter who scores and who does what, all that matters is the 2 points and the W’s at the end.”Many Rangers have been skating together here for the past several weeks, getting a jump on becoming a team. Gomez moved to Manhattan from New Jersey, and Drury also relocated his family to the city.Jagr flew in from the Czech Republic on Wednesday, eager to see how it would all fit together. Practices begin in earnest Friday. The first preseason game is next Friday, and the season opener is Oct. 4 at home against Florida.In becoming part of the group, Drury said he could draw on his experience with Colorado early in his career. For four seasons, Drury played in a constellation of stars that included Patrick Roy, Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg, Ray Bourque and Rob Blake. That group won a Stanley Cup in 2001 after several years of coming close.“I think the biggest thing I learned from my first four years in Colorado is everyone just has the same goal in mind,” Drury said. “It’s a long year, and there’s ups and downs, day in and day out, and you have to keep that goal in the back of your mind and trying to get there.”Each of the new, expensive Rangers will be judged by how the season ends, not by how it starts.“We can’t just say: ‘Hey we’re the New York Rangers. We’ve got this and this guy,’ ” Gomez said. “If we do everything we’re capable of, we’re going to be a tough team to beat, and that’s all you can ask.”'"
"'07-09-14,'1','The disarray inside the Liberal Democratic Party and recent gains by the main opposition Democratic Party will almost certainly interrupt, and perhaps end, the Japanese naval force’s six-year role supporting the war in Afghanistan.In announcing his resignation, Mr. Abe said a more popular successor would be better able to extend the naval force’s mission past its scheduled expiration on Nov. 1.But because of the resignation, and with time needed to select a new prime minister and form a new cabinet, the governing party will be unable to overcome opposition objections before the expiration, said Gen Nakatani, a member of Mr. Abe’s party who served as defense minister when the law was first passed in 2001.“It’s now 100 percent sure that our ships will have to come back at least once,” Mr. Nakatani said in an interview, adding that he hoped the mission would resume under a new law. “In the international community, it’s important to carry out a mission to the end. If we withdraw at this stage, all that we have accomplished will go down the drain.”Urged by the United States to shoulder greater military responsibilities, Japan has passed laws since 2001 to circumvent its pacifist Constitution and allow it to assist in the American-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. President Bush and other American officials have pressed Japan to extend its mission in the Indian Ocean, where its ships have been refueling American and other vessels taking part in the war in Afghanistan.Debate over the law allowing that mission is expected to lead to a larger discussion about Japan’s security alliance with the United States and the increasingly assertive military.The Democratic Party opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa, has said Japan’s military should take part only in United Nations-led missions. Members of Mr. Ozawa’s party have said that under Mr. Abe and his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, Japan grew too close militarily with the United States at the expense of its relations with its neighbors.“Koizumi and Bush, Abe and Bush — from our perspective, those relationships were too close,” Shinkun Haku, a Democratic Party lawmaker who is a member of the upper house of Parliament’s foreign affairs and defense committee, said in an interview. “I don’t deny that the Japan-U.S. alliance is our most important one. But is it right to look only to the United States and turn our backs on China and South Korea?”Opposition lawmakers said they would use their new control over the upper house to extract more information about the exact nature of Japan’s military assistance in the Indian Ocean.Kenji Eda, an independent lawmaker, said some of the oil supplied by Japan might have been used in Iraq instead of Afghanistan, and in other ways that possibly contravened Japan’s antiterrorism law. The government has denied the charges.“The actual conditions surrounding the refueling mission have barely been explained,” Mr. Eda, who has pressed the government to release more details, said in an interview. “Until now, the governing party used its large majority to easily extend the law.”Mr. Haku added: “We have no idea what’s happening on the other side of the ocean. We’re told that everything’s going well, but there’s no way to know the truth.”'"
"'07-09-14,'1','MOSCOW, Sept. 13 — President Vladimir V. Putin’s little-known choice to be prime minister suggested on Thursday that he might consider running for president next year, stoking speculation about whether he intends to be more than simply a caretaker.“If I succeed in doing something in the post of premier, if I manage to do something, then I do not exclude this alternative, maybe, as well,” said the nominee, Viktor A. Zubkov, responding to questions from reporters about his presidential ambitions during an appearance at Parliament in Moscow.It was not clear whether Mr. Zubkov’s statement about the presidency was planned or was merely an off-the-cuff remark from an official unused to the spotlight. Before his nomination, Mr. Zubkov was the chief of a low-profile federal financial crimes agency and had attracted little if any attention in political circles.That changed on Wednesday, when Prime Minister Mikhail Y. Fradkov announced his resignation and Mr. Putin immediately put forth Mr. Zubkov. The two have longstanding ties that date from their days in the city government in St. Petersburg in the early 1990s.Mr. Putin has repeatedly promised that he will step down next year after eight years in office, abiding by the constitutional limit of two consecutive terms. Whoever he endorses for president is all but assured to win the election next March, political experts here say, but Mr. Putin has kept his decision to himself, if he has in fact made one.'"
"'07-09-14,'1','Inevitably, the first question patients ask about morphine is: But isn’t it addictive?Pain specialists draw a distinction between physical dependence and addiction. The World Health Organization no longer even uses the word “addiction,” which it regards as stigmatizing.Physical dependence includes developing a tolerance for the drug, meaning that increasingly higher doses may be needed to get pain relief — sometimes doses that would kill anyone taking the drug for the first time. Dependence also includes withdrawal symptoms, such as violent tremors, nausea and diarrhea, if the drug is abruptly stopped. Medical experts regard these as inevitable consequences of narcotic use. . By contrast, addiction is “compulsive use, continued despite it doing harm to the patient, who is taking it for the mood-altering effects” rather than for pain, said David E. Joranson, director of the pain and policy studies group at the University of Wisconsin’s medical school.In patients with genuine pain, the risk of addiction “is small and can be managed,” said Dr. Scott M. Fishman, former president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine. Tendencies toward addiction are genetic, he added. “Some are going to manifest it no matter what they get from a doctor, and there are others whom I can give all the drugs in the world and they’ll never get addicted.”Tsutomu Suzuki and Minoru Narita, toxicologists at Tokyo’s Hoshi University and consultants to the World Health Organization, work with mice subjected to chronic pain by injecting formalin in their paws or by severing hip nerves. They demonstrated that pain itself causes physical changes in the brain not just in the nerve pathways that normally transmit painful sensations, but also in the dopamine pathways that convey pleasure.Pain suppresses the formation of one type of dopamine receptor, while narcotics stimulate formation of an opposing receptor. In pain-free mice, overstimulation of the second type of receptor leads to euphoria, and the mice respond by seeking more narcotic. But in mice experiencing chronic pain, narcotics serve to restore the balance between the two receptor types. When the pain subsides, the mice can be weaned off the drugs.'"
"'07-09-14,'1','Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, said yesterday that it had lined up $12 billion of financing to help weather a housing slowdown that it expects to lead to widespread layoffs.The company said it obtained the secured financing through new or existing credit lines. On Aug. 16, it had drawn down $11.5 billion from credit lines because it was unable to sell short-term debt to finance regular operations.Countrywide, based in Calabasas, Calif., said it had also financed $34.4 billion of mortgage loans in August, down 17.3 percent from a year earlier, as it tightened lending standards.Daily applications fell 11.8 percent, to $2.33 billion. Countrywide’s pipeline of mortgages being processed fell 16.8 percent from July, to $51.8 billion.A Credit Suisse analyst, Moshe Orenbuch, wrote that Countrywide’s success in finding new sources of capital “should substantially address funding concerns.”“As origination volumes and mortgage pipeline decline over the coming months, “ he continued, “we expect the stress on its funding needs should subside significantly.”'"

"'07-09-15,'0','The Ferrari mechanic Nigel Stepney was a right-hand man to Brawn. According to the federation report, as early as mid-March, at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Stepney began to communicate with his friend and former colleague, Mike Coughlan, McLaren’s chief designer, about details of Ferrari’s car and team strategy.Ferrari claimed it had been tipped off about a 780-page document found at Coughlan’s home in England by an employee of a copy shop in Woking, where McLaren is based. The employee was a Ferrari fan, and Ferrari became suspicious about the document.But Stepney told the British news media in early July that Ferrari had been following his movements all season.On July 4, McLaren said the data had not been transferred to the car or used by anyone else, and that it had been an isolated incident involving a rogue employee.But the evidence issued Friday suggested otherwise. Coughlan and Stepney were shown to be communicating regularly not only since before the first race of the season, but also with two McLaren drivers.Coughlan, who had worked with the McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa at another team years ago, shared some information in e-mail exchanges with de la Rosa.“Hi Mike, do you know the Red Car’s Weight Distribution?” de la Rosa wrote in an e-mail to Coughlan on March 21, three days after the first race. “It would be important for us to know so that we could try it in the simulator.” At the hearing Thursday, de la Rosa confirmed that Coughlan had responded by text message “with precise details of Ferrari’s weight distribution.”De la Rosa then sent an e-mail to the McLaren driver Fernando Alonso, the reigning world champion, setting out the Ferrari’s weight distribution.“Its weight distribution surprises me,” Alonso responded in an e-mail. “I don’t know either if it’s 100 percent reliable, but at least it draws attention.”De la Rosa responded on March 25, saying: “All the information from Ferrari is very reliable. It comes from Nigel Stepney, their former chief mechanic.”In June, Ferrari started proceedings in court in Modena, Italy, against Stepney. The Italian police provided the racing federation with evidence that showed Coughlan and Stepney had exchanged 288 text messages and 35 telephone calls between March 11 and July 3.For F.I.A., this evidence seemed to nullify the argument that two rogue employees had simply been sharing data.The report said the evidence led F.I.A. “to conclude that some degree of sporting advantage was obtained, though it may forever be impossible to quantify that advantage in concrete terms.”On Friday, the McLaren chairman, Ron Dennis, continued to deny the team had gained any advantage and pointed out that he had supplied some of the final evidence after he learned about it in August.“We now have seven days to appeal and are carefully considering the company’s position once we have a full understanding of the F.I.A.’s findings,” Dennis said.'"
"'07-09-15,'0','Next, however, came a bit of good news: The city determined that the building was structurally sound after all, with the exception of the furniture store, Capital Wide Furniture and Mattress Warehouse. The owner, Johnny Diaz, had sunk his life savings into it, plus about $200,000.“It’s a total loss to me,” said Mr. Diaz, 41, the married father of four children. The collapse rendered about $350,000 worth of furniture unsalable, including some pieces that had been reduced to little more than scrap when the 100-foot north side wall fell in, slightly injuring one of Mr. Diaz’s three employees. He hopes that insurance will cover at least some of his losses.The other shop owners, however, had reason to believe that the worst was over. Once the gas and electricity were turned back on, they could reopen.“They said we would have the opportunity to move back, so we were very happy,” said Julio Pomariko, 61, the owner of Canal Buy and Sell, a pawnshop he opened 25 years ago.In the meantime, the building’s owner, Nick Anagnostopoulos, had workers take off the roof for required asbestos abatement work, officials said. No one, however, placed a tarp over the hole where the roof had been.Several of the business owners, including Mr. Pomariko and Dr. Harsha Mehta, whose dental office has been in the building for 25 years, fear that some of their equipment may have been ruined by recent storms. Although they have been allowed back into their businesses to retrieve some items, they have not yet been able to get everything out.Finally, the coup de grâce: This week, Mr. Anagnostopoulos told his tenants that he intended to tear down the entire building — Mr. Diaz’s furniture store, Imelda Caraballo’s New Shampoo Unisex barbershop, Mr. Pomariko’s Canal Buy and Sell, Peter Min’s Queens Vision Optical, and Dr. Mehta’s dental practice — and replace it with a new structure.Mr. Anagnostopoulos did not return calls seeking comment, but tenants and James F. Gennaro, the City Council member who represents the area and who has been trying to help the business owners, fear that the owner is not eager to save space for his old tenants.“He is using this opportunity to get out of his leases,” said Mr. Gennaro, whose father still owns a small business, Gennaro’s Jewelers, on Long Island. Mr. Gennaro and the tenants are planning to demonstrate in front of the building tomorrow to draw attention to their concerns.As for the tenants, all they want is a place to reopen their businesses, they said, preferably in the neighborhood.“I’ve been here so long, I’m afraid to look anywhere else,” Mr. Pomariko said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen.”'"

The first wave of baby boomers will be eligible for early retirement next year, marking a turning point, analysts say, that will eventually force hard choices, including whether to require workers to pay more into the Social Security and Medicare systems and whether to scale back benefits for retirees or raise the age at which retirees are eligible for benefits.Mr. Thompson has been characteristically vague when it comes to detailing a strategy to combat the looming crisis, although in a recent interview with The Washington Post he said he would have opposed the recent prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, calling it “a $17 trillion add-on to a program that’s going bankrupt.” Pressed for more specifics, his campaign offered few details yesterday.Washington has been reluctant to touch Social Security, which last went through major changes in 1983, after a bipartisan commission tried to assure its long-term solvency through a mix of benefit reductions cuts and tax increases. Experts say another fix is now needed.“The dilemma candidates now face is that if you tell the truth about the hard choices and where you stand, you might not get elected,” said David R. Gergen, professor of public service at Harvard University and an adviser to Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.“But if you don’t tell the truth and manage to win, you can’t govern,” Mr. Gergen added. “It’s clear Thompson is trying to reach the conservative base and say, I care about your concerns.”The problem is not just Mr. Thompson’s. Other candidates, Republican and Democratic, are also doing a delicate dance around the issue. But it is perhaps most acute for Mr. Thompson because he is positioning himself as the small-government conservative in the race.He proclaims the fact that he voted for tax cuts while in the Senate, and against bills that he said included wasteful spending, including one farm measure. He voted for the No Child Left Behind education bill, a stance that has caused him some regret on the campaign trail. (He has said that at the time he did not realize what the ultimate outcome would be.)Mr. Thompson often cites the future burden of government spending, but usually with broad generalizations. In Greenville last week, he said, “One thing that concerns me is that while our attention is there and our economy right now is good, so many in Congress are busily at work — and that in itself ought to make you concerned — they’re busily at work spending the money of future generations.”At another point he said, “I wonder what these kids would say, I wonder what the unborn would say if they had a seat at the table, what they would say to us, what they would think about us.”To some extent, Mr. Thompson cannot afford not to talk about such issues. “Basically the whole game for any Republican right now is base mobilization,” said Jack M. Burkman, a Republican strategist and lobbyist. “Whoever gets their base out the best on Feb. 5 is going to be the nominee. Those are hot-button issues for different parts of the base.”But going forward, Mr. Thompson will probably be pressed to outline his plan for dealing with entitlement spending.“What does he stand for?” asked Stephen Hess, a professor at George Washington University who has worked for two Republican presidents. “Being for small government ain’t sufficient in the Republican Party.”'"
"'07-09-15,'0','A weakness, though, is that the dancers are seen in too limited a range of positions. One shot of female dancers, knee-high in topiary and bending forward, is striking; we don’t need four.You can glimpse connections of choreographic shape and garden location. One grouping shows three pairs of dancers in fantail shapes, each pair hanging diagonally on either side of a tall topiary bush. Another has two men holding Jennifer Goggans in a downward diagonal; behind them, a tiered fountain is flanked by grand staircases. A third shows the two men supporting either end of her as she holds an off-balance outstretched position; in the background, two stone urns flank a spreading path that opens onto a lawn, with a line of distant statues behind.The book is beautiful in its own right. What it isn’t, though, is a serious or sustained demonstration of the long-term connection between Mr. Cunningham and nature.In 2002, the Aperture Foundation brought out a charming and surprising volume, “Other Animals: Drawings and Journals by Merce Cunningham,” which did more along these lines. As few people knew, Mr. Cunningham had been drawing animals and plants in his journal for 20 years. “Other Animals,” eschewing chronological sequence, was an anthology of these drawings, of pages from his diary (some going back to 1972) and of photographs of his repertory.Mr. Cunningham wrote that he was encouraged to develop these drawings by the art dealer Margarete Roeder; in June and July this year, she presented a new exhibition of further Cunningham animal-bird drawings at her gallery on lower Broadway.The drawings are vividly colored cartoons, with enough fantasy to resemble the drawings of Edward Lear or Quentin Blake. Mr. Cunningham catches the characteristics of a species, then heightens them in one way or another: he colors a sea lion mauve or puts a quizzical expression into a grasshopper’s eye. Or he crams a whole range of animals and birds onto the same page, as if placing in one cage species that could never coexist in real life.This brings us close to some of Mr. Cunningham’s choreographic methods: he loves to take movements from different sources and splice them onto one another, and to juxtapose opposites. One of his most beloved works of the 1990s, “Beachbirds,” at first seems almost disappointing in the literal details with which it brings specific avian features to life.What makes the piece fascinating on further viewing, however, is that Mr. Cunningham is connecting features from very different species of birds: the open wingspan of a seagull in flight, the flutter of a duck’s wings on the shore, the stance of a penguin. Sometimes “Beachbirds” (filmed in 1992 as “Beachbirds for Camera”) seems to interbreed two or more contrasting species at the same time; at other times it shows one morphing into another. The morphing is a famous characteristic of his own role in “Solo” (1975, filmed in the 1977 “Event for Television”), in which Mr. Cunningham, then in his late 50s, seemed to keep changing into different animals.Few artists of any kind have done so much to imagine animal realms undisturbed by humans; certainly no other choreographer. The paradox here is that Mr. Cunningham avoids country life, even though his partner and long-term artistic associate, John Cage, loved it. Mr. Cunningham’s childhood in Washington State gave him a love of wildlife, but no sooner did he set foot on a New York sidewalk in 1939, age 20, than he said, “This is home,” and his taste hasn’t changed.He has often visited zoos (“Solo” was inspired by a visit to the San Diego Zoo), and his choreography has also long shown his devotion to TV nature programs, not least the camera methods. In the 1980s, several of his works evoked the safari and underwater wildlife films of the era in their traveling sequences, framing and rhythm. But cameras have changed since then, with wildlife often shown on screen in astonishing close-up, and so has Mr. Cunningham’s choreography.The aspect of his work most evoked by “Green World” is simply the unparalleled range of spectacular sites in which he has staged dances over the decades: against an ocean still full of late-afternoon swimmers in Perth, Australia; in the Piazza San Marco in Venice; in Grand Central Terminal and in the open air at the World Financial Center (in view of the Statue of Liberty); in the Baroque courtyard of the Palais Royal in Paris; in the Roman theater at Arles, France; in three separate spaces in the Turbine Hall at the Tate Modern in London (only if you looked high up into the mirrored ceiling could you see all the dances at once); against the ruins of Persepolis in Iran. And here amid the vast and poetic gardens of Vizcaya.'"
"'07-09-15,'0','Dr. Joseph W. Eschbach, a leading kidney specialist whose studies in the 1960’s led to a dramatic improvement in the treatment of anemia in patients on dialysis, died on Sept. 7 at his home in Bellevue, Wash. He was 74.The cause was lung cancer, his family said.Dr. Eschbach began studying anemia as a young researcher in nephrology at the University of Washington. The disorder causes a decline in red blood cells and interrupts the delivery of oxygen to the body’s tissues. About 90 percent of patients undergoing dialysis for kidney failure become anemic, a condition once treated with blood transfusions that could expose them to hepatitis and other diseases.Working with a hematologist, Dr. John W. Adamson, Dr. Eschbach looked at various forms of renal failure and the role of a natural hormone, erythropoietin, also known as EPO, in the formation of red blood cells. Studying sheep and other animals in the 1970s, the two scientists helped establish that EPO stimulates the production of red cells in bone marrow and could lead to a treatment for anemia in humans.In the 1980s, Dr. Eschbach, who had a large private practice in Seattle, and others helped lead a clinical trial for a synthetic form of the hormone produced by Amgen, a California biotechnology company. The trial was successful, and its results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1987.In 1989, the Food and Drug Administration approved the hormone, called Epogen, which remains in use.Dr. Christopher R. Blagg, a nephrologist and emeritus professor of medicine at Washington, said the development of the drug led to “a difference in patients’ well-being that was as strong and as dramatic as what we saw with the advent of the kidney transplant.”Throughout his career, Dr. Eschbach combined research with its clinical application. He was an early advocate of treating kidney patients at home, if possible, instead of in the hospital, and was director of home dialysis at Washington from 1965 to 1972.Joseph Wetherill Eschbach was born in Detroit. He graduated from Otterbein College before earning a medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in 1959.He became a clinical instructor at Washington in 1965, and was named a clinical professor of nephrology there in 1975. Dr. Eschbach was also a senior research associate at Northwest Kidney Centers in Seattle, where he was a former president of the board. He retired in 2003.'"

"'07-09-15,'0','“What is dance today, and how does it fit into the larger cultural picture?” Carla Peterson, the artistic director of Dance Theater Workshop, asked on Thursday night during a post-performance discussion of Charlotte Vanden Eynde and Kurt Vandendriessche’s “Map Me.”No one answered that query — nor did “Map Me,” an enigmatic duo performed with chilly, surgical precision by its Belgian creators. But it certainly raised the question, even before Ms. Peterson gave it voice.In “Map Me,” the compactly built Mr. Vandendriessche and Ms. Vanden Eynde, an angelic-faced, slim-bodied blonde, lie on their sides on top of each other so that their joined naked backs form a blank screen for a series of video projections. Striations, bruises, burns and nasty-looking rashes bloom and disappear.Later the dancers stand, their bodies passive vessels for other images. Ms. Vanden Eynde’s body appears to be carved up into drawers that are opened and closed; Mr. Vandendriessche’s body is “built” by light that illuminates, segment by segment, his torso and limbs.Up to this point, “Map Me” — performed entirely nude (almost obligatory these days), in utter silence and with a notable economy of gesture — feels theoretical, like someone’s dissertation project or a museum installation.But in a subsequent section called “join me,” in which the pair create headpieces of brown tape that bind their heads together as if they were conjoined twins, the work suddenly flares into brilliant life.'"
"'07-09-15,'0','The National Football League has recently faced questions about its handling of concussions after four former players were found to have significant brain damage as early as their mid-30s. But teenagers are more susceptible to immediate harm from such injuries because, studies show, their brain tissue is less developed than adults’ and more easily damaged. High school players also typically receive less capable medical care, or none at all.At least 50 high school or younger football players in more than 20 states since 1997 have been killed or have sustained serious head injuries on the field, according to research by The New York Times.Experts say many of these accidents could have been prevented by simple awareness of and respect for their gravity.Poor management of high school players’ concussions “isn’t just a football issue,” said Robert Sallis, president of the American College of Sports Medicine. “It’s a matter of public health.”Interviews with players indicate that even those aware of the dangers of concussions ignore them. Coaches, trainers and parents can detect a gimpy knee or a separated shoulder, and act. But a concussion is often the player’s secret. It is the one injury no one sees — until a case like Will Benson’s, which no one forgets.Benson carried himself with a verticality that captivated teachers, classmates and coaches. A handsome, straight-A student headed for the Ivy League, he was the star quarterback for St. Stephen’s Episcopal School in Austin, Tex.“He loved the idea of playing for his teammates and his brothers on that battlefield of the gridiron,” recalled his good friend and classmate Kashif Sweet, now a senior at Columbia. “He was a naturally tough kid with a high threshold for pain. He liked to endure things, to conquer things, and have people follow him.”On a play during St. Stephen’s first game of 2002, as a pile of bodies grew too dense to see through, a crack was heard throughout the stadium: the sound of helmet meeting helmet, two shells of polycarbonate alloy crashing together.Watching from the stands, Judy Ryser, Benson’s mother, heard the sound — everyone did — and turned to a friend next to her.“Oh, my goodness,” she said. “I hope that wasn’t Will.”In the stifling heat of July in Alabama, hundreds of high school players from across the United States gathered at Hoover High School outside Birmingham, preparing to compete in a preseason tournament. They ambled about the field in baggy polyester shorts, helmets dangling from their fingers. Give them each five years and 50 pounds, and it could be an N.F.L. rookie camp.Some sat on the grandstand’s metal benches, waiting for their games to begin. They were asked about concussions.Garrick Jones, a senior quarterback at Whitehaven High School in Memphis, said he sustained one last year: He was briefly knocked unconscious when a linebacker picked him up and threw him to the ground on his head. No flag was thrown. He said he wobbled to the huddle, took the next snap and dropped back to pass before his vision blurred completely.“I couldn’t come out — my team needed me,” Jones said. “You have to keep playing — until you can’t.”Some players airily guessed at describing a concussion: “You feel dizzy and stuff”; “when you’re cross-eyed”; “when you feel real sleepy”; “it’s like when you turn into someone else.” Only a few of more than 50 players interviewed at the tournament came close to defining the injury: a blow to the head that causes the brain to crash into the skull. Concussion — the word derives from the Latin concutere, meaning shake violently — is typically followed by dizziness, headache, nausea, lethargy, impaired vision or other disruptions in brain function.Studies show that concussions are drastically underreported in high school football in part because many youngsters — even adults — still mistakenly think the injury requires the player to have been knocked unconscious. Athletic trainers report about 5 percent of high school players as having had a concussion each season, studies show, but formal widespread surveys of players strongly suggest the number is much higher.Anonymous questionnaires that ask specifically about concussions have reported rates among high school football players at about 15 percent each season; when the word concussion is omitted and a description of symptoms is provided instead, close to 50 percent of players say they had one, with 35 percent reporting two or more. Although concussions remain one of the more imprecise diagnoses in sports medicine — magnetic resonance imaging exams and CAT scans cannot detect them — the players’ testimony has been taken by experts to indicate that a vast majority of concussions are not treated.Asked to define a concussion, Josh Bailey, a senior safety at Patterson High in Louisiana, could not. After being told, he said he definitely had one last year, when his head slammed against another player’s knee. He said no one noticed, and he never considered leaving the game.“Football, it’s all about contact — you kind of have to suck it up,” Bailey said. “Because you’re going to feel pain. That’s what the game is about. If you don’t put yourself through that, you don’t really love the game.”The crack on the St. Stephen’s field five years ago was indeed the sound of Will Benson’s helmet slamming into another. He played the rest of the game, which his team lost. Admitting to headaches several days later, Benson sat out the next game — and St. Stephen’s lost again.“He felt a lot of responsibility,” recalled Jay Lamy, a volunteer coach that season. “He didn’t want to let his teammates down. He knew the impact that he had.”That influence was felt the next Friday night. Filling his No. 7 uniform as only a star quarterback can, Benson ran for a touchdown in the first quarter.But later in the half, with seemingly no provocation, he took off his helmet and walked off the field. Benson told his coach he felt weird and had “big blobs” in his vision. He sat on the bench and put a towel over his head. Then a golf cart took him to the trainer’s room.A few minutes later, Benson was screaming in a way that no one present will ever forget.“Mom!” he shrieked before he lost consciousness.Doctors call it second-impact syndrome. Almost solely among teenagers, sustaining another blow to the head — even a seemingly benign one — before a first has healed can set off a devastating chain of metabolic events: Cerebral blood flow increases, arteries swell past capacity, and pressure builds inside the brain, often leading to coma and death. Helmets can do only so much to keep youngsters’ brains from sloshing inside their skulls, like the yolk inside an egg.A recent study in The American Journal of Sports Medicine led by Barry P. Boden of the Orthopaedic Center in Rockville, Md., found that catastrophic football head injuries were three times as prevalent among high school players as college players — and that “an unacceptably high percentage of high school players were playing with residual symptoms from a prior head injury.”For many victims, staying alive is only the first challenge. Kort Breckenridge of Tetonia, Idaho, has trouble holding down a job because of short-term memory problems stemming from a football brain injury two years ago. Brady Beran of Lincoln, Neb., emerged from a coma reading at a kindergarten level; he remains in physical therapy with hopes of running again.Second-impact syndrome is relatively rare, however. Experts said that for every such case there can be hundreds of victims of postconcussion syndrome, leaving youngsters depressed, irritable and unable to concentrate, and they sometimes miss school for weeks or perform poorly on tests. Ben Mangan of Lewisburg, Ohio, still has mood swings and cognitive problems deriving from at least one major concussion in 2002.“It definitely has held me back in progressing through school,” said Mangan, now 20 and attending a small Ohio college. “I was a B student in math before, but now I sit there and I’m like, Why can’t I get this? I’ll do the same problem five times and keep getting different answers. It’s really frustrating.”With no limp or wince to advertise most concussions, coaches and sideline medical staff must be keenly aware of their signs; waiting for gross disorientation or nausea invites disaster.Diagnostic methods vary in science and scope, but most involve asking questions to gauge a player’s awareness, testing short-term memory by repeating strings of words and numbers backward and forward, and administering short pencil-and-paper tests. Players are encouraged to be re-examined after physical exertion to see if headache or cognitive problems return.Many school districts require an ambulance and paramedics to be on-site in case of emergencies, but a sideline physician is often a luxury. Only 42 percent of high schools in the United States have access to a certified athletic trainer, according to the National Athletic Trainers’ Association.“Budgets are tight,” said Bob Colgate, the assistant director of the National Federation of State High School Associations. “You hate to say that, but it’s a reality.”Howells High School is among the 77 percent of Nebraska schools without an athletic trainer. The football coach, Mike Spiers, said that he cannot monitor the health of every player, many of whom he speaks with only a few times a game.“I have a tremendous fear of all injuries that could permanently damage a kid,” Spiers said. “It’s something that may convince me not to do this anymore.”At midweek practices, which often feature even more banging and tackling than games, volunteer coaches with little training typically evaluate injuries while the head coach calls plays.Sallis, of the American College of Sports Medicine, joined many experts in saying he was not trying to discourage the playing of football, only the widespread acceptance of playing it unsafely.“It’s crazy,” he said. “High schools hire a zillion coaches before they wonder about hiring a trainer. If you hire a head football coach, that next hire should be an athletic trainer.”As Will Benson wailed, vomited, had a seizure and lost consciousness, the ambulance dispatched for him could not find the entrance to the St. Stephen’s campus. According to records released by the local emergency medical services unit, it spent 13 minutes trying to find the trainer’s room.A helicopter whisked Benson to a hospital as the game continued. Coaches were confused: He had not been involved in any notable hits or tackles in the game.Bleeding in his brain, Benson slipped into a coma that night and never regained consciousness. A neurosurgeon operated to relieve pressure inside the skull but could not revive him. Five days later, Benson was declared brain dead. He was kept alive overnight so his organs could be harvested for donation.There is no shortage of unenlightened coaches. Scott Robertson, a volunteer team physician for Nipomo High in Southern California, said he had seen coaches at other schools “berate and ostracize” players who complained of concussion symptoms. Jerry Bornstein, another team physician for several Los Angeles-area schools, said a coach once yelled at him for refusing to let a concussed player return to a game. His response: “I’ll be happy to, Coach, as long as you accept the responsibility for this kid waking up dead tomorrow morning.”Ellen Marmer, the team physician for Rockville High School in Vernon, Conn., said that after she determined an offensive player from the opposing team was unfit to play after a concussion, his coach had him switch uniforms to try to play defense.Parents lose perspective as well. Garrick Jones, a quarterback from Memphis, said that the week after his concussion, his father pleaded with the coach to let him play. (The coach won.) Vito Perriello, the team doctor for St. Anne’s-Belfield School in Charlottesville, Va., said, “I have had parents tear up the form that I’ve filled out strongly recommending their child not play, and shop a doc to get their kid O.K.’d.”Yet many experts say that as poorly as adults can behave, it is the football bravado they instill in children, the thirst for competition and the blind eye to pain, that keeps players in the game. More than a dozen high school players at the Alabama tournament said they had hidden concussions from their coaches and medical personnel to stay on the field.“If the coach knew about it, he’d take us out,” said Matt Arent, a quarterback in Nashville. “They treat us like we’re their own kids. It comes down to the player not telling the coach that something’s wrong.”Players will hide from trainers and try to sneak back into huddles. They will rehearse answers to impress the trainer, so they won’t forget to use magic phrases like “I don’t have any headache at all” when asked.One maneuver involves the preseason memory and cognitive tests many schools administer as a baseline for comparison should a player sustain a concussion. Several doctors and trainers said they have heard players boast of purposely doing poorly on the preseason tests so they will be more readily found fit to play.A paradox has developed in high school football: The more strict the rules, the more likely they are to be evaded by the players they aim to protect. Many doctors support a rule whereby any player sustaining a concussion cannot return to play that day. But Sallis supported a more realistic approach, in which a player may return to the game if doctors are convinced the symptoms have cleared.If not, Sallis said: “Players are all going to stop telling the team physician that they have any symptoms — they’re going to hide them. Which we know they already do, but I think it’s going to get even worse. It’s putting them at more risk.”Dick Benson spent five years trying to wring something positive out of his son Will’s death. In June, Will’s Bill, legislation he crusaded for, was signed into law.It requires every Texas high school coach and official involved in every sport to be trained in basic safety and emergency procedures. Beyond neck injuries and heart attacks, special attention will be afforded to the symptoms of concussion and roots of second-impact syndrome. Benson said: “We’re not teaching people the principles of neurology. This is fundamental, basic stuff.”The law does not apply to Will’s old high school, however. It originally covered parochial and private schools, but the primary sponsor of the bill, State Senator Leticia Van de Putte, said it became entangled in “a raging school-voucher argument.” The legislation had to be scaled back “over politics,” she said.Benson said that he hoped that the steps taken in his son’s name would reach other states, but added that the process would be slow at best.“It usually takes something like Will to get people to take this kind of thing seriously,” he said. “People like learning things the hard way.”Particularly adolescents. Playing linebacker two years ago, Riley Haynes of Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., tackled a running back with such force that he found himself on the ground, all but unconscious, not remembering his name. His head throbbed, and he had no idea where he was.A teammate reminded him. He jumped on top of Haynes and screamed through his face mask: “That’s football, baby! That’s football, baby!”Haynes gathered himself, stumbled back to his position and took his stance for the next snap.'"
"'07-09-15,'0','It was also in January 2001 that the Fed surprised the market with a 50-basis-point — or half a percentage point — reduction in the target rate for fed funds. That move briefly cheered the stock market, but did not prevent the recession that began in March.The second chart shows the six-month changes in the number of people with jobs, as reported by the Labor Department’s household survey. In a growing economy, with the labor age population rising, the number of jobs almost always increases.But not now. The August employment figures, reported last week, showed 145,794,000 people with jobs, or 125,000 fewer than in February. When that number goes into negative territory, it is a warning of a slowdown.As can be seen from the chart, the job warning was sent out in July 1990, the month in which the recession began. A warning of the 2001 recession arrived in July 2000, but few took it seriously.To be sure, there have been just two recessions in two decades, which is not enough to validate any set of forecast tools. But if one arrives, there will be criticism that the Federal Reserve was too slow to cut interest rates as it ignored the threat of an inverted yield curve, and that it focused on inflation for too long.“With the core inflation rate comfortably close to 2 percent, and the Treasury market begging for ease for over a year, if it turns out to be a recession, it will also be a policy error,” said Robert Barbera, chief economist of ITG.As the charts show, sometimes one indicator or the other has seemed weak when no recession followed. The job number looked bad in 1995, but there was no confirmation from the interest rate indicator.Similarly, in 1998 the interest rate indicator came close to sounding a warning amid the fears brought on by the rescue of a large hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.But the difference between the rates never quite reached 1.3 percentage points, and in any case the employment figures remained strong.Now both look weak. That is no guarantee of a recession, but it may help to explain why the Fed is expected to change course and reduce the federal funds rate next week.'"

"'07-09-16,'0','The door to Mets Manager Willie Randolph’s office opened yesterday, and out came Orlando Hernández, scowling because of the continued discomfort in his right foot. Randolph said he would not decide until today, but Hernández will almost certainly miss tomorrow night’s start against Washington.“If there are any questions, yes, we’ll err on the side of caution,” Randolph said after a 30-minute pregame meeting with General Manager Omar Minaya; the pitching coach Rick Peterson; and the head trainer Ray Ramirez.With the playoffs less than three weeks away, the Mets may give Hernández as much time as he needs to make sure he is ready. Hernández said he could still run and throw from flat ground without pain.But he said that the irritation flared up when he pushed off the mound, which is why he aborted a bullpen session Friday, and that it has spread to the top of his foot. “I felt again pain,” Hernández said.Randolph, however, said after Friday’s game that Hernández had felt fine after throwing.Hernández first felt the soreness during his start Aug. 30 in Philadelphia, in which he lasted three innings, and did not pitch again until Tuesday night, when he was charged with eight runs in three innings.The next day, Hernández revealed that he “still felt pain.” Assuming he does not pitch tomorrow, the Mets figure to start Mike Pelfrey or Philip Humber.'"
"'07-09-16,'0','The goal seems to be to acknowledge both public distress over the war and concerns even among Republicans about the White House’s competence without directly assailing Mr. Bush himself, a step that could still alienate the most loyal of the party’s voters, those who tend to turn out in primaries.When Mr. McCain, standing outside a V.F.W. hall in Rock Hill, S.C., was asked on Saturday if he and Mr. Bush were now on the same page on the war, he responded in markedly measured tones. “At this moment,” Mr. McCain said. “For nearly four years we were on opposite sides, because I believed and knew the Rumsfeld strategy was failing.”At the very least, the confluence of two campaigns — one by Mr. Bush and his supporters to rally public support for the war, and the other by Mr. McCain to effectively jump-start his candidacy — has won Mr. McCain a burst of new attention in the early primary states.And Mr. McCain, who had been all but written off two months ago when he fired many of his campaign staff members in response to a collapse in fund-raising and poll numbers, has responded with new energy and cheer.As he campaigned across New Hampshire and Iowa, Mr. McCain was met with sizable and often enthusiastic crowds, though many of them said in interviews that they were on the fence or supporting other candidates. The New Hampshire Union Leader was not alone in proclaiming him the winner of a Republican candidates’ debate in New Hampshire last week.And Mr. McCain, in an interview, said he thought he could win New Hampshire as he did in 2000, while expressing less hope about Iowa; his description of his chances was much the same as those offered by independent analysts. “We really have taken some lumps,” he said. “But I’m guardedly optimistic about New Hampshire. In Iowa, we have a lot of work to do, and I think we have to understand that this is a very significant challenge.”In proclaiming support for the war while distancing himself from Mr. Bush, Mr. McCain is embarking on another chapter in a relationship that has shaped his career and image in ways he is still grappling with. With just months to prove that he is still a viable candidate, Mr. McCain is trying to undo the effects of a decision in recent years to put the bitterness of his early relationship with Mr. Bush aside in favor of a close association that went well beyond the war.That decision raised questions among Republicans about whether Mr. McCain had abandoned his independence to win favor with the White House and the conservative base of the party. Last year, Mr. McCain appeared at Liberty University, next to its founder, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the conservative religious leader whom he had once described as an agent of intolerance and a threat to the party.“From a political standpoint, the most important thing any candidate has is their authentic brand: That is why he was always so popular, always drew such big crowds,” said Matthew Dowd, who was Mr. Bush’s chief strategist in 2004 before having a falling out with the White House. “But when he became, ‘I want to try to get the popularity of Bush among Republicans,’ his brand dropped. He didn’t gain anything in getting closer to Bush. And he diminished his brand.”Mr. McCain indeed was a constant figure at Mr. Bush’s side, famously pictured giving him a bearhug in the 2004 campaign. And he came to Mr. Bush’s defense on many issues, including the war, in the last four years, as he methodically shed his image of the maverick unafraid to attack the White House.That said, the relationship has been alternately poisonous and unctuous since the 2000 South Carolina primary in which Mr. Bush defeated Mr. McCain. At one point, an aide said, Mr. McCain barked an obscenity upon watching Mr. Bush stand silent as a voter questioned Mr. McCain’s commitment to veterans.When Mr. McCain lost South Carolina, he at first refused to place the obligatory telephone call of congratulations to Mr. Bush, instructing a senior adviser, John Weaver, to do it, before finally taking the telephone and speaking to Mr. Bush, witnesses said. Mr. McCain at the time blamed the Bush campaign for spreading rumors that he had an illegitimate child; Bush aides have always denied doing so.The two repaired their relationship, after Mr. Bush won the nomination, at a private meeting. “It was one of those conversations where you sit down and it’s sort of stilted at first and we talked about sports and we talked about some of the things that we both like,” Mr. McCain said. “And then the conversation became more comfortable.”Mr. Bush had warned aides that Mr. McCain was a “loose cannon” during their fight in South Carolina. Since then, Mr. Bush’s friends said, the president has warmed somewhat to Mr. McCain, even though they said he never quite understood or completely trusted him. Mr. McCain said that he and his wife, Cindy, have had dinner with Mr. Bush and Laura Bush only once — and that the meal lasted about 45 minutes. “It was rather brief,” Mr. McCain said with a chuckle.Mr. McCain did not dispute the observation that his brand, as Mr. Dowd put it, had been diminished. He jumped in to finish the question when asked if coming to Mr. Bush’s defense had tarnished his image. “As a maverick and independent and all that?” Mr. McCain said. “Well, maybe the perception did change because, you know, MoveOn.Org ran all those ads showing me and Bush embracing. I understand that. But on any specific issues there was no change. Again, life isn’t fair. I went from being the greatest critic of the failed Rumsfeld strategy to now being tied to the war as Bush’s guy on the war.”Politics is cyclical; people who are down tend to rise up, and Americans tend to embrace comeback stories, no matter how implausible. Which is to say that none of this means Mr. McCain is back: His obstacles remain huge, and advisers to all his major rivals say they see little or no chance of his re-emergence.The first reason is financial; Mr. McCain, in a bus in New Hampshire and Iowa, could be heard on his cellphone raising money in anticipation of a fund-raising report next month. Several McCain advisers said it would be tough to continue if he did not break this year’s pattern and raise enough money to at least pay for a campaign.The second is the political calendar, which is problematic for anyone trying to run an underdog campaign. If Mr. McCain wins New Hampshire, he still has to deal with what is in effect a national primary on Feb. 5, when as many as 20 states hold contests, a scenario that seems tailor-made for a candidate with money.And should he really begin taking off, his opponents would no doubt come after him with advertisements reminding voters of the issue that caused him trouble before: his support for measures allowing some illegal immigrants to become citizens. One reason for Mr. McCain’s resurgence is that time and passions on immigration have since cooled.And whatever happens in Iraq, the war could pose an obstacle to Mr. McCain in New Hampshire, where independents are permitted to vote in either party’s primary. Mr. McCain won the state in 2000 in large part because independents flocked to him; Mr. McCain acknowledged that antiwar sentiment was high in New Hampshire this time around, suggesting that independents might turn to a Democrat.'"
"'07-09-16,'0','Until the credit crisis, which began with troubles in the American mortgage market, the value of foreign currencies traded online by private Japanese citizens, including women, averaged $9.1 billion a day — almost a fifth of all foreign exchange trading worldwide during trading hours in Tokyo, said Kazuhiro Shirakura, an analyst at the Yano Research Institute in Tokyo.Now Japan’s homemaker-traders may become yet another casualty of the shakeout hitting the debt, credit and stock markets worldwide. If so, these married women could lose more than just an investment opportunity. They could also lose the newfound economic freedom that drew many to currency trading in the first place.Most analysts estimate that Japanese online investors lost $2.5 billion trading currency last month. In fact, the subprime-mortgage crisis was the first severe market downturn since online trading took off here. Economists see the current tumult as the first real test of Japan’s homemaker-traders, and whether these newcomers have the stomach to ride out markets in a time of volatility.“Mrs. Watanabe got burned this time,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, currency economist at Nikko Citigroup in Tokyo. “The question now is whether she can make a comeback.”Indeed, online currency trading has become a phenomenon here, with a subculture of blogs, books and investing clubs for Japan’s legions of housewife-traders. The appeal, many of these women say, lies partly in the potential that online trading offered at least some financial independence for wives who still wanted to dutifully spend their days at home.Some of the women used their own money, some used their husband’s, and some used a combination of both. But by trading, they challenged deeply held social prohibitions in Japan against money, which is often seen here as dirty, especially when earned through market speculation.“There are strict taboos against money that isn’t earned with sweat from the brow,” said Mayumi Torii, a 41-year-old mother of one who said she earned $150,000 since she started margin trading in currencies early last year.Ms. Torii is one of Japan’s most famous housewife-traders. She has written a book on her investing strategies and founded a support group for home traders, the FX Beauties Club, which now has 40 members. (FX is financial shorthand for “foreign exchange.”)But until her book was released in July, she said, she was afraid to admit even to her friends that she was trading, though her husband knew and approved. Now she is a regular guest on television programs.Ms. Torii said she intended to keep trading, despite the recent market setbacks. She said it was her best chance to “stand on my own economically,” a necessity she discovered after her first marriage ended in divorce, and she and her son had to live off her meager savings. “I never want to feel that vulnerable again,” said Ms. Torii, now remarried.For other women, trading offered a more modest sort of independence, giving them a chance to build up savings separate from their husbands’ accounts.One reason Japan’s homemakers can move markets is that they hold the purse strings of the nation’s $12.5 trillion in household savings. For more than a decade, that money languished in banks here at low interest rates. But as the rapid aging of Japan’s population has brought anxiety about the future, households are starting to move more of it overseas in search of higher returns.A tiny fraction of this has flowed into risky investments like online currency accounts. Most of these accounts involve margin trading, in which investors place a cash deposit with a brokerage that allows them to borrow up to 20 or even 100 times their holdings for trading.The practice has been popular not only because it vastly raises the level of potential profits, but also because it allowed wives to trade at home, said Hiroshi Takao, chief operating officer of TokyoForex, an online trading firm.The housewife-traders were so secretive that many market analysts did not realize how widespread the trend had become until this summer, when the police arrested a Tokyo housewife accused of failing to pay $1.1 million in taxes on her foreign exchange earnings.While day trading of stocks has also taken off in Japan, the women say they prefer currencies because of the relative simplicity: currencies might involve only a handful of nations, while trading stocks might mean keeping an eye on hundreds of companies.For a time, margin trading seemed like a surefire way to make money, as the yen moved only downward against the dollar and other currencies. But last month, in the midst of the credit turmoil, the yen soared as hedge funds and traders panicked.Ms. Itoh recalled that she had wanted to cry as she watched the yen jump as much as 5 percent in value in a single day, Aug. 16.“But I had to keep a poker face, because my husband was sitting behind me,” Ms. Itoh said.She did not sell her position, thinking the yen would fall again. But by the next morning, only $1,000 remained in her account, she said.Yayoi Kawakage, a 40-year-old homemaker who works part time at a real estate consulting firm, said she limited her losses last month to $500 because she sold her positions quickly. She said that if markets become less predictable now, many housewives would likely abandon trading.“The subprime problem showed good things don’t last forever,” she said.Still, some analysts point out that the $2.5 billion that Japanese individuals lost last month was just a fraction of a percent of the nation’s overall household savings.“It is about the same as what Japan spends in two weeks on horse racing, lotteries and pachinko,” said Tohru Sasaki, chief foreign exchange strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank, referring to a pinball-like game popular among gamblers here.Mr. Sasaki said he believed the losses were not big enough to scare away married women and other investors. And while the trading volume is far below last month’s, recent data show signs of a return to online trading, said Mr. Yamamoto of Citigroup.Indeed, most of the half dozen homemaker-traders interviewed for this article said they were already trading again, and the rest said they soon would be — including Ms. Itoh, who said she would probably invest her remaining $1,000 in savings.“There’s no other way to make money so quickly,” she said.'"
"'07-09-16,'0','The sport was once known as nawa arwut, literally “nine weapons,” because soldiers were taught that even if they had no knives or guns they could use two hands, two elbows, two knees, two feet and their head to battle their enemies.The rules have evolved: boxers are no longer allowed to head-butt their opponents and are barred from biting, spitting, pulling hair, poking at eyes and sticking out their tongues. But a well-placed knee to the kidney or a kick to the head or neck is fair game, and encouraged.Muay Thai has been popular for years among martial arts enthusiasts worldwide, women and men, as well as those looking for a disciplined workout regimen. But it has only been in the past few years that the sport has taken off for girls and women in Thailand, partly because poor girls see it as a path toward modest prosperity if they reach the sport’s highest levels. The small paychecks that even younger girls earn also help families in a struggling economy.The sport is also being promoted more aggressively. At the Bangkok Boxing Stadium, one of the three main sites for muay Thai in the capital, girls and women fight every Saturday afternoon.“People come to see the fight — the lovely face is a bonus,” said Pariyakorn Ratanasuban, who promotes female boxing at the stadium. The daughter of the country’s leading muay Thai promoter, Songchai Ratanasuban, she estimates that Thailand has 5,000 amateur female boxers. But many Thais have not accepted the idea.“Parents don’t want their children to even train because they will get blood on their face,” she said. “We have to change the perception of the sport.”Maintaining femininity is a serious concern for many of the Thai girls who fight, says Ms. Pariyakorn, a bejeweled and delicately built woman. Often, she says, they drop out before they reach 20.“When they grow up they get a boyfriend or they get married,” Ms. Pariyakorn said. “Their career cycle is not very long. Their husbands don’t want them to come home with bruises.”Younger fighters say they are teased by boys in school and they try to keep their fighting careers low profile.“In the ring I have to fight and do my best as a boxer: I kick, I punch, use my elbows and knees like a boy,” said Pannipa, the 13-year-old boxer, after a fight in which she gave her opponent a bloody nose but got a fat lip in return. “Once I get down from the ring I become who I am, a girl.”That means, she says, helping with housework. And her manner shows that she is traditional in other ways as well. She has absorbed the sense of deference taught to Thai girls: she fills a visitor’s glass during meal time, speaks softly and bows while clasping her hands together in a traditional Thai gesture of respect several times during an interview.Until recently, it was considered very bad luck for a girl or a woman to enter the boxing ring. Muay Thai is steeped in superstition, where gold and silver talismans, blessed by Buddhist monks and engraved with words and symbols, are sometimes imbedded under a fighter’s skin. The presence of a woman, especially if she was menstruating, was thought to cancel out the invulnerability conferred by these and other charms and blessings.“The belief was that if a woman came too close to the charm, you would bleed more during a match,” said Amnart Saichalard, a former fighter who now teaches muay Thai at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok and has gold talismans buried under his skin near his Adam’s apple and in his biceps.The superstitions against female boxers have faded as more girls and women take up muay Thai. But as a concession to tradition, girls enter the ring by crawling under the bottom of four ropes. Boys climb through the ropes any way they want.On a recent Saturday at a Buddhist temple outside Phitsanulok, a central Thai city where the sport is very popular, Orathai Boonyarit, 14, kneeled and bowed on the grass in front of the ring before ducking under the ropes to face her opponent, Namkang Saengpara, also 14. Performing the traditional prematch rituals, the two girls moved rhythmically around the ring as musicians played muay Thai music with flute and drum. The air smelled of the peppermint liniment slathered onto fighters’ legs.When the match began, Orathai hissed like a snake as she kicked and punched Namkang, a technique that her trainer told her would give her more power. Namkang looked shaky on her feet as she dodged Orathai’s blows. After three rounds, the referee ended the fight, explaining that Namkang was not attacking, just defending herself. Orathai crossed the ring and hugged Namkang.“People say I’m not a good boxer because I always feel sorry for my opponent,” Orathai said. But she is passionate about the sport despite protests by her mother, who is afraid she will get hurt and wants her to stop fighting. “She told me, ‘If you lose today you should quit,’ ” Orathai said. “I told my mom it’s not about losing or winning.”Orathai is one of a half-dozen girls who train at a small camp in Nern Maprang, about an hour outside Phitsanulok. The girls have a vigorous exercise schedule, starting before school at 5 a.m. and resuming as soon as the school bus, a converted pickup truck, drops them off. The practices continue into the evening.Each day they do 30 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 10 pull-ups and 200 dumbbell curls. They skip rope 1,000 times and run a few miles on dirt and pavement barefoot because they cannot afford good sneakers.“If they fight and their legs are not strong enough, they jump rope 2,000 times,” said Tanawat Somnet, 47, their trainer. “If they lower their guard during a fight, 20 push-ups. Punishment.”Mr. Tanawat founded the camp six years ago after a teenage girl, his neighbor’s daughter who was home alone, was tied up by burglars. “We thought we should teach girls how to protect themselves,” he said.But self-defense is only one of the reasons girls train at the camp. Some like Orathai say they enjoy boxing and the discipline of the sport. Others are literally fighting their way out of poverty.Pannipa and her twin sister, Sawinee, fight to help pay for school fees, books and pocket money. Their mother left the family when they were young and has since disappeared. Their father, whom they rarely see, has remarried and has a new family in Bangkok. They live at the boxing camp and get about 300 baht, slightly more than $9, for each fight, win or lose.The prize money increases with experience and age. Areerat Yaited, 17, who trained at a different boxing camp in the Phitsanulok area, recently made about $283 for a match against a foreigner in a stadium on the resort island of Phuket, a princely sum for a teenager here.Pannipa and Sawinee have a long way to go before they start making that kind of money. Their trainer, Mr. Tanawat, calculates they have made a total of $315 in their two-year careers, but only a little over $30 remains in each of their bank accounts.The girls say they regularly give money to their cash-strapped and widowed 61-year-old grandmother, Rabiab Chaiyated, who has become one of their biggest fans.Mrs. Rabiab, who attended Pannipa’s recent match, said that girls boxing was inconceivable when she was young and that she was apprehensive when her granddaughters started.“Before their first fight I was so afraid my heart beat faster,” Mrs. Rabiab said. “But now I’m proud of them.”'"
"'07-09-16,'0','“I think the meeting will add some clarity to what has already taken place,” said Bishop Kirk S. Smith of Arizona. “I think clearly there is going to be some sort of exodus from the communion.”Currently, the Episcopal Church urges, but does not require, dioceses and bishops to refrain from electing openly gay and lesbian bishops. None have been elected since Bishop Robinson, but the Rev. Tracey Lind, who is a lesbian, is among the candidates to become the new bishop of Chicago.The church does not have rites of blessing for same-sex unions, but some individual bishops permit blessing ceremonies in their dioceses.At a February meeting in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, three dozen primates of the Anglican Communion issued the directive on gay bishops and same-sex unions. They also demanded that the Episcopal Church create a parallel leadership structure to serve the conservative minority of Episcopalians who oppose their church’s liberal stance on homosexuality.Conservative Anglicans hailed the primates’ directive as an affirmation of traditional biblical teachings on homosexuality for the world’s 77 million Anglicans, of whom 2.4 million are Episcopalians.A month later, Episcopal bishops rejected the parallel structure, saying it would compromise the church’s autonomy. Since then, several more parishes among the 7,700 Episcopal congregations in the United States have left the church and placed themselves under the authority of foreign bishops, mostly in Africa.Moreover, the provinces of Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda and Uganda, passionate critics of the Episcopal Church, have consecrated conservative American clergy as their bishops in the United States to serve disaffected congregations, a move Episcopal Church leaders view as a violation of the church’s authority.“There already is a separation,” said the Rev. William Sachs, director of the Center for Reconciliation and Mission at St. Stephen’s Church in Richmond, Va. “The question is, how far does it spread?”The answer may soon become apparent. Several dissident dioceses, like Quincy, Ill., San Joaquin, Calif., and Pittsburgh, are taking steps to align themselves with a foreign province, should the Episcopal bishops refuse the terms of the directive, said Bishop Robert Duncan of Pittsburgh, who leads a network of conservatives seeking alternative oversight. Such departures would probably lead to years of litigation over church property, experts said.Unlike bishops in provinces that are more hierarchical, bishops in the Episcopal Church cannot legislate on behalf of the church, experts said. Only the church’s General Convention can do that, they said, and its next meeting is in 2009.Still, the bishops could overturn their earlier decision regarding the alternative oversight structure or state that they would categorically refuse to approve the election of openly gay and lesbian clergy members to the episcopate.Few expect that to happen, and some bishops, including some theological conservatives, take issue with outsiders telling the American church what to do.“I think they’re pushing us because they want to polarize the issue,” said Bishop Henry Parsley of Alabama, who did not vote for Bishop Robinson’s consecration. “The primates want us to say that we don’t approve public rites of blessing, and we have not done that. They don’t want us to approve gay bishops in committed relationships, and the 2006 general convention resolution makes that unlikely. Basically, what I’m saying is that what they are asking is essentially already the case.” If the bishops take such a position, that would amount to a rejection of the directive. Archbishop Williams would “have a hard time carrying on with business as usual,” said the Rev. Ephraim Radner, a leading Episcopal conservative and professor of historical theology at Wycliffe College in Toronto.The archbishop might then take steps to reduce the Episcopal Church’s role and representation in the communion, Mr. Radner and others said.Some African primates have also spoken openly about leaving the Anglican Communion, which would create great disarray in their provinces, as not all their bishops or clergy are willing to break with the communion over this issue, Episcopal bishops and experts said.“This is the most significant meeting in the last three years,” Mr. Radner said. “I’m not saying it will resolve everything, but it will set in motion responses that have been brewing for a long time. It doesn’t matter what happens, there’s going to be response from a whole range of folks in the Anglican Communion that will determine the future of communion.”'"
"'07-09-16,'0','The rush to find an edge has resulted in yoga’s being incorporated at many golf schools. Roberts said she had trained 60 teachers in seven countries through her program.Other golf schools — like Kohler — have their own yoga programs that are not certified by Roberts.At Kohler, the coordinator, Todd Wagner, said yoga was helping his students loosen up to execute freer, easier swings.“Typically, what we’d do in a lesson or in the golf school is we would actually videotape their swing right away and help them actually do the yoga poses that will help benefit their golf swing,” Wagner said.The school also has more intensive yoga programs in its women’s golf school, as well as its one-hour yoga-golf combination lessons.Eduardo Romero, who has 96 career professional victories, including the Argentine PGA Championship eight times and the European Masters during his 27-year career, said he would not have had nearly as much success without practicing a form of Indian yoga.It has also helped him overcome back problems, and he credits the practice with improving his concentration.“If I’m not doing yoga, who knows?” said Romero, who has won more than $975,000 on the Champions Tour this year. “Maybe I’m retired. But I’m doing yoga and I’m still playing.”And that is the goal the Chepeniks have at the weeklong course at the Kohler Golf Academy. The couple, from Winter Park, Fla., have golfed together for 17 years and have three daughters-in-law that practice yoga.But the concept was something new to them, and they enjoyed practicing a few basic poses at Kohler.Barney Chepenik was already hungry for lunch — with two hours of instruction left. But he said he felt like the yoga would pay immediate dividends.“When I get out to play, it takes me a lot of time to warm up before I play, and finally four or five holes into it, I begin to get loose,” he said. “I feel so much more limber, in terms of movements, now.”And that is Wagner’s goal in trying to improve the Chepeniks’ golf game. He said it was impossible to teach the correct techniques if Barney Chepenik could not get in the right position.“We’ll train him using yoga to free up his muscles, his hips and his core muscles and allow him to turn,” Wagner said. “It will give him the freedom to actually go forward now because of his flexibility.”Roberts said he believed that golf pros would be incorporating yoga in their lessons within 10 years.“It’s going to shift the traditional methodologies of teaching golf,” she said. “Golf pros, to enhance what they’re bringing to their students, are going to have to understand the student’s body and how the body works. Grip is important, but you have to be able to get the student into the position to do what you’re asking them to do.”'"
"'07-09-16,'0','Concerns are mounting that such financial incentives are contributing to an overuse of Epogen that may lead to heart problems, blood clots or even premature deaths. “The payment system leads to perverse incentives,” said Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, during a Congressional hearing in June at which DaVita was singled out for criticism.The Food and Drug Administration, which has already forced Amgen to provide stricter warnings about Epogen and similar products, convened a panel of experts last week to consider further restrictions on the drug’s use. While the panel advised against such a move, use of the drug is still expected to drop from last year’s levels, industry analysts say.Medicare and Congress are moving to stop separate Medicare reimbursement for Epogen to end the incentives to overuse the drug. Law enforcement authorities, including those at the Justice Department and at the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, are conducting criminal and civil investigations into how DaVita and some other dialysis providers bill for Epogen.All of this casts an unfavorable spotlight on the dialysis business, which might be the closest thing the United States has to nationalized health care. Medicare pays for almost all dialysis, even for patients younger than 65.Dialysis is a dreary experience, one in which people with failed kidneys sit for hours hooked to machines that cleanse their blood, assisted by technicians who often have to work a second job to make ends meet. More than one in five of the nation’s dialysis patients die each year — a rate as much as double that in Europe and Japan — for reasons that aren’t clear.Some 350,000 or so Americans currently need dialysis; that population is growing about 3 percent a year, fueled by a rise in diabetes. DaVita treats about 106,000 patients in more than 1,300 clinics and appears to be the most aggressive Epogen user among major dialysis chains, according to the United States Renal Data System, a government-funded registry of dialysis data. Epogen accounts for 25 percent of DaVita’s revenue and up to 40 percent of its earnings, according to the Stanford Group Company, a research firm.As he sorties forth to defend DaVita, Mr. Thiry has become the most visible dialysis executive in Washington, taking issue with what he describes as unfair accusations that his company’s profits are built on a product that causes harm to patients.“The suspension of logic in this discussion has been remarkable,” he said. He said he was confident that DaVita would emerge unscathed from the government investigations.Mr. Thiry added that he would welcome a well-designed change in the reimbursement system to eliminate perceived incentives to overuse Epogen, which is commonly referred to as Epo. “Do that tomorrow so we get rid of the taint,” he said. “We’re still going to use the same amount of Epo.”THE controversy comes just as Mr. Thiry, 51, has started to attract favorable attention in business schools and the media for DaVita’s management practices, like an extensive emphasis on employee training.After graduating from Harvard Business School, Mr. Thiry was a consultant at Bain & Company and then ran Vivra, a dialysis chain in Northern California. After Vivra was acquired in the late 1990s, Mr. Thiry was recruited by Total Renal Care, a dialysis chain in Southern California that was in disarray.Mr. Thiry had just seen the movie “The Man in the Iron Mask,” in which the Three Musketeers come out of retirement. Inspired, he called some of his former aides from Vivra and asked, “Will you ride again?”He and his team took over in October 1999, though Mr. Thiry continued to live in Northern California, working mostly out of his home or a nearby company office. As they addressed bookkeeping problems and other woes, they also overhauled the corporate culture.Many chief executives stress teamwork and values, but Mr. Thiry took those concepts to extremes. He changed the company’s name from Total Renal Care to DaVita (which he describes as Italian for “he/she gives life”). He also painted inspirational slogans in huge letters on the walls of his office — including “Begin with the end in mind,” and “Speak with your life, not just your words.”DaVita employees are known as teammates. Those who do well can win company-paid vacations. Dialysis clinics have “walls of fame” with a picture of each patient and staff member.Mr. Thiry and his wife, Denise O’Leary, a former venture capitalist, bankroll the KT Family Fund, which provides $100,000 a year in scholarships for the children of employees, as well as the KT Community Fund, which helps pay for community service projects undertaken by employees. Another fund, backed by the company and employee contributions, helps staff members during setbacks like illnesses.DaVita uses annual company meetings and many smaller regional gatherings so people can bond and learn the “DaVita way.” Mr. Thiry, often wearing his musketeer outfit, speaks at many of them, afterward posing for pictures with employees.Some skeptics say Mr. Thiry is merely a salesman who has created a cult of personality around him.“You see 2,500 in a huge conference room in Dallas, and KT running through the hall with his arms up slapping hands, with his Three Musketeers costume, and these women crooning,” said a former employee who said Mr. Thiry’s showmanship was self-aggrandizing. This person requested anonymity because a relative still works for DaVita.But others say Mr. Thiry’s motivations are genuine. “Kent cries at movies. He’s one of those guys,” said Douglas Vlchek, who was called Yoda at DaVita, where he was chief wisdom officer, in charge of employee education. He left in 2005 and is now a deacon in the Catholic Church. “I preach at Mass and I talk about this company sometimes,” Mr. Vlchek said. “It does what human beings are supposed to do.”Another defender is Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at Stanford business school who wrote a case study in 2006 of DaVita’s revival. He said the corporate culture, while being too “Kent-centric,” reduced employee turnover and made the company “extremely successful and effective.” He also said that DaVita is a leader among companies in using data to make decisions.Certainly, the financial results have been stellar. Revenue climbed from $1.4 billion in 1999, the year Mr. Thiry took over, to $4.9 billion last year. And the stock, which dipped below $2 in early 2000, is now about $62.Mr. Thiry has profited from this growth, in large part from gains on stock options. He made $8.4 million in 2006 and more than $25 million in 2005. He owns DaVita shares worth about $90 million, according to the last proxy statement.DaVita and its main competitor, Fresenius Medical Care, control about two-thirds of the dialysis business. The rest of the industry is composed of smaller chains and independent clinics, some of which are nonprofit operations. Since 2002, DaVita has grown faster in the markets it serves than Fresenius, said an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities.Mr. Thiry points to company data showing that DaVita provides better care than the national average, although the United States Renal Data System statistics do not show this clearly. He argues that DaVita’s efforts to improve overall dialysis treatment, even when it makes no extra money, show that the company is not overusing Epogen just to cash in.Dialysis clinics lose money on the fee paid by Medicare for a dialysis treatment because the payments haven’t kept pace with inflation. Yet industry executives say the clinics can typically recoup those losses by getting reimbursed for Epogen and other drugs.Government officials “understood they were subsidizing the cost of dialysis by allowing us to make a profit on the drugs,” said Dr. J. Michael Lazarus, chief medical officer of Fresenius. He added that he did not particularly like the arrangement. “I don’t want to be in the drug business,” he said. “I want to be in the dialysis business.”Amgen offers discounts and rebates to dialysis companies based, in part, on how much Epogen they use and how much that use increases year to year. DaVita says in regulatory filings that failure to qualify for such discounts could have a “material adverse effect” on the company’s earnings.While Amgen and DaVita are financially tethered through Epogen, there have been tensions in the relationship. Protected by patents, Amgen is the only supplier of a drug that dialysis centers cannot do without, giving it strong leverage over the dialysis companies.Mr. Thiry declined to comment about Amgen. But in previous comments to reporters and analysts, he has accused Amgen of “abuse of monopoly power” and has said that Washington would not care as much about Epogen if the price were lower.In a letter to Amgen in February 2006, DaVita protested terms of a new contract, saying it would face huge financial penalties if it didn’t increase usage of Epogen by 4 percent.In a statement, Amgen said the incentives in its contracts with DaVita were based on past patterns of growth and did not cause Epogen usage to increase unduly. Amgen said it “partners with customers in service to patients,” and that DaVita was a “valued Amgen customer.” It also said the cost per unit of Epogen to Medicare had dropped over the years.Despite such pressures, Mr. Thiry says DaVita did not overuse Epogen. He said decisions on how much to use are made by patients’ physicians. While a small number of physicians own a stake in their local DaVita clinic, the vast majority do not profit personally from prescribing Epogen, according to Mr. Thiry.Still, corporate ownership does seem to influence Epogen use. According to a study published in April in The Journal of the American Medical Association, for-profit clinics use $1,700 more of Epogen on each patient every year than nonprofit centers do.Moreover, DaVita does have a central protocol to advise doctors on dosage.“The truth is, there’s a partnership between the facilities and the doctors,” said Dr. Peter W. Crooks, head of nephrology for Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, which sends patients to Fresenius and DaVita clinics.When Epogen came on the market in 1989 it was a godsend for dialysis patients. The drug is a synthetic version of a hormone, made by the kidneys, that stimulates the body to produce oxygen-carrying red blood cells. Patients with failed kidneys make little or none of the hormone and can have fatigue-inducing anemia or require blood transfusions.But some studies have shown that if the drug is used too aggressively and red blood cell levels are raised too high, it can cause cardiovascular problems or kill people. And Renal Data System figures show that more than 60 percent of DaVita patients have red blood cell levels that the F.D.A. considers risky. A Renal Data System study from 2006 found that DaVita was the company most likely to overshoot recommended red cell levels and was the slowest to reduce doses once this occurred.Yet the evidence is complicated and incomplete, as testimony at last week’s F.D.A. meeting showed. Low red blood cell levels are also unhealthy, and Medicare has a minimum recommended level for dialysis patients. Mr. Thiry said that DaVita tries to get as many patients as possible above that level, but that each patient responds differently and that some overshoot.Still, other chains manage to keep more patients in the desired range, according to a Renal Data System study. DaVita said it didn’t cut Epogen dosages sharply after an overshoot because that causes big fluctuations in red blood cell levels. At last week’s meeting, some panel members said such fluctuations could, in themselves, be risky.The F.D.A. doesn’t have to listen to its advisory panels and has yet to decide on a proper target range for levels of red blood cells — but when it does, analysts say, it will almost certainly be lower than what DaVita was aiming for before the safety concerns intensified. Still, last week’s proceedings reduced the chance that there would be severe new restrictions, and DaVita’s stock surged to $63 on Thursday, the highest level since Mr. Thiry took over.MR. THIRY said that last week’s proceedings provided some vindication. “As people step back and consider the actual evidence that exists, all the old fun and dramatic criticisms are evaporating,” he said.Other challenges loom, however. Congress and Medicare are moving to eliminate the separate payments for Epogen and other drugs in favor of one “bundled” payment that would cover all aspects of dialysis treatment. That would eliminate the financial incentive to overuse Epogen — but could end up replacing it with an incentive to skimp on the drug to lower treatment costs and increase profits. After long opposing bundling, Mr. Thiry now says he would accept it providing the total payment per treatment does not drop.To help press their case in the nation’s capital, Mr. Thiry and DaVita’s government relations office — what it calls its G-Force — have plunged into the various Washington battles in DaVita’s usual rah-rah way. DaVita’s political action committee contributed $530,000 to lawmakers last year and is aiming for $1 million this year, according to the company’s in-house magazine. DaVita even organized its patients into an advocacy group, the DaVita Patient Citizens. DaVita employees and patients sent 27,000 letters and e-mail messages to lawmakers in 2006.Mr. Thiry’s frequent trips to Washington have added to rumors that DaVita’s “mayor” is planning to run for a real public office. Mr. Thiry says he would like to pursue a public service job when he leaves DaVita, but he wouldn’t say when that might be. DaVita has begun to spread his cheerleading duties to other executives.But for now, Mr. Thiry seems intent on saving DaVita, and his own reputation, from attacks in Washington and the media attention that has followed. “We were on our way to becoming a role model for American health care,” he said, “until this spate of articles on anemia has tainted our community.”'"

"'07-09-16,'0','THERE’S been a lot of debate about whether the Iraq government has fulfilled our list of benchmarks to show if the United States can justify pulling out its forces. Maybe we just need new benchmarks, like these:BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Iraqi National Assembly, in order to justify the withdrawal of Operation Iraqi Freedom troops, must achieve by no later than Feb. 5, 2008, (henceforth known as “Super Tuesday”) the following benchmarks of progress:2. Maintain a calendar and clock device capable of counting days and effectively measuring the passage of time.3. Meet regularly, using podiums, gavels and mood lighting for the purpose of producing video clips of at least 15 seconds in duration.4. Train and equip three full Iraqi Army brigades, using trucks, rifles and haircuts for the purpose of producing video clips of at least 15 seconds in duration.5. Pass a parliamentary resolution authorizing the continued export of Iraqi oil. (Note: Failure to pass a resolution will not imply lack of authorization.)6.

"'07-09-16,'0','By the time we were 17, we had graduated to gin and tonics and no longer hid our furtive drinking in the middle of traffic.In my parents’ quiet suburban house, no one ever drank cocktails. Nothing we owned, including the house itself, was more than 60 years old. In the walnut-paneled library of Elizabeth’s apartment, her parents required us only to use the less expensive crystal with our afternoon drinks.My Fresno friends were the children of country doctors and family farmers, public school principals and solar energy salesmen. The girls I knew in New York had fathers who ran banks and wrote the advertising slogans that defined the era: “Certs: two mints in one.” “Snickers really satisfies.” “If you dare wear short shorts, Nair for short shorts.” Children of these New Yorkers, I thought, were the most glamorous and irreproachable children of all.After we left Groton, Elizabeth and I wrote letters every day, sometimes several letters a day, trading gossip about our friends and arguments we had had with our parents and the outrageous things our shrinks had said. Elizabeth said her shrink made her lie on the sofa. I was certain that my shrink didn’t know a thing, because he was not a New York shrink and because he never asked me to lie on the sofa.EVERY vacation, while my Fresno friends went to Carmel or Sun Valley or other places I considered quaint and useless, I begged my parents to send me off to see Elizabeth. And so at 17 in New York, I learned how to half-smile when I wanted to laugh out loud, how to feign ease at parties full of worldly strangers, how to conceal my own drunkenness. “Focus on one still thing,” Elizabeth would tell me, which is handy advice for much more than faking sobriety. “Just sit and be languid, but make sure the boys know you’re a little bit drunk.”I learned from Elizabeth that reasonable people do not have mineral-colored American Express cards. People with a modicum of good taste carry traditional green American Express cards. People with a modicum of good taste eat inexpensive lunches at Soup Burg and expensive dinners at Le Cirque.Before Elizabeth, I had seen toile only in the movies. After I met her, I assumed that the most glamorous people have toile in their bathrooms. And fainting couches. And French crystal sconces, and large blocks of soap made from olive oil.Elizabeth taught me to buy my lipsticks at Bergdorf’s, but to eat my lunch at Bloomie’s. Stick to a rigorous diet, but do not mention your diet in polite company. Never buy a handbag with the designer’s insignia emblazoned on the outside. Chanel suits look elegant on young ladies, but only if the suit is inherited from one’s grandmother. “You can’t buy Chanel for yourself until you’re 60,” Elizabeth instructed.She also taught me to dress up when going to the theater. “We’re not tourists,” she would say, putting on her hot-pink, knee-length cocktail gown trimmed with ostrich feathers and slipping into four-inch pink stilettos. “Only tourists wear jeans to the theater.” Being considered a tourist topped my list of teenage fears and anxieties.When I moved to New York at 21, I imagined that Elizabeth and I would continue our intimate friendship in the Palm Court at the Plaza, on the walking paths in Central Park, at the 17th-century French farm table in her parents’ kitchen: all the places I had learned how to be a New Yorker. In fact I saw her only once, two weeks after my arrival, when she paid a visit to my apartment on 73rd Street and Second Avenue. “I’ve never been to this neighborhood,” she said.I still have an affection for ostrich feathers and for lunch at diners on Madison Avenue. I dress up for the theater. I get a feeling of dull humiliation every time I pull out my not green American Express card.Even now, buying lipsticks at Bergdorf’s, I cannot help but pity young women in their crisp new Chanel suits. Yet even now, I cannot summon that divine teenage expression of dismissal and sympathy, the way other women can: Elizabeth didn’t teach me enough.'"
"'07-09-16,'0','Psychoanalysis is now an independent profession with the passing in 2002 of the New York State licensing laws for psychoanalysts. Psychoanalysis cannot be dominated by the New York Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, the focus of your article, nor any other institute or professional mental health group.Freud said an analyst was someone who worked with resistance and transference. He was never as rigid as his disciples became in regard to frequency of sessions. The emphasis on frequency of sessions closed the doors to students (and patients) not able or willing to afford the cost of three or four sessions a week. No wonder there has been a decline in psychoanalysis!The state law licensing psychoanalysts did not include frequency of sessions in its requirements for training. Now a more diverse group of patients can afford to be in psychoanalysis, and a larger group of students can afford training. Many psychoanalytic institutes now exist under the umbrella of the National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis.As a practicing certified psychoanalyst for many years, and as an analyst who believes it is possible for some patients to be in analysis and attend once a week, I feel that these changes are long overdue.While there is no doubt that the face of psychiatry and psychology has changed, and that the popularity of analysis has waned, there are three qualifiers.First, many people are returning to psychodynamic therapy, often some who have been the route of cognitive behavioral therapy, finding the latter just another intellectual lecture on how they can change, without the context of an empathic relationship and of the understanding of personal and unique dynamics and history. The move away from analysis has been a response to an onslaught from health insurance and pharmaceutical companies since the ’70s.Second, the neurobiology that has been possible in recent years shows support for some of Freud’s critical concepts, such as the pre-eminence of the unconscious in brain activity. Third, Freud talked not just of sex, but of aggression. However, in despair as the Nazis took over in the ’30s, he also spoke of the ultimate self-destructive nature of man. It is hard to view current events, both political and environmental, without thinking that his drive theory was right on target.We need not follow Freud slavishly to realize that he was brilliant and still has much to teach us. The question remains, can we learn it?'"

"'07-09-16,'0','On Wall Street, opinion is deeply divided, with investors who are betting on a drop in the stock having sold short more than 10 percent of Ceradyne shares. “What if we pull out of Iraq? That’s the biggest risk,” says Jason Simon of JMP Securities, a boutique investment bank in San Francisco.Joel P. Moskowitz, Ceradyne’s founder and chief executive, remembers the lean years of the 1990s, when Ceradyne stock hovered between $5 and $10 a share for most of the decade. Today, it is at $68, but he says his company’s fate doesn’t turn on Washington’s policy toward Iraq. “It doesn’t change anything,” he says. “Body armor has changed the tactical course of war, and the Army is going to want everyone to have it.”He also points out that Ceradyne has other successful businesses — like ceramic components that go into things as diverse as solar cells, jet engines and orthodontics — and a longstanding technical expertise that helped it move quickly when the Pentagon suddenly needed better protection for troops under fire from the insurgency in Iraq. “The only reason we are where we are is because of the technology we have,” he says.That may be true, but body armor now generates more than 80 percent of the company’s profits.Then there is the issue of competition — Ceradyne’s market share in body armor is roughly 80 percent — and skeptics like Mr. Butler warn that new competitors are likely to eat into Ceradyne’s dominance. He has a target price of $60 for Ceradyne, $8 below where it is now trading.Ceradyne’s best hope may be to win a share of a contract set to be awarded next year for upgraded armor to protect against armor-piercing bullets increasingly being used by insurgents in Iraq. That’s among the reasons that Mr. Simon is bullish on Ceradyne. His target price is $85.Then there is the Bull. This is a heavily armored combat vehicle that would shield soldiers from conventional roadside bombs, as well as the more deadly “explosively formed penetrators,” which are responsible for increasing casualties this year. Ceradyne has teamed up with Oshkosh Truck and Ideal Innovations, a Virginia defense contractor, to develop the Bull. As Mr. Moskowitz says, “It represents a multibillion dollar opportunity.” The Pentagon is likely to make a decision on the Bull later this year.Of course, that depends on what happens on the ground in Baghdad, as well as Washington, between now and then. Expect opinions on Ceradyne to be just as volatile — and fought over — as the war itself.'"

On a crowded B train, they chatted about friends and Mr. Pendle’s book-in-progress, “Death: A Life.” Mr. Dancy occasionally peeked out the window with an are-we-there-yet? expression.Ninety minutes and a subway transfer later, they were seated at Tatiana, with glasses of Grey Goose vodka (straight) and a table strewn with pickled tomatoes, cabbages and cucumbers, smoked fish and a drink called kvas, which the waitress — also named Tatiana — described as “like root beer.”“Who knew they made liquid bread?” Mr. Dancy said, sipping the kvas.“Tell me this wasn’t worth the four-hour subway journey,” he added. “When we order the next round, we have to go more extreme.” The two went wild: another bottle of vodka and identical entrees of beef stroganoff.The beef arrived, a massive architectural feat of meat and bone, rendering them perplexed as to their next move.“I’m going to attack it from the eastern face,” Mr. Pendle said.Mr. Dancy gave a lecture: “If we think of the stroganoff as the proletariat, this thrusting eggplant is the czar — either that, or this bone could be the ice pick in Trotsky’s brain.” He snorted and removed the petrified eggplant, noting it resembled an insole.Giggling, the two wandered to the Q train, hoping that it still ran after midnight.

"'07-09-16,'0','Mr. Morabito countered that the report reflects a continuing debate with the comptroller’s office over what jobs the town needs to obtain bids on.Among the problems cited in the audit was $971,009 paid to eight vendors for work that was done without issuing requests for proposals, which help assure there is competitive bidding and is required under town policy. The audit cited examples where no written quotes were obtained: $110,493 for purchases for three vendors, $294,017 on four public works contracts and $305,257 to pay five vendors the town hired. In addition, according to the report, the town’s comptroller did not prepare an abstract for 83 vouchers totaling $535,533.Mr. Morabito said requests for proposals, or R.F.P.s, were not required on the eight vendors because they were special service contracts and fell outside the guidelines. In the other cases, he argued, the sums represented numerous small jobs that did not meet the threshold for requiring written quotes.“They’re just small jobs that add up,” he said, adding that changes were being made to see that R.F.P.s and written quotes were obtained as required.The report cited several examples, however, where Mr. DiNapoli believed written bids should have been obtained, including 68 purchases from four vendors totally $215,288. Of these 68 purchases, 54 were for $1,000 to $5,000 and required three quotes, and 4 were for $5,000 to $9,000 and required at least four written quotes, the report said.William Villanova, a Republican elected to the Town Board in 2005, said that he believed the situation deserved further investigation and that he had spoken to the state comptroller’s Division of Investigations. William P. Reynolds, a spokesman in the comptroller’s office, would not comment on whether an investigation was being conducted.“New York State has a manual for town law,” Mr. Villanova said. “If you take the time to read it and to apply it to the way the town is operated, there would be no questions.”The 2007 audit was narrower than those in 1999 and 2003, which found that the town had also consistently overspent its budget.Saverio L.

"'07-09-16,'0','A slow-motion crisis in housing is consuming a region strangely unable to confront it.Housing advocates in these suburbs have long seen it coming. They have fought to build affordable-housing developments, and have been mightily opposed by residents blind to the benefits and overwrought by its perceived problems: density, traffic, higher taxes and those people — blacks, Latinos and the working class — although few these days are candid about that last part.Some affordable housing has been built — a 12-family complex was dedicated just last week in Bridgehampton, of all places — but not nearly enough to make a difference. Meanwhile, steadily rising housing prices and rents are making living here increasingly untenable for anyone of modest means, including young couples, students, entry-level employees, retirees, police officers, teachers. These are just the sort of people who make a community vibrant and healthy and save it from gated stagnation.Affordable housing is also critical for the region’s economic viability. It will be increasingly difficult to attract businesses if families cannot afford to buy homes. A Census Bureau report released last week showed that housing costs are eating up an ever-larger share of people’s incomes, a fact that residents of Long Island know only too well.When it comes to recognizing the scale and urgency of the housing shortage, some leaders are farther along than others. They include Long Island’s county executives — Thomas Suozzi, who has housing development in his grand vision for the economic rejuvenation of Nassau, and Steve Levy, who wants to tackle the problem on a big scale in Suffolk, with a plan for 1,000 units on county-owned land in Yaphank, where large corporate employers are being encouraged to relocate.Mr. Levy is leading an effort of seven downstate counties — Suffolk, Nassau, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Dutchess and Putnam — to press for help from Albany to confront what they consider a regional emergency. The legislation they envision would enlist the state’s help in planning projects and identifying potential housing sites, making loans for infrastructure improvements, recommending housing goals and providing land.The initiative is a good and promising example of the broad, regional thinking that will be needed to solve this crisis. The problem, though, is that the effort is entirely voluntary. Since state and county governments do not control zoning, the most they can do is entice and cajole towns and villages into doing the right thing.Affordable-housing advocates have long urged a tougher approach. They have sought a state law on inclusionary zoning, which would mandate that a percentage of new housing units be set aside as affordable. The State Legislature, however, has never gone along, which is unfortunate. Inclusionary zoning legislation is still one of the best hopes for solving the housing shortage.'"
"'07-09-16,'0','“You can get a good house for $750,000 in Garden City and your taxes would be less than the taxes on the condo,” said Ryan Donnelly, a real estate agent with the local office of Coach Realtors.He is currently listing a three-bedroom, one-and-a-half bath house, on a block that is farther away but still within walking distance of the train station, for $665,000, he said. The $9,000 yearly taxes, he added, would amount to about $750 a month.Neighboring Mineola, the Nassau County seat, is far less expensive over all than Garden City, but prices at a condo conversion there, the 59-unit Jackson Terrace Condominiums, are also viewed as high.The building, a formerly run-down rental that has undergone a top-to-bottom renovation, offers more room per unit than Hampshire House, with condos ranging in size from 852 to 1,111 square feet. But Olivia Musso of Musso Realty, which bought the building in 2005, said prices range from $317,000 for a one-bedroom, up to $515,000 for a two-bedroom, one-and-a-half bath unit.At least one broker, Evelyn Atanas of Atanas Realty, a longtime specialist in Mineola and Williston Park, described Jackson Terrace as one of several buildings currently priced too high. “It’s unbelievable” how many condos and co-ops are on the market right now, Ms. Atanas said during a recent interview, counting 80 in the Multiple Listing Service’s online listings.Ms. Musso acknowledged that of the Jackson Terrace units that have gone to contract since they were first put up for sale in February, many have been at the lower end of the asking price range — somewhere between the high $200,000’s and the mid-$400,000’s, she said. “Obviously people are looking for bargains,” Ms. Musso said, but she emphasized the building’s roominess and expensive renovations.Back in Garden City, the Hampshire House brokers defend its pricing by pointing out its major draw: It is on Seventh Street in the village’s vibrant downtown of upscale shops, spas and restaurants; and two blocks from the train station.But buyers who want to have a car must pay an additional $40,000 for one of the 18 indoor parking spaces, or rely on public parking in a village lot behind a fence in back of the building.Moreover, though the 77-year-old brick building is stately, with nine-foot ceilings in each unit and an attractive restored Old World lobby, it has none of the swimming pools or health clubs typical of many modern upscale condominiums. (Its common charge covers a part-time doorman and concierge, heat, hot water and gas for the stove, two superintendents who live in the building and maintenance for common areas and landscaping.)“They’re really reaching,” Mr. Donnelly, the Coach agent, said of the Hampshire House developers. “If they had amenities, the prices would be warranted, but besides the location, they don’t really have any amenities.”If they did have them, he pointed out, the Hampshire House would be “a different ballgame.” He cited the modern Wyndham condominium in Garden City, where prices start around $700,000 for a one-bedroom and go up to $3 million. The Wyndham, “a miniresort in the middle of town,” has a “pond, valet parking, a huge fitness center, pools, gyms, spas, saunas, a movie theater,” he said.Mr. Carlinsky tried to lighten the Hampshire House’s sticker shock. “We’ve made a lot of adjustments” to the prices, he said, adding that one two-bedroom, 675-square-foot unit’s price had been lowered 15 percent for the open house, to $699,000.He went further and invited what sounded like lower offers. “If somebody came to me today and made a reasonable offer,” he said, “we would certainly talk.”'"

In the 1940s and 1950s, customers would visit the pigs and geese at the farm’s petting zoo before carrying home a fresh ready-to-roast turkey from the adjacent butcher shop.Though the family farm is gone, you can still buy fresh chicken, turkey and duckling at the original Zorn’s market.

"'07-09-16,'0','Leviev, who is 51, is a legendary philanthropist, too — he refuses to say how much he gives away each year, but he did not dispute an estimate of $50 million. He does not share Gates’s universalist outlook, however. Leviev is a tribal leader, a benefactor of Jewish causes, particularly in the former Soviet Union, where he underwrites Jewish day schools, synagogues, orphanages, social centers and soup kitchens for more than 500 communities. To make this vast philanthropic enterprise run, Leviev subsidizes an army of some 10,000 Jewish functionaries from Ukraine to Azerbaijan, including 300 rabbis.Most of the 300 rabbis are Chabadniks, adherents of the Brooklyn-based Hasidic group Chabad — fundamentalist, missionizing, worldly and centered on the personality and teachings of the late Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher rebbe. Chabad is anti-abortion, regards homosexuality as a sexual perversion and generally finds itself aligned with other fundamentalist religious groups on American domestic issues. In Israel, it has supported right-wing Greater Israel candidates. Most controversially, during Rebbe Schneerson’s lifetime, Chabad entertained the notion that he might be the messiah; a vocal group in the community still does. (This led the ultrapious Rabbi Eliezer Shach to acidly define Chabad as the sect closest to Judaism.)Lev Leviev’s loyalty to Chabad is unquestioning. “The rebbe is my role model, and my values are his values,” he says.Lev Leviev arrived in Israel as a teenager in 1971, at a time when Moshe Dayan, hero of the Six Day War, was the legendary embodiment of the Israeli WASP (Well-born/Ashkenazi/Secular/Paratrooper). Immigrants were classified by their potential to attain this ideal. The Leviev family — unconnected, uneducated, not even real Russians but Bukharan Jews, primitives from the steppes of Central Asia — were classified as “bad material” and dispatched by government authorities to the dusty “development town” of Kiryat Malachi.Avner Leviev enrolled his son in a Chabad yeshiva. It was a match that didn’t take. “I’m not a born yeshiva scholar,” Leviev admits. In Tashkent he had finished 10th grade. He left the yeshiva after a few months, ending his formal education. If Leviev regrets this, he doesn’t show it. “I just wanted to make money,” he told me.Through a family friend, Leviev found work as an apprentice diamond cutter. It was industry practice not to teach anyone all 11 steps of the diamond-cutting trade, but Leviev paid his fellow workers to show him every facet of the process. By the time he finished an undistinguished stint in the rabbinical corps of the army, he was ready to go into business for himself.“I never doubted that I would get rich,” Leviev told me. “I knew from the time I was 6 that I was destined to be a millionaire. I’d go with my father to shops, and while he was talking business, my eyes automatically counted the merchandise.”Leviev chose a tough industry. “The diamond business is usually a family business,” says a Tel Aviv diamond merchant. “People accumulate wealth slowly, over generations. When Leviev started out, all he had was an amazing amount of ambition and the ability to understand the stone. Understanding the stone — that was the key.”The headquarters of Leviev’s U.S. diamond company, LLD USA, is located at the mouth of the Manhattan diamond district, on the corner of 47th Street and Fifth Avenue. To get up to his office, you need to be both photographed and fingerprinted by a very high tech security system.People who handle gems are cautious and security-conscious, and Leviev is no exception. Perhaps for that reason, many of his closest associates are relatives or longtime friends, most of them also Bukharan Jews. Paul Raps, the general manager of LLD USA, has known Leviev since they were both young diamond merchants in Ramat Gan. “One day we were sitting there, just chatting, and suddenly Leviev said to me: ‘You know what we need? We need to get our hands on the gelem.’ Uncut diamonds. I thought he was kidding. Nobody could find uncut diamonds back then.”Before Leviev’s epiphany, the world’s diamond market was strictly regulated by De Beers, a company founded in the 19th century to mine its first shaft of diamond-bearing kimberlite. In 1930, De Beers established a cartel that over the next few decades came to dominate diamond mining in the Soviet Union, Africa and the rest of the world. It regulated the market through a system of “sightholders,” handpicked producers of rough diamonds and dealers of finished diamonds, who were allowed to buy quantities of unfinished diamonds at fixed prices, via De Beers.When Leviev started out, there were about 100 sightholders around the world. They came to London several times a year and, at syndicate headquarters, were offered diamonds on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Those who left it too often were decertified, and new sightholders were selected.Small diamond cutters and merchants like Leviev couldn’t afford to buy from sightholders. They were allowed to buy rough diamonds from “secondary dealers” who managed to get their hands on small, smuggled quantities. It was a limiting arrangement, and Leviev didn’t like limitations. He applied to become a De Beers sightholder.“There was resistance to him at first,” recalls the Tel Aviv diamond merchant, who knew Leviev at the time. “A lot of people thought he was uncouth, not really civilized. This wasn’t anti-Semitism. Most of the people who rejected him were European Jews themselves. Leviev was an outsider, a Bukharan. But he was so industrious, so ambitious, such a good businessman, that eventually they had no choice. They had to accept him.”Soon Leviev became a rising star in the De Beers syndicate. He brought his extended family into his business, leveraged their resources and prospered. But he chafed under the control of the syndicate.In the late ’80s, Leviev saw an opportunity. De Beers had encountered antitrust problems in the United States. In South Africa, the apartheid government that had worked with De Beers was losing political power. At the same time, the Soviet Union, whose leaders had long had a mutually profitable partnership with De Beers, was nearing collapse.Leviev has a complicated relationship with his former homeland. In our first meeting, when I asked him about his boyhood memories, he surprised me by saying: “Fear. I grew up in fear.”Tashkent is a Muslim city, and although there wasn’t much overt anti-Jewish violence, there was a climate of mistrust. “Many times I was beaten up in school,” he recalls. But his biggest fear was of the Communist government.“As a boy, they used to make us stand at attention and salute the statue of Lenin,” he told me. “I’d curse him and the other Communists under my breath. They sent my grandfather to Siberia. They wouldn’t let us keep the Sabbath — we had to go to school on Saturdays. Just being Jewish was dangerous.”Still, he saw business potential in Russia. He spoke the language, knew the local customs. His father, sensing danger, begged Leviev not to go. So Leviev traveled to Brooklyn, to the headquarters of the Lubavitcher rebbe, for a second opinion.It is a meeting that has become folklore, both in Chabad and in the diamond industry. Leviev tells the story with obvious relish: “I spoke to the rebbe in Hebrew. I asked him, Should I go or not? He answered me in a kind of antique Russian. He said: ‘Go. Go to Russia and do business, but don’t forget to help the Jews. Remember your family tradition.’ ”This was more than good advice. The rebbe’s blessing gave Leviev the keys to the Chabad network in the former Soviet Union at a very dangerous time.Officially, Leviev was invited by the Soviet minister of energy in 1989, which was exploring ways of ending the De Beers grip on the country’s diamonds. “When I got there, Gorbachev was still in power, but you could sense that things were coming apart,” Leviev says. “Everything was unsettled, and I felt the fear again.”There were other risks, too. To do business with the Russians, Leviev had to give up his position as a De Beers sightholder. This shook the international diamond business. “It was unbelievable,” says the Tel Aviv merchant. “He was breaking the rules, going after the source. When he succeeded in Russia, and then in Angola, others saw it and were suddenly emboldened. That’s how Leviev cracked the De Beers cartel. With the instincts of a tiger and the balls of a panther.”There’s no need to cry for De Beers, which still controls a major share of the world’s uncut diamonds. But the syndicate no longer sets the worldwide market value of diamonds or decides who can manufacture and sell them.Neither can Leviev. But he has become the world’s largest cutter and polisher of diamonds and one of its major sources of rough diamonds — the gelem he dreamed of.A key to his success is his vertical integration. He mines the diamonds in Angola, Namibia and Russia, cuts and polishes them, ships them and sells them, wholesale and retail. He has a string of high-end shops in Russia and a luxury boutique, Leviev, on Bond Street in London. Next month, Leviev is opening a store on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, which, as the president of Leviev Jewelry, Thierry Chaunu, told a reporter, will cater to “the young hedge-fund professional who just got his bonus.”One of Leviev’s first moves in Russia was to set up a high-tech cutting and polishing plant. It provided jobs and, more important, showed the Russians how they could gain control of their own industry. In turn, the Russian government helped him gain a foothold in Africa. In 1997, Leviev bought into the Catoca diamond mine, Angola’s largest, in a joint venture with the Russian state diamond company, Alrosa; a Brazilian partner; and the Angola state diamond company. Leviev soon established warm ties with the Angolan president, José Eduardo Dos Santos, who speaks fluent Russian from his days as an engineering student in the U.S.S.R.When Leviev arrived in Angola, Dos Santos was fighting a civil war against Unita rebels, who were financed by the sale of smuggled “blood diamonds.” Leviev had a suggestion: Why not create a company that would centralize control of all diamonds? The company that grew out of that idea was the Angola Selling Corporation, or Ascorp, jointly owned by the Angolan government, a Belgian partner and Leviev. While Leviev’s plan took aim at the trade in conflict diamonds, critics say that Ascorp took advantage of mounting international pressure to establish and profit from a monopoly.Unita surrendered in 2002, after the death of its leader, Jonas Savimbi. By then, the Angolan government had effectively pushed De Beers out of the country, and Ascorp had generated great sums for the Dos Santos government (and, it is rumored, the Dos Santos family), created thousands of jobs for Angolans in newly established factories and mines and made Lev Leviev a vast fortune. None of this would have been possible without the Russian connection.On a shelf in Leviev’s Ramat Gan office sits a framed photo of Vladimir Putin. Leviev describes him as a “true friend.” The offices of many Israeli business magnates feature photographic trophies, grab-and-grin shots with (in ascending order of importance) the prime minister of Israel, the president of the United States, Bill Clinton and A-list Hollywood stars. Leviev has a different collection. Aside from the Lubavitcher rebbe and Vladimir Putin, there are photos taken with the leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Kazakhstan, for which he serves as honorary consul in Israel. (“Yes, I saw ‘Borat’ ” Leviev told me wearily. “Yes, I thought it was funny. But silly.”) Leviev’s picture gallery reflects his status as the president of the Federation of Jewish Communities in the former Soviet Union, an organization he has led since 1998. Nobody knows exactly how many Jews live in the former Soviet Union, but estimates range from 400,000 to upward of one million. Leviev leads them with his checkbook.“When it comes to contributing to the Jewish people, Lev Leviev is in a class by himself,” says Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident and former Israeli deputy prime minster. “I know a lot of rich people who give money. But Leviev is on a completely different level. He’s building entire communities.”More than this, he is a power broker and intercessor on behalf of beleaguered Jews throughout the former U.S.S.R. Take, for instance, the case of the Jewish private schools in Baku, Azerbaijan. Three years ago the government, concerned about the influence of neighboring Iran and the spread of local madrassas, decided to close all the private schools in the country. This, of course, included the Jewish school in Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital. The community elders petitioned the government, but to no avail.“They even tried to get American Jewish organizations to intervene,” Leviev recalled. “But the Jewish organizations couldn’t do a thing.” He smiled thinly. He has a generally low opinion of American Jewish activists, especially his fellow billionaires.And so Leviev decided to ride to the rescue. He flew to Baku on his private plane, parked at the airport and went straight to the synagogue.“The Jews were all gathered there,” he recounted in what is obviously a favorite story. “I told them to wait while I talked to the president.” At the time, that was Heydar Aliyev. “There were journalists in his outer office. Everyone was excited to see me there, because they thought I had come to invest money in the country. Heydar thought so, too. He said: ‘Just tell me what you’re interested in — oil? Gas? Tourism? What can I do for you?’“I asked him, ‘How can I invest in a country that doesn’t like Jews?’ Heydar got very upset when I said that. He began telling me how many Jewish friends he had and how much the Jews had contributed to his culture and the country and so on.“ ‘But you’re closing down the Jewish school,’ I told him. ‘I’ve come to ask you to allow it to remain open. Right now the Jews of Baku are gathered in the synagogue, awaiting your answer.’ ”Leviev paused at this point in the story. Dramatic tales of peril and salvation are part of the Chabad oral tradition.“Heydar consulted his advisers,” Leviev said. “Then he returned to me and said: ‘The school can remain open. All right?’“I told him: ‘Well, there’s another problem. The Jewish institutions here are in bad shape. Can you arrange for me to acquire a plot of land to rebuild?’“ ‘Not quite. I’d appreciate it if you would personally open the school next year. That way there will be no misunderstandings about what the government’s position is.’“Heydar said: ‘I’ll do that. Are you satisfied now?’“I told him: ‘Just one last thing, sir. Those journalists in your outer office? Would you mind announcing our agreement to them?’ ”After Aliyev’s press conference, Leviev remembers returning triumphantly to the synagogue to deliver the good news. Shortly thereafter, Aliyev died and was succeeded by his son, with whom Leviev is on friendly terms.“And did you invest after that?” I asked.Leviev smiled. “No,” he said. “Azerbaijan has so many natural resources they don’t need my investment. But I told them that they would get a blessing from God.”Leviev insists that he maintains a strict division between his community leadership and his business dealings. Perhaps this is so, but the republics of the former Soviet Union are not famous for their transparency. At any rate, business depends to a large extent on personal and political access. “A big part of our analytical value depends on the perception that we can get anything approved in Russia,” says Jacques Zimmerman, the vice president for communications of Africa Israel, Leviev’s international holding and investment company.This perception has been strengthened by public displays of affection between Putin and Leviev. In 2000, the Russian president was the guest of honor at the opening of the Jewish Community Center in the Marina Roscha district of Moscow, which Leviev played a major role in building. It was a gesture widely interpreted as a sign of good will not only toward Russia’s Jews but toward Leviev himself.Putin also took Leviev’s side in a dispute over the post of chief rabbi of Russia, backing Leviev’s candidate, Berel Lazar, over Adolf Shayevich, who held the position. The Kremlin’s endorsement of Lazar was a final confirmation that Leviev had achieved a typically audacious and improbable victory — putting the fundamentalist Chabad in effective control of the assimilated, mostly irreligious Jewish communities of the former Soviet Union.Lazar’s selection has been quite controversial not only in Russia but also among Jewish groups in Israel and in the U.S. But Chabad is nothing if not practical, and they have taken a gradualist approach to winning over Russia’s secular Jews. Schools enroll nonreligious students and offer them a full government curriculum, along with some beginner’s Torah studies. Community centers hold coeducational social events. There are even mixed dances.Such modernity comports with Leviev’s personal style, which is, in its outward aspect, Chabad-lite. He once made headlines by closing his upscale mall in Ramat Aviv — a bastion of WASP Israel — on the Sabbath, and officially his businesses are closed on Saturday. But he maintains a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy for his Israeli executives, some of whom hold unofficial meetings and phone sessions on the Sabbath. Abroad, some of the businesses Leviev owns an interest in work seven days a week, and his American 7-Elevens sell nonkosher food. Leviev himself strictly observes the Sabbath, but he has been known to interrupt his weekday prayers for important phone calls.Unlike many Chabad men, Leviev is clean-shaven, wears stylish business suits open at the collar and sometimes lounges in jeans, and his small black skullcap is barely visible. He is also something of a feminist. The women in his office, including his private secretaries, are allowed to wear slacks, a violation of strict Orthodox custom. Leviev’s two eldest daughters have been brought into the business as senior executives. Zvia, a mother of four who runs international marketing and mall businesses for her father, is frequently mentioned in the Israeli press as a potential successor. Leviev is proud to have raised his nine children in B’nai B’rack, Tel Aviv’s ultra-Orthodox suburb, but he is planning to move to an estate in Saviyon, the equivalent of going from Borough Park to Scarsdale.Leviev’s pragmatism ends, however, at the vexing and fundamental question of who is a Jew. American Reform Judaism recognizes patrilineal descent. The State of Israel grants citizenship under the Law of Return to people with a single Jewish grandparent. But Leviev accepts only the Talmudic rule that a Jew is anyone born to a Jewish mother, or someone who has undergone an Orthodox conversion and agreed to keep all 613 Jewish laws.There are a great many people who regard themselves as Jews but do not meet these criteria. In Israel alone, there are an estimated 300,000 among Soviet immigrants, and perhaps more than that in the former Soviet Union. “What do you do about all these people?” I asked Leviev. “Just write them off?”Leviev’s answer: “It’s not a matter of what I do or what I want. I have no choice. The law is the law.”A few years ago, concerned Bukharan Jewish immigrants in New York reported to Leviev that their children were being corrupted by the public schools of Queens. “The kids were going out with Pakistanis, Puerto Ricans, all sorts of people,” I was told by one of Leviev’s intimates. Leviev would have been equally horrified to learn that the Bukharan Jews of Queens were hooking up with descendants of the Mayflower.In response, Leviev donated the money for a private school in Elmhurst. He picks up the tuition tab for the entire student body — about 800 kids at an estimated $18,000 a pop. Leviev regards this as a pilot project. His goal, I was told by his assistant, Shlomi Peles, is to make a free Orthodox Jewish education available to every Jewish child in United States.The educational project is just one part of Leviev’s recent discovery of America. After 9/11, he and a partner bought the JP Morgan building near ground zero at a bargain price (a reported $100 million), converting it into luxury condominiums and clearing a very handsome profit. It made him a believer in New York.“Every building is half a billion dollars,” he told me. “All you need is a global perspective. I knew New York would come back.”Jacques Zimmerman, who handles communications for Africa Israel, told me: “Lev’s natural tendency, his home court, is Israel and Russia. But he is constantly looking to expand.”The engine for this growth is Africa Israel. The company is publicly traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and handles Leviev’s businesses, not including privately held diamond interests. Leviev personally owns about 75 percent of Africa Israel, which was valued, in mid-July, at approximately $5 billion.According to Zimmerman, Africa Israel has made a “strategic decision” to think big. “The work involved in large and small projects is about the same, so why not do big projects?” In Moscow, Africa Israel is currently building a million-square-foot mall as well as another 750,000-square-foot mall that is entirely underground. It is the lead partner in a consortium that is building the subway in Tel Aviv. Africa Israel is active in China, India, the Philippines and Latin America as well.“We’re worldwide, but our emphasis is moving more and more to the United States,” Zimmerman says. “In the last six months, we’ve bought into more than a billion dollars’ worth of projects in Manhattan, and that’s going to grow.”Africa Israel’s American holdings include not only the former New York Times Building but also a half-share of the Apthorp apartment building on the Upper West Side and the Clock Tower on Madison Avenue, 1,700 Fina gas stations around the country and development projects in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Phoenix. Recently the company announced it will be opening a giant Hard Rock amusement park in Myrtle Beach, S.C.“All you need to do business in America is a good name, and banks will lend you all the money you need,” Leviev told me with enthusiasm.Israel is a society in which successful people are rarely praised. But I encountered very little criticism of Leviev there, even from members of the Jewish WASP business establishment. “He’s still an outsider,” one high-powered Tel Aviv lawyer told me. “We don’t know anything about his personal life. But from what anyone can tell, he’s clean. You read about him in the business pages of the newspaper, not the gossip columns.”One of Leviev’s greatest admirers is Eitan Raff, chairman of Israel’s Bank Leumi, from which Leviev bought Africa Israel in 1996. The sale was controversial at the time. “He was a Russian,” Raff says. “We didn’t know him or anything about him. We thought he might be some kind of oligarch. I hired two or three investigators to check him out. He came up clean.”There were a number of foreign suitors for Africa Israel, but after fighting broke out in Jerusalem between Israeli and Palestinian gunmen, they became skittish and withdrew, leaving Leviev as the sole bidder. The asking price was $400 million, and Bank Leumi had to sell; it had been ordered by a court to divest itself of nonfinancial holdings, including Africa Israel, by a certain date. Leviev had the bank over a barrel. “What would you say to $330?” Leviev asked Raff.“No, it’s worth four, that’s the fair price,” Raff said.Leviev stuck out his hand, diamond-business style. “Four,” he said.“He acted with great probity,” Raff says. “He didn’t try to take advantage or squeeze. His word is his bond,” he says. “Look, I’m a kibbutznik. Leviev and I aren’t from the same world at all. But I consider him a friend, and I think he’s an example of what the head of a public company should be.” Leviev’s biggest public-relations problem is his association with Arkady Gaydamak, a mysterious Russian-Israeli billionaire of unsavory reputation, now under indictment in France for a variety of offenses, including gunrunning and money laundering. Gaydamak, who cuts a flamboyant figure and recently established his own political party in Israel, is reputed to have made his fortune selling arms in Angola in partnership with various European, Israeli and African military and government figures.Leviev says he was first introduced to Gaydamak by the former Mossad chief Danny Yatom. They certainly knew each other. According to the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan journalism group based in Washington, Leviev and Gaydamak jointly acquired a metallurgy plant in Kazakhstan in 1999. A year later, Gaydamak bought a 15 percent share of Africa Israel, which he later sold. Leviev swears they are no longer partners, but the relationship has stained his reputation.Unlike Gaydamak, Leviev has thus far steered clear of Israeli politics. That doesn’t mean he lacks influence, however. He meets from time to time with the nation’s leaders, mostly to discuss the economy. He owns Israel’s Russian-language television station, which reaches about 15 percent of the population. Despite his allegiance to Chabad, Leviev is considered a moderate. “He’s not one of the crazies,” a former adviser to Ariel Sharon told me. “Certainly not a Greater Israel man.”Leviev’s global view is Moscow-centric and more than a little Machiavellian. He says he believes, for example, that America’s difficulties in places like Iran, Syria and Venezuela come primarily from George W. Bush’s failure to come to Russia’s economic aid. “If Bush had invested $100 million to help the Russian economy early in his first term, he’d have Putin’s friendship,” he says. “Instead, Bush put the money into a war with Iraq, and he’s been paying for it all over the world ever since.”The first time I spoke to Leviev, he denied that he had any personal political aspirations. Three days later, he wasn’t so sure. “Would I like to be prime minister?” he mused. “I might. When I turn 60.”That’s nine years off. At Leviev’s pace, nine years is a lot of time — time enough to make his way into the Forbes “starting 10,” time to complete the Chabadization of Soviet Jewry and time, perhaps, to make a run at becoming Israel’s first Russian-Bukharan-mohel-mogul prime minister.'"
"'07-09-16,'0','In 1999, 22 years after I left Colombia, I decided to open up the Pandora’s box of my past, and I knew that an important part of the journey would be trying to find my childhood playmate Imelda. But before leaving New York, I didn’t know how to start. I saw her every day for almost a decade but never knew her last name. Tracking her down seemed impossible. So many people — aunts and cousins and nannies and maids and cooks — passed through our house.Imelda was a lanky 8-year-old when she came to live with us in the city of Barranquilla around the time I turned 2. My grandparents, landowners from the northeastern part of the country, sent her from their finca, their farm. She came in the jeep with the weekly delivery of fresh meat, milk and fruit. No one introduced us, and no one told me why she was there. But from that day on Imelda became my constant companion.Imelda had a cropped Afro, dark skin, almond-shaped eyes and perfect teeth. She woke me up in the morning and stood by my bedside when I prayed at night. Then she retired to her cot in the servants’ room with the cook and two maids. We played all kinds of games, and in all of them I was the commander and star. Imelda even came with me to my friends’ birthday parties, always wearing the same yellow dress. She helped us break the pinatas but never knelt down to gather the candies, and she knew to have her Coca-Cola and slice of cake in the kitchen. Then one day when I was about 9, I came home from school and she was gone. I never asked what happened. It was just ya no está, she is no longer here. I can’t remember if I ever missed her.I’d been back at my grandmother’s place in Barranquilla for days before I asked her about Imelda. “Grandmother,” I said, “do you remember that girl who lived with me when — ?” I didn’t have to finish. “Imelda, sí. ¿Por qué?” she said, unfazed by my bringing up her name more than 30 years later.My grandmother explained that Imelda was the daughter of a trabajador, someone who works the land but does not own it. Her father, Tulio, came to our gates; he walked from the south for days. This was in the ’50s, during la violencia, an undeclared war between liberals and conservatives in which more than 200,000 people were killed. (Although it still has no real name, the conflict, as well as the displacement, continues: three million people have been forced to leave their land in recent years.)“I remember him perfectly,” my grandmother said, “with his wife and a pack of children. The boys were stark naked. The girls wore rags.” My grandfather gave them food and clothes, then offered Tulio work and a piece of land to live on and farm. Tulio accepted my grandfather’s offer. Years later, he showed up at their gates again with an offering of his own, his daughter Imelda. “She can help one of your daughters in the city,” he apparently said. To the adults in my family it somehow made sense. My sister had just been born, and I needed to be distracted. To Tulio, with his ever-growing family, it meant one less mouth to feed. Then my grandmother said that Imelda came to see her recently. “She was having problems with her eye,” she said. “Remember she had un ojito malo?” I never knew that Imelda was almost blind in one eye.'"

"'07-09-17,'0','These Americans and many others were already struggling before the problems on Wall Street arose. Now they are looking at their homes and wondering if their greatest source of wealth will still have the same value in another year, or even another month. And we're all wondering whether this will spill over to the wider economy.So we know there is a need right now to restore confidence in our markets. We know there is a need to renew public trust in our markets. But I also think that this is another moment that requires, in FDR's words, a re-appraisal of our values as a nation.I believe that America's free market has been the engine of America's great progress. It's created a prosperity that is the envy of the world. It's led to a standard of living unmatched in history. And it has provided great rewards to the innovators and risk-takers who have made America a beacon for science, and technology, and discovery.But I also know that in this country, our grand experiment has only worked because we have guided the market's invisible hand with a higher principle.It's the idea that we are all in this together. From CEOs to shareholders, from financiers to factory workers, we all have a stake in each other's success because the more Americans prosper, the more America prospers. That's why we've had titans of industry who've made it their mission to pay well enough that their employees could afford the products they made. That's why employees at companies like Google don't mind the vast success of their CEOs – because they share in that success just the same. And that's why our economy hasn't just been the world's greatest wealth creator – it's been the world's greatest job generator. It's been the tide that has lifted the boats of the largest middle-class in history.We have not come this far because we practice survival of the fittest. America is America because we believe in creating a framework in which all can succeed. Our free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get, however you can get it. And so from time to time, we have put in place certain rules of the road to make competition fair, and open, and honest. We have done this not to stifle prosperity or liberty, but to foster those things and ensure that they are shared and spread as widely as possible.In recent years, we have seen a dangerous erosion of the rules and principles that have allowed our market to work and our economy to thrive. Instead of thinking about what's good for America or what's good for business, a mentality has crept into certain corners of Washington and the business world that says, ""what's good for me is good enough.""In our government, we see campaign contributions and lobbyists used to cut corners and win favors that stack the deck against businesses and consumers who play by the rules. Massive tax cuts are shoved outside the budget window and accounting shenanigans are used to hide the full cost of this war.In the business world, it's a mentality that sees conflicts of interest as opportunities for profit. The quick kill is prized without regard to long-term consequences for the financial system and the economy. And while this may benefit the few who push the envelope as far as it will go, it's doesn't benefit America and it doesn't benefit the market. Just because it makes money doesn't mean it's good for business.It's bad for business when boards allow their executives to set the price of their stock options to guarantee that they'll get rich regardless of how they perform. It's bad for the bottom line when CEOs receive massive severance packages after letting down shareholders, firing workers and dumping their pensions; or when they throw lavish birthday parties with company funds.It's bad for competition when you have an Administration that's willing to approve merger after merger with barely any scrutiny. Such an approach stifles innovation, it robs consumers of choice, it means higher prices, and we have to guard against it.And it's bad for the market when there are over $1 trillion worth of loopholes in the corporate tax code, or when some companies get to set up a mailbox in a foreign country to avoid paying any taxes at all. This means a greater share of taxes for Americans and small businesses that are trying to compete but can't afford to lobby their way to more loopholes.It also means that investment goes to the companies that are best connected instead of the ones that are most productive. Economics 101 tells us special interest politics distorts the free market. After all, why would an oil company invest in research for alternative fuels that could save our environment when they can get billions of dollars in subsidies to keep drilling for oil and gas?These anti-market, anti-business practices are wasteful, unproductive, and antithetical to the very spirit of capitalism. They benefit the undeserving few at the expense of hardworking Americans and entrepreneurs who play by the rules.In fact, the danger with this mentality isn't just that it offends our morals, it's that it endangers our markets. Markets can't thrive without the trust of investors and the public. At a most basic level, capital markets work by steering capital to the place where it is most productive. Without transparency, that cannot happen. If the information is flawed, if there is fraud, or if the risks facing financial institutions are not fully disclosed, people stop investing because they fear they're being had. When the public trust is abused badly enough, it can bring financial markets to their knees. We all suffer when we do not ensure that markets are transparent, open and honest.We saw this during the dotcom boom of the 90s when conflicts of interest between securities analysts, whose research was supposed to guide investors, and the banks they worked for led investors to doubt the markets in general.We saw it during the Enron and WorldCom scandals when major public companies artificially pumped up their earnings, disguised their losses and otherwise engaged in accounting fraud to make their profits look better – a practice that ultimately led investors to question the balance sheets of all companies.And we cannot help but see some reflections of these practices when we look at the subprime mortgage fiasco today.Subprime lending started off as a good idea – helping Americans buy homes who couldn't previously afford to. Financial institutions created new financial instruments that could securitize these loans, slice them into finer and finer risk categories and spread them out among investors around the country and around the world.In theory, this should have allowed mortgage lending to be less risky and more diversified. But as certain lenders and brokers began to see how much money could be made, they began to lower their standards. Some appraisers began inflating their estimates to get the deals done. Some borrowers started claiming income they didn't have just to qualify for the loans, and some were engaging in irresponsible speculation. But many borrowers were tricked into glossing over the fine print. And ratings agencies began rating bundles of different kinds of these loans as low-risk even though they were very high-risk.Most everyone knew that some of these deals were just too good to be true, but all that money flowing in made it tempting to look the other way and ignore the unscrupulous practice of some bad actorsAnd yet, time and again we were warned this could happen. Ned Gramlich, the former Fed governor who sadly passed away two weeks ago, wrote an entire book predicting this very situation. Repeated calls for better disclosure and stronger oversight were met with millions in mortgage industry lobbying. Far too many continued to put their own short-term gain ahead of what they knew the long-term consequences would be when those rates exploded.Those consequences are now clear: nearly 2.5 million homeowners could lose their homes. Millions more who had nothing to do with this could see the value of their own home decline – with some estimates projecting a cost of nearly $164 billion, primarily in lost home equity. The projected cost to investors is nearly $150 billion worldwide. And the impact on the housing market and wider economy has been so great that some economists are now predicting a possible recession – a prediction all of us hope does not come to pass.There are a number of lessons that we must learn from this going forward. We know that much of this could have been avoided if the market operated with more honesty and accountability. We also know we would have been far better off if there were greater transparency and more information had been available to the American people.To that extent, I believe there are a few steps we should take to prevent future crises of this kind and restore some measure of public trust in the market: First, we need more disclosure and accountability in the housing market. To ensure that potential homeowners aren't tricked into purchasing loans they can't afford, I've proposed updating the current mortgage rules to establish a federal definition of mortgage fraud and enact tough penalties against lenders who knowingly act in bad faith. I've also proposed a Home Score system that would create a simplified, standardized metric for home mortgages, sort of like the APR. This would empower Americans to make smart decisions by allowing prospective buyers to easily compare various mortgage products so they can find out whether they can afford the payments. And I believe we should finally enact the meaningful mortgage disclosure laws that the mortgage industry has been lobbying against for far too long.Second, I believe that if we hope to restore trust in the markets, we must be able to trust the judgment of our rating agencies. The failure of government to exercise adequate oversight over the rating agencies will cost investors and public pension funds billions of dollars – losses we have not yet fully recognized. We cannot let the public trust be lost by a conflict of interest between the rating agencies and the people they're rating. As Arthur Levitt recently reminded us, this happened when rating agencies continued to give a rosy outlook for Enron despite its impending bankruptcy. And of course we saw it this year when subprime mortgage loans continued to receive strong ratings despite repeated warnings of the instability of the mortgages and the impending slowdown of the housing market.Here's the real danger – if the public comes to view this like the accounting analyses of Enron, the markets will be ravished by a crisis in confidence. We must take steps to avoid that at all costs, and that is why I believe there should be an immediate investigation of the relationship and business practices of rating agencies and their clients.The third thing we need to do is look at other areas in the market where a lack of transparency could lead to similar problems. Many of the people who hold these subprime mortgages are now shifting their debt to credit cards, and if they do not understand the commitments they're taking on, or are subjected to predatory practices, this could fester into a second crisis down the road. That's why I'm proposing a five-star credit card rating system to inform consumers about the level of risk involved in every credit card they sign up for, including how easily the company can change the interest rate. If more Americans were armed with this kind of information before they purchased risky mortgage loans, the current crisis might not have happened. Now that so many are in debt, we shouldn't let the same lax standards create another.Finally, while it's not my place to comment on the actions of the Fed, I have heard many of you say that you hope for a sizable rate cut tomorrow to soothe the market turmoil.But I also know that there are nearly 2.5 million Americans who may lose their homes no matter what happens tomorrow. And so for those institutions that are holding these mortgages, I ask them to show some flexibility to folks trying to sell or refinance their houses. They are in the same liquidity pinch as companies are, but they don't have the same resources available to protect themselves.Now, in addition to these immediate steps, I also believe there is a larger lesson to be learned from the subprime crisis.In this modern, interconnected economy, there is no dividing line between Main Street and Wall Street. The decisions that are made in New York's high-rises and hedge funds matter and have consequences for millions of Americans across the country. And whether those Americans keep their homes or their jobs; whether they can spend with confidence and avoid falling into debt – that matters and has consequences for the entire market.We all have a stake in each other's success. We all have a stake in ensuring that the market is efficient and transparent; that it inspires trust and confidence; that it rewards those who are truly successful instead of those who are just successful at gaming the system. Because if the last few months have taught us anything, it's that we can all suffer from the excesses of a few. Turning a blind eye to the cronyism in our midst can put us all in jeopardy. And we cannot accept that in the United States of America.So I promise you this. I will be a President who believes in your success. I will value your contribution to this country and I will do what I can to encourage it, because I understand that how well you do is inextricably linked to how well America does. And I will always be a strong advocate for a market that is free and open.But today I am asking you to join me in saying that in this country, we will not tolerate a market that is fixed. We will not tolerate a market that is rigged by lobbyists who don't represent the interests of real Americans or most businesses. And we will not tolerate ""what's good for me is good enough"" any longer – because the only thing that's good enough is what's best for America.I am also asking you to join me in doing something else today. I am asking you to remind yourselves that in this country, we rise or fall as one people. And I am asking you to join me in ushering in a new era of mutual responsibility in America.Right now there are millions of hardworking Americans who have been struggling to get by for quite some time. They have watched their wages stagnate and their health costs rise and their pensions disappear. Some have seen jobs shipped overseas and others have found new ones that pay much less. Some tell their children they won't be able to afford college this year, others send their youngest to a school that is crumbling around them.I meet these Americans every single day – people who believe they have been left on the sidelines by a global economy that has forever changed the rules of the game. They understand that revolutions in technology and communication have torn borders and opened up new markets and new opportunities. They know we can't go back to yesterday or wall off our economy from everyone else. Their problem is not that our world is flat. It's that our playing field isn't level. It's that opportunity is no longer equal. And that's something we cannot accept anymore.For too long we have had a President who has clung to the belief that there is nothing America can do about this. He has looked away from these challenges and peddled a philosophy of ""what's bad for you is not my problem.""It may be true that many of the dislocations that have occurred were propelled by technology, and if we are honest, I think we must admit that those who have benefited from the new global marketplace – and that includes almost everyone in this room – have not always concerned themselves with the losers in this new economy. There has been a tendency, during the boom times, to consider the casualties of a changing economy to be inevitable, and to justify outsized paydays or lower tax rates on Wall Street earnings as part of the natural order of things.Indeed, rather than addressing this growing sense of uncertainty and constricting opportunity for millions of working-class and middle-class Americans, this Administration has accelerated these trends through its tax policies and spending priorities – to the point where there is greater income inequality now than at any time since the Gilded Age.It may be true, as some have argued, that larger forces are at work here – that technological advance and globalization have triggered a fundamental change in the economy. It is true as well that we cannot simply look backwards for solutions – to try to fence off the world beyond our borders, or to hope that the New Deal programs borne of a different era are, by themselves, somehow adequate to meet the challenges of the future.No, we are going to have to adapt our institutions to a new world as we always have. And in doing so, we have to remind ourselves that we rise and fall as one nation; that a country in which only a few prosper is antithetical to our ideals and our democracy; that those of us who have benefited greatly from the blessings of this country have a solemn obligation to open the doors of opportunity, not just for our children, but to all of America's children; and that unless we take immediate steps to realign the interests of all Americans in growth and prosperity, we may generate a political climate that is inimical to both.And so, in the coming weeks, I will be laying out a 21st century economic agenda for America. It's an agenda that will level the playing field for more Americans to ensure that America can compete and thrive in a global economy.It will focus on three broad areas.Tomorrow, I'll lay out the first part of my agenda – a plan to modernize and simplify our tax code so that it provides greater opportunity and more relief to more Americans. For far too long, our tax code has been so riddled with special-interest loopholes and giveaways that it's shifted the tax burden to small businesses and middle-class Americans. At a time when most Americans are facing stagnant wages and rising costs, that's not fair and it doesn't benefit our economy. My plan will give a break to middle-class Americans, seniors, and the homeowners who are feeling today's anxiety and uncertainty, because I believe that we all have a stake in restoring their confidence and investing in their prosperity.The second part of my agenda will be to ensure America's competitive edge in the 21st century. This starts with providing every American with a world-class education from cradle to adulthood. We know that in this economy, countries that out-educate us today will out-compete us tomorrow. And we also know that China is already graduating four times as many engineers as we do and that our share of twenty-four-year-olds with college degrees now falls somewhere between Bulgaria and Costa Rica.We can't allow ourselves to fall behind. That means investing in early child education. It means recruiting an army of new, qualified teachers who we pay more and support more because we know how important their job is to the future of this country. And it means finally making a college education affordable and available to every American. Tony Blair once said that ""Talent is the 21 st century wealth,"" and I believe we all have a stake in nurturing that talent if we hope to prosper in this century.Ensuring our competitive edge also means investing more in the science and technology that has fueled so much of our nation's economic growth. And one place where that investment would make an enormous difference to the future of this country is in a renewable energy policy that ends our addiction on foreign oil. We know this addiction isn't sustainable for our security. We know it's not sustainable for the planet. And I've talked to countless CEOs and business leaders who know it's not sustainable for our economy to be held hostage to the spot oil market. I believe that we all have a stake in a renewable future that will create thousands of new jobs and entire new industries that can fuel our prosperity well into the next century.Finally, the third part of my agenda will be to modernize and strengthen America's safety net for working Americans. Like all of you, I believe in free trade. But we have to acknowledge that for millions of Americans, its burdens outweigh its benefits. And so if we want to avoid rising protectionism in this country; if we expect working Americans to accept and even embrace free trade, then I believe we all have a stake in embracing policies that will provide them with a sense of security. That means health insurance and a pension that they can always count on. That means skills and training that can actually help people find a job. And that means wages that actually make work pay.I ask for your support for this economic agenda, both in this campaign and if I should get the chance to enact these policies as your President. I will not pretend it will come without cost, but I do believe we can do achieve this in a fiscally responsible way – certainly more so than the current Administration that's given us deficits as far as the eye can see.I know some may say it's anathema to come to Wall Street and call for shared sacrifice so that all Americans can benefit from this new economy of ours. But I believe that all of you are as open and willing to listen as anyone else in America. I believe you care about this country and the future we are leaving to the next generation. I believe your work to be a part of building a stronger, more vibrant, and more just America. I think the problem is that no one has asked you to play a part in the project of American renewal.I also realize that there are some who will say that achieving all of this is far too difficult. That it is too hard to build consensus. That we are too divided and self-interested to think about the responsibilities we have to each other and to our country. That the times are simply too tough.But then I am reminded that we have been in tougher times and we have faced far more difficult challenges. And each time we have emerged stronger, more united, and more prosperous than the last. It is faith in the American ideal that carries us through, as well as the belief that was voiced by Franklin Roosevelt all those years ago this week: ""Failure is not an American habit; and in the strength of great hope we must all shoulder our common load."" That is the strength and the hope we seek both today – and in all the days and months to come.'"
"'07-09-17,'0','Q. Even though this is not strictly a question about advertising acceptability, perhaps you will answer in the hopes of clearing up the last of the MoveOn/Petraeus ad controversy.When the controversy came to a head, the Times spokeswoman explained that with advocacy groups, any customer willing to buy space on a ""standby"" basis will get the same discounted price; while The Times does its best to accommodate with respect to the preferred date and placement, it cannot be guaranteed. Once the run date is known, the customer is usually informed. This is evidently what happened with the MoveOn ad.Some bloggers point to the fact that the ad, which ran on the day General Petraeus testified, said he would be testifying ""today,"" and thus, The Times must have agreed to run it on that day.Could you please explain how it works when someone wants to run date-specific copy on a standby basis? Are there different versions for different days?Thanks for your response.A. As the acceptability director it was my job to say yes, or no to the ad, as I do every day for hundreds of advertisements. Let me explain how opinion advertising decisions are made.In the past year, The New York Times accepted opinion ads from more than 200 groups, from Save Dartmouth to Save the Constitution. We accept ads from organizations across the political spectrum and from many groups and individuals, who simply have something to say. With opinion advertising, sometimes called advocacy advertising, the client uses our pages to make an argument or to dispute what someone else is saying … and this may include negative characterizations.Acceptance of an ad does not in any way reflect the official position of The New York Times nor do we need to agree or endorse our advertiser's message or opinion. We only decline or alter an opinion ad when the message is clearly discriminatory, illegal, libelous, or hate speech. Of course, we expect advertisers to stay within the bounds of good taste aswell.The MoveOn.org ad was published because it complied with our standards. This ad was also accepted because it is our ongoing desire to keep our advertising columns as open as possible to the public, which we believe is a First Amendment responsibility. I would also point out that this ad was similar to other ads that criticized President Bush, formerPresident Bill Clinton, and countless other public officials.Within the category of political or advocacy advertising it is common practice throughout the newspaper industry to offer a standby rate in addition to open rate advertising. When a group buys a standby ad, it can request a particular date for it to be run, but receives no guarantee that it can appear that day. The lower cost of such ads reflects the flexibility that gives us. Any political or advocacy group calling up today to request a standby ad would be quoted the same rate that MoveOn.org paid.It is also our practice to notify an advertiser, a day before, that we have room to accommodate his or her standby ad in the next day's newspaper, and at that point the advertiser can make minor changes in the text.Q. Because the H.I.V. virus continues to be a serious problem nationally, it's important (I believe) that condom advertising should not be restricted because of worries over taste. I think the TV networks are gradually changing their rules to allow more of these ads, at least during some hours of the night. What are the policies at TheTimes concerning condom ads, what is the rationale for them, and have these policies changed over time?A. I can tell you that The Times accepts advertisements for condoms provided that the copy and illustrations are in acceptable taste. This policy has changed over the years. At one time condom ads were accepted only if the ad dealt with the health benefits of using condoms. Thanks for asking.Q. Let's say I would like to purchase a full page ad in your newspaper and beat the #@*& out of Hillary Clinton. All proper and no foul language. Would you allow that?A. First of all, we do not accept the word #@*& in advertisements in this newspaper. As a matter of fact, we accepted a full advertisement for a book that contained that word on the book's cover just last week. We insisted that the vulgarity be changed to asterisks or other characters.Now, without the vulgarities, we would accept an advertisement that criticized Senator Clinton, as long as it stayed within the parameters of good taste.Q. It appears that many companies now are joining the bandwagon of global warming and carbon print responsibility because it makes good commercial sense, if customers want it.How does advertising plan to keep an eye on claims and responsibilities of advertisers? The whole thing could be taken for a ride if we just pay lip service to it. How do we know that advertisers are genuine in their claims? What's the code of conduct?Should a scientific advisory group be created to supervise irresponsible advertising claims?A. We expect all of our advertisers to be able to substantiate their claims, be they in an opinion ad or in a product ad. If the advertiser cannot substantiate their claims, we may ask them to modify their advertising.In product or service advertising, if our readers find there is a difference between the advertised claims in the advertisement and how the product performs, they can write or call this department. We then ask the reader to document the complaint, and we forward it to the advertiser.The advertiser usually contacts the reader to make a satisfactory adjustment to the product.Q. A couple of weeks ago, the main page of www.nytimes.com displayed a large ad for ""The Center for Union Facts,"" an anti-labor group inviting visitors to ""help stop the big union power grab."" The ad was pretty shocking to me, and made me wonder if The Times only runs advertisements whose politics it shares. Especially after Giuliani's demand for the same low rate given to MoveOn.org by The Times earlier this week, I'm hoping you can answer how The Times makes choices like this in picking their sponsors, whose messages certainly reflect on the publication as a whole. Is The New York Times anti-labor? Or is advertising just another kind of editorial?A. In an effort to keep our opinion advertising columns as open as possible, we accept ads form virtually all individuals and groups.We make no judgments on the advertisers' politics, arguments, factual assertions or conclusions. We accept opinion advertisements regardless of our editorial position on any given subject. In short, the background or the message is of no concern of ours as long as the advertiser stays within the bounds of good taste, and is not gratuitously offensive on racial,religious or ethnic grounds.I can assure you that The Times is not anti-labor and the advertisement that you saw reflected only the views of the advertiser and not of this newspaper.Q. We are subscribers on Sundays, and really enjoy receiving The Times. However, we detest it when The Times includes perfume samples amid its magazine pages. The smell is not contained, and permeates the entire magazine. I'm not able to read the magazine, much less touch it when this happens. I get immediate headaches from perfumes. Maybe you received my letter some time ago where I sent back the offending perfume ad? Annoying, isn't it?A. Dear Ms. Almeida: Perfumed inserts in The New York Times Magazine, or scent strips, are a problem for many readers who either suffer from asthma or get headaches like you do. We looked into this problem many years ago and suggested that the perfumes be sealed until the strip was broken by the reader to release the scent. Ultimately, this did not work because the perfume manufacturers wanted their scent to leak out of the scent strips and permeate the entiremagazine.The only alternative we had was to either decline all the scent strips or send separate magazines to subscribers who wished to get a scent-free magazine. We chose the latter.I am sending your name and address to our advertising department and you will be added to the list to receive a scent-free New York Times Magazine via the mail, every time a scent strip appears.Thank you for letting us know.When Advertising Looks Like a MagazineQ. I've always been puzzled by Chicago Life magazine, which runs as an advertising supplement to The New York Times. Reading the letter from the editor in Chicago Life, a casual reader might mistake it for an unbiased,editorially-independent publication (despite the ""advertising supplement..."" disclaimer that is printed on each page). It has many of the trappings of a ""real"" magazine — interviews with prominent individuals, travel stories, etc. But, upon careful review, there's obvious advertorial content (some articles mention only advertisers, restaurant ""reviews"" that are uniformly positive and again primarily feature advertisers, etc.). In my opinion, it's offensive because it tries so hard to deceive and conceal its true purpose.Several years ago I wrote an a letter to the New York Times ombudsman about Chicago Life, and was told that the ombudsman doesn't deal with advertising. So I'm curious where you draw the line. How many issues of Chicago Life have you read cover to cover, and did you find anything wrong with the way it presents itself?A. I've read Chicago Life for a number of years now, but only as an advertising professional.As a free-standing insert to The New York Times in the Chicago area, Chicago Life is clearly marked ""Advertising Supplement to The New York Times"" on the cover and is marked ""Advertising Supplement"" on each page. According to the rules of the Audit Bureau of Circulation, the typeface should also be different from our product and it should be clearly labeled. There is also a disclaimer that says that the insert did not involve the reporting or editing staff of The New York Times.As long as Chicago Life is clearly marked as an advertising supplement, we believe that it meets our advertising standards for clarity and honesty.Q. There have been plenty of ads in the Times I've disagreed with, but I've only seen two series of advertisements that I've felt were inexcusable in their bad taste. One is an on-going exploitative series of fund-raising ads showing children with palates damaged by birth defects; the other was a series of people who look like they'd been badly beaten about the head and neck, their faces dark purple — in full-page full color, so you couldn't miss it — with a captioncalling the puffy and bruised faces a metaphor for liver damage.How do you determine whether to accept or reject ads whose intent is clearly to invoke a visceral, horrific ""yuck!"" reaction?A. We have declined ads over the years that in our opinion would not be appropriate to share with your morning bagel and coffee. One of the more memorable ""yuck"" factor ads was a two-page color ad from a nameless (and I believe defunct) search engine. It showed the details of a hospital operating room just after an unsuccessful attempt to save a man's life. The operating room showed a dejected doctor along with the bloody detritus of equipment and supplies. A caption in the corner read ""Search; Is there life after death.""The Smile Train ads showing a little girl appealing for money to help doctors perform operations in Third World countries speaks to a stark reality.The liver damage ad for a drug marketed by Hoffman LaRoche to prevent Hepatitis C is clearly designed to shock. If it were designed to shock in order to sell computers, clothes or any other product, we would have turned it down. Since this ad could help save lives, we agreed to publish it.Thank you for bringing up the subject.Q. I use a Firefox plug-in called ""NoScript"" primarily because of the way that The New York Times Web site is programmed. I probably check the site two to three times a day (plus home delivery), but the advertising was so intrusive and distracting, that I found it hard to read.Your ads would flash, change colors, or, in at least one case, grow to cover the editorial content. Turning off scripting also turns off the ""multimedia"" presentations on your site — which by and large is also a blessing. I have not (yet) turned to the more drastic plug-ins that turn off all advertising.In any event, I wonder what your policy is for ads that flash, are distracting, that use fancy scripting to intrude on editorial content, or, as in the case of the mortgage company with the dancing Santas, are just plain ugly.A. Our policy is to accept flash ads that animate for 30 seconds or less and include a default version for people who don't have a flash plug-in. We also accept advertising that expands upon user-initiation (but that youshould be able retract as well). Some of the ads that you see that animate are flash, and some are just animating graphics.We also take a limited number of ""uninitiated overlay"" ads: these appear over content without the user initiating anything. They can also be eliminated from view by using the close button that is always required to appear with the ad. Each person should only receive only one of these ads per visit to The New York Times Web site.What Gives with Louis Vuitton?Q. What's your take on the new Louis Vuitton ad campaign featuring celebs from another time? Do you think it targets new customers or appeals to the old ones? None of them seems to be an icon of fashion, so what gives?A. I could only guess at why they are featuring stars and statesmen from years ago in their advertising, but to my mind it sets them apart from other upmarket competitors. The very fact that you are asking about it confirms that they have hit on a winner.It might also be that these celebrities from years ago are more recognizable to an older demographic now, who happen to be older and richer.Q. The NYT has run many ads by Matthias Rath, a vitamin salesman who makesunsubstantiated claims that micronutrients treat AIDS, cancer and bird flu.Rath has a warning against him by the FDA and his ads have been ruledagainst by the British Advertising Standards Authority and the AdvertisingStandards Authority of South Africa. His claims have been condemned byUNAIDS, Harvard Medical School researchers and many others. One of his adsdescribed an experiment conducted on people in South Africa for which hehad no ethical approval. He has also misrepresented the NYT on his websiteby giving the impression that he has written for or been quoted in thepaper. Why does the NYT persist in running his ads? I can supply further details if you require.A. We do not accept advertising from Dr. Rath that claims to cure AIDS orcancer with micronutrients. He did run some advertisements where he usedhis own research to show improvements in AIDS research trials in Africa.Subsequently, those claims have been discredited and they have not beenrepeated in this newspaper.Recently Dr. Rath has been back on his original crusade against themultinational pharmaceutical companies. We allow this kind of advertisingbecause it is opinion advertising. Dr. Rath feels that the global, oil anddrug companies are behind our society's dependence on drugs to treatillness and that going to war is only one means to the end in keeping thatmonopoly. One of is recent ads was headlined ""Nuremburg Records Reveal:Oil and Drug Cartel Behind WWII. We will continue to accept these.Q. What about some of the ads in the Sunday book section? Some ads appear tobe from strange but harmless little vanity presses. But some appear to befrom outright kooks. You don't worry that these ads bring into question theTimes's content and legitimate advertising? The overall perception of thesection?A. The small classified ads in the back of the book section are indeed apotpourri of offerings to authors and the book community.In all the years that I've been in the advertising acceptability departmentthere was only one case of one of these small vanity presses takingprospective authors' money and never providing any service in return. Ifthere were a problem here, we would likely know about it and handle it thesame way we would any other reader complaint.So, as far as I can see, these advertisers are small, esoteric and havefound a business niche for themselves.Q. I appreciate you making yourself available to take questions from thegeneral public.I am referring to an ad I found in The New York Times Style Magazine Womens' Fashion Fall 2007. Pg. 185, Cesare Paciotti. The image shows a woman with no pants on, on a stationary bike. She is clearly perched onto a bar that appears to be inserted into her body and the look on her face is such that she is in a situation of passion... good or bad. I am not certain what caught my attention other than her incredibly beautiful legs. Then I tried to figure out what was being sold. It wasn't until another five minutes or so that it struck me how utterly pornographic this ad is, but once noted, difficult to ignore. Rods inserted in women are used as forms of sexual abuse and even torture in our world today...My question is.... Is The New York Times taking advertising revenue from Cesare Paciotti for clothing, bikes, accessories, erotic sex, or misogyny?A. I continue to be surprised at the reaction of some of our readers to the advertising that appears in the Women's Fashion Magazine section.The Cesare Paciotti advertisement for handbags and shoes, shows a model wearing a unitard (along with handbag and shoes) on a stationary bicycle. Be assured that we did consider this advertisement carefully and found that it complied with our standards.Q. Was there any debate at the Times about running the eight-page advertisingsupplement last year that celebrated Sudan as a wonderful place to dobusiness? I know that Nicholas Kristof, one of the most eloquent andpassionate voices speaking out against the genocide there, did not objectto it afterwards, but I found it deeply offensive. Doesn't the fact that theSudanese government is actively engaged in the wholesale slaughter ofinnocent civilians violate your own standards against ads that are""misleading, inaccurate, or fraudulent''? If whitewashing genocide isn¹toffensive to human ""decency and dignity,'' where exactly does the Times drawthe line?When your major requirement is that the content not be in poor taste, youmay be missing the true obscenity.A. Dear Mr. Goldsmith: The tragedy in Darfur continues to call for an immediate internationalsolution and there is no doubt that the people there are badly in need ofrelief. The Times has vigorously reported on the Sudan and our editorialshave condemned the actions the Sudanese government has taken against itsown citizens. Last year, The New York Times accepted a specialadvertising section on the Sudan in keeping with our policy at the time ofkeeping our advertising columns as open as possible. It accepting it, wedid not endorse the politics, the trade practices or actions of the Sudan,or the character of its leaders.However, there are those who feel that we should not have accepted thissection and that debate is fair. If nothing else, the Sudan sectionhas taught us is that we need to approve or disapprove these sections longbefore they are sold, packaged and produced by outside agencies andultimately delivered to us as a finished product.We have therefore set up a committee within The Times to examineinternational advertising opportunities such as foreign governmentadvertising. The committee will examine theissues relating to the countries inquestion well in advance to determine whether we will approve or disapprovesuch sales.Q. Since you've been fielding quite a few questions featuring complaints andcriticisms, let me offer one that offers a compliment. I am a long-timereader of the Times, and every day I find myself looking forward to theelegant one-ninth-page ads on pages 2 and 3 of the newspaper for Tiffany,Saks, Lord & Taylor, etc, always in the same place on the page.Seeing them in their familiar positions everyday is like walking up Fifth Avenueknowing I'll see their stores at the same place along the avenue. Theyacknowledge festive holidays, days of mourning and every day in between.It seems these companies have held this newsprint real estate forever. Howdid they achieve this vaunted position, and how does the Times treat thesecompanies' ads differently from other advertisers? How do you feel aboutthese ads and their place of honor in the newspaper?A. Mark: Thank you for your kind words.Tiffany's advertising has a longstanding and valuable relationship with theTimes, and therefore has held the premier position in our newspaper fordecades.We are very happy that they continue this tradition.The following questions concern advertising on nytimes.com, so Mr. Jesperson consulted his Web colleagues to answer them.Q. Periodically when opening The Times, a box appears with the bold statement""YOUR OPINION COUNTS"" and requests you to complete a questionnaire. Theimpression is that the poll is sponsored by The Times, but it turns out that this is a commercial for UPS. This is ""sucker-type"" advertising, and should be below Times standards and definitely does not create any good will for UPS. Please comment.A. These surveys are run by our advertisers to gauge performance of ads thatrun on our site. We sanction them, but they are not written by us nor hosted by our staff or site. We work with advertisers to control their frequency to prevent our visitors from getting them more than occasionally.Q. Why must we online subscription readers/payers have to be subjected to ads before an article or video will load? Newspapers are SPATIAL, not TEMPORAL. This sleazy practice is just an opportunistic abuse of the electronic delivery medium of what is still a newspaper. Newspapers are expected to use spatial ads that can be viewed when the reader chooses to do so.A. We run ""interstitial"" ads (ads that appear before the page that you requested), which appear before you enter internal pages of our Web site or between pages as you navigate. We've taken a careful look at the impact these ads have on the browsing experience and their effectiveness as an advertising unit, and as a result limit them. You should only see one per visit, and it will give you the ability to skip it using a link in the upper-right corner of the screen.Q. I would rather continue to pay for an online subscription that is devoid ofthe constant barrage of animated ads. The constant motion on each page is tantamount toa spoiled child screaming for attention, smacking the back of dad's paper while he is trying to digest the day's news. Can you not afford your readers the option of paying for a babysitter?A. How animation affects the browsing experience has always been a concern. We try to maintain a mix of static and animated ads to prevent a carnival-like atmosphere, and any animated ad must discontinue animation after approximately 30 seconds. We do not accept constant animation advertising, and if we see any of those ads on the site(which can happen, as many ads are served through third-party systems and change frequently) we try to work quickly to have those changes made.Q. This is part of the response you gave to Alan Harper:""Our policy is to accept flash ads that animate for 30 seconds or less and include a default version for people who don't have a flash plug-in. We also accept advertising that expands upon user-initiation (but that you should be able retract as well). Some of the ads that you see that animate are flash, and some are just animating graphics.""Periodically some of the Flash ads placed in the Times increase CPU usage to 100 percent. When I wrote about this a while back, I was told that my comment would be forwarded to the Advertising Department. The e-mail also suggested hitting the escape key to stop the animation. Does the Times have a policy about how processor intensive Flash ads may be? In my experience the CPU usage stays high until I navigate off or close the page.A. There are a number of reasons for a 100-percent CPU usage, and they don't have to be ad-related. One cause could be that the user has a lot of adware and spyware on the computer from many years of Internet usage. Many issues relating to CPU usage have to do with PC's and programs running in the background, which in most cases start when Windows boots up.Sometimes these programs are useful and necessary. But quite often they are not needed, and in too many cases cause severe problems (freezing, crashing, etc.), even those on some of Microsoft's own XP Services and Vista Services.Option 1 for the user with such problems is to do the following:Go to start>run>msconfig>startup>and uncheck everything, then rebootand see if it happens.In Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista you bring up the Task List of runningprocesses by right-clicking on the Task Bar and choosing ""TaskManager."" In Windows 95/98/ME you can bring up the Task List (WindowsTask Manager) by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del.This link will let you know for A-Z whether the program running is indeed useful.Q. In many of your responses to people who wrote e-mails, your answers frequently refer to ""good taste."" How exactly can you explain that? God forbid that if something happened to you, how would your successor know what your idea of good taste was? I'm assuming much of it is personal preference, so how do you create a uniform rule for such a vague idea?A. The good taste that we refer to in these advertisements is the judgment that the copy and illustration fit in the context of the advertisement. When we consider each advertisement as a whole - with copy, illustrations, time and place all put together - we can then make a judgment as to whether it is acceptable or not. When any of these elements change, the ad can become unacceptable.This department is guided by an acceptability manual that was written a number of years ago, and we continue to update it. It is our internal guide, which on a category-by-category basis, helps us make informed and hopefully wise decisions.Q. Standards regarding decency, vulgarity or printabililty vary from community to community. How does the Times deal with this? As the Times is NYC based, is it fair to say the paper defaults to big-city standards when a deciding which ads are OK to run?A. You're right that standards on vulgarity and decency vary from community tocommunity and from state to state. That is why I have always been in favorof newspapers having their own separate advertising acceptability standards. They should not copy our standards but develop standards for themselves, which work for their publication and community.With that said, we try to take into consideration our readers from a wide area and not just from New York. When there is a question of taste and propriety, we trust our instincts.Q. What book (or any other medium) has most influenced you to find the paththat brought you to your current position?A. It wasn't a book or medium. There were two people, now retired from this newspaper, who greatly influenced my path to my current position. One was my predecessor in this position, Robert Smith. He taught me to listen and/or read carefully, trust my instincts, deliberate, and then decide. But most of all, check your ego at the door. The other was Allan M. Siegal, former Standards Editor in the newsroom. He was always there to answer the hard questions. When I made a mistake, someone (usually him), would let me know.Q. A lot of people, myself included, think “betray us” as a play on a general's name was in atrocious taste. The Times did not consider it in bad taste, so it ran. Can you give us a couple of examples of phrases fromadvocacy ads that were deemed in bad taste and removed?And in order to avoid the appearance of favoritism — an appearance the Times demands its reporters avoid — wouldn't it be a good idea to end the space-available discounts on advocacy ads altogether?A. We declined an advertisement from an environmental group that questioned an oil company’s motives (acceptable) but tried to insert unacceptable language in its corporate logo; we also declined another ad because it also manipulated a company logo. Another group tried to make an allusion to a cowchip, another one wanted to use a nude photograph.And these are only a few.In turning down these advertisements it is well to note, that the group usually came up with another ad, either very soon afterward or within a few months. The advertisers understood why we said no, and ultimately gave us alternate copy that was acceptable.When we look at these ads we find that as the years go by, our standards, like society itself, have changed. Some words and pictures not accepted a few short years ago would be acceptable today.Q. Your discussion this week has been most enlightening in helping readers to understand how the Times goes about finding a balance between competing objectives of opening your advertising to a diverse range of opinions while trying to avoid claims that are misleading or offensive. But one point still is not that clear to me. In your answer regarding Dr. Rath's advertisements, you seem to distinguish between claims for medical cures, which you have rejected because the ""claims have been discredited,"" and other advertisements in which he has expressed strong opinions about world affairs. I gather from this that a looser standard is applied to opinion advertising and that even claims that The Times might conclude are discredited (for example, that Roosevelt plotted to encourage an attack on Pearl Harbor) would still be allowable as exercises in free speech not targeting any ethnic or religious group. But then I'm not clear on what distinguishes Dr. Rath's medical claims from his other claims — couldn't both be viewed as opinions with which readers (and The Times) are free to agree or disagree with? Is the distinction that Dr. Rath stood to profit from the medical claims and that the same claims would have been allowed in an advertisement that was paid for by someone who did not stand to profit?Or is there a different standard for claims that can be discredited by scientific evidence — but if that's the case, how can the paper be fully open to disputes about science, e.g., the impact of global warming or whether autism is caused by inoculations? Or is there another distinction that I am missing?A. We distinguish opinion advertising from all other types of advertising that we accept. In the case of Dr. Rath, we will continue to accept his opinion ads relating to his views on world affairs but not his claims of medicalcures. We will accept his statements that the immune system can be strengthened by the use of micronutrients, but there is much disagreement about whether vitamins can prevent an individual from contracting a virus.In any case of claiming a medical cure for a disease or illness, we would need documentation from the medical community. In this way we do not expose our readers to ""miracle cures"" from unknown charlatans. We will also continue to accept opinion ads where there is a legitimate scientific dispute. Many times in these disputes the outcome cannot be readilydetermined. Such is the case of the global warming and the causes of autism.Q. Would The Times allow BP to run ads like this, say on the front page of the business section, or in the large mid-page ad on the front page of the online edition?A. There's no problem with the advertisement for BP, only a problem with the news content concerning BP near a BP advertisement.In the newspaper, we would accept such an ad (different configuration) on the front of Business Day. The lead time to schedule such an advertisement is long enough so no one would be aware of any conflicts. However, were there to be a major news story concerning BP on that day, the ad would be moved.On the Web site, the answer is a bit different. The advertisement would be accepted in a rotation of advertisements that change all the time. If there was a news story about BP, there is a small chance of it appearing on the same page as dozens of ads that move through the rotation. If it bought a fixed position on a Web section front, the ad would not be moved.Q. I would also like to receive a scent-free New York Times Magazine. I never knew that was an option, and your response didn't include the contact information for making that request. Will you please publish it?A. The New York Times Magazine without perfumed inserts is available to subscribers by contacting Karen Farina in our advertising department. Her email is kfarina@nytimes.com. I will be happy to forward your request toher.Q. I'm not sure this is in your area, but I wonder why some ads are so annoying in terms of flashing or moving? Don't advertisers realize that that motivates people to install flash-blocking and similar software sothat they then never see the ads at all? Similarly, the ads that take up a whole page and have to be moused and then clicked to get past — every time I see AmEx do that on the Times Web site I vow never to be an AmEx customer.On the other hand, I like the quiet text ads on Google and often follow those links. You'd think annoying advertisers would go, ""duh,"" and wise up.Q. I read The Times online every single day, and have for several years now. My question about ads concerns the online ads that appear next to whatever article I'm reading, the ones that constantly move. I find it extremely annoying and distracting to try to read whatever the article is about with movie ads or other things constantly moving just next to my line of vision. Often, it is so disruptive to both my vision and concentration while I'm trying to read something, I have to close the article. I don't think it is the intention of The Times to make the ads force its readers to close the articles. Can you make the ads move only if a person is actually interested in the movie, make-up, etc., and perhaps clicks on it? I love The Times and it would make reading the paper a much more enjoyable experience.Q. I very much enjoy reading The Times online. However several months ago there was an increase in advertisements that took control of my browser automatically scrolling the page and overriding manual control. It was so irritating that I installed an ad-blocking program. What are the chances that such ads will be discontinued? While I feel bad about denying The Times ad revenue, I don't feel badly enough to cede control of my PC.Q. When I clicked on askthetimes@nytimes.com I was surprised to find the first thing to come up was an ad! Thankfully, there was a place to click to ""skip this ad"" (though very inconspicuous). Unfortunately, that is not always the case, and I think it should be. For people who are not interested in being subjected to advertising when they are trying to get some information from the Internet, advertisements are a huge annoyance. I particularly object to being required to see an ad before I can access one of your videos about some current event. If there is a way to avoid that, I would like to know about it, but better yet, put the ad at the end, where we can cut it off. I realize you put these ads in a prominent place because you want the advertising revenue, but annoying your readers eventually turns them off.A. Animation within ads is an industry standard technique for online advertising, and while advertisers do get some complaints about it (some of which are passed along from the comments we get here), many of them choose to take advantage of this creative flexibility. Based on metrics that our advertisers measure, they find that animation, whether it's subjectively attractive or not, generally is effective.Our visitors can argue the creative merits of each ad, but our acceptability policy has to be based on objective standards. We have ad specs that are designed to create an unobtrusive atmosphere on the Web site while also allowing advertisers the flexibility to get their message across in ways that are in line with industry standards for online advertising. One of the ways we do this is to limit uninitiated ad animation to approximately 30 seconds and restricting animation to only a portion of the ad spaces on the page.'"

"'07-09-17,'0','In a 244-page decision, the court reaffirmed that Microsoft had abused its near-monopoly in computer operating systems to gain unfair advantage over competitors such as RealNetworks in digital media players and over Sun in so-called workgroup computer servers. The court rejected Microsoft’s argument that sufficient competition had developed in both businesses.“The court finds the commission did not err in assessing the gravity and duration of the infringement and did not err in setting the amount of the fine,” the ruling stated. “Since the abuse of a dominant position is confirmed by the court, the amount of the fine remains unchanged.”Legal experts said the European court’s ruling could embolden judges elsewhere, like those in South Korea and Brazil, where Microsoft is facing similar challenges to its business practices. But they said the ruling, handed down by the court’s presiding judge, Bo Vesterdorf, on his final day in office, is unlikely to have an effect in the United States, where courts rarely force companies to share intellectual property with competitors.“The message being sent with this ruling is: If you are a dominant player in a given market, you have to be on your best behavior in Europe,” said Damien Gerardin, an Brussels antitrust lawyer with the firm Howrey. “It is clear that the commission will be emboldened by this ruling and will strictly pursue wrongdoing.”Microsoft’s allies said the court’s decision, which expressly forbids the company’s policy of bundling new extras into its Windows operating system, would have a chilling effect on the business strategies of many global software makers.“This ruling is certainly going to introduce a lot of uncertainty,” said Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a Washington-based group that supported Microsoft in its legal case in Europe. “What the court is basically saying is that if you develop a successful product and get too big, the European Commission is going to force you to give away your intellectual property.”When Microsoft wants to put handwriting and speech recognition features or stronger antivirus features and other security software into the Windows operating system, competitors can complain to European authorities, even though the European unbundling order in the media player case — compelling Microsoft to offer a version of Windows in Europe without the media player but with no difference in price — was a failure.“This is sort of a licensee to go after Windows’ tying of secondary products,” said Herbert Hovenkamp, a leading antitrust scholar at the University of Iowa College of Law. “We haven’t heard the last of the legal challenges to Microsoft’s bundling practices by any means.”The order applies only to Europe. But Microsoft may have a difficult time containing the impact on the European market only. As a practical matter, the proprietary information it passes to competitors in Europe will be hard to bottle up in one region of those global companies.“Over the long run, the effect is going to be to open up adjacent markets more than they are now,” Mr. Hovenkamp said. “That could be an important result of this decree well beyond Europe.”Representatives of the European Commission, which had devoted unprecedented resources to nine-year-old case, called the decision a “bittersweet” victory.Neelie Kroes, the European Union competition commissioner, said at a news conference in Brussels that while the decision set an “important precedent,”, the judgment “is bittersweet because the court has confirmed the commission’s view that consumers are suffering at the hands of Microsoft.”Brad Smith, the general counsel for Microsoft, who was present for the reading, said the company would follow the ruling but did not say specifically whether the company would appeal it.“It’s clearly very important to us as a company that we comply with our obligations under European law. We will study this decision carefully and if there are additional steps that we need to take, we will take them,” Mr. Smith said.The decision followed a five-day hearing on the issues under appeal in April 2006. Microsoft had indicated in the past that it would appeal any negative ruling to the European Court of Justice, the highest court in Europe. But an appeal by the company, a process likely to take at least two years, would focus only on whether the appellate court erred in procedure and points of law in reaching its decision, not on the facts in the case.Kelyn Bacon, a British lawyer who had argued the case before the court on behalf of a Microsoft ally, the Washington-based Association for Competitive Technology, said Microsoft would have ample opportunity to overturn the judgment in a final appeal. Ms. Bacon said Microsoft could challenge the court’s determination that Microsoft had abused its Windows dominance since the company faces intense competition in the server and media player markets.Microsoft has already been forced to pay nearly 1 billion euros in fines in the nine-year-old legal case, which has pitted the software maker against the commission and a host of competitors, including I.B.M., and Novell.The ruling validated the pursuit of Microsoft by Mario Monti, former competition commissioner for the European Union, and his successor, Ms. Kroes.After Sun filed the initial complaint in 1998, the commission later expanded its inquiry to include Microsoft’s practice of bundling its Windows Media Player into the Windows operating system. After Microsoft began bundling its media player into Windows, it overtook the market leader, RealNetworks.Microsoft has been repeatedly fined by the commission since the 2004 antitrust ruling for inadequately supplying the protocols. “I think this means it’s about time for Microsoft to comply,” said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer in Brussels with the firm Clifford Chance who represented the European Committee for Interoperable Software Systems, a group including several Microsoft competitors like I.B.M.Mr. Smith of Microsoft, in Luxembourg, said: “There has obviously been a lot of work that has gone into our efforts to comply with the commission’s terms with respect to communications protocols. We have made a lot of progress in that regard and yet we all have to acknowledge that there are some issues that do remain open.”In the course of the litigation, Ms. Kroes said in Brussels, Microsoft’s share of the market in workgroup servers has risen to 80 percent, up from 40 percent, and that Windows Media Player has come to dominate the market.She highlighted the fact that Microsoft has 95 percent of the world market for desktop operating systems and said she would like to see this fall.“You can’t draw a line and say exactly 50 percent is correct, but a significant drop in market share is what we would like to see,” she said. “Microsoft cannot regulate the market by imposing its products and its services on people.”Jeremy Allison, the co-creator of Samba, a maker of desktop and server software in San Jose, Calif., that bridges the gap between Microsoft and non-Microsoft products, said the European court’s ruling would help small software developers more easily obtain financing to fund their promising innovations. Samba supported the complaint against Microsoft.“One of the major obstacles many small software developers face is the question: Can your innovation be overtaken or replicated by Microsoft?” said Mr. Allison, who flew to Luxembourg to hear the court’s decision.'"
"'07-09-17,'0','But two Democrats who will have a powerful say over whether Mr. Mukasey gets confirmed — Senators Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Charles E. Schumer of New York — vowed today to use the nomination to pressure the White House into turning over information that the Senate Judiciary Committee has been seeking on the domestic wiretapping program and the government’s treatment of military detainees.“All I want is the material we need to ask some questions about the former attorney general’s conduct, on torture and warrantless wiretapping, so we can legitimately ask, ‘Here’s what was done in the past, what will you do?’ ” Mr. Leahy, the committee chairman, told reporters.Whether that is a negotiating tactic, or a threat that could turn into an all-out battle, was unclear today. But Mr. Leahy did say he had told the White House counsel, Fred F. Fielding, that the nomination could not go forward without the information, and that “cooperation with the White House would be central” to scheduling hearings.Senator Schumer, for his part, seemed today to take on the role of mediator between Mr. Leahy and the White House. On Sunday, Mr. Schumer — who first floated Mr. Mukasey’s name with the White House as a potential Supreme Court nominee four years ago — praised Mr. Mukasey as a potential “consensus nominee.” Today, he said he had told Mr. Fielding that the White House would have to resolve Mr. Leahy’s concerns.“Chairman Leahy’s concern is genuine,” Mr. Schumer said in an interview. “He strongly defends the prerogatives of the committee. I stressed that to both Fielding and Mukasey. It would be much better for everyone concerned if they could reach an agreement.”The White House is trying to cast the Mukasey confirmation as urgent and is calling on the Senate to put him in place at the Justice Department before lawmakers leave for their next recess on Oct. 8. In private, top aides to Mr. Bush are calculating that Democrats will not want a messy confirmation fight.And most Democrats reacted with caution today. Several, like Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, said Mr. Mukasey would have to prove that he is independent of Mr. Bush and can repair the damage they say was done to the department by Mr. Gonzales, who many Democrats regarded as a crony of the president.Others, like Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, sounded surprised by what they regarded as an unusual White House overture. Mr. Biden said he was “pleased that President Bush put aside his old habits and picked an outside professional to nominate as attorney general, rather than a member of his own circle.”With just 16 months left in his administration, Mr. Bush can ill-afford a nasty confirmation fight, and the White House had been extremely concerned about finding a consensus nominee — so much so that it found itself trying to fend off criticism not only from the left, but also the right.Leading conservatives in Washington had set their sights on Theodore B. Olson, the former solicitor general. But Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said last week that Democrats found Mr. Olson too partisan and would block his nomination.White House officials would not say how seriously Mr. Bush had considered Mr. Olson — or even confirm whether he was under consideration. But they did say the president had interviewed several candidates and that he offered Mr. Mukasey the job last Friday. Bill Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, said top aides to Mr. Bush had already been feeling out conservatives about Mr. Mukasey by the time the job was offered.“The White House was very interested in Mukasey 10 days ago; they were already probing to get more information about him and how conservatives would react,” Mr. Kristol said. “So I don’t buy the argument that they backed off in the face of Reid’s criticism of Olson.”Another ally of the Bush administration, Jay Lefkowitz, a former domestic policy adviser to Mr. Bush, said the president “had several very competent potential nominees,” adding: “I think he picked a nominee who was not only highly qualified but also commanded significant respect on both sides of the aisle. That’s a significant advantage at this stage of the presidency.”Still, the White House had to sell the nomination to conservatives, and over the weekend top aides to Mr. Bush made a furious attempt to do so, inviting at least six leading conservative thinkers to the White House for face-to-face meetings with Mr. Mukasey. Participants said a range of issues were discussed, from Mr. Mukasey’s views on national security matters to his Republican political pedigree.'"
"'07-09-17,'0','Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, a leading Democratic supporter of the legislation, said Sunday: “I’m increasingly optimistic that we’re going to have a deal. The House and Senate are working day and night to put together a framework that both Democrats and Republicans can support.”Neither side will get all it wants, Mr. Rockefeller said, but “we are very close to a compromise that will protect the health and future of millions of children.”At issue is the future of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. Supporters of the Senate bill, passed last month by a vote of 68 to 31, had enough votes to overcome a presidential veto. Only five Republicans voted for the House bill when it was approved, 225 to 204.The compromise is likely to pick up some Republican votes in the House but probably not enough to override a presidential veto, Republicans said. A two-thirds majority is needed to override a veto — 290 votes if all 435 representatives are voting.The compromise would allow states to cover nearly half of the children who are uninsured. About 6.6 million youngsters are now covered under the program.The Congressional action comes in response to urgent appeals from governors of both parties. In a letter to Congress last week, Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, and Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association, said, “For health and moral reasons, Congress must pass and the president must sign a reauthorization of the program by Sept. 30.”Without prompt action by Congress, they said, “it will be virtually impossible for states to continue coverage for children already enrolled.” The Congressional Research Service said that 12 states would have no federal money available on Oct. 1, while an additional 23 states would exhaust their allocations in the coming year without a fresh infusion of money.The framework devised by Congressional negotiators would provide $60 billion for the Children’s Health Insurance Program over the next five years. That is about the same as in the Senate bill — $35 billion more than the current level of spending, but $15 billion less than the House wanted and $30 billion more than Mr. Bush wanted.Republican supporters of the program, led by Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, had said they could not support legislation that cost more than the Senate measure.Mr. Fratto, the White House spokesman, said: “We have issued veto threats against both the House and Senate bills. So the House moving toward the Senate position is not sufficient.”The proposed compromise does not include provisions of the House bill dealing with Medicare. One of those provisions, vehemently opposed by Republicans, calls for cuts in Medicare payments to private health plans. Another provision would increase payments to doctors, who, under current law, face a 10 percent cut in their Medicare fees on Jan. 1.While Medicare is off the table for the moment, senior Democrats from both chambers said they intended to deal with it in separate legislation later this year.Republican senators were involved in some of the recent negotiations, but Republican House members and their aides were generally excluded.Democrats say the confrontation with Mr. Bush will sharpen the contrast between his priorities and theirs.“If the president signs the bill we present to him, it’s a major accomplishment,” said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. “If he vetoes the bill, it’s a political victory for us. Public opinion polls show strong support for expanding kids’ health coverage.”The proposed compromise would increase tobacco taxes to help pay for expansion of the child health program. It is generally similar to the Senate bill, which called for an increase of 61 cents per pack of cigarettes, generating $35 billion in new revenue over five years. The tax is now 39 cents a pack. The House bill had a 45-cent increase.Democrats and some public health advocates say the tax increase would deter smoking. But many Republicans oppose it. Kevin G. Smith, a spokesman for the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, said the congressman “did not come to Washington to increase taxes.”Congressional aides said the compromise bill would affirm the states’ ability to decide who qualifies for the Children’s Health Insurance Program.On Aug. 17, the Bush administration issued a new policy that would make it much more difficult for New York, California and other states to use federal money to cover children from middle-income families — specifically, those with annual incomes exceeding two and a half times the poverty level, or $51,625 for a family of four.The compromise bill is likely to roll back some of the new restrictions but would probably not eliminate all of them, Congressional aides said.If Mr. Bush or Congressional Democrats have a post-veto strategy, they have not described it in any detail. One possibility would be a temporary extension of the program, for 3 to 12 months. But that would create uncertainty for beneficiaries and for state officials and could leave important policy questions unresolved.'"
"'07-09-17,'0','But a lawyer who filed the original complaint against Microsoft for Sun Microsystems in 1998 said the current level of competition in media players was not relevant because Microsoft gained its market lead by unfairly bundling its player.“The court’s decision on Microsoft’s appeal will certainly not be moot,” said Michael J. Reynolds of the law firm of Allen & Overy. “How did Microsoft build its position in this market? They did so through bundling. The court’s decision will have an effect on a number of markets in Europe on whether dominant players can use bundling.”When the complaint against Microsoft was first filed, according to a study by the research firm Media Metrix, now comScore, the dominant maker of media players was RealNetworks — whose RealPlayer had three times the number of users as Windows Media Player.Microsoft quickly caught up after it began to give away its own media player with Windows in May 1999. By March 2002, according to Media Metrix, Windows Media Player had pulled even with RealPlayer, each having some 45 million unique users.Figures from Nielsen/NetRatings show that Microsoft was the top global maker of media players as of January, with a 50 percent market share. But the Microsoft media player recorded just 2 percent growth in 2006.By contrast, Nielsen found, Apple increased the use of its iTunes media players by 48 percent in 2006 for a 19 percent share of the market. RealPlayer remained at No. 2 with a 22 percent share, and Apple’s QuickTime desktop player was at 9.6 percent.In the United States, video sent using Adobe’s Flash format accounted for 22 percent of all streaming video traffic in 2006, according to AccuStream iMedia Research of Salinas, Calif. Adobe recently said it was developing its own media player to take advantage of Flash’s popularity.Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, a group that includes Sun Microsystems, RealNetworks, Adobe, I.B.M. and Nokia and which testified in the case against Microsoft, said the statistics were misleading and Microsoft still had a dominant position in media players.“Adobe is developing a media player,” Mr. Vinje said. “It has not been launched and has zero market share.”Thomas Graf, a lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, which also represents the committee, said iTunes was not a streaming video player. Microsoft’s share of total streaming video use is 85 percent, Mr. Graf said. “All of the other players have been relegated to a niche.”Some lawyers speculate that the appeals court may favor Microsoft on the bundling issue because the European Commission’s order in 2004 that forced Microsoft to sell a version of Windows without its own media player turned into a commercial flop.It sold a stripped-down version of the software for the same price as the version with a Windows Media Player. It has said that the stripped-down version sold just a few thousand copies in Europe.'"
"'07-09-17,'0','Some publishers are just dipping in a toe. Random House Audio, for example, will be selling about 500 titles, roughly 20 percent of its catalog, through eMusic. “We’re very interested in testing this, but we didn’t think it was appropriate to put all of our titles in a test program,” said Madeline McIntosh, the group’s publisher.Like her counterparts in the music business, Ms. McIntosh is concerned about piracy, but doubts it will be as big an issue for audiobooks, which draw an older audience and are unwieldy to circulate. Unabridged audiobooks sold in stores often comprise more than a dozen CDs, and, in digital format, the enormous files cannot be e-mailed as easily as single songs.“If we see that piracy of our products is increasing, we would stop,” Ms. McIntosh said, adding that her company monitors file-sharing networks and that there will be a “watermark” on eMusic files. “But I don’t expect that working with eMusic would lead to an increase.”“Our customers don’t steal music,” said David Pakman, chief of eMusic, of the company’s 300,000 subscribers, who pay from $9.99 (for 30 songs) to $19.99 (for 75 songs). “A lot of them are technically sophisticated, but they’re not prone to piracy.”Nevertheless, some publishers have no interest in signing on with eMusic.“I think it’s a mistake,” said Brian Downing, publisher of Recorded Books, which is more than 25 years old and whose authors include Philip Roth and Jodi Picoult. “I think our obligation to protect the files and protect the authors is a big one.”Hachette Audio will start by selling only about 15 titles on the site, but that includes bestsellers like “America (The Book): A Citizen’s Guide to Democracy Inaction” by Jon Stewart.At the other end of the spectrum is Penguin Audio, which will sell on eMusic all the audiobooks it currently makes available in a digital format on iTunes, about 150 titles. “Publishers have been waiting for other companies to play ball,” said Patti Pirooz, the executive producer.Most publishers have been playing ball with Audible Inc., which pioneered downloadable audiobooks 12 years ago and sells its wares through iTunes and its own Web site, audible.com. Audible sells about 15,000 audiobooks and another 20,000 recordings of public radio shows and periodicals like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.Audible has its own proprietary digital format, which plays on both iPods and non-Apple devices, but still cannot be duplicated except to copy onto CDs just once. Spokesmen from Audible and Apple declined to comment on eMusic.Since it was founded in 1995, Audible has grown steadily. It went public in 1999, and its 2006 revenues of $82.2 million were up 30 percent over the previous year. But this growth has not translated into profit: Audible has lost money in seven of the last eight years, including $8.4 million last year.In 2006, Audible earned 24 percent of its income selling content on iTunes, compared with 11 percent in 2004. While eMusic will offer fewer titles than Audible sells on its site or through iTunes, it will do better on price. A one-book-a-month subscription to eMusic is $9.99; the same on Audible is $14.94, while a two-books-a-month subscription is $22.95.As for the issue of intellectual property, Mr. Pakman of eMusic said that his company’s expansion into audiobooks signaled growing acceptance of the easy-to-copy MP3 format in general.“Here you have Random House, the largest publisher in the U.S., taking part in this,” Mr. Pakman said, noting that Random House’s parent company, Bertelsmann, also owns BMG Music. “What they’re doing is prioritizing the need for sales and growing the market share over copy protection. It speaks to the larger trend that media companies are now getting comfortable with something they probably should have done seven or eight years ago.”'"
"'07-09-17,'0','“People are eating better and looking for more balance,” Mr. Rosenstock said.Balance is the catchphrase at Westin hotels. Menus focus on “superfoods,” 14 functional foods outlined in the book “SuperFoods Rx,” which are supposed to be eaten in combinations with other foods for maximum benefits.The initiative, which is in 25 Westin hotels and will become chainwide next year, encourages travelers trying to beat insomnia to drink smoothies made from bananas and soy milk. Those trying to stay alert in a new time zone can order a high-protein breakfast.“The egg white omelet is popular, but it’s the egg white omelet with the spring green salad,” said Colleen Keating, a general manager at the Westin Waltham-Boston. “They don’t want to pair it with hash browns.”The program is part of an overall approach to renewal, which is intended, in part, to soothe road-weary business travelers, who toil in their rooms late into the evening.“The laptop has done this to us,” Ms. Keating said. As a result, travelers are looking for ways to take care of themselves. “We’ve moved from power to balance.”Hotels are equally obsessed with breakfast programs that are about speed. Several hotel managers call it the Starbucks effect — when business travelers are not sitting down to an egg-white, whole-grain sustainable breakfast, they want a good cup of coffee and something easy to eat as they head out the door.“The emphasis is on convenience,” said Vanessa Bortnick of Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants, which is based in San Francisco. People want food that is light but delicious, like a muffin and a latte, as long as the muffin is whole grain and the coffee is from a quality roaster, she said.“The power breakfast that takes an hour doesn’t seem to be an option anymore,” Ms. Bortnick said.Those power breakfasts of the 1990s, where executives lingered over a late breakfast of expensive egg dishes and even a Bloody Mary in elite hotel dining rooms, may be rare these days. But so is the idea of breakfast as a meeting Siberia, in which less important clients or last-minute meet-and-greets were relegated to a quick meal with an easy out: “Busy day ahead. Got to run.”For some businesspeople, breakfast is a prime slot.Sue Morgan, for example, can’t remember the last time she scheduled a lunch meeting, but she recently had three breakfast meetings in eight days.She is on top of breakfast trends more than most people because she must be. Ms. Morgan, a 25-year veteran of the restaurant business, is a vice president for food and beverage services at InterContinental Hotels Group. The company runs more than 3,700 hotels in nearly 100 countries and territories.“With this busy schedule, I am much more hesitant to schedule a lunch,” she said. “Breakfast is more flexible. I can schedule something at 7 instead of 7:30 if we need more time.”Breakfast is going through big changes at several of the company’s brands, which include Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza Hotels and Resorts and Candlewood Suites. All of Holiday Inn’s nearly 1,000 hotels, for example, serve only coffee that is certified by the Rainforest Alliance.Although 42 percent of guests want something quicker than a full breakfast, they prefer more than the cinnamon roll that was the star of the chain’s breakfast bar expansion in 2003. A recent makeover of the Express Start breakfast bars included scrambled eggs, cereal, skim milk and fresh fruit.Those changes are just what business travelers like Carlos Boughton want. He is on the road a lot as a brand manager for Tecate beer, and he is scheduling more business meetings than ever at breakfast, usually over oatmeal, fruit and yogurt.“It’s easy to say I need to pack this trip with meetings, so let’s have breakfast,” he said. “Even when you say 7 a.m., people say: ‘Sure I’ll have breakfast. Are you buying?’ ”Mr. Boughton says he still relishes taking a moment alone in the morning. Not only is it relaxing, but is also without stigma. Having a solo dinner feels “kind of lame,” he said. But going downstairs and having breakfast alone? “That’s O.K.”'"
"'07-09-17,'0','“Audit Cites Overpaid Medicare Insurers” (news article, Sept. 10) calls attention to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ virtually nonexistent oversight of private Medicare Advantage plans. As part of the Republican drive to privatize Medicare, President Bush’s agency conducts only 14 percent of the audits required by law.To add insult to injury, when C.M.S. finds that private plans have overcharged consumers, it does nothing to help beneficiaries get their money back. C.M.S. claims that it does not have the legal authority to force insurers to reimburse either consumers or the Medicare trust fund for overcharges even though the independent and nonpartisan Government Accountability Office says it does.The Children’s Health and Medicare Protection (Champ) bill, passed by the House last month, resolves this ambiguity, provides health care to 11 million children, and improves Medicare’s benefits for seniors. Section 423 of the act provides C.M.S. with the explicit legal authority to address deficiencies in Medicare Advantage plan audits.This provision and the Champ bill as a whole reflect House Democrats’ commitment to children, seniors and responsible government oversight. I hope the Senate will join the House in recognizing that these priorities must be a part of the health care bill we will send to the president.'"
"'07-09-17,'0','As most businesspeople know, it can be hard to keep the focus on winning new deals, meeting customers and expanding opportunities without quick and easy access to the right information — whether it concerns presentations, contracts or directions to an office. Here is the latest crop of travel-oriented business technology devices and Internet services that can help people do more with less, and kick back and even enjoy themselves after the deal is done.Anywhere With all the computers and other electronic devices that business travelers use, it is hard to leave your power cords and chargers behind. But what if there is no convenient outlet to plug them into?Now there is a solution. Solio offers universal “hybrid” chargers that power a wide range of electronic devices — from cellphones to iPods to G.P.S. units and digital cameras (solio.com, starting at $79). Solio’s new Hybrid1000 is a sleek but rugged charger with a built-in solar panel to recharge its internal battery (and your devices) from the sun. The Solio itself can hold a charge for up to a year, so before leaving on a trip, charge it and keep it handy for when your batteries run out.Reluctant to leave your laptop behind, even though there are Internet cafes, kiosks and business centers with computers at most business travel destinations? That’s understandable, given that what’s missing at all those cafes and kiosks is the personal and business “stuff” that users keep on their hard drives, from e-mail files to PowerPoint presentations. New ultraportable hard drives and software make it possible to leave your computer behind while taking all your programs and files with you. For example, the Seagate FreeAgent Go data mover (available in 80 gigabyte, 120 GB and 160 GB capacities; 120 GB drive is $99.99 at J&R (jr.com) and $119.99 at Best Buy, among others) is a small, lightweight hard drive that plugs into any PC via a U.S.B. cable. While it has plenty of storage space, what’s really new is the software; you can run everything from word processing to custom programs directly from the FreeAgent drive, even on a “foreign” computer, without installing any software or leaving traces behind when you unplug.For those who can’t live without a computer, but don’t want to lug it around, there is the OQO model 02 (oqo.com, starting at $1,299). A palm-size ultramobile computer, the model 02 is a one-pound marvel. Larger and more powerful than the iPhone, with a bigger screen and the option of installing standard Windows programs like PowerPoint or Word, the 02 gives travelers the power of a laptop with the portability of a small paperback book. Although the device is not a phone, it does include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies for local area connectivity, and optional mobile Internet connectivity using Sprint or Verizon wireless services.With rich restaurant meals and airport snacks, it’s hard not to put on weight when traveling. The Forerunner 305 by Garmin (at Amazon.com, $217.99, among others) is a watchlike G.P.S. device that can help travelers keep up with their exercise regimes in unfamiliar places. While its G.P.S. receiver helps runners (or walkers) track time, speed, distance and even heartbeat using a wireless heartbeat monitor, the device also tracks distance automatically so runners don’t need to plot out a course before they run. The unit includes a “go home” feature that leads wayward travelers back to a hotel or starting point.'"
"'07-09-17,'0','Brad Smith, the general counsel for Microsoft, who was present for the reading, said the company would follow the ruling but did not say specifically whether the company would appeal it.“It’s clearly very important to us as a company that we comply with our obligations under European law. We will study this decision carefully and if there are additional steps that we need to take, we will take them,” Mr. Smith said.Robert Kramer, a vice president of public policy for CompTIA, a Microsoft ally that represents 3,000 technology companies, predicted the court’s ruling would have a chilling effect on investment both within the European Union and beyond.“What this ruling will do is send a message to companies that if they establish a good market position with a successful product, they will be forced in Europe to essentially give up that product to their competitors,” Mr. Kramer said.But Carlo Piana, a lawyer representing the Free Software Foundation Europe, hailed the court’s decision as a victory for small software developers around the world who may have lived in fear of Microsoft or other large platform operators. “This is an incredibly huge victory. The doors are kept open now for competition,” Mr. Piana said.The decision followed a five-day hearing on the issues in April. Microsoft has indicated in the past that it would appeal any negative ruling to the European Court of Justice, the highest court in Europe, but Mr. Smith would not say today whether the company would take that step in the two months and 10 days it has to. An appeal by the company, a process likely to take at least two years, would focus only on whether the appellate court erred in procedure in reaching its decision, not on the facts in the case.Microsoft has already been forced to pay nearly €1 billion in fines in the nine-year-old legal case, which has pitted the software maker based in Redmond, Wash., against the commission and a host of competitors, including I.B.M., Sun Microsystems, RealNetworks and Novell.In its ruling, the 13-member panel of judges said Microsoft had violated European antitrust law by exploiting its near dominance in operating systems to shut out competitors like RealNetworks in digital media players and Sun Microsystems in workgroup exchange servers.The ruling validated the pursuit of Microsoft by Mario Monti, former competition commissioner for the European Union, and his successor, Ms. Kroes. The case began in 1998 when Sun Microsystems filed a complaint over Microsoft’s refusal to disclose its confidential server protocols — computer code that competitors need to make their servers or desktop computers work with Microsoft products.Microsoft has been repeatedly fined by the commission since the 2004 antitrust ruling for inadequately supplying the protocols. “I think this means it’s about time for Microsoft to comply,” Mr. Vinje said.The commission later expanded its inquiry to include Microsoft’s practice of bundling its Windows Media Player into its dominant Windows operating system. After Microsoft began bundling its media player into Windows, it overtook the market leader, RealNetworks, and as of January it had a 50 percent share of the global market, according to the researcher Nielsen/NetRatings.“There has obviously been a lot of work that has gone into our efforts to comply with the commission’s terms with respect to communications protocols,” Mr. Smith said in Luxembourg today. “We have made a lot of progress in that regard and yet we all have to acknowledge that there are some issues that do remain open.”'"

"'07-09-18,'1','Yes, argues Ivan Lansberg, a senior partner at Lansberg, Gersick & Associates, a research and consulting firm based in New Haven that specializes in family business.In this month’s issue of The Harvard Business Review, he writes about whether the new chief executive has taken account of the various constituencies — family members, directors, senior executives, investors, trade unions — who may not be convinced that the executive has earned the right to hold the top spot. In a sidebar to the main article, he offers a multipart self-diagnostic test the scions can take to determine if they are ready.These are the five questions potential successors should ask themselves, he says (with yes, being the best answer to each):¶Is there a good fit between what I studied and the leadership role?¶Have I worked outside the family business and shown that I can succeed?¶Have I taken on jobs and projects whose results can be objectively measured?¶Am I aware of the deficiencies in my training and what I should do about them?¶Do my behavior and demeanor serve to defuse concerns about nepotism?PARTNERING Finding good people, especially good senior people, is difficult. And wherever there is a problem, someone is bound to start a business to try to solve it. That’s where a company called PartnerUp.com comes in.Steve Nielsen said he began the company after he realized that he could have used its services in a previous venture, in 2003. “I just couldn’t find the right engineer to partner with” for the company, he says. Months later, at a University of Minnesota event, he says he ran into an engineer who would have been perfect, if only he had had a way to meet him.So, he created a business that allows people to post opportunities and network and allow companies to search for the people they need. Most of the opportunities advertised are companies looking for a “co-founder, executive, board member, or positions where people will get involved in the company as more than just an employee.”OVER THERE If you are thinking of starting a company in a developing country, the Web site www.smetoolkit.org can prove helpful.The site is a part of the small and medium enterprise department of the World Bank and is aimed at combining “the market perspective of the International Finance Corporation with the policy expertise of the World Bank to promote local small business growth in developing nations.”The articles on accounting and finance, human resources and marketing are equally applicable for firms in the United States.LAST CALL If you find it hard to get started at the beginning of the workweek, Cristina Tudino, writing in Self magazine, has three suggestions:¶Alter your routine. Going through the motions makes you sluggish, so try something new. “Listen to classical music instead of jazz on your commute. You may think faster on your feet.”¶Work hard first. Instead of easing into the day, “pick a project that requires analytical thinking but that will take no more than an hour.” It will set a productive tone for the day.¶Have fun — later. By definition, Mondays can be difficult. “Lower your stress level by treating yourself to one small luxury — such as meeting a friend at a favorite lunch spot. It should help you relax, focus and get down to business afterwards.”'"
"'07-09-18,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 — American technical experts spent today inspecting a Russian radar in Azerbaijan, but the director of the Pentagon’s missile defense program emphatically stated that the Soviet-era early warning system is incapable of replacing an antimissile tracking radar proposed for the Czech Republic.Even so, the Missile Defense Agency director, Lt. Gen. Henry A. Obering III, pressed the Kremlin to drop its objections to American proposals for 10 antimissile interceptors in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic. In a speech here, the general urged Moscow to link its radar in Azerbaijan into the American system in Central Europe, running them in tandem.The visit to Azerbaijan by a high-level delegation of missile experts was in response to a proposal from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to drop American plans for new construction of an antimissile system in Central Europe and to instead use the Russian radar in a system to defend against a future Iranian threat.“We are taking the Russian proposal seriously with respect to cooperation,” General Obering said to the European Institute here. “So we are going to learn as much as we can about this.”But he also said that “we do not anticipate, and cannot see, that what they are proposing can take the place for what we are proposing for Poland and the Czech Republic.”'"
"'07-09-18,'1','For consumers, the Fed’s move could mean lower borrowing costs on for mortgages and automobile loans. But the impact may be muted, because investors remain deeply anxious about the credit quality of mortgages and other long-term loans. The main problem in the past month has not been high rates so much as the availability of capital to complete deals.In a separate move to bolster the banking system, the Fed also said today that it had cut its discount lending rate, which applies to short-term emergency loans to banks, to 5.25 percent — also a half-point cut.This was the Federal Reserve’s most abrupt reversal of course since January 2001, when it suddenly slashed rates at an unscheduled emergency meeting because of signs that the economy was slipping into a recession. The last half-point cut in the federal funds rate came in November 2002.Economists said that the Fed’s move today was similarly pre-emptive. “Monetary policy makers are worried about growth being seriously compromised and are prepared to take whatever prudent steps they can to avoid a deep slump,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR.Some aspects of today’s Fed’s move could fuel inflation fears. Gold, a traditional investment safe haven in times of inflation, soared immediately after the Fed’s decision was announced. As United States interest rates became less attractive for investment, the value of the dollar against the euro touched a new low before recovering slightly, and oil prices continued to climb even further above $80 a barrel.In the stock market, financial stocks posted the biggest gains, reflecting the fact that banks now will face lower borrowing costs, which should help drive profits higher.“Shock therapy,” was the assessment of Ethan Harris, chief economist at Lehman Brothers.But Mr. Harris cautioned that the Fed stopped short of signaling a firm commitment to more rate reductions. While it dropped its previous statement that inflation was still the “predominant concern,” which would argue against using lower rates to stimulate the economy, the Fed said that “inflation risks remain” and that it would “monitor inflation developments carefully.”David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said the Fed appeared deliberately ambiguous about its readiness to cut rates even further at its policy meetings in October and December.“The Fed kept its cards much closer to its vest than anyone would have guessed,” Mr. Rosenberg said. “It’s not at all clear they think they have more to do.”As recently as six weeks ago, the central bank was still predicting “modest” growth for the economy and warning that inflation remained its “predominant concern.” As in 2001, the Fed’s move today came after a panic in financial markets and the collapse of a speculative bubble. This time, the panic is in credit markets spooked by dubious mortgages on inflated housing prices. Back then, it was the stock market that crashed, initially because the air went out of inflated dot-com stocks.In the jargon of economists, the turmoil in both cases represented a sudden “repricing” of risk. Other signs have surfaced recently that the financial market upheaval may not be isolated. Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported the first monthly loss of jobs in four years. Employers eliminated 4,000 positions in August, a factor that may have played a role in the Fed’s decision today.By today, it seemed clear that Fed policy makers were no longer debating whether to reduce rates but how much to lower them. Despite the seemingly narrow debate — whether to lower the overnight federal funds rate by one-quarter of a percent or by one-half of a percent — the uncertainty about this policy meeting was higher than any other in the past four years.The debate within the Fed was all about risk probabilities: what were the odds the twin meltdowns in housing and mortgage markets would tip the overall economy into a recession later this year? If policy makers cut rates too cautiously, they risked a recession; if they cut them too much or too early, they risked stoking inflation.Economists said what appeared to push the Fed to cut rates by a half point were the dismal job market numbers from August.“I think that was a real eye-opener for them,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for Maria Fiorini Ramirez, an economic consulting firm in New York. “The only ammunition the consumer has left is from the labor market. If income growth is compromised here because the labor market is weakening, then you’ve got a serious problem.”Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist for Bank of America, said that by cutting rates a half point, Fed policy makers may have been hoping to draw the investors’ attention away from the central bank.“I think they kind of cleared the decks,” he said. “They said we’re going to be a little bold and remove at least one source of uncertainty. And that is the source that says ‘What is the Fed thinking, and when are they move again?’ Maybe they can take the market’s mind off the Fed for a little while.”Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had made it clear over the past month that the Fed did not simply want to rescue Wall Street investors who made bad bets or real estate speculators who bought properties on the assumption that prices would keep skyrocketing.But Mr. Bernanke also pledged that the Fed would act if the dislocation in financial markets or the downturn in housing threatened to derail overall growth.Just a few hours before the central bank announced its decision, new statistics indicated that the pace of home foreclosures is accelerating. RealtyTrac of Irvine, Calif., reported that foreclosure filings — from default notices and auction sales to bank repossessions — were 36 percent higher in August than in July and 115 percent higher than one year ago.The Labor Department also reported today that producer prices fell by 1.4 percent in August — much more than expected — because of slumping energy prices. That was positive news on inflation, but analysts said it was unlikely to have much influence on the Fed because the ""core” measure excluding energy and food prices increased 0.2 percent, slightly more than expected.Except for the housing downturn, which Fed officials admit is much more severe than they had expected, the evidence of a recession in the real economy is ambiguous. Global economic growth is much stronger than in 2001, and American exports have climbed about 14 percent over the last year.Instead of the United States’ being the world’s engine of growth, the global economy could now become the engine of American growth.For the last four years, the Federal Reserve has telegraphed its intentions months in advance as it pursued a gradualist approach of slow but steady adjustments in monetary policy. It advertised its intention to raise rates gradually many months before it actually did so in June 2004, and then raised rates in well-signaled increments at each policy meeting over the next two years.By contrast, Wall Street analysts were sharply divided as of early today about how much the Fed would cut rates and what it would say in its statement about the economic outlook.A smaller rate reduction posed a risk of moving too slowly if the economy was indeed in danger of stalling. But a bigger rate reduction could have been taken as a sign of Fed panic, and it added to the risk of stoking inflationary pressures that the central bank had just begun to tamp down.But the evidence so far is inconclusive. In August, for the first time in four years, the Labor Department estimated that the number of jobs declined slightly. It also reduced its estimates of job growth in June and July, suggesting that the labor market weakened even before credit markets froze up in early August.But other indicators — on consumer spending, consumer confidence and export growth — point to a continuation of modest growth.Right or wrong, today’s decision will be a defining moment for Mr. Bernanke, the former economics scholar at Princeton who became Fed chairman in February 2006.Many Wall Street economists place the odds of a recession at about one in three or somewhat higher. Alan Greenspan, who preceded Mr. Bernanke as Fed chairman, puts the odds at somewhat more than the one-in-three that he estimated earlier this year.The Fed’s course change has been under way since early August, when fears about huge losses on subprime mortgage loans and continued downturn in housing caused a much broader panic in credit markets.The resulting credit crunch has now affected all but the safest home mortgages, and also greatly reduced the ability of private equity funds and hedge funds to borrow money at low rates. Many banks, which had been planning to resell their loans into the giant market for tradable commercial debt securities, are now being forced to absorb loans that the securities markets will no longer take.On Aug. 17, the Federal Reserve moved to ease the liquidity crisis by encouraging banks to borrow money through its “discount window,” a program originally created as an emergency source of overnight funds for banks in a cash squeeze.But by most accounts, the turmoil in credit markets has abated very little. The market for subprime mortgages has all but disappeared, and demand for all forms of “asset-backed commercial paper,” which are securities backed by mortgages, credit card debt, company receivables, remains very weak.'"
"'07-09-18,'1','As part of its corporate revamping, Intel executives last year outlined a “tick-tock” strategy, referring to the development of a new chip architecture every other year and the introduction of a new manufacturing technology in alternating years.“Our tick-tock strategy of alternating next generation silicon technology and a new microprocessor architecture — year after year — is accelerating the pace of innovation in the industry,” Mr. Otellini said.The new silicon technology component — representing the other part of the equation — is almost ready. When Intel introduces its Penryn family of processors on Nov. 12, it will be the industry’s first high-volume 45-nanometer processor.Mr. Otellini said the company plans to introduce 15 new 45-nanometer processors by the end of this year and an additional 20 in the first quarter of 2008. The current standard is 65 nanometers, and A.M.D. has said it will move to 45-nanometer technology in mid 2008.“We expect our Penryn processors to provide up to a 20 percent performance increase while improving energy efficiency,” Mr. Otellini said. The new chips, he said, will be used for small yet technologically advanced devices.Mr. Otellini also demonstrated to developers the industry’s first working chips built using 32-nanometer technology, on track to begin production in 2009. The 32-nanometer chips use transistors so small that more than 4 million of them could fit on the head of a pin.“Smaller is better; smaller is cheaper,” Mr. Otellini said.Mr. Otellini also said Intel has decided to be halogen-free by the end of 2008; Intel processors are already lead-free, he said.Just a day before the start of Intel’s developer conference, A.M.D. unveiled a new twist in its own product road map: a desktop chip with three cores — unusual in an industry that tends to grow in even numbers, routinely doubling performance. The announcement came as a surprise to analysts, as the company had touted the advantages of four processors only last week.A.M.D. executives said, however, that its quad-core desktop chip had been slower to catch on than the company expected when it released it last November, and today A.M.D.’s quad core processors account for only 2 percent of all desktop computer systems.A.M.D. is hoping that its new three-core chip, called Phenom, will appeal to midrange customers looking for more performance than dual core systems, but who don’t see the need for quad-core systems.But the addition of the triple-core chip, part of A.M.D.’s Phenom family of processors, could prove confusing to customers, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst with Insight 64, a consultancy in Saratoga, Calif. The new triple-core chip is due in the first quarter of 2008, a quarter after the company is scheduled to release the quad-core product.'"
"'07-09-18,'1','Prices at the producer level declined in August, the government reported today, signaling a slackening of inflation pressures in months to come just before an expected rate cut by the Federal Reserve.Rapidly falling energy costs, including a 13.8 percent plunge in gasoline prices, caused a 1.4 percent dip in the Producer Price Index in August after a 0.6 percent rise a month earlier. Increased vehicle and prescription drug prices pushed the rate of core producer inflation, which excludes food and energy, up 0.2 percent, a slight acceleration from July.Analysts pointed to a half-point dip in the cost of intermediate goods as a sign that price increases were slowing further up the production chain. That could signal fewer price pressures on consumers as these goods are processed and enter the retail market over the next few months.""The intermediate materials pattern offers a hint of evidence that inflation pressures at the consumer price level will be weakening,"" said Kenneth Beauchemin, United States economist for Global Insight, an economic research firm in Lexington, Mass.The new inflation figures were released ahead of today’s much-anticipated Fed meeting, where the central bank’s policy makers are expected to cut interest rates by a least a quarter-point. The slowdown in producer prices — what businesses charge one another for materials — suggested some leeway for the Fed to go ahead with its expected cut, though at least one economist said the report would have little effect on today’s meeting.'"

New Democracy and the main opposition socialist party, Pasok, lost support to the left and extreme right in the vote on Sunday, after public anger over the handling of deadly forest fires last month. “We are fully aware of our responsibility, and we must go forward quickly and with determination to make the country progress,” Mr. Karamanlis said after meeting with Mr. Papoulias.'"
"'07-09-18,'1','The administrator of the Camp Meeting Association, Scott Hoffman, said in a written statement that “the Camp Meeting is reviewing the letter. However, it is worth noting that over 99 percent of the Camp Meeting’s land was recertified as tax-exempt.”Every three years since 1989, the association has applied for, and received, tax exemptions for its boardwalk, beach and the pavilion under the Green Acres Program, designed to encourage the use of privately owned lands for public recreation and conservation. This is the first time any part of its application has been turned down.Facing a deadline of last Saturday mandated by the Green Acres rules, Ms. Jackson said it was important to make clear where her department stood on the definition of open property.“When people hear the words ‘open space,’ we want them to think not just of open air and land, but that it is open to all people,” said Ms. Jackson. “And when the public subsidizes it with tax breaks, it goes with the expectation that it is not going to be parsed out, whether it be by activity or any particular beliefs.”The tax assessor in Neptune Township, where Ocean Grove is located, said he could not estimate how much more tax the association might have to pay because of the changed status of the pavilion. When the lawsuit was filed against the state last month, the assessor, Bernard Haney, estimated that the association was saving about $500,000 a year because of all of its Green Acres exemptions.In a letter sent to the state last week arguing that the tax-exempt status of the Pavilion, should be retained, Michael Behrens, the association’s lawyer, said that the use of the open-air pavilion had not changed since it was first included in the Green Acres Program 18 years ago.The pavilion, which is used largely for Sunday church services and youth ministry programs, has also been a place where boardwalk strollers are welcome to sit and relax. “But never was the general public granted unfettered right to use the pavilion in any way it chooses (e.g., to reserve it for an exclusive use such as a civil union ceremony),” Mr. Behrens wrote.The case has drawn national attention, in part because Ocean Grove has long been considered a community that embraced gay residents. Steven Goldstein, executive director of Garden State Equality, a New Jersey gay rights organization, said he has gotten more e-mail messages on this issue than on any other cause his group has taken up.“I’m hearing from gay people all over the country who thought Ocean Grove was the leading light for gay tolerance and that’s not the case anymore,” Mr. Goldstein said.'"
"'07-09-18,'1','This year Massachusetts announced a greenhouse gas emissions policy that covers major real-estate projects. All qualify for regulation under the state’s environmental protection laws, and their developers must quantify the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with the projects and detail what they are doing to reduce those emissions, a news release from Mr. Bowles’s office said.In an interview, Chris Gordon, the chief operating officer of the Allston Development group at Harvard, said he welcomed the opportunity to commit the university to the new standards. And, while he declined to estimate publicly how much the science complex would cost, he said he did not expect the new design measures to add significantly to the overall bill.“First of all, the technology associated with green construction has dropped dramatically in the last decade,” Mr. Gordon said. “Geothermal wells, natural ventilation, natural lighting — most of it doesn’t cost a premium anymore. Also, we think the operating costs will go down. When you save 50 percent on greenhouse gases, you’re burning less fuel and buying less fuel.”Mr. Gordon said it was not possible, in a short span of time, to quantify the exact tonnage of the greenhouse gas reductions to which the university had committed.Harvard’s commitment to reductions mirrors what colleges and universities across the country are doing, including Carnegie Mellon and Arizona State.To date, 399 college presidents have signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, pledging to assess their greenhouse gas emissions and develop a strategy for reducing them, or buying offsets, with the goal of becoming carbon neutral, or adding no carbon-dioxide emissions to the atmosphere.“We are acting as a model for the rest of society saying we are going to do everything we can to reduce our emissions,” said an organizer of the initiative, Anthony Cortese. “The bigger commitment we are making is that we are going to create the knowledge and the graduates that will help society” achieve the same goals.Harvard is not a signatory to the climate initiative, but Mr. Gordon said in a statement: “Harvard’s Allston campus ultimately will be the university’s greatest expression of environmental sustainability. Today’s decision continues progress towards an environmental strategy that benefits both the university and the community.”Residents of the Allston neighborhood have been skeptical, if not prickly, about the university’s expansion from Cambridge. The move is part of a 50-year plan that would increase the campus footprint by about 50 percent. Construction on the science complex, the first part of the expansion, is set to begin this fall and end in 2011.This year, two members of a task force formed by Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston criticized the development plans in an article in The Boston Globe. They singled out the science complex for its 125-foot height, which they said was incompatible with the smaller neighborhood homes.But, when contacted yesterday about Harvard’s agreement with the state, Brent Whelan, one of the critics, said the green component of the construction was one good aspect of a project that had raised concerns about the future of the neighborhood, and about communications between the university and Allston residents.Although some of the new design elements will add to the height of the complex, Mr. Whelan said that was an acceptable trade-off. “There are some consequences for the green construction,” he said, “but I think most people agree that it’s a really, really good thing they’re doing.”After approving the plans for the science complex, with the commitment to keep greenhouse gases from energy use 50 percent below the national standard of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Mr. Bowles signed documents setting the terms for the coming environmental reviews of the rest of the Allston project, as it develops.These establish greenhouse gas limits about 30 percent below those in the national standard.'"
"'07-09-18,'1','I.B.M.’s engineers have been working with OpenOffice technology for some time. But last week, I.B.M. declared that it was formally joining the open-source group, had dedicated 35 full-time programmers to the project and would contribute code to the initiative.Free office productivity software has long been available from OpenOffice.org, and the open-source alternative has not yet made much progress against Microsoft’s Office.But I.B.M., analysts note, has such reach and stature with corporate customers that its endorsement could be significant.“I.B.M. is jumping in with products that are backed by I.B.M., with the I.B.M. brand and I.B.M. service,” said Melissa Webster, an analyst for IDC, a research firm. “This is a major boost for open source on the desktop.”I.B.M. executives compare this move with the push it gave Linux, the open-source operating system, into corporate data centers. In 2000, I.B.M. declared that it would forcefully back Linux with its engineers, its marketing and its dollars. The support from I.B.M. helped make Linux a mainstream technology in corporations, where it competes with Microsoft’s Windows server software.I.B.M. is also joining forces with Google, which offers the open-source desktop productivity programs as part of its Google Pack of software. Google supports the same document formats in its online word processor and spreadsheet service.I.B.M. views its Symphony desktop offerings as part of a broader technology trend that will open the door to faster, more automated movement of information within and between organizations.A crucial technical ingredient, they say, is the document format used in the open-source desktop software, called the OpenDocument Format. It makes digital information independent of the program, like a word processor or spreadsheet, that is used to create and edit a document. OpenDocument Format is based on an Internet-era protocol called XML, short for Extensible Markup Language, which enables automated machine-to-machine communication.For example, an individual investor might create a spreadsheet with automated links to market information, and prices at which he or she wants to buy or sell shares in particular stocks. The person would get an alert by e-mail or cellphone message of price swings, and could create the document for a buy or sell order with a keystroke.Or, in a doctor’s office, patient records could be linked to hospital, clinic and other databases and updated automatically.Microsoft has the same vision of software automation, but it champions its own document format, called Office Open XML. Earlier this month, Microsoft failed in its initial effort to have Office Open XML ratified as a global technical standard by the International Organization for Standardization in Geneva. The OpenDocument Format, backed by I.B.M., Google, Sun and others, was approved by the standards organization last year.I.B.M. clearly regards its open-source desktop offerings as a strategic move in the document format battle. “There is nothing that advances a standard like a product that uses it,” said Steven A. Mills, senior vice president of I.B.M.’s software group.The Lotus Symphony products will support the Microsoft Office formats as well as the OpenDocument Format. But analysts note that technical translators are not entirely foolproof; Symphony software may easily translate the words from a Microsoft Word document, but some of the fonts and formatting may be lost. For many users, that may not matter, they say, but for others it might.Betsy Frost, a general manager in Microsoft’s Office business, said users valued “full compatibility” with previous versions of their Office documents as well as the ease of use and familiarity of Microsoft products. And she noted that there are 500 million Office users worldwide.Any inroads I.B.M. and its allies make against Microsoft, analysts say, will not come easily. “Three major players — I.B.M., Google and Sun — are now solidly behind a potential competing standard to Office,” said Rob Koplowitz, an analyst at Forrester Research. “But it’s a tough road. Office is very entrenched.”'"
"'07-09-18,'1','“There’s no right way to do it,” Coles said with a sigh.McCareins, speaking in a voice barely above a whisper and staring at a fixed spot on the floor, was left all alone to explain how he managed to get open inside the 5-yard line on the final possession and could not hold on to a well-thrown deep ball by Kellen Clemens.Had McCareins, a seventh-year veteran, been able to make the grab, he had a clear path to the end zone.“I let the guys down,” McCareins said. “I’ve got to make that play. I made an adjustment on that route and I got open and I just couldn’t get both my hands on it.”Six plays later, McCareins, who was Clemens’s favorite target in the preseason, leapt for a ball in the end zone. It glanced off his fingers and into the hands of Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis to seal the defeat.On the way off the field, McCareins was approached by Ravens receiver Derrick Mason, a former teammate with the Tennessee Titans, who said he patted McCareins on the back and said, ‘Oh, man, you should have had it.’ ”McCareins did not disagree. “Those are plays I know I can make and I have made,” he said after the game. “I just didn’t get it done when it counted.”McCareins, 28, did not appear in the locker room Monday, so it was impossible to take his emotional temperature. Knowing McCareins as they do, his teammates would not be surprised if he replayed those two throws in his mind all night Sunday before reporting to work Monday morning to review the tape.“He’s one of those guys who does everything right,” Coles said. “He wants to be perfect, but none of us are that.”McCareins, who struggled last year to adjust to a new coaching staff and offensive system, concentrated on improving his weaknesses during the off-season.“I tried to make them into my strengths,” he said during training camp, reciting a few examples: “Improving my route running, improving my speed and my explosiveness in and out of breaks. Little things like that.”All the little things McCareins worked on added up to big gains in the preseason, when he caught passes of 42, 35 and 45 yards from Clemens.“He’s a great athlete, especially in the vertical passing game,” Clemens said last week. “He’s really pretty easy to throw to. You just drop back and throw it about as far as you can. With his speed, he goes and gets it.”With the game on the line Sunday, McCareins put himself in the perfect position to succeed. Why was he unable to?Maybe it was because of a lapse in concentration, as Mason suggested. It also might have had something to do with his relative unfamiliarity with the rotation of Clemens’s throws.Clemens throws a harder, tighter spiral than Chad Pennington. During practices last week, Jets receivers mishandled a lot of his throws. In the fourth quarter Sunday, with adrenaline coursing through his throwing arm, Clemens’s passes had even more zip on them than usual. All the receivers seemed thrown off, but in the end, McCareins was the one whose drops drew all the attention.“I know the person that I’m striving to be on and off the field,” McCareins said during training camp. “I may not reach the goals I have, but I’m sure going to try.”RAVENS ACCUSE JETS Ravens Coach Brian Billick accused the Jets’ defense of shouting out signals to intentionally throw off the Baltimore offense. Billick claimed the tactic led to three illegal-procedure penalties against the Ravens.“I credit the New York Jets,” Billick said Monday. “Their defensive line and linebackers did a very, very effective job of illegally simulating the snap count. They did it the whole game long. It needs to be caught.”Ravens tackle Adam Terry moved early in the first and third quarters. Tight end Quinn Sypniewski jumped in the first quarter.“That’s not an excuse by any stretch of the imagination,” Billick said. “But it is illegal. Our guys have to deal with it. I don’t know how to help my linemen with that because you’re in the heat of battle and you’re calling the snap count, and the guy across from you is also calling a snap count — which is illegal.” (AP)'"
"'07-09-18,'1','Judge Jenkins wrote that a resolving of the questions presented in the suit was not a proper task for the courts.“The adjudication of plaintiff’s claim would require the court to balance the competing interests of reducing global warming emissions and the interests of advancing and preserving economic and industrial development,” Judge Jenkins wrote.The two decisions are not necessarily at odds. They collectively suggest that states may address climate change through their legislatures and executive branches but not through the courts.Given national and international debate on the issues, Judge Jenkins wrote, “the court finds that injecting itself into the global warming thicket at this juncture would require an initial policy determination of the type reserved for the political branches of government.”Indeed, he continued, a decision from the court on awarding damages for increasing global warming could potentially undermine the choices of the political branches.Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for the car companies, said Judge Jenkins had shown appropriate deference to the other branches of government.“Our bottom-line point is that global warming presents exceedingly complex policy issues that must be addressed at the national and international levels by Congress and the president, not through lawsuits seeking damages in the federal courts,” Mr. Boutrous said. “We are pleased that Judge Jenkins agreed and dismissed this lawsuit.”Kenneth P. Alex, a lawyer in the California attorney general’s office, said, “We’re disappointed with the ruling and are studying it closely.” He said no decision had been made about an appeal.“We do understand,” Mr. Alex said, “that it is difficult for a district court judge to jump into a global warming dispute.”Judge Jenkins wrote that the Constitution’s assignment of interstate commerce and foreign policy powers to Congress and the president rather than to the courts supported his decision.He said he was reluctant in any event to expose automakers, utility companies and other industries to damages “for doing nothing more than lawfully engaging in their respective spheres of commerce within those states.”He added that he would not know how to calculate the harms caused by the emissions even if he were to entertain the suit.“The court is left without guidance in determining what is an unreasonable contribution to the sum of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere,” Judge Jenkins wrote, “or in determining who should bear the costs associated with global climate change that admittedly result from multiple sources around the globe.”'"

The petition is expected to reach the S.E.C. today, representatives of the groups said.The action by Ceres, a coalition of environmental activists and investors, along with Environmental Defense and investors managing $1.5 trillion in assets is the second in recent days to focus attention on the potential impact on Wall Street of climate change.On Friday, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York started an investigation of five energy companies to determine if they had adequately disclosed any financial risk they might face from their ownership stake or operations of coal-fired power plants. Scientists believe that carbon dioxide, the main emission from these plants, is a leading cause of recent global warming.Mindy S.

"'07-09-18,'1','“The reaction of Mattel and Disney really is exposing the deep flaws that exist in the system of testing, monitoring and quality assurance,” said Richard Howitt, a British member of the European Parliament who is the body’s spokesman on corporate social responsibility.“These companies claim to have codes of conduct covering environmental standards, health and safety,” he added. “The fact that they are now being forced to send monitors into shops shows how redundant all these promises were.”Beyond improving the system of regulation in Europe, some European officials and analysts say the union must focus more energy on monitoring practices on the factory floors of China itself. “Companies are not afraid of being punished if they don’t apply standards in factories in China,” said Dwight Justice of the International Trade Union Confederation, who has studied labor practices among toy producers in China.Like the United States, the European Union is considering requiring toy manufacturers to have all their new products tested in independent laboratories — a move that would add to costs. And while some European manufacturers have resisted the temptation to shift nearly all their production to Asia, Europe is like the United States in that it imports about 70 percent of its toys from abroad, mostly from China.Toy Industries of Europe, the association that represents large manufacturers, including Mattel Europe, Hasbro Europe and Hornby, argues that self-regulation is the only option when the volume of goods is so large. “I think there are very good systems in place,” said Anne Starkie-Alves, secretary general of the European toy association.Beyond introducing tougher measures for toy manufacturers, the European Union is also considering broader inspections and monitoring by government officials before goods ranging from DVD players to washing machines are given the “CE label,” which confirms that a product is up to European standards.Peter Mandelson, Europe’s top trade official, warned in an interview that any more high-profile safety problems would “prompt growing calls for intervention from the European Commission.”“If the E.U. doesn’t take defensive measures when they are justified,” he added, “we will risk encouraging a backlash against China’s trade growth. Given the mood in Europe, the burden of proof is shifting to China to demonstrate that it is trading fairly and that its goods are safe.”Last year there were 924 notifications of dangerous products in the European Union, 57 percent of them prompted by government action, 41 percent by the companies themselves and 2 percent by a mixture of both. Of all the imported products deemed unsafe in Europe, 48 percent were made in China.European consumer safety officials said that they were pushing the Chinese to improve safety standards and that the union’s legislation on product safety was robust and effective. But they acknowledge that enforcement and oversight by regulators and companies is difficult to achieve, because toy factories are in China and because of the enormous scale of China’s manufacturing.Beyond depending on manufacturers, the European Union relies on a monitoring system called Rapex, under which national authorities circulate alerts to officials in other countries if a manufacturer recalls a product or officials discover unsafe toys.If a breach of regulations is serious enough, officials in each country will contact suppliers of defective goods or intervene to take the goods off store shelves. In extreme cases, the European Commission itself can force products from the market, but it has done so only twice.One case involved toys containing phthalates, chemicals that may adversely affect human reproduction or development; the other concerned novelty cigarette lighters that often look like toys and are potentially dangerous to small children.'"

The leak was traced to the right main landing gear strut, which cushions the impact when the shuttle lands. Early efforts to correct the problem by cycling the hydraulic system did not work as well as officials had hoped, and so “the decision was, ‘Let’s just go ahead and bite the bullet and change the seals,’ ” said Kyle Herring, a NASA spokesman. NASA has five extra days built into the launching schedule, and officials said the work, which requires removing the wheels and brakes, might be completed without causing a slip of the launching date.'"
"'07-09-18,'1','Oil soared to another record yesterday on worries that global energy supplies could shrink to critical levels during this winter heating season because of strong growth in demand.Crude oil settled at $80.57 a barrel for October delivery in regular trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and was continuing to rise after hours.Expectations that the Federal Reserve will agree to cut interest rates when it meets today also supported oil and other commodities markets, raising the likelihood that the economy will weather a credit crisis.Though oil prices have quadrupled since 2002, when adjusted for inflation the price is still below the $90-a-barrel peaks at the time of the Iranian revolution in 1979.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on a small supply increase last week, but analysts said the decision to raise output by 500,000 barrels a day starting Nov. 1 was not enough to reverse a rally that has lifted prices around 30 percent this year.“We believe that this will be too little, too late, barring an outright collapse in demand, and now expect inventories to draw to critical levels this winter,” the investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a research note.'"
"'07-09-18,'1','Seeking to recoup tens of millions spent by government-financed health programs on prescriptions for Vioxx, New York State and New York City joined yesterday in filing a lawsuit against Merck, the drug’s maker, which withdrew the painkiller from the market in 2004 because of dangerous side effects.The lawsuit, filed yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, accuses Merck & Company of intentionally concealing the dangers of Vioxx, and therefore defrauding the state Medicaid program, which paid for the prescriptions. The drug was used to treat arthritis and migraines but led to a high risk of heart attacks and strokes.Several other states have filed similar lawsuits against Merck — more than 25,000 suits have been brought so far — seeking reimbursement for taxpayer dollars spent on purchasing Vioxx and on treating patients for its side effects. The suits have focused on drug pricing and safety, involving both consumer and Medicaid fraud.“Merck’s irresponsible and duplicitous conduct endangered the health of New Yorkers and wasted our tax dollars,” Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement. “Even as evidence was piling up showing just how dangerous this drug was, Merck put profits above all else.”New York was the seventh state — after Alaska, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Utah and Texas — to file suits seeking, essentially, a refund from Merck for Medicaid expenditures.'"
"'07-09-18,'1','But the court decision comes as the center of gravity in computing is shifting away from the software for personal computers, Microsoft’s stronghold. Increasingly, the e-mailing or word-processing functions of a computer can be performed with software delivered on a Web browser. Other devices like cellphones are now used as alternates to personal computers.The real challenge to Microsoft, after more than a decade of dominating the technology industry, is coming not from the government, but from the marketplace.The direct impact on Microsoft is small, said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. But there may be a longer-range consequence of having Microsoft under constant, open-ended scrutiny from Europe.“If you end up handicapping a major player in new markets, you may actually not enhance competition but hinder it, and help create new monopolies,” Mr. Yoffie said. “The obvious example is Google in Internet search and Apple in digital music.”Indeed, the Justice Department issued a statement expressing its concerns with the European decision, saying that tough restraints on powerful companies can be harmful.

Barnett, assistant attorney general for the department’s antitrust division, said that the effect “rather than helping consumers, may have the unfortunate consequence of harming consumers by chilling innovation and discouraging competition.”Consumer welfare, not protecting competitors, should be the guiding standard in antitrust, Mr. Barnett said.Antitrust enforcement has often been criticized as too slow to grapple with fast-moving high-technology markets. Indeed, the media player market changed drastically during the years-long investigation in Europe. When the European Commission ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows in Europe without its media player, but at no difference in price, few people wanted the stripped-down version of Windows.Still, the Luxembourg court’s ruling poses a threat to Microsoft’s traditional way of doing business by bundling new features and products into its Windows operating system. The court decision sets a precedent, at least from Europe. For example, if Microsoft wants to put handwriting- and speech-recognition features or stronger security software into Windows, European authorities might listen to competitors’ complaints.In the United States, the Justice Department chose to settle the Microsoft antitrust case in 2001 without challenging the company’s freedom to put whatever it wants in its operating system.Microsoft’s allies said the court’s decision would have a chilling effect on the business strategies of many global technology companies.“This ruling is certainly going to introduce a lot of uncertainty,” said Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a Washington-based group that supported Microsoft in its legal case in Europe. “What the court is basically saying is that if you develop a successful product and get too big, the European Commission is going to force you to give away your intellectual property.”The European ruling’s widest impact on technology companies, legal and industry experts say, will probably be on Microsoft’s ability to guard some of its intellectual property in software for servers. Server software, running on data center computers, powers corporate networks and the Web.The court upheld the commission’s order that Microsoft must share technical information with competitors so their server software works smoothly with Microsoft’s Windows desktop.The order applies only to Europe, but Microsoft may have a difficult time containing the impact to the European market only.Because the Internet runs on server software, industry analysts say the court’s ruling could have a lasting impact.“The Internet has opened a really good door for the industry and society to walk through to enjoy a far more rapid pace of innovation and growth than in personal computing, where Microsoft controls things,” said Timothy F. Bresnahan, an economist at Stanford University and a senior official in the Justice Department’s antitrust division during the Clinton administration. “Europe is pushing to ensure that the higher pace of innovation on the server is allowed to continue.”Bradford L. Smith, the general counsel for Microsoft, who was present for the reading, said the company would follow the ruling but did not say specifically whether the company would appeal it. In a statement issued by the company, Mr. Smith said: “I would note that a lot has changed since this case started in 1998. The world has changed, the industry has changed, and our company has changed.”The decision followed a five-day hearing on the issues under appeal in April 2006. Microsoft had indicated in the past that it would appeal any negative ruling to the European Court of Justice, the highest court in Europe. But an appeal by the company, a process likely to take at least two years, would focus only on whether the appellate court erred in procedure and points of law in reaching its decision, not on the facts in the case.Neelie Kroes, the European Union competition commissioner, said at a news conference in Brussels that while the decision set an “important precedent,” the judgment “is bittersweet because the court has confirmed the commission’s view that consumers are suffering at the hands of Microsoft.”In the course of the case, which began with a complaint in 1998, Ms. Kroes noted that Microsoft’s share of the market in server software has risen sharply and that Windows Media Player has come to dominate the market.She highlighted the fact that Microsoft has 95 percent of the world market for desktop operating systems and said she would like to see this shrink. “You can’t draw a line and say exactly 50 percent is correct, but a significant drop in market share is what we would like to see,” she said. “Microsoft cannot regulate the market by imposing its products and its services on people.”'"
"'07-09-18,'1','I can add a footnote to “Ike Liked Civil Rights,” by David A. Nichols (Op-Ed, Sept. 12).In 1964, during the struggle to pass Lyndon B. Johnson’s civil rights bill, Eisenhower told me about a visit from Barry Goldwater, who would be the Republican candidate for president that year.“He came to tell me,” Ike said, “he was going to vote against the civil rights bill as a matter of conscience. I said I wouldn’t ask any man to go against his conscience, but that if I were a senator I’d vote for it. Even an imperfect bill would help balance 80 years of oppression. But what I couldn’t understand was his attempt to keep the bill from coming to a vote. If I were to comment, I’d crucify him for that.”As a former president who did not want to roil his party, Eisenhower never spoke out, but his passion for racial justice was clear.Robert SteinWeston, Conn., Sept. 12, 2007The writer is a former chairman of the American Society of Magazine Editors.'"
"'07-09-18,'1','David Brooks correctly documents the waning of the theory of a single intelligence and the practice of I.Q. tests. But he doesn’t explain why intelligence needs to be pluralized and how each intelligence can be enhanced.The standard view of intelligence focuses on a combination of linguistic and logical-mathematical facility — skills critical for success in school and in school-like environments.More than poets or physicists, professors of law epitomize high I.Q. The less scholastic the environment, the less relevant is I.Q.-style thinking.Even in environments that resemble school, absence of understanding of self and understanding of others imposes limits on success — hence the recent interest in emotional and personal intelligences.Mr. Brooks gains I.Q. points because he is facile with language, but loses nothing because he can’t compute the carom on a pool table.The standard view also stresses the intractability of intelligence. But we now know that a person’s profile of intelligences reflects not only general environmental factors but also access to resources, individual and group motivation, skill of teaching and availability of prosthetic devices.Unaided, Mr. Brooks may miscalculate the pool shot; but with a diagram or a handheld device, he can hold his own in terms of spatial intelligence. If he has bodily kinesthetic intelligence, he’ll make the shot; if he has interpersonal intelligence, he can handle victory graciously. Howard Gardner'"
"'07-09-18,'1','Women who have more than two alcoholic drinks a day double their risk of endometrial cancer compared with those who drink less, a new study finds.Researchers examined a multiethnic group of 41,574 postmenopausal women, following them for an average of eight years and using questionnaires about diet and drinking habits. In that time, the team found 324 cases of endometrial cancer, the type that forms in the tissue that lines the uterus. According to the National Cancer Institute, the United States has 40,000 new cases of endometrial cancer a year and 7,400 deaths.After controlling for variables including body mass index, age, hormone therapy and whether they had been pregnant, the researchers found that women who had less than two drinks a day had no increased risk of endometrial cancer. But those who had more than two drinks a day had slightly more than twice the risk. It made no difference whether the women drank beer, wine or hard liquor.The exact mechanism is unknown, but alcohol raises estrogen levels, and it is well established that prolonged exposure to estrogen increases mutations and DNA replication errors, predecessors of cancerous growths.“Relatively few studies have examined the relationship between endometrial cancer and drinking,” said Veronica Wendy Setiawan, the lead researcher and an assistant professor of research at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. “If this is a true association, that’s one more lifestyle change women can make.”The study appeared online Aug. 31 and will be published in a future print issue of The International Journal of Cancer.'"
"'07-09-18,'1','It is Ms. Iacoboni’s responsibility to introduce these most optimistic of patients to the heaven and hell of knowledge, the breadth and limitation of genetic diagnoses, and their choices. Then she will be their liaison throughout the hospital to turn those choices into action.But her job is made even more grueling because the women referred to her are overwhelmingly minority, poor and poorly educated. Their first languages might be Albanian, Bengali, Urdu, Korean or Wolof.Even though medical advances have improved first-trimester screenings, many of these patients do not realize early on that they are pregnant, are in denial or have pressing life problems that prevent them from keeping appointments.Some do not have partners. Earlier this morning, a 37-year-old patient who spoke only Mandingo sat with her head bowed, as her husband declared that because his other children were born healthy, there was no need to test this one. One patient is homeless; another became pregnant and HIV-positive after she was raped.“And they’re sitting down with this white, privileged, upper-middle-class woman,” Ms. Iacoboni, who has a master’s degree in genetic counseling from Sarah Lawrence College, says later, “and they’re thinking, ‘What do you know?’ On some level, they’re right. That’s why I don’t use a conventional psycho-social approach: ‘So what’s going on in your life that’s influencing your ability to make a decision today?’ I don’t try to pretend that I really understand.”She shows the Mexican couple a chromosome chart. The blood test is a “maybe,” she says, and because the woman is 27, chances are good that her baby will be fine.The only way to know for certain before the baby is born, she continues, is to do an amniocentesis. “Es opcional,” she adds. “Es tu decisión.”The doctor will use a needle to take a sample of the fluid surrounding the baby.The couple grow pale and shift in their seats. No.“I try not to be patronizing but to use the simplest language I can,” Ms. Iacoboni says later. “Numbers are very hard for most people. I try to let the patient guide me. I’ve had patients say, ‘Why did you tell me this?’ Our system is set up so that patients have a right to know everything we know. We can’t withhold that information.”Ms. Iacoboni has worked at this hospital and at its sister institution, Jacobi Medical Center, for seven years. She counsels not just patients with positive second-trimester blood screens but older women, about chromosomal risk factors, and women with family histories of an inherited disease.During her training, she did rotations around the city, including at an Upper East Side hospital. She prefers her patients in the Bronx.“This patient population is challenging but appreciative,” she says later.“That population?” she says, referring to her Manhattan rotation. “I’m that patient: high-maintenance, know-it-all, with the stack of Internet printouts. Now that’s a tough crowd.”For the Mexican couple, Ms. Iacoboni lays out the consequences of learning more: that amniocentesis has a small risk — 1 in 500 — of miscarriage.Faced with a quandary, patients often ask Ms. Iacoboni what she would do.“I say, ‘It’s not my place to tell you,’ ” Ms. Iacoboni says later. “ ‘And if I were you, I wouldn’t want me telling you to have a needle stuck in you that has any kind of a risk — and it’s also not my place to say you shouldn’t. Your religious beliefs, home support, financial situation are individual. The two worst things that could happen are, you could lose a healthy baby or you could learn you have a Down syndrome baby. You have to decide which risk is worse for you.’ ”Ms. Iacoboni gently tells the couple that many problems diagnosed by an amniocentesis have no cures.No, they say.That when some women learn the results, they keep their pregnancies. Others do not.“I’m not pro-anything,” Ms. Iacoboni says later. She has worked with patients who chose to keep pregnancies with severe fetal anomalies, for whom she helped arrange services throughout the hospital; and with those who terminated just before the 24-week legal deadline.“For lots of patients it’s more traumatizing to go through with an abortion than to let nature take its course,” she says. “I just want to make sure that patients truly understand what they’re taking on, including the ones who choose to terminate, that they see the magnitude of their choices.”The Mexican couple have shut down: No. No. No.Do you have any questions? Ms. Iacoboni asks.While she leaves to check their next appointment, the couple sit in silence, not looking at each other, the woman, tears glistening, turning over Ms. Iacoboni’s card, the man restlessly perusing a brochure in Spanish about amniocentesis. Then they politely thank her, and walk out.How much did they understand? Were they frightened by the needle? The remote possibility of miscarriage? The fear of having to think about abortion? Or did they just not want their dreams of a healthy baby punctured months before the due date?Ms. Iacoboni has no clue. She had sensed their consistent resistance, so she moved on.“ ‘Recommend’ should not be in a genetic counselor’s vocabulary,” she says.Her own pregnancy, she says, affected her counseling. “That’s when I had the best rapport with patients,” she says later, with a fond smile. “They could relate to me on that level.”Her belly grew. Then it became even more difficult, devastating actually, to discuss ambiguous test results and even conclusively awful ones with patients. “Talking about abortion while I was pregnant made me a better counselor,” she says. “I have much more empathy with patients than I did before.”Ms. Iacoboni answers her phone, listens and covers her eyes with her hands.She must tell a doctor that a patient’s baby has Trisomy 18, a chromosome disorder that will almost certainly be fatal shortly after birth.She puts off the call for a few moments. She needs to take a break to pump breast milk. There are no photographs in her office of her astonishingly normal 3-month-old baby.'"
"'07-09-18,'1','False righteousness can boomerang. The track coach Trevor Graham once said he anonymously mailed the syringe that started the Balco circus in an effort to clean up the sport, but a grand jury witness told a different tale: He did it to implicate athletes and coaches that his runners competed against. Graham is awaiting trial on charges that he lied to federal agents about the distribution of performance-enhancing drugs.Videogate isn’t a criminal issue — it’s more of a punch line by now — but it does cast shadows on the league’s integrity.There is no doubt Belichick’s video trickery was wrong, hubristic and a below-the-belt maneuver of reckless proportion. Commissioner Roger Goodell — the N.F.L.’s overtaxed moral warden — was right in delivering a punitive blow as a scare tactic to a league full of teams that seek a competitive edge by tapping into their inner MacGyvers. Even Kraft understood Goodell’s logic, even if it took him a while.“I must tell you I was quite upset and perturbed when I saw the penalty, because I didn’t think that the incident deserved this kind of punishment,” Kraft told NBC on Sunday night. “Over the last couple of days, I’ve been thinking about it and have cooled down. I realized he wasn’t just sending a message to the New England Patriots, he was sending it to all 32 teams.”Belichick wasn’t alone in this race to the bottom of sports ethics. Mangini was very likely, at one point in his Patriot days, the spy who loved Hoodie.How will we ever know? Maybe the lens will be the judge. In order to eliminate any competitive advantage Belichick might have tucked away in his film files, the Patriots said yesterday that they would comply with Goodell’s request to provide their videotape archive.How about popcorn and a movie with Goodell? Imagine what’s on those old tapes. Is that Mangini holding the Cheat Cam in 2004? Is that Mangini wiretapping Bill Parcells’s headset in 2003?A question to Jets officials yesterday about Mangini’s possible role in New England’s spy ring was greeted with the organization mantra: “It’s a league matter.”The matter has revealed more about Mangini than Belichick. Already, Mangini was known for attempting to raid the Patriots’ cupboards upon his exit in January 2006. He slithered around Foxborough as if he were pilfering Whoville, trying to lift players, assistants and secretaries.He wanted everything but the picture hooks on the walls. He also wanted to claim Belichick’s mind as his own intellectual property.But who knew how far he would go for a gotcha of Belichick? Maybe Mangini’s betrayal was a little something he learned from Belichick’s school of calculated callousness. In a way, the two almost deserve each other. Someday, Belichick and Mangini may look up and realize teams can win — and play in Super Bowls — on the strength of a coach’s humanity, not his ability to humiliate.Belichick is who he is. Mangini is the one with an identity crisis. He wants to portray himself as the anti-Bill — oozing charm when talking family values — and yet he longs to be Hoodie, to be known as wickedly smart.Calling out his mentor lacked thought, though. It is not the wisest idea to mess with the N.F.L.’s version of Zeus. The wisdom of Mangini’s decision to flip Bill will play out all season — and maybe beyond. So far, it’s Coach Hoodie, 2-0; and Coach Hoodwink, 0-2.'"

"'07-09-19,'1','But the CW adaptation pumps up the importance of parents, particularly Rufus, father to Dan (Penn Badgley) and Jenny (Taylor Momsen), middle-class Brooklyn kids who chafe beneath the scorn of their more glamorous classmates. In the novels Rufus is a minor figure, a scraggily failed poet with bad hygiene; here he is played by Matthew Settle as a former rock musician with romantic problems of his own, including a history with Serena’s snobby mother.The blending of adult and teenage story lines was crucial to “The OC,” but here it is a glaring violation of the genre.“Gossip Girl,” along with similar series like “The A-List” and “The Clique,” is Mean Girl lit, mass-market paperbacks that put “Sex and the City” in a teenage context, with lots of sex and erotic brand names like Prada, Absolut and St. Barts.And while these works are often criticized as a devolution from Judy Blume’s coming-of-age novels, they are actually closer to children’s literature. Like “Peter Pan,” “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” or the “Harry Potter” series, these novels are fantasies and projections of an imaginary world where parents are dead or peripheral, and lost boys and girls struggle on their own with good and evil, or in this case, Bergdorf Goodman and evil.Even the characters’ names — Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen — are as fancifully evocative as those found in children’s books, like Willy Wonka in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” or the candy magnate Lord Skrumshus in “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” Ian Fleming’s novel for children. (Fleming, whose spy James Bond met up with one Pussy Galore, never quite outgrew that name game.)Parents matter on “Gossip Girl,” and their negligence veins the narrative as if to explain their children’s excesses. CW specializes in young-adult television, and certain public-trust habits are hard to break, like enriching spoiled, bratty characters with poignant back stories to make them more sympathetic — or justifiable to media monitoring groups like the Parents Television Council.Oh, and also, Serena and Blair don’t smoke cigarettes. It is an odd crick in our culture that a show geared toward younger viewers will depict minors drinking alcohol and doing illegal drugs, but draw the line at cigarettes. Good citizens complain about the power of the tobacco lobby in Washington, but in Hollywood it seems that the anti-tobacco lobby is stronger, and even more intimidating to industry executives than Mothers Against Drunk Driving, or for that matter, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.The show even assigns Serena, back from boarding school under mysterious circumstances, a younger brother who attempted suicide and is misunderstood by all but his caring, if troubled, sister. (In the novels he is older, at Yale and an object of female lust, not psychotherapy.)Children’s book protagonists skirt past private wounds; they are too busy exploring Narnia or Neverland and fending off witches, pirates and Indian chiefs — or hostile saleswomen at Bendel’s.Only adult fiction indulges the grown-up delusion that children are interested in their parents’ personal lives.The mothers and fathers in “Gossip Girl” novels like “Because I’m Worth It” and “Nothing Can Keep Us Together” are peripheral figures, shallow socialites, divorcées and Wall Street tycoons who provide credit cards, neglect and a few bare-bones plot points, much the way Mr. Darling’s decision to chain Nana, the nanny watchdog, in the yard gave Peter Pan his chance to fly away with Wendy and the boys.That “Gossip Girl” novels have no underlying moral lesson is exactly the point; the tale of Hansel and Gretel has no redeeming social message either, except perhaps to beware of candy.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','NBC Universal, acknowledging that viewers are increasingly moving away from traditional television viewing, announced plans today for a service that will make popular NBC programs available to download free to personal computers and other devices.The programs, including “Heroes” and “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,” will be offered for a week immediately after their initial broadcasts. Commercials will be embedded in the programs and viewers will not be able to skip through them.The move comes less than three weeks after NBC Universal announced it was severing ties with Apple Inc. after a dispute over how Apple was selling NBC programs on its popular iTunes service.NBC first contracted with Amazon to offer its programs for sale to downloading devices like MP3 players. Now it is establishing its own downloading service, which NBC executives say they expect to become a viable competitor to iTunes.“With the creation of this new service, we are acknowledging that now, more than ever, viewers want to be in control of how, when and where they consume their favorite entertainment,” said Vivi Zigler, the executive vice president of NBC Digital Entertainment. “Not only does this feature give them more control, but it also gives them a higher quality video experience.”The NBC service, called NBC Direct, will begin a testing period in October with plans to be operational in November. The service will allow customers to download full episodes of NBC shows for seven days on Windows-based PCs. The file will expire after the seven days.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 — A move to give terrorism suspects the right to challenge their detentions in federal court fell short in the Senate today, even though it had majority support.Fifty-six senators voted to cut off debate, and move forward to a vote on the bill itself, a step known as cloture. But under Senate rules, 60 votes are needed to invoke cloture.Some supporters of the bill said they might bring it up again, although it was not clear just when. The cloture vote had been expected to fail, but the result did nothing to quell the debate over the proper balance between national security and personal liberty.“The truth is that casting aside the time-honored protection of habeas corpus makes us more vulnerable as a nation because it leads us away from our core American values,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, a co-sponsor of the measure with Senators Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. Mr. Leahy is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Mr. Specter the committee’s senior Republican; both are former prosecutors.The legal concept of habeas corpus (“You have the body” in Latin) dates back to medieval England, and is meant to protect people from being locked up indefinitely without a court review. Last year, Congress passed and President Bush signed an act eliminating the right of habeas corpus for non-Americans who are labeled “enemy combatants” in the continuing campaign against terrorism.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','A psychiatrist put her on an antidepressant, “the magic bullet,” she said. That, combined with therapy, exercise and a better diet, started her on the road to recovery. “It was gradual,” she said. “I crawled out of my hole.”In December 2002, she landed a job with an executive recruiting firm, and was soon chafing at the constraints of reporting to a boss. “I’m not the kind of person who can work at a desk in a cubicle under fluorescent lights near windows that don’t open,” she said.She said she was also not the sort of person who was willing to make do with 45 percent of her fee rather than 100 percent. In May 2004, she started BioEquities Recruiting.Two years later, she got a break that she thinks could help revolutionize the dietary habits of Americans. At a conference for the medical diagnostics industry, she said, she met the co-inventor of a technology that can quickly and inexpensively measure omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in serum or plasma, a process that normally takes 2 ½ days.Maintaining a proper balance of those two fatty acids is crucial in the treatment of disorders ranging from diabetes and heart disease to Alzheimer’s and, yes, depression. A quick and inexpensive test would, she thought, have huge market potential.Luckily for her, one of the symptoms of depression, a desire to escape the world, had lingered. “I get saturated quickly at these events and want to go hide,” she said. But when she saw a man “standing to one side of a room, by himself, sipping coffee,” she went up to him. He told her about his technology and asked, ‘Do you want to see my abstract?’ ”She read it during the next session, and was immediately excited. “I have a good gut feeling for what will be a successful product,” she said. “I’ve ushered enough of them to market. I knew this had huge potential.”Within weeks, she started a second company, LipidX Technologies in Mill Valley, Calif., to develop the product. She said she has worked out arrangements to pay the man she met at the conference, Neil Purdie, the head of the chemistry department at Oklahoma State University, and his co-inventor.At first, financers were lukewarm to her pitch. Then Ms. Alberty heard a commercial on her car radio for Smart Balance that promoted the omega-3 supplements in its butter, mayonnaise, eggs and other products.“I said to myself, ‘We can test omega-3 in food as well as people,’” she recalled. “We broadened our pitch, because omega-3 is in everything.”For now, she is focusing on using LipidX’s technology to develop faster and better tests of fatty acids in foods and in people at risk of heart attacks, especially for pregnant women and infants. But, she said, “the applications are everywhere, and the partnership, licensing and spin-off possibilities are endless.”Investors are starting to show interest in her company, she said, and she hopes to raise up to $1.5 million this year to acquire enough data to go into clinical studies.She said she made the transition from despairing recluse to enthusiastic promoter by drawing on all the reserves of her entrepreneurial personality, notably her determination to control her destiny, her stubbornness and her fearlessness, as when she left a company without a safety net.“I was taking an entrepreneurial approach to depression,” she said. “Nothing stops me. At times I lost my motivation, but I had built my support system and fell back at that.”That is true to form, says Kerry Sulkowicz, founder of the Boswell Group LLC, a New York consulting firm, who has agreed to comment on the ways entrepreneurs in this three-column series face up to personal adversity.Despite their reputation as indefatigable optimists, he said, entrepreneurs are just as susceptible to bouts of severe melancholy as the general population — and maybe more so. “All of them are very emotionally vulnerable people,” he said, and many are probably borderline bipolar.What sets them apart is the alacrity with which they act, once they begin pulling themselves out of their rut. “It is because they are action-oriented, especially when the action is directed at a problem they want to solve,” he said. “In Betsy’s case, once she emerged from her crippling depression, she drew upon her entrepreneurial skills to prevent a relapse.”Just as entrepreneurs, in general, view setbacks as opportunities rather than failures, Ms. Alberty said she views her struggle with despondency as a passage to success. “My depression led me to investigate the nutritional possibilities of this technology, to see how it might address the underlying causes of depression,” she said. “Otherwise, I might have just glanced at this guy’s abstract and done nothing.”Next week: How an entrepreneur overcame the overnight loss of a business he had spent years building.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','In Asia, the rate cut is seen as particularly benefiting exporters of cars and electronic goods that rely heavily on the United States market. Toyota Motor Corporation had its biggest gain in more than three years on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, adding 4.9 percent.In Seoul, Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor Company, both heavily reliant on the U.S. market were up 1.9 per cent and 4.6 percent respectively, leading a surge in the share prices for exporters.But the enthusiasm to cash in the American rate cut was tempered by a discomforting message implicit in the decision to drop the benchmark interest rate to 4.75 percent.“I don’t think anyone can feel comfortable that all is well,” said Edmund Harriss, the investment director with Guinness Atkinson Investment Managers, which has $370 million in assets in three Asia-focused funds. On one hand, the move signifies that the Fed is “prepared to act as needed,” Mr. Harriss said, but on the other, the United States economy may be “looking weaker than we thought.”Whether the old adage about the U.S. economy sneezing and the rest of the world catching a cold holds true is a question on the minds of many economists and business executives in Asia as they watch the fallout from the crisis in the U.S. over defaults on home loans to poor grade borrowers, the so-called sub-prime mortgage problem.The aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve has signaled to many economists the depth of concern over a U.S. recession brought on by a credit squeeze and declining consumer consumption.But what impact will that have on Asia? Just two days before the Federal Reserve’s announcement, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank issued its annual economic outlook report for Asia, forecasting average growth in the region of 8.3 percent for 2007. This upgraded its earlier estimate of 7.6 percent. Growth for 2008 was forecast to be 8.2 percent.One of the bank’s key messages was that Asia is well placed to manage any U.S. slowdown, although the comment came with the caveat that the outlook for the region in 2008 is “hazy” because of uncertainty in global financial markets and the health of the world’s biggest economy.“Developing Asia’s defenses against external shocks are solid and it can weather a slowdown in the United States,” the bank said. “The region’s growth prospects will continue to depend on how well the countries address their internal challenges.”At a conference in Manila today, Haruhiko Kuroda, the president of the bank, said the U.S . rate cut would help stabilize financial markets and give a timely boost to the U.S. economy.“It would definitely improve the prospect of sustained strong economic growth in the United States, which could be also very beneficial particularly for emerging economies in Asia,” Kuroda said. “So, I would say that the decision would be greatly appreciated by many economies, financial sectors in the region.”The bank’s outlook report pointed to research by the International Monetary Fund that growth in countries of developing Asia declined by 0.28 percent for every percentage point fall in U.S. growth in the five U.S. recessions from 1974 to 2001.Even oil priced at about $82 a barrel is yet to shake confidence in the region’s ability to maintain the fastest growth rates in the world, although it will increase the budget cost of direct and indirect subsidies for consumers.Big Asian manufacturers with significant exposure to the U.S. market will be hoping the rate cut will ease the effects of the sub-prime crisis in damping consumer consumption, hence the rally in stocks of car and electronics companies Wednesday. Markets were ebullient across the region.In late trading, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia-Pacific Index jumped 3.9 percent “It wasn’t a big topic of discussion for us today,” said Jake Jang, a spokesman for Hyndai Motor Co. “But we hope that the Fed’s rate decrease will help improve the consumer sentiment in the United States and help our car sales there.”Still, other analysts were less sanguine about the effect of the rate cut. Christopher Lingle, a research scholar at the Centre for Civil Society, a think tank in New Delhi, said the Federal Reserve had “decided to refill the punch bowl”, encouraging loose lending practices.“I think it’s a stupid idea, done by stupid people, to be polite,” said Lingle. “The Federal Reserve system has been engaged in one of the most ruinous monetary policies of the last century, starting with Alan Greenspan,” Lingle said.Before Tuesday’s rate cut “some of the excess liquidity was trying to dry up, bankers were realizing that the party should be over and getting out before the hangover started,” Lingle said.For Asia’s central banks there is sufficient uncertainty about the global economy that they are widely expected by economists to take a wait-and-see approach to any interest rate changes of their own.The Bank of Japan decided Wednesday to leave rates unchanged, despite favoring a policy of incremental increases. Other central banks, like the Bank of Korea, are also likely to be cautious about going ahead with forecast rate rises, say analysts.Toshihiko Fukui, the bank governor, said the decision to keep rates on hold was influenced by the downside risk for the U.S. economy and the potential impact on the state of the global economy, despite Japanese rates being low compared to the strength of the domestic economy.”‘Uncertainty over the world economy has grown,” Reuters reported him saying. “We will make an appropriate policy judgment looking at economic data and risk, both at home and abroad.”Mr. Harriss, the investment director with Guinness, said the rate cut might offer only a temporary reprieve. “Once the dust has settled, the concerns that have been there for a while still remain,” said Mr. Harriss.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','For consumers, the Fed’s move could mean lower borrowing costs for mortgages and automobile loans. But the impact may be muted, because investors remain deeply anxious about the credit quality of mortgages and other long-term loans. The main problem in the last month has not been high rates so much as the availability of capital to complete deals.Analysts described the Fed’s action as a bold attempt to restore confidence, with a quieter caveat that investors and consumers should not assume the certainty of more painkillers later this year.“The important policy debate now centers on the future interest rate path, but Fed officials left that more ambiguous,” said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.Indeed, while many on Wall Street have been clamoring for an aggressive rate cut, some economists had warned against it, saying that it might send the wrong signal by bailing out those who contributed to the housing bubble and encourage future market excesses.In both the bold stroke and the fine print, the Fed’s move offered a revealing hint about Ben. S. Bernanke, the former professor from Princeton who took over as Fed chairman last year.Mr. Bernanke, a champion of steady rules to guide monetary policy, has long been seen as more skeptical about reacting to financial turbulence than his predecessor, Alan Greenspan.Mr. Bernanke, for example, made it clear that he did not want to rescue investors or real estate speculators who made bad decisions. But in shielding the economy from a downturn, the Fed will inevitably be helping some of the very people Mr. Bernanke did not want to help.What seems to have driven Mr. Bernanke to act more boldly, analysts said, was the jolt from the Labor Department’s unexpectedly poor employment report for August, which showed that the nation had lost jobs for the first time in four years.Still, Mr. Bernanke’s move was nothing if not a Greenspanian display of “discretionary” policy in response to trouble but before the signs of an economic downturn were unambiguous. And in doing so, he obtained unanimous agreement from other board members, even though some Fed officials have been dubious about the need for a rescue.The Fed’s course change has been under way since early August, when fears about huge losses on subprime mortgage loans and a continued downturn in housing caused a much broader panic in credit markets.The resulting credit tightness has now affected all but the safest home mortgages and has also greatly reduced the ability of private equity funds and hedge funds to borrow money at low rates. Many banks, which had been planning to resell their loans into the giant market for tradable commercial debt securities, are now being forced to absorb loans that the securities markets will no longer take.In the rate cut and an accompanying statement, the central bank acknowledged that the risks of a recession were too big to ignore.“The tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and restrain economic growth more generally,” the Fed’s policy-making committee said in its statement. “Today’s action is intended to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets.”Leaving the door open for the possibility of additional rate cuts, the central bank said it would “continue to assess” the economic outlook and “act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.”But while Fed policy makers abandoned previous statements that the risk of inflation was their “predominant concern,” they did not say that the risk of a downturn had replaced inflation as their main worry. Rather, they spoke of “uncertainty” and left it at that.“The Fed kept its cards much closer to its vest than anyone would have guessed,” said David Rosenberg, chief North American economist for Merrill Lynch. “It’s not at all clear they think they have more to do.”Trading among investors indicated that Wall Street expects the central bank to keep cutting rates. Many analysts contend that it needs to cut twice as deeply as it has so far by early next year.And in a sign that the politics of rate-cutting could become more bruising, at least one prominent Democrat quickly criticized the Fed’s cautionary warning about inflation at a time of slowing growth. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he was “surprised” by the Fed’s statement.“I hope, in this instance, that markets and consumers will pay more attention to what the F.O.M.C. did than to what it said,” Mr. Frank added, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates.In a separate move to bolster the banking system, the Fed also said that it had cut its discount lending rate, which applies to short-term emergency loans to banks, by a half a percentage point, to 5.25 percent.As in 2001, the Fed’s move came after a panic in financial markets and the collapse of a speculative bubble. Today, the panic is in credit markets unnerved by dubious mortgages on inflated housing prices. Back then, it was the stock market that was in trouble, initially because the air went out of inflated dot-com stocks.But the debate within the Fed was all about risk probabilities: what were the odds that the twin meltdowns in housing and mortgage markets would tip the overall economy into a recession?If policy makers cut rates too cautiously, they risk a recession; if they cut them too much or too early, they risk stoking inflation.Ever since the jobs data was released this month, it seemed clear that Fed policy makers were no longer debating whether to reduce rates but how much to lower them. A smaller rate reduction posed a risk of moving too slowly if the economy was indeed in danger of stalling. But a bigger rate reduction could have been taken as a sign of Fed panic, and it added to the risk of stoking inflationary pressures that the central bank had just begun to tamp down.Just a few hours before the central bank announced its decision, new statistics indicated that the pace of home foreclosures was accelerating.RealtyTrac of Irvine, Calif., reported that the number of foreclosure filings — from default notices and auction sale notices to bank repossessions — was 36 percent higher in August than in July and 115 percent higher than one year ago.But except for the housing downturn, which Fed officials admit is much more severe than they had expected, the evidence of a recession in the real economy is indecisive. Global economic growth is much stronger than in 2001, and American exports have climbed about 14 percent over the last year.Instead of the United States being the world’s engine of growth, the global economy could now become the engine of American growth.Many Wall Street economists place the odds of a recession at about one-in-three or somewhat higher. Mr. Greenspan puts the odds at somewhat more than the one-in-three that he estimated earlier this year.On Aug. 17, the Federal Reserve moved to ease the liquidity crisis by encouraging banks to borrow money through its discount window, an outlet originally created as an emergency source of overnight funding for banks in a cash squeeze.But by most accounts, the turmoil in the credit markets has abated very little. The market for subprime mortgages has all but disappeared and demand for all forms of asset-backed commercial paper — which are securities backed by mortgages, credit card debt and company receivables — remains very weak.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','In a statement released Tuesday night, Mr. Krongard said he had not seen Mr. Waxman’s letter because he was traveling in Afghanistan and Iraq. “The allegations, as described to me and in certain media reports, are replete with inaccuracies, including those made by persons with their own agendas,” the statement said, adding that he looked forward to the opportunity to respond in full to the accusations.One facet of Mr. Waxman’s inquiry reportedly involves Blackwater USA, the security company that was banned by the Iraqi government from working in the country after a shooting on Sunday that left eight Iraqis dead. Mr. Waxman told Mr. Krongard that he had been accused of impeding an investigation of a security company suspected of “illegally smuggling weapons into Iraq.” The Associated Press reported that the unidentified company was Blackwater.Karen Lightfoot, a spokeswoman for Mr. Waxman’s panel, said she could neither confirm nor deny the A.P. report. A spokeswoman for Blackwater, Anne Tyrrell, declined to comment when reached by The A.P.Last year, when Republicans still controlled Congress, they tried to do away with the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, which had uncovered numerous construction abuses and contract violations. Mr. Waxman was furious, and he has made no secret of his relish in probing activities of the Bush administration now that Democrats are in control.One accusation against Mr. Krongard is that he interfered with an investigation of Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, at the time the head of Voice of America and a close associate of Karl Rove, President Bush’s former political adviser. Mr. Krongard was accused of passing information about the inquiry to Mr. Tomlinson.State Department investigators determined last year that Mr. Tomlinson had used his office to run a “horse racing operation” and had improperly put a friend on the payroll. Mr. Tomlinson, who resigned in January, has denied doing anything improper.Mr. Waxman wrote Mr. Krongard that his detractors have described “a dysfunctional office environment” in which he routinely bullied and berated employees, driving many away and undermining the agency.Mr. Waxman said it appeared that Mr. Krongard had done nothing to investigate “wasteful spending or procurement fraud” in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the State Department has spent more than $3.6 billion on contracts. He said Mr. Krongard was also accused of thwarting investigations into possible procurement fraud in Afghanistan by “a large State Department contractor,” which he did not identify in his letter.Mr. Waxman said Mr. Krongard had apparently prevented his investigators from cooperating with a Justice Department inquiry into waste, fraud and abuse involving construction of the new United States Embassy in Baghdad and followed “highly irregular procedures in exonerating the prime contractor,” First Kuwaiti General Trading and Contracting Company, of charges that it mistreated its workers.The embassy will be the largest in the world when completed this year at a cost of some $600 million. Problems with its construction, reported at length in The Washington Post and cited by Mr. Waxman in his letter, included the contractor’s failure to build blast-resistant walls and its use of faulty electrical wiring. The bad wiring led to power failures that made cooking impossible and forced security people to dine for some time on the military’s prepackaged “meals ready to eat.”Mr. Krongard became inspector general in May 2005. He worked previously for Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, an international law firm, and before that served as general counsel of Deloitte & Touche.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','Procter & Gamble was ordered yesterday to stop advertising that its Vicks foaming sanitizer for hands prevents the spread of viruses that cause colds.The Food and Drug Administration is not aware of enough evidence to show the product is safe and effective for such use, according to a warning letter posted on the agency’s Web site.The regulators ordered P.& G. to correct the violations or face legal action, seizure or an injunction.The F.D.A. is reviewing health claims for over-the-counter antiseptics made by P.& G., Johnson & Johnson and other companies. While the active ingredient in the Vicks product, triclosan, is covered under F.D.A. regulations for certain antiseptic uses, that does not include P.& G.’s directions that users should leave the sanitizer on their hands, without rinsing with water, according to the letter.“We believe we’re within the F.D.A. guidelines, and we’re going to work with the F.D.A. to clear up any misunderstandings,” said David Bernens, a spokesman for P.& G.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','Prices at the producer level declined in August, the government reported yesterday, signaling a possible slackening of inflation pressures in the months ahead.Rapidly falling energy costs, including a 13.8 percent plunge in gasoline prices, led to a 1.4 percent drop in the Producer Price Index in August after a 0.6 percent rise in July. But the more crucial core rate of inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 0.2 percent, a slight acceleration from July, driven by increased costs for vehicles and prescription drugs.“There are other indications in the goods sector that there are some significant price pressures,” said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist for Goldman Sachs. “So you want to put it in perspective, but it’s definitely a piece of good news.”While a recent rebound in oil prices could lead to higher fuel costs in the weeks ahead, other inflation pressures appear to be easing. Analysts pointed to a half-point decline in the cost of goods used to make other goods, known as intermediate goods, as a sign that price increases were slowing further up the production chain and that consumers may see some relief as those goods are processed and enter the retail market.“The intermediate-materials pattern offers a hint of evidence that inflation pressures at the consumer price level will be weakening,” said Kenneth Beauchemin, United States economist for Global Insight, an economic research firm in Lexington, Mass.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','Impac Mortgage Holdings, a California home lender that suspended some operations last month, now plans to cease almost all lending and omit dividends for the rest of 2007 after “disruptions” caused by rising defaults.The company, one of more than 100 that have halted home lending or left the business since the start of 2006, said in a statement that it had notified 144 more employees across the United States that they would be laid off as it ended “warehouse lending, commercial lending and substantially all of its mortgage lending.”Impac, based in Irvine, Calif., plans to keep only a handful of offices that make loans that conform to standards set by government-sponsored mortgage buyers. It bought the branches it will keep operating from Pinnacle Financial in May.Many investors are shunning mortgage bonds that lack implied government guarantees through entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, reducing the size of the market for loans originated by Impac.The chief executive, Joseph R. Tomkinson, said it had been “extremely difficult” to sell certain loans as buyers stopped bidding or reneged on promises.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','Warren B. Church, an archaeologist at Columbus State University in Georgia, particularly applauded Mr. Savoy’s discovery of Vilcabamba. But as for Gran Pajatén, he said, Mr. Savoy’s claim of discovery in 1965 was not the first. He said a local mayor had reported that his townspeople had found the ruins a year earlier but that they had been ignored by the authorities in Lima.That episode became further complicated when a University of Colorado team was given credit for the find in 1985 and Mr. Savoy objected that his own discovery had been widely reported 20 years earlier. (He neglected to mention the claim made by the local villagers still earlier, even though the mayor who had reported it was among those with him at Gran Pajatén.) When People magazine reported on the controversy between Mr. Savoy and the University of Colorado team, it likened Mr. Savoy to Indiana Jones, an image he assiduously polished in ensuing years.Scientists have also questioned Mr. Savoy’s tendency to use his explorations to pursue unusual theories, his lack of scientific expertise and his ballyhooing of discoveries. Keith Muscutt, an archaeologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 2004 that finding ruins in the region where Mr. Savoy prowled “is about as hard as finding elephants in a zoo.”Others wondered if Mr. Savoy’s practice of allowing would-be explorers to pay to accompany him might have embellished his characterization of what they found. In 1967, the charge for a 21-day expedition for two was $10,160, The New York Times reported at the time.Douglas Eugene Savoy was born in Bellingham, Wash., on May 11, 1927, and grew up fascinated with local Indians and archaeology. At 17, he joined the Navy and became an aircraft gunner. He attended the University of Portland, a Roman Catholic institution, but dropped out to pursue his broadening captivation with religion. For a decade, he studied subjects including philosophy and folklore, both on his own and with private tutors.Then, in 1959, he founded the International Community of Christ, Church of the Second Advent, which claims thousands of followers around the world. Its theology, which is said to emerge from the teachings of the Essenes of Jesus’ time, includes elements of many world religions and holds that the Second Coming is already occurring.Mr. Savoy went on his first archaeological mission in 1957, to Peru. It was canceled for lack of financing, but he stayed on.In addition to pursuing terrestrial archaeology, he organized missions in an effort to prove that ancient civilizations had been connected by sea travel. The first such mission involved a voyage on a raft from northern Peru to Mexico. Another attempted a round-the-world trip intended to prove that the ancient Egyptians, Japanese, Incas and Jews could have been in touch.Mr. Savoy married the former Sylvia Ontaneda in 1971; they divorced in 1992. His other marriages, to Carmel Cervetto and Elvira Clark, also ended in divorce. He is survived by the children of his first marriage, Gene Jr., Sean and Sylvia Jamila Savoy, all of Reno; three brothers, Bill Dailey of Reno, Jack Dailey of Medford, Ore., and Douglas Leon Dailey of Talent, Ore.; and three granddaughters.Sean Savoy said that two additional sons had been born of his father’s marriage to Ms. Cervetto but that the family had lost touch with them.Mr. Savoy wrote 60 books on religion and four on his explorations. His penchant for colorful recollections never abated in interviews, even as his health worsened. He spoke of friends’ being kidnapped by pirates, of a nearly fatal bite of a pit viper, of the utter loneliness of the sea.But he could also be downright practical about the worth of his accomplishments: he said his discoveries, based on hunch and chutzpah, had paved the way for serious scientists.Professor Dillehay agreed, and said the process was not over.“Some of the sites that he discovered and examined have not been fully explored by others,” the professor said. “In some ways, his heyday has not yet come.”'"
"'07-09-19,'1','Astoria Federal Savings ads promote its longevity, being in business for “more than 118 years,” and use soothing phrases like “We’re part of your community, and we’re here when you need us.”The changes are reminiscent of the makeovers that financial marketers have given their ads during previous tumultuous times, like the stock market crash of 1987, the East Asian financial crisis of 1997 and the dot-com bust.Other financial advertisers, however, are taking a contrary point of view when it comes to today’s turmoil, saying they see no need for such measures — or even deeming them counterproductive.“Most market research we’ve done shows that when a stock market says, ‘Don’t worry,’ people worry,” said John L. Jacobs, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Nasdaq Stock Market. “We tend to be agnostic to a market condition because we’re here for the long term, the big picture,” he added.So a television campaign for Nasdaq that began this week, created by the McKinney & Silver division of Havas, is focused on the achievements of companies like eBay and Starbucks, which are listed on Nasdaq. The humorous commercials carry an optimistic theme, asserting that a company trading on Nasdaq “moves life forward.”In recent weeks, however, it seemed to many investors and homeowners that life might be moving in the other direction. The reason was the turmoil in the mortgage markets and the resulting gyrations in share values on the stock exchanges.The campaign from LendingTree, which started last Thursday, characterizes conditions as “chaotic.”The campaign, by an internal team at LendingTree and Mullen, an agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, extends from print and television to the company’s Web site (lendingtree.com) and YouTube. The ads take an educational tack, centered on what are described as “Five steps for smart borrowing.”One of those steps is a measure that most marketers rarely take: damping consumer interest.“Make sure you can afford it,” Step 4 cautions, referring to a mortgage loan. “The costs of owning a home extend far beyond the mortgage payment.”The goal is to communicate to consumers that LendingTree realizes “the landscape for lending has changed considerably,” said C. D. Davies, chief executive at LendingTree, part of IAC/InterActiveCorp.LendingTree added a feature to its Web site in 2004 called the Smart Borrower Center, Mr. Davies said, and made it the subject of ads that ran in some magazines as recently as July. But it was not until last week that LendingTree switched gears to the five steps approach from its far more upbeat “When banks compete, you win” campaign.“If I had to do it over again, I would’ve maybe started it 15 to 30 days earlier,” Mr. Davies said of the switch.But with “all the people who need to buy homes, who need to be lent money, who may have adjustable-rate mortgages that are adjusting” in the coming months, he added, “it’s not too late” to revise marketing tactics.The campaign for Chase Bank, created by McGarry Bowen, began appearing in late August in local and national newspapers. Some ads carry headlines like “Strength. Value. Commitment. Qualities you’ve come to depend on.” Some offer promotional rates on certificates of deposit or home equity loans. And other ads promise that Chase Bank is “committed to helping you buy or refinance your home.”The “volatility in the lending market, in the stock market,” inspired the campaign, said Ryan McInerney, head of marketing for consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase.“We stepped back and said, ‘This is a big time of uncertainty,’ ” he added. “We saw it as an opportunity to grow our business while reassuring customers.”By contrast, the New York Life Insurance Company was reluctant to attribute the timing of its campaign to market conditions.Rather, said John Brine, a vice president at New York Life, the genesis of the ads was a recent upgrading of its insurance financial-strength rating by Standard & Poor’s, which gives the company “the highest rating from all four major rating agencies” (the others being A. M. Best, Fitch and Moody’s).“The upgrade, based on our financial strength and industry leadership, speaks volumes about the quality of New York Life,” Mr. Brine wrote in an e-mail message, “particularly in this volatile environment.” The ads are from Berlin Cameron United, part of the United division of the WPP Group.Experts in brand marketing, corporate-identity consulting and crisis management offered divergent opinions on the timing and appropriateness of the campaigns.“Obtuse and reactive and dilatory,” Dean Crutchfield, senior vice president for marketing at Wolff Olins, a division of the Omnicom Group, said about many of them. “They’re groveling.”Worse yet, Mr. Crutchfield said, the ads are “self-indulgent” because they are “talking about the companies, not about the consumer.”By comparison, Eric Dezenhall, chief executive at Dezenhall Resources, said the campaigns might be arriving at the right time.“There is a certain danger in coming out too fast,” Mr. Dezenhall said, “because you don’t know if you’re dealing with a couple of bad days or a fundamental sea change.”As current conditions suggest there are chronic aspects to the problems, he added, advertisers like LendingTree are clever to adopt an educational subtext for their ads.“Sometimes in crisis situations, the best you can do is give anxious people a sense of control and a sense of choice instead of curing their anxiety,” Mr. Dezenhall said. “This isn’t marketing to increase the upside; it’s communication to limit the downside.”Don Peppers, a founding partner at the Peppers & Rogers Group, said he believed that the primary issues for financial marketers in addressing consumers who feel victimized were trust and competence.“The more self-interested you are, the less I’m willing to trust you,” said Mr. Peppers, whose consultancy is part of the Carlson Marketing unit of the Carlson Companies. “And do you have the competence to deliver on the promises you’re making me?”Too many financial marketers adopted business models “that maximized the short term at whatever cost,” Mr. Peppers said. “Getting their credibility back is going to hinge more on the actions they take than the advertising they produce.”'"
"'07-09-19,'1','The manufacturing-technology innovation, a new silicon technology component, is almost ready. Intel’s Penryn family of processors, to be introduced on Nov. 12, will be the industry’s first high-volume 45-nanometer processors. (the current standard is 65 nanometers.)Mr. Otellini said the company planned to introduce 15 new 45-nanometer processors by the end of the year and 20 more in the first quarter of 2008. A.M.D. has said it will move to 45-nanometer technology in mid-2008.“We expect our Penryn processors to provide up to a 20 percent performance increase while improving energy efficiency,” Mr. Otellini said.He said that 32-nanometer technology, which is on track to begin production in 2009, would offer even greater performance. The 32-nanometer chips use transistors so small that more than 4 million of them could fit on the head of a pin.“Smaller is better, smaller is cheaper,” Mr. Otellini said.The company also disclosed plans for a new graphics-oriented product, called Larrabee, which will compete with products from Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia and Advanced Micro’s ATI graphics unit. Larrabee will include 12 cores, or computing brains.On Monday, A.M.D. unveiled its own strategic change: a desktop chip with three cores, unusual in an industry that tends to grow in even numbers, routinely doubling performance. The announcement came as a surprise to analysts, as the company had promoted the advantages of four processors only last week.A.M.D. executives, referring to a recent survey by Mercury Research, said that quad-core processors accounted for only 2 percent of all desktop computer systems, suggesting that they had been slower to catch on than expected.It is hoping that its new three-core chip, called Phenom, will appeal to midrange customers who are looking for better performance than dual-core systems can provide, but do not see the need for quad-core systems. A corporate vice president, Robert Brewer, predicted that “it’s naturally going to resonate with customers,” who he said would appreciate having another choice.But Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst with Insight 64, a consulting firm in Saratoga, Calif., said the triple-core chip could prove confusing to customers. It is due in the first quarter of 2008, the quarter after Advanced Micro is scheduled to release its quad-core chip. In some cases, the triple-core chip may actually perform faster than a quad core.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','ANKARA, Turkey, Sept. 18 — Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan refused on Tuesday to rule out the possibility of military operations into northern Iraq to root out armed Kurdish separatist groups that he said had taken refuge in the border region.Mr. Erdogan also criticized some Western countries for what he called their increasingly hawkish stance against Iran.Meeting with foreign journalists before his trip to the United States to meet with President Bush and others attending the United Nations General Assembly next week, Mr. Erdogan said that despite the relative calm in the northern region of Iraq bordering Turkey, all options remained open in his country’s struggle against Kurdish separatist militants.“No country can continue living under the constant threat of terrorism,” Mr. Erdogan said in his office at his party headquarters in Ankara, the capital. “This struggle has the same legitimacy for Turkey as it has for the U.S., Spain or United Kingdom.”The P.K.K., or Kurdistan Workers’ Party, has been operating in Turkey since the 1980s, pressing demands for a separate Kurdish state in a conflict that has taken more than 30,000 lives.'"
"'07-09-19,'1','In his introduction Mr. Aldous, a historian at University College, Dublin, argues that the great rivalry between Gladstone and Disraeli, although a familiar story, needs retelling because the issues that engaged them — patriotism, liberal values, cultural identity and tradition — touch on modern preoccupations in an illuminating way. He cites, rather vaguely, “a need to reclaim the national story” as his excuse for revisiting old haunts.This comes perilously close to being hot air. What Mr. Aldous presents, quite entertainingly, is a dual character study and a blow-by-blow account of two warriors engaged in hand-to-hand combat for the better part of their lifetimes.His method is cinematic. Rather than a continuous narrative, the book is a sequence of vignettes, each preceded by a dateline (“Hawarden Castle, 7 July 1855”) and each initiated by a blind, attention-grabbing lead sentence that puts readers in the swirl of mysterious events: “Sleet and violent winds thrashed against the windows of the handsome reception rooms at the new Foreign Office,” or “The servant had already knocked once.”Although formulaic and, by the end of the book, frankly irritating, Mr. Aldous’s lapel-grabbing approach has the virtue of immediacy. He conveys not only the cut-and-thrust of parliamentary debate but also the intensely personal nature of the enmity between Gladstone, leader of the reform-minded Liberal Party and four-time prime minister, and Disraeli, two-time prime minister and architect of a kinder, more inclusive “one-nation Conservatism.”The issues were great. Under Gladstone and Disraeli, Britain struggled to recast its political system to reflect the momentous social and economic changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution. The thunderous parliamentary oratory, in an era when three-hour extemporaneous speeches were a matter of course, matched the moment.Both men proved more than equal to the age. Gladstone, whose moral fervor was matched only by his phenomenal capacity for hard work and mastery of arcane financial and administrative details, could speak with equal power to Parliament and the public. Disraeli specialized in the rapier thrust and the poisoned epigram. The radical politician John Bright, in a diary entry after one of Disraeli’s bravura performances, ticked off the highlights with a connoisseur’s appreciation: “satire, sarcasm, invective, all were abundant and of the first class.”From great heights both men could stoop, and stoop low. Mr. Aldous gleefully records their quarrels over a furniture bill at the office of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Disraeli was on the way out, Gladstone on the way in). Gladstone refused to accept Disraeli’s valuation of the merchandise. In revenge Disraeli walked off with a Chancellor’s robe once worn by Pitt the Younger, one of Gladstone’s heroes. It resides today at Disraeli’s country estate.The subtleties in some of the parliamentary machinations might elude American readers, and the personal clashes are certainly easier to grasp than the difference between personal and compound ratepayers, a critical point in the debate over the 1867 Reform Bill.But Mr. Aldous outlines the broad issues clearly and economically. One of Disraeli’s great contributions to political life, he points out, was his conviction that opposition parties should oppose rather than wait politely for events to swing the pendulum their way. This attack-oriented philosophy lent acrimony to parliamentary debate, and the sneaky tactics that went with it often caught Gladstone by surprise.On the other hand, Gladstone, on taking a bow, could be “terrible on the rebound,” as one politician observed.Back and forth they went, trading blows and insults, decade after decade. Ten Downing Street should have been outfitted with a revolving door. Gladstone came and went, and so did Disraeli, each snarling at the other on the way in and out. It made for a great show, richly appreciated by fellow parliamentarians and the public. After them, the politicians looked very, very small.'"

"'07-09-20,'0','Borse Dubai agreed today to take a stake in the Nasdaq stock exchange and become the first government-controlled stock exchange of the Middle East to hold a significant stake in an American rival, a step that may stir political controversy in Washington.In a complex four-way deal, Borse Dubai plans to take a 19.9 percent stake in Nasdaq and buy Nasdaq’s 28 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange. Dubai will in turn let Nasdaq buy OMX, the Stockholm-based stock exchange operator, over which the two have been locked in a six-week bidding war. In a separate statement, Qatar, which competes with Dubai as a financial center in the region, said it bought 20 percent of the London exchange but does not currently intend to make an offer.The agreement allows Borse Dubai, the fastest-growing financial center in the Persian Gulf, to gain access to expertise for its one-month-old enterprise and help it develop into a capital market center in the developing world. For Nasdaq’s chief executive, Robert Greifeld, the deal means he can finally fulfill his goal of creating a more global stock exchange after he failed to combine with the London exchange in the past while the rival NYSE Group successfully merged with Euronext.“Our primary objective is to build a world class, growth oriented exchange out of Dubai and to become the center for capital markets activities in the emerging markets,” Borse Dubai’s chairman, Essa Kazim, said in a statement today.As part of the deal, Dubai would get two of the 16 board seats once Nasdaq merges with OMX and not more than 5 percent of voting rights. The deal, which would create a stock exchange operation spanning from America across Europe to the Middle East, is still subject to a long list of conditions and may attract political opposition in America.Reports of a possible deal brought questions last night from lawmakers in Washington about potential compromises to security in the United States. The concerns were similar to those raised more than a year ago when another Dubai-owned company, DP World, tried to buy a company that managed port operations around the United States, and in 2005, when the Chinese oil company, Cnooc, tried to buy its American rival, Unocal. Both efforts were abandoned under pressure from Congress.'"
"'07-09-20,'0','Reports of a possible deal brought questions last night from lawmakers in Washington about potential compromises to security in the United States. The concerns were similar to those raised more than a year ago when another Dubai-owned company, DP World, tried to buy a company that managed port operations around the United States, and in 2005, when the Chinese oil company, Cnooc, tried to buy its American rival, Unocal. Both efforts were abandoned under pressure from Congress.Dubai is the commercial and financial center of the United Arab Emirates on the Persian Gulf and has been cited as a transit point for money used to finance terrorism.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who helped lead the opposition to Dubai’s investment in the American ports, said last night that the deal, which would make Dubai a major player in New York finance, would “raise serious questions that have to be answered.”“Should any government own any part of a major U.S. stock exchange?” asked Mr. Schumer, who is on the banking and finance committees in the Senate and is the chairman of the joint House and Senate economic committee.A spokeswoman for Nasdaq did not return phone calls seeking comment and executives in Dubai could not be reached.Borse Dubai plans to acquire its stakes in the New York and London exchanges through an elaborate series of steps growing out of its success in outbidding Nasdaq for the OMX Group for about $4 billion.In the deal that is expected to be announced today, Borse Dubai will complete the purchase of the OMX Group and then hand it over to Nasdaq in exchange for at least a 19 percent share in the New York exchange and Nasdaq’s stake of about 30 percent in the London Stock Exchange, which is valued at about $1.8 billion.Nasdaq has been struggling to get a foothold in Europe and watched as a rival, the NYSE Group, merged with Euronext to form a global exchange company. Stock markets around the world are combining or buying stakes in each other to meet clients’ demands to trade shares of companies anywhere, at a faster pace, across different asset classes and for less money. Combinations also help them save costs in an industry where the largest expense is developing the technology to run trading platforms.But Nasdaq’s efforts to expand have been rebuffed. It bought a 30 percent share in the London Stock Exchange, but its hostile bids to take over the entire London operation were rejected.Then in May, Nasdaq announced that it had reached agreement to buy the OMX Group for $3.7 billion. But in August, Borse Dubai, the parent company of the Dubai International Financial Exchange, which includes the former Dubai Financial Markets, came in with a higher bid.'"

"'07-09-20,'0','NBC makes many of its popular shows available online in streaming media, which means that fans can watch episodes on their computers. Under the new NBC service, called NBC Direct, consumers will be able to download, for no fee, NBC programs like “Heroes,” “The Office” and “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” on the night that they are broadcast and keep them for seven days. They would also be able to subscribe to shows, guaranteeing delivery each week.But the files, which would be downloaded overnight to home computers, would contain commercials that viewers would not be able to skip through. And the file would not be transferable to a disk or to another computer.The files would degrade after the seven-day period and be unwatchable. “Kind of like ‘Mission: Impossible,’ only I don’t think there would be any explosion and smoke,” Mr. Gaspin said.The programs will initially be downloadable only to PCs with the Windows operating system, but NBC said it planned to make the service available to Mac computers and iPods later.In a second phase of the NBC rollout, customers would pay a fee for downloads of episodes that they would then own, and the files would be transferable to other devices. NBC hopes to offer this service by mid-2008, depending on how quickly the company can put in place the secure software necessary to allow payment by credit card.The latter system is what is already available through iTunes.Chris Crotty, an analyst for iSuppli, an independent firm that specializes in analysis of new electronic media, said of the NBC move, “I think it’s a stretch.” He argued that consumers have shown they are extremely happy with the iTunes service and that it would not be attractive to consumers to have to range far and wide over a number of services to find the programs they want to download.“It’s not just a shift from a supermarket to a mom-and-pop story, it’s a shift to one store that only sells bread, another store that only sells dairy products. The consumers have decided they want to get their content from iTunes.”Mr. Crotty said NBC had come across to consumers as “highly greedy” in its dispute with Apple. Apple reported that NBC was insisting it raise the price of some downloads on NBC shows to $4.99 from the $1.99 iTunes charges for all programs.NBC hotly denied that, saying that the disagreement was over what Mr. Gaspin termed the wholesale price that Apple was charging, not the retail price. NBC wanted a better wholesale price for its heavily downloaded shows, like “The Office,” the biggest seller on iTunes.But, Mr. Gaspin said, “piracy was and is our No. 1 priority.” He said that the music industry had been devastated by the free exchange of music, much of it facilitated by iTunes.Apple representatives did not respond to requests for comment last night.Mr. Gaspin said that one important attraction of the NBC service was the option it would offer consumers to receive programs on a temporary basis free, but including commercials, as well as the choice to pay a fee for episodes without commercials and own the programs.NBC hopes to extract significant revenue both ways, though it is not estimating what kind of money the service may generate. Nor did NBC Universal project what the service would cost.Mr. Gaspin noted that none of this meant that NBC was moving away from its traditional model of a nightly schedule of programs supported by advertising. He pointed to sales of television sets, driven by high-definition equipment, which are soaring to levels, he said, that surpass those of the biggest booms in color set sales.""Our research shows that 83 per cent of the viewers would still rather watch on a TV than a PC,"" Mr. Gaspin said. But he acknowledged that the numbers were different for younger viewers, a trend stirring much of the concern about the business’s future.""What we don’t know is if habits will change when people get to their 40s,"" Mr. Gaspin said.But he added, ""I don’t think anyone would argue with the idea that the customer is going to be in control.""'"
"'07-09-20,'0','He was whisked out of the country and has not been charged with any crime, said Peter W. Singer, a Brookings Institution scholar who has written extensively about contractors in Iraq.On Wednesday, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq complained of killings of Iraqis “in cold blood” by American armed contractors. He said Sunday’s shooting was the seventh such case involving Blackwater. Iraq’s government is threatening to throw Blackwater out of the country, a move that would have a striking impact on American operations inside the country.Publicly, the Bush administration has not said how it would respond if the Maliki government tries to carry out its threat to evict Blackwater, but administration officials and executives in the security contracting industry both said Wednesday that they believed that the White House and the State Department would seek to block any move by Iraq to force the company out.The issue is already leading to sharp tensions between the governments, and any effort by the United States to force Iraq to keep Blackwater could make the Maliki government appear to be a weak puppet.For years, government officials and members of Congress have debated what has become in Iraq the most extensive use of private contractors on the battlefield since Renaissance princes hired private armies to fight their battles. The debate flares up after each lethal episode in Iraq, but there has been no agreement on how to police the private soldiers who roam Iraq in the employ of the United States government.Sunday’s shooting, which Iraqi officials have branded “a crime,” has led American authorities to suspend temporarily most uses of private contractors as traveling bodyguards, and it has put the issue of security contractors back on the front burner in Washington.A Blackwater spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday, but in an earlier statement, the company said that its employees “responded legally and appropriately to an attack by armed insurgents.”Several members of Congress and nongovernment analysts said that the oversight of thousands of private military personnel was plainly inadequate and were urging passage of new laws governing contractors, particularly those carrying weapons. The laws governing contractors on the battlefield are vague and rarely enforced. Senators John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, successfully sponsored an amendment to a Pentagon budget bill last year to bring all military contractors in Iraq under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The bill did not include State Department contractors, like the Blackwater gunmen involved in Sunday’s shooting, but Senator Graham said Wednesday that he intended to try to extend its reach to all civilian contractors in Iraq and other war zones. While contractors are not subject to the military code, some argue they could be prosecuted for crimes abroad under civilian law, but in the case of Iraq, that has not been tested.“If we go to war with this number of contractors in the war zone, thousands of them armed, you need application of U.C.M.J. to maintain good order and discipline,” said Senator Graham, who serves in the Air Force Reserve Judge Advocate General Corps.“This is a real gap in discipline,” he added. “These people are on a legal island.”In the House, meanwhile, Rep. John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who is chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, is pushing legislation that would require the secretary of defense to set new personnel standards for contractors and to establish clear rules of engagement for security contractors operating in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. Murtha’s panel noted that “the oversight and administration of contracted security services is woefully inadequate.”Even the trade association representing armed contractors called for new regulations to rein in contractors who abuse Iraqi civilians or violate the terms of their contracts with the United States government. “If you’re going to be outsourcing this much of our war-fighting capability, you have to have appropriate oversight,” said Doug Brooks, president of the International Peace Operations Association, which represents private military contractors including Blackwater.Between 20,000 and 30,000 civilians work for the United States in Iraq as private military contractors, part of a civilian work force that equals or exceeds the more than 160,000-person military force there. The State Department employs about 2,500 private military personnel, chiefly to guard American diplomats and sensitive facilities there. The three prime security contractors for the State Department are Blackwater, DynCorp International and Triple Canopy. Many of their workers are former military Special Forces troops such as Navy Seals and members of the Army’s elite Delta Force.Officials with other security companies said Wednesday that Blackwater now was the dominant contractor for State Department diplomatic security in Iraq, making it all but impossible for the State Department to operate without the company, at least in the short term. For the moment, the military will provide any security needed by the State Department in Iraq. But officials at other firms said that the State Department has in recent weeks awarded Blackwater another major contract, for helicopter-related services, a strong signal of the close relationship between the department and Blackwater.“If all Blackwater personnel had to leave the country, there would be no one to provide security for the diplomatic mission in Baghdad, except the U.S. Army,” said an executive at another security firm, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a competitor. “My guess is that they will try to find a way to work this out. But there is no doubt there is a lot of raw feelings with the Iraqis.”The United States government and the Iraqis on Wednesday formed a joint commission to review the case and propose steps to avoid a repeat. But a State Department official in Washington said Wednesday that it may be difficult to reconstruct the event and assign blame because of the unreliability of witnesses and the difficulty of conducting forensic studies in the midst of a war zone.Tom Casey, a State Department spokesman, said at a briefing for reporters that he could not say what laws might apply to the Blackwater guards who fired until the facts are established.“Until we have results of the investigation and know what facts we’re dealing with and know whether, in fact, any activities that might have violated laws occurred,” Mr. Casey said, “you can’t really deal with the question of who would have specific jurisdiction or how you would resolve issues of competing jurisdiction that might be out there.”'"

"'07-09-20,'0','Mr. Schulman, who will cooperate with prosecutors, also agreed to disgorge $1.85 million in profits, pay a $250,000 fine and accept a likely prison sentence of 27 to 33 months, according to court papers.In announcing the charges against Mr. Weiss, George S. Cardona, the United States attorney in Los Angeles, said, “The indictment outlines a decades-long kickback scheme that was deliberately concealed from courts that were overseeing significant class-action cases.”Last year, prosecutors in Los Angeles initially charged that Milberg Weiss paid $11 million in kickbacks to plaintiffs in more than 150 cases, a strategy that allowed it to beat other firms to the courthouse and earn more than $216 million in fees.The firm, founded in 1972, had announced Wednesday evening that the indictment of Mr. Weiss was expected. “Mr. Weiss has decided to discontinue his participation in firm management in order to focus on the defense of the charges against him,” a Milberg Weiss statement said. “The firm remains proud of Mr. Weiss’s and the firm’s accomplishments over the years.”The indictment of Mr. Weiss comes on the heels of a plea agreement announced on Tuesday between prosecutors and William S. Lerach, another prominent class-action lawyer who once worked at the firm.Another former partner, David J. Bershad, pleaded guilty to conspiracy in July and has also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.The indictment of Mr. Weiss, a co-founder of the firm, coupled with the plea agreement by Mr. Lerach, is the latest twist in the saga of two lawyers who dominated the field of class-action securities litigation for more than a decade. Both men styled themselves as defenders of investors and consumers wronged by corporations; their critics, including defense lawyers and corporate leaders, viewed them as opportunists who turned class-action lawsuits into a big business.The close timing of the plea agreement by Mr. Lerach and the indictment of Mr. Weiss suggested that both men were facing imminent indictment; given their choices, Mr. Lerach opted to cut a deal while Mr. Weiss chose not to for now.The two men, who were allied for so long, split in 2004 after a bitter dispute. Along with the firm, several other individuals have been indicted.Milberg Weiss, the law firm, has maintained its innocence. The trial against the firm was expected to start in January, but with Mr. Weiss’s addition to the case, that proceeding may be delayed.In many ways, the kickback scheme that prosecutors say that Milberg Weiss and its lawyers concocted was simple and effective. To file a class-action lawsuit, a lawyer needs a so-called named plaintiff, or an individual whose name will appear on the initial complaint as a representative of the class. The class could be a group of individuals, like shareholders of the same company.Milberg Weiss, prosecutors say, essentially put named plaintiffs like the ophthalmologist, Dr. Steven G. Cooperman, on retainer and would, through disguised means, pay them 10 percent of any legal fees the firm earned. Having a ready list of named plaintiffs available also meant Milberg Weiss, by getting its cases filed ahead of other firms, could gain control of a case and get a bigger share of the legal fees.Those payments, however, were hidden from judges overseeing the cases.Dr. Cooperman pleaded guilty in July to conspiracy to obstruct justice and make false statements.Milberg Weiss’s ranks have shrunk significantly since the firm came under investigation. In its statement, the firm said that prosecutors had not accused any of the firm’s other current partners of wrongdoing.“We do not anticipate any interruption in our work, and we look forward to putting this difficult period behind us,” the firm said.'"

"'07-09-20,'0','John D. Feerick, the chairman of the Ethics Commission and the expected chairman of the Public Integrity Commission, has declined to explain why he did not pick Mr. Grandeau.The merger has received mixed reviews. Among other things, 7 of the 13 members of the new commission will be selected by the governor, giving him effective control over the body; no single official has such sway over appointees at the two existing commissions. None of the commissioners have been officially nominated, even though the Public Integrity Commission is supposed to open for business next week.The Legislature will still police itself; its own legislative ethics panel, which will be slightly modified under the new structure, has rarely shared information with the public.Though he wanted the job, Mr. Grandeau concedes he might not have lasted.“I know that a commission controlled by the governor’s office at some point would have fired me, because at some point, if you’re doing your job, you’re going to be investigating the executive branch, or the executive branch is going to ask you to do something you’re not comfortable with,” he said.Certainly, going along to get along is not Mr. Grandeau’s forte.He investigated Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver over a discounted stay in a Las Vegas hotel suite that the lawmaker received from Caesars Entertainment, leading Caesars to pay a $25,000 fine to settle the matter.Mr. Grandeau clashed with Gov. Eliot Spitzer on more than one occasion when Mr. Spitzer, as attorney general, had to represent Mr. Grandeau’s agency. “I readily admit I was a very difficult client,” Mr. Grandeau said.And he clashed with his own commissioners over his investigation of Russell Simmons, the hip-hop impresario, who was not registered as a lobbyist when he was advocating in Albany for a softening of Rockefeller-era drug laws.“He was frequently injudicious,” James D. Featherstonhaugh, a well-known lobbyist and lawyer who argued in court on Mr. Simmons’s behalf, said of Mr. Grandeau. “On the other hand, it cannot be argued that he vigorously pursued people he thought were breaking the law in a way no one else had.”Mr. Grandeau, he added, “certainly kept me busy.”Perhaps the most bitter falling-out involving Mr. Grandeau, a lifelong Republican, has been with his onetime patron Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Grandeau came of age under Mr. Bruno’s guidance, first as counsel at the telecommunications company Mr. Bruno founded, the Coradian Corporation. Later, Mr. Bruno was instrumental in his landing jobs as the city manager of Troy, where he had a brief and tempestuous turn as a cost cutter, and at the Lobbying Commission.Mr. Grandeau’s investigatory zeal, however, has left the men no longer on speaking terms.In one of its last acts, the Lobbying Commission issued a preliminary finding that Jared E. Abbruzzese, an Albany-area businessman and longtime friend of Mr. Bruno’s, may have violated state lobbying laws when he provided the senator with flights on a private aircraft. Mr. Abbruzzese is also a central figure in a federal investigation of Mr. Bruno’s outside business interests.Through a spokesman, Mr. Bruno declined to comment for this article. Earlier this year, the senator said of Mr. Grandeau, “He has to make his own judgments on how he leads his life.”“I’m afraid that some people, when they get into a powerful position, that power does things to their capacity and capability to make decisions that are just straightforward and not biased,” he added.Mr. Grandeau, who met his wife because they both once worked for Mr. Bruno, was regretful about his changed relationship with the senator. “People don’t realize how much I got from Senator Bruno, both professionally and personally,” he said. “At the same time, I had a job to do here, and my integrity was important, and I did the job wherever it took me.”A native of Poughkeepsie who earned his law degree at Albany Law School, Mr. Grandeau lives with his wife and two sons in Colonie, where he also coaches Little League.Mr. Grandeau has no illusions about his persona. Where some see him as self-aggrandizing, he sees himself as a by-the-books regulator.“I don’t play within the boundaries, I don’t color within the lines, I don’t believe in playing by anyone else’s rules,” he said.He used a mild epithet to describe himself, then added, “but a fair one.”He has handled his own media relations since his last press officer, who was referred by Mr. Bruno, departed after a memorable blowup a couple of years ago.Mr. Grandeau has also had a prickly relationship with the commissioners he has worked with.“We’ve been at odds a great deal,” said Patrick J. Bulgaro, an appointee of Mr. Silver’s, citing the Simmons case as an example where he thought Mr. Grandeau went too far and risked treading on First Amendment protections. In that case, Mr. Grandeau contended that the amount spent for advocacy efforts like Mr. Simmons’s should be disclosed.Still, Mr. Bulgaro said Mr. Grandeau “raised the profile of lobbying oversight,” and he called his tenure, if “a stormy one,” also “a period of accomplishment.”Andrew G. Celli Jr., another commissioner, said Mr. Grandeau “was fundamentally guided by a sense that transparency was a really important thing in government, but he’s not the only person in the universe that feels that way.”“He certainly had a very proprietary sense of the job and his role in government, and that was often a great motivator to get things done, and sometimes it was a distraction,” added Mr. Celli, who was appointed by Lt. Gov. David A. Paterson, a Democrat, when Mr. Paterson was Senate minority leader.Groups that have pushed for more ethics enforcement in the state are skeptical that others will pick up the baton.“I think it’s extraordinarily unfortunate that the only really good watchdog for the last decade is not going to become part of the new Public Integrity Commission,” said Barbara Bartoletti, legislative director of the League of Women Voters of New York State.“He was an apolitical, which means he was willing to go after whoever it was without regard to party,” she added, “and I’m not sure we’re going to see that again in the new future.”'"
"'07-09-20,'0','WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 — Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked an effort to give terrorism detainees the right to appeal their detention to federal courts, rejecting complaints that a new law denying that option ran against the nation’s principles.Senators voted 56 to 43 to cut off debate on the proposal, 4 votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. The result put an end for now to the legislative effort to reverse a provision in a 2006 antiterror law; the matter is also before the Supreme Court.The proposal, part of a broad Pentagon policy bill, was backed by Senators Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the senior Republican on the committee. The two senators argued that the decision to strip the right of habeas corpus from detainees, including those at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, was a major mistake that merited quick correction.Mr. Leahy dismissed the suggestion that giving detainees access to the federal courts amounted to what critics called a terrorist bill of rights that would put the nation at risk.“The truth is, casting aside the time-honored protection of habeas corpus makes us more vulnerable as a nation because it leads us away from our core American values and calls into question our historic role as a defender of human rights around the world,” Mr. Leahy said.'"
"'07-09-20,'0','Consumer prices dipped slightly in August as energy costs fell, keeping pace with the year’s slowdown in inflation and offering some comfort to Federal Reserve officials after Tuesday’s half-point cut in interest rates.But some analysts, pointing to continuing increases in underlying inflation, warned that the threat of rising prices could return in the months ahead.And while Wall Street remained positive yesterday, with the leading stock indexes recording modest gains, market watchers were divided about whether the Fed would be forced to take inflationary pressures into account as it considers whether to keep cutting rates.The Consumer Price Index, which measures prices at the retail level, fell 0.1 percent in August, a Labor Department report released yesterday showed. Core inflation figures, which exclude food and energy, ticked up 0.2 percent, holding at the same pace as the previous month. A recent surge in crude oil prices to record levels could also increase future inflationary pressure.The core inflation index is up 2.1 percent from a year earlier, and the index as a whole has risen 2 percent since last August.Most analysts seemed relieved that the figures were so benign. “The Fed’s cut yesterday would have been put into a little bit of doubt if you had an upside surprise on this number,” said John Shin, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. Instead, the index came in just ahead of Wall Street forecasts.'"
"'07-09-20,'0','LONDON, Sept. 19 — The Bank of England abruptly reversed its policy on Wednesday of refusing to ease lending standards, offering to inject cash into British money markets amid criticism that it had not done enough to stem a credit squeeze that has undercut its economy.The action came a day after the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions with an aggressive half-point cut in interest rates, a move that buoyed global stock markets but also fanned concern that the United States might still face a notable slowdown.Economists have been trimming their international and national growth forecasts as the global credit squeeze, spawned by a meltdown in the market for subprime loans in the United States, curbs lending and saps consumer confidence.In Britain, the crisis hit abruptly when Northern Rock, a mortgage lender, ran into difficulties last week that threatened to destabilize the wider British banking system.Days earlier, the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, said the bank would not follow the Fed and the European Central Bank by injecting cash into a system where banks had stopped lending because of volatile conditions, saying such moves encouraged risky behavior by banks.'"

At $900 billion in annual revenue, logistics now accounts for some four million jobs nationwide and it is the largest single source of employment in Southern California, accounting for more than 650,000 jobs, according to the economist John Husing of Redlands, Calif., an authority on regional industry.Companies like Weber Distribution have had to invest in new technology. “We handled fewer than 200 containers a month in 2000, and today we handle 2,500 containers a month,” said William H. Butler, Weber’s president and chief executive.In 1999, the company invested heavily in computing and communications systems. In its warehouses, forklift operators now use personal digital assistants to keep track of goods stacked on shelves several stories high. The company “gives clients information about products all the way from factories in China, on ships across the Pacific and through the ports of Los Angeles to final delivery,” Mr. Butler said.Mr. Sada, from Monterrey, is a member of one of Mexico’s most influential business families. He started in the export-import business in the early 1990s using public warehouses in the United States, but said he found the service and information deficient. With three partners, a $100,000 investment and a warehouse management software system, he started Source to help companies like Grupo Bimbo of Mexico City, a large bakery.“I store inventory for them and when they make contact with an American distributor or retailer, I ship their products immediately,” Mr. Sada said. His company now handles shipments from Central America and Colombia, Brazil, Peru and Argentina.“My strategy is simple,” Mr. Sada said. “I open operations near ports of entry — San Diego, Los Angeles, Laredo — and in places of large Latino population.” A distribution center in Atlanta was built because of growing concentrations of Latin American immigrants in the Southeast, Mr. Sada said, and Source Logistics’s next planned distribution center will be in Chicago.CaseStack is opening an office in Fayetteville, Ark., to be near the 1,300 companies that have offices in the area to serve the Wal-Mart Stores headquarters in Bentonville.Mr. Sanker said that because so many products are now made overseas and shipped into the United States, “we must think of ways to reduce costs and fuel consumption.” Shipping some products, he said, “is no longer economical when diesel fuel is $3 a gallon.”CaseStack is working on ways to package goods more efficiently so more products can fit on a single truck, he said, and it is running trucks on biodiesel fuel, which is cheaper in some regions. CaseStack also recently started a Spanish-language Web site to offer logistics help to small businesses owned by Spanish speakers.The logistics business has been growing rapidly but now competitive changes and serious challenges are looming. Large warehouse and trucking companies, like the Saddle Creek Corporation of Lakeland, Fla., and the Kenco Group of Chattanooga, Tenn., are expanding partly by acquiring smaller firms, putting pressure on smaller companies that want to remain independent, said Mr. Butler of Weber Distribution.Global logistics managers, including the C. H. Robinson Company of Eden Prairie, Minn., and Expeditors International of Seattle, are also bringing pressure on smaller firms.The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation’s largest port complex, are also being required by state and local regulators to reduce air pollution from their operations or face a halt to needed expansion. The ports have developed a plan that would sharply reduce air pollution over the next five years even as trade expands.The plan calls for all trucks coming to take cargo from the ports to be replaced or retrofitted with new engines within five years. That involves a trade-off: Many of the 1,000 small independent trucking companies now serving the port will be put out of business and their operations replaced by larger trucking firms with employees approved by port and federal government officials. The ports will help finance the transition through grants and special loan programs.Mr. Husing, the economist who wrote the official analysis of the anti-pollution program, said expenses will rise. But the reduction of vehicle emissions will allow expansion at the port. That will create “well over half a million jobs” in logistics, Mr. Husing estimated in an interview. And logistics, he added, “is everything from wholesale trade, to truck, rail, air and water transportation, to general warehousing.'"
"'07-09-20,'0','An upward tick in the index, Mr. Shin said, “would have put the Fed’s inflation fighting credibility a little more in doubt.”The consumer inflation report followed on the heels of a report on Tuesday of a 1.4 percent drop in prices at the producer level. Analysts said a decline in the cost of goods used to make other goods, known as intermediate goods, signaled that price increases were slowing further up the production chain and that consumers might see some relief as those goods are processed and enter the retail market. Together, the reports suggest to some analysts that inflation worries will not stand in the way of future rate cuts.Investors reacted positively, extending the stock rally that began immediately after the Fed announced its decision. At 12:50 p.m., the Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index was up 0.8 percent to 1,531.81. The Dow Jones industrial average, keeping pace with its 335-point gain from yesterday, was up 94.05 points, or 0.7 percent.Still, the threat of inflation has not dissipated, with some analysts pointing to the 0.2 percent increase in core consumer prices and a similar gain in the core Producer Price Index.“I think it’s a bit of a mistake to assume that the inflation genie has been put back in the bottle,” said Michael T. Darda, chief economist for MKM Partners, a research firm based in Greenwich, Conn.. Mr. Darda argued that this month’s plunge in oil and energy costs have skewed inflation figures, providing a falsely reassuring snapshot of the current retail market.But other observers saw this morning’s report as a sign of stabilization.“There is no clear sign of deceleration in the core,” said Per Gunnar Berglund, a senior economist at Moody’s Economy.com. “We expect it to stabilize around 2 percent going forward.” Referring to personal consumption expenditures, another inflation gauge, he added, “Our take is that the core P.C.E. price will decelerate somewhat further in the coming months and that the core C.P.I. will remain where it is.”Restrained inflation could help ease the effect of the turmoil in the housing and credit markets on the broader economy. While the fallout has been relatively modest so far, some consumers are becoming more cautious. Whether that leads to a modest economic slowdown or a full-blown recession will depend on several variables, primarily employment and consumer spending.Consumer spending was aided by the housing boom, especially in states like California, Florida, Arizona and New York, but there are few signs that the ensuing housing slump will abate soon.The Commerce Department reported today that housing starts and building permits dropped last month, led by a 3 percent slip in single family homes. Those figures fell short of analysts’ expectations. Residential housing projects were down 2.6 percent in August, continuing a downward trend over the last few months.Housing starts, feeling the squeeze from the subprime mortgage meltdown, are down nearly 20 percent over the last year, painting a bleak picture for residential construction sectors.But housing costs, which are heavily weighted by the consumer price report, were virtually unchanged from last month, though household energy and utility prices dropped slightly.Apparel costs fell too, with men and boys’ apparel and footwear recording the biggest dips. Bad news, however, was in store for stylish infants and toddlers looking for bargain buys: their clothing costs rose 0.3 percent.Textbooks, too — along with other educational books and supplies — continue to put a strain on students’ wallets, with costs rising 1.8 percent last month, keeping up with a steep increase of 9.2 percent since last August.Medical care costs also continue to rise, up 0.5 percent for August and recording an annual growth rate of 4.5 percent.'"
"'07-09-20,'0','McCain can run for president as a cheerleader for the surge, while differentiating himself from his major opponents, who don’t like to criticize the commander in chief. Or in other words: I actually was against this war before I was for it.Way back at the beginning, McCain was a charter member of the “Iraqi-people-will-greet-us-as-liberators” club. Then he made his first trip to the war zone in August of 2003, and came back very worried about the way things were going. “If we do not meaningfully improve services and security in Iraq over the next few months, it may be too late,” he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. And after that deadline passed with no plans for sending additional troops, he simply kept grumbling on Sunday morning talk shows and making speeches to the Council on Foreign Relations.Now McCain sees this conflict as a potential “fight for survival,” and at minimum, the only thing standing between the Middle East and “catastrophic consequences and genocide.” If he realized the war was being run so badly, you would really expect a level of dissent somewhat higher than you hear when the issue is, say, inadequate funding for the No Child Left Behind Act. You would figure that McCain would be delivering a passionate speech every single day. Offering amendments that threaten to withdraw funding unless more troops are added. Staging hunger strikes in front of the Washington Monument.Instead, he helped George Bush get re-elected. Introducing the president to a crowd of soldiers in Fort Lewis, Wash., in 2004, McCain reminded the audience that we were in a fight between good and evil. He warned them that if the terrorists got hold of weapons of mass destruction we would all be toast. As far as how things were going, he said: “Like all wars, this one has had its ups and downs.”Yes, in 1775, we had “The British are coming.” In 2004, John McCain tries to jar the nation into facing the harsh reality of what was happening in Iraq with “like all wars, this one has had its ups and downs.”It was not until the president was safely re-elected that McCain announced he had “no confidence” in the secretary of defense. Even then, he declined to call for his resignation. Bush, he said, “can have the team that he wants around him.”A) Disaster if we mess up in IraqB) Rumsfeld is messing up in IraqC) Only Bush can decide to get rid of RumsfeldD) Bush wants to keep RumsfeldAs his own presidential campaign got under way, McCain became more and more outspoken about the disaster that is Donald Rumsfeld. (He must not have received that 25-point memo.) The war was being run by “one of the worst secretaries of defense in history.” But you would have thought that the Pentagon was a separate nation-state, since McCain never seemed to connect the secretary to the man who hired him and protected him.Until McCain IV: The No Surrender Tour, in which the candidate’s Web site lists all the TV interviews in which he dropped the phrase “more boots on the ground” over the last four years.Here’s the great thing about playing the role of Cassandra. We’re not supposed to hold the four years of lost lives, international chaos and missed chances against John McCain because he always knew it was going badly. He said it on “Meet the Press!”And we should trust him about the surge because he was right about the presurge. Or at least potentially right, since there is no way of proving whether the “more boots on the ground” critique was actually an answer, or simply just a way to avoid confronting the fact that everything was a hideous mistake from day one.This is the way you rationalize the Iraqs of the future. And when they don’t go well, remember: I warned you.'"

"'07-09-21,'1','Borse Dubai, the government-controlled exchange, agreed to take a 19.9 percent stake in Nasdaq and buy Nasdaq’s 28 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange. Dubai will in turn bow out of the bidding for OMX, a Stockholm-based equity market operator, ending a six-week bidding war with Nasdaq. Separately, Qatar, which competes with Dubai as a financial center in the Persian Gulf region, bought 20 percent of the London Stock Exchange and about 10 percent of OMX.By buying into Nasdaq, Borse Dubai would gain expertise. For Nasdaq, the deal means that its chief executive, Robert Greifeld, can fulfill his goal of creating a more global stock market. He has failed to combine with the London exchange in the past, while the rival NYSE Group successfully merged with Euronext.Borse Dubai’s chairman, Essa Kazim, said, “Our primary objective is to build a world class, growth-oriented exchange out of Dubai and to become the center for capital markets activities in the emerging markets.”Dubai would get 2 of the 16 board seats once Nasdaq merged with OMX and not more than 5 percent of the voting rights. The deal, which would create a stock market operation from the United States across Europe to the Middle East, is still subject to a long list of conditions, including the national security review, and approval by stockholders of the companies involved.Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and the main author of the recent law, called for an aggressive review of the transaction. Mr. Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, added that as a general matter, he supported foreign investment in the United States that “promotes growth and creates good jobs.”Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, was one of the few members of Congress to raise questions about the national security implications of the deal, though his remarks were not considered as hostile to the deal as his comments on the Dubai ports transaction were.“At this early stage, this deal gives me pause,” Mr. Schumer said. “While I am and have been a big proponent of foreign investment in the United States, we must still be careful of the kinds of investments made in our critical infrastructure, financial exchanges, utilities and other areas that are vital to the operation and security of our country.”In the House, the speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, and Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Financial Services Committee, both said that they were not alarmed by the investment and that it was different from the ports deal.“In the ports deal, the concern was smuggling something or someone dangerous into ports,” Mr. Frank said. “What are we talking about here — smuggling someone onto a stock exchange?”The senior Republican on the committee, Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, also praised the deal.“This is a win-win for both exchanges,” he said. “Nasdaq’s brand is respected worldwide. This is exactly the kind of foreign investment in U.S. companies we should foster and encourage.”The deal was also applauded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who said it was “good news for both New York and the nation.”“This deal will extend Nasdaq’s reach in both Europe and the growing markets of the Middle East and lead to higher regulatory standards in Dubai,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “Like all such deals, this one should undergo all the appropriate scrutiny, but I hope that that discussion does not devolve into the kinds of demagogic attacks that could cost Americans jobs and threaten New York’s place as the financial capital of the world.”The review by the interagency Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States will begin with a 30-day examination of the deal for national security implications. The new law expanded the list of security factors to be considered, although it left many issues to the discretion of the administration. While requiring the committee to review the deal for risks associated with foreign investment in “critical infrastructure,” the law never defines the term.If, after the initial review, the committee finds no problems, then it transmits its conclusions to Congress. But if issues are unresolved, then a second 45-day investigation would be undertaken to give the companies time to address any objections.'"
"'07-09-21,'1','Working dogs are still used to move flocks of sheep. But for the hobbyists, sheep serve a different purpose: “An awful lot of us now only have sheep to entertain our dogs,” said a finalist here, Jack Mathieson, a systems analyst.Grant Colfax, who was home-schooled in Boonville and now works as San Francisco’s director of H.I.V. prevention and research, described the sheepdog trials as “a moment where everything seems to be in balance.” As he stood in front of football bleachers, where more than 1,000 fans cheered the dogs and their handlers at the center of a bowl of bucolic hills, Dr. Colfax said: “It’s what everyone wants America to look like. It’s an illusion we all collectively embrace.”In the 1940s, there were 300,000 sheep in Mendocino County, said John Harper, a livestock and natural resources adviser at the University of California Cooperative Extension at Ukiah. Today, there are no more than 14,000.Americans’ attitude toward lamb changed after 1945, when soldiers overseas, fed partly cooked mutton, became sick and returned home telling their wives, “ ‘Just don’t feed me lamb,’ ” Mr. Harper said.The annual per-capita consumption of lamb has tumbled to one pound today from a high of six pounds in the late ’40s, said Ms. Wortman of the lamb board.Since that era, higher and higher land prices in this region have persuaded many ranchers to sell their acreage, often to grape growers. Those who remain must be innovative to survive.With his three-legged dog, Archie, Bruce Campbell, from Sonoma County, won the state sheepdog trials championship in the mid-1970s, when he owned 2,500 sheep. Today, he has 200.Raising sheep became harder after 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon, in an effort to protect wildlife, banned a poison that had been used to kill coyotes, among the deadliest of sheep predators.Still, Mr. Campbell persevered, selling his lamb to Whole Foods and other markets until they switched to cheaper lamb from New Zealand and Australia, which lack major predators.“For someone not as stubborn as I, that would have been the last lap,” he said. Instead, he has found a niche market, selling lamb without hormones or antibiotics to the acclaimed chef Wolfgang Puck and other clients. Gary and Wanda Johnson, who supplied the sheep for Sunday’s trials, own 200. They had 4,000 in the 1970s, before coyotes destroyed much of their flock and before imported lamb flooded the market in the 1990s.A fourth-generation rancher, Mr. Johnson and his wife, who was 9 when she began competing in sheepdog trials, have full-time jobs to supplement their income.California remains one of the largest producers of lamb, although ranching has shifted to the central and southern parts, where land is flat, fenced and less expensive.But once a year, sheepdog fans in Mendocino County celebrate the past.When Mr. Slaven’s dog Roy failed to urge three sheep through the chute, the crowd sighed. When Roy eyed the sheep backward into the pen, fans roared. “That dog is intimidating the sheep with his eyes,” said an approving Tom Trent, a carpenter and one of the finalists.Besides Mr. Slaven, the only other sheep rancher to compete this year was Gordon Contival, 80, who has so few sheep left that his wife calls him a hobbyist. A third-generation rancher, Mr. Contival survives by selling directly to customers. He said the offspring of his fifth-generation border collie, Kate, will work as herders, but none of his six children have chosen to follow him into the sheep ranching business.'"
"'07-09-21,'1','The two 21-foot pipe sections, once joined with couplings and gaskets to each other and to the two sections at the ends of the missing portion, were apparently then removed from the building, the people said.One of the people said that some portions of pipe were found in the basement, but it was unclear whether any of them were part of the two missing 21-foot sections.Prosecutors from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, who are investigating the fire and the events that led up to it, are still unsure why the long section of pipe was removed and who removed it, according to one person with knowledge of that inquiry.The fire at the former bank headquarters exposed a tangle of missteps and failures at the already troubled project. The deconstruction of the building, which stands beside ground zero as an ugly reminder of the Sept. 11 attack and the slow progress rebuilding Lower Manhattan, has been interrupted by a seemingly endless series of setbacks and mired in politics.The investigation into the removal of the pipe has focused largely on the contractors, construction manager Bovis Lend Lease and its demolition and asbestos abatement subcontractor, the John Galt Corporation.The size of the missing section, and the nature of what would have been involved in cutting or dismantling it, indicated that at least several people were probably involved in its removal and raised questions about how it could have been taken out of the building. A spokesman for Bovis declined to comment. The Galt Corporation has said that it will not comment until the investigation into the fire is completed.But the focus on the pipe is just one aspect of what several people have characterized as a very broad inquiry, examining not only the deaths of the firefighters, but also the actions of inspectors from the Fire and Buildings Departments.Prosecutors are also looking into why the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which owns the building and is overseeing the demolition, allowed Bovis to hire Galt, a company with little demolition experience and ties to a company under scrutiny by city investigators, for the enormously complex job.The pieces of pipe recovered in the basement after the fire and the remaining portions of the standpipe that were adjacent to the missing sections were sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation lab in Quantico, Va., for analysis. No official findings have yet been provided to prosecutors.The standpipe would have carried water pumped in from a hydrant by a fire truck to the pipe that rises to valves on each floor, where firefighters could connect a hose and draw water.One theory about why the pipe was removed was based on a makeshift hoist that had been built beneath where the missing length of pipe had been.One person who has been briefed on the case said the hoist was set up to lower material into the subbasement. Under the theory, the person said, the section of pipe was removed to make room for the hoist.The size of the missing section makes an early theory about the removal seem less plausible. Investigators had theorized that workers had used the standpipe to run a compressed air hose up from the basement to the upper floors to power heavy equipment, a practice that some construction experts said was not uncommon.Since the fire, various reports have described the missing section of pipe as having been a chunk, a section and in one instance, a 20-foot length, but nothing as long as 42 feet.'"
"'07-09-21,'1','Norman G. Gaylord, a versatile industrial chemist who helped develop a safe and permeable material for hard contact lenses that allowed oxygen to reach the eye, thus avoiding a common lens problem, died Tuesday in Boynton Beach, Fla. He was 84.Dr. Gaylord’s death was confirmed by his family.Working with a New York optometrist, Dr. Leonard Seidner, in the 1970s, Dr. Gaylord experimented with various materials in an effort to prevent corneal edema, a condition that occurred in some contact lens wearers. When lenses stayed in place for long periods, earlier acrylic materials sometimes blocked the passage of oxygen to the cornea, leading to blurred vision, swelling of the eyes and even nerve damage.Dr. Gaylord developed a rigid material, siloxane-methacrylate, that was both permeable and suited to the production of lenses. He was awarded two patents; with Dr. Seidner, he marketed the material as Polycon for lenses that were intended to be worn all day and then removed for cleaning at night. After the material was shown to be reliable and safe, it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1979.Joseph C. Salamone, a polymer chemist and former vice president of research for Bausch & Lomb, said that Dr. Gaylord’s experiments had been “critical to the development of novel materials, and through them he became a pioneer at the beginning of a new field.”Siloxane-methacrylate, Dr. Salamone said, has since been superseded by lens materials that are even more permeable. And soft materials called hydrogels and silicone hydrogels now allow some contact lenses to be worn for up to a month.From the Gaylord Research Institute, his laboratory in New Providence, N.J., Dr. Gaylord also worked on rubbers and resins, films and fabrics for industrial and commercial applications.'"
"'07-09-21,'1','Microsoft’s resounding defeat in a European antitrust case establishes welcome principles that should be adopted in the United States as guideposts for the future development of the information economy.The court agreed with European regulators that Microsoft had abused its operating system monopoly by incorporating its Media Player, which plays music and films, into Windows. That shut out rivals, like RealPlayer. The decision sets a sound precedent that companies may not leverage their dominance in one market (the operating system) to extend it into new ones (the player).The court also agreed that Microsoft should provide rival software companies the information they need to make their products work with Microsoft’s server software. That establishes the welcome principle of interoperability, which should spur innovation in the future.Microsoft’s near-monopoly can hurt consumers in two big ways: allowing the company to charge more for its software and potentially stifling innovation by rivals, who might stay out of a market from fear of being demolished by the dominant player. Microsoft should not be allowed to use the bundling of its products to bury RealPlayer and other companies, just as it was convicted of doing to Netscape’s Navigator.In applying these principles, of course, regulators must be careful not to stifle innovation — including innovation by market-dominating forces like Microsoft. The principles contained in the European court decision should not be used to hamstring Microsoft and other big technology firms from simply adding features to their software, because that would harm consumers, too.The court’s decision is likely to have a profound impact on technology industries, emboldening European regulators in antitrust fights against other companies, including Apple, over its dominance of the music download market, and Intel, over its virtual control over the microchip industry.The court’s decision puts Europe at the cutting edge of technology regulation. Considering the global nature of the technology industry, the principles set in Europe could set the bar for products developed and sold around the world. The scrutiny of regulators appears to have already produced some positive results. Responding to complaints by Google that it would use the search box in its new version of Internet Explorer to steer users toward the MSN search engine, Microsoft made it fairly easy for consumers to choose which search engine to use with the feature.'"
"'07-09-21,'1','One student, Mychal Bell, 17, was convicted in June of aggravated battery and conspiracy. Those charges were voided by appeals courts, most recently last Friday. Mr. Bell has not been released from jail.Even as demonstrators marched in Jena, which is 85 percent white, an appellate court ordered an emergency hearing to determine why Mr. Bell had not been released.Mr. Bell is the sole student who has had a trial. Amid pressure from critics, prosecutors have gradually scaled back many charges against the other five.Although the starting incident occurred about a year ago, the case has been slow to join the national conversation. After Mr. Bell’s conviction, though, the details spread quickly on the Internet, text messaging and black talk radio.The case has drawn the attention of President Bush, who said to reporters in Washington on Thursday, “Events in Louisiana have saddened me.”“I understand the emotions,” Mr. Bush said. “The Justice Department and the F.B.I. are monitoring the situation down there, and all of us in America want there to be fairness when it comes to justice.”Students, particularly those at historically black colleges, have also had a pivotal role in spreading the details. They poured into town after all-night bus rides. Many said they were happy to pick up the torch of the civil rights struggle.“This is the first time something like this has happened for our generation,” said Eric Depradine, 24, a senior at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. “You always heard about it from history books and relatives. This is a chance to experience it for ourselves.”A sophomore schoolmate, Charley Caldwell Jr., 22, said he was moved to attend the rally by the details of the case.“When I first heard about it,” Mr. Caldwell said, “I thought it was obscene. So I felt I had to come. When we got here, there’s nothing but white people, and they aren’t used to seeing this many people of color.”The case also resonates for people not in college.April Jones, 17, who traveled from Atlanta, with her parents, Diana and Derrick, said she saw the problem as one of basic fairness. Ms. Jones could not understand why the students who hung the nooses were not punished severely.The students were briefly suspended. District Attorney J. Reed Walters said Wednesday that the action did not appear to violate any state laws.“I just feel like every time the white people did something,” Ms. Jones said, “they dropped it, and every time the black people did something, they blew it out of proportion.”Mr. Walters sharply criticized the nooses on Wednesday, saying: “I cannot overemphasize what a villainous act that was. The people that did it should be ashamed of what they unleashed on this town.”A marcher, Latese Brown, 40, of Alexandria, said, “If you can figure out how to make a school yard fight into an attempted murder charge, I’m sure you can figure out how to make stringing nooses into a hate crime.”'"
"'07-09-21,'1','Prosecutors in a federal case involving questionable tax shelters have asked the judge to determine whether two defense lawyers had conflicts of interest and should be removed.The prosecutors say that two defense lawyers may have given advice to a defendant, David Amir Makov, who recently agreed to enter a guilty plea and become a witness for the government.The two lawyers, Steve Bauer and David Scheper, represent two former colleagues of Mr. Makov. At issue is the possibility that they could be forced to turn over confidential details of their comments in meetings with Mr. Makov. Mr. Bauer and Mr. Scheper could be required to testify, or in the extreme, be disqualified.Prosecutors asked Judge Lewis A. Kaplan at a hearing yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan to determine whether a conflict of interest existed and whether a rule known as the crime-fraud exception, which is normally reserved for drug dealers and gangsters, should be used to force Mr. Bauer and Mr. Scheper to disclose the contents of the meetings. The judge is expected to rule on the motion before the trial, which is scheduled to begin Oct. 16.At yesterday’s hearing, Judge Kaplan also declined to postpone the trial to give defense lawyers more time. “That’s not flying,” he said.'"
"'07-09-21,'1','“I was actually reading somewhere, a roundup of the matches, that makes it sound like all the matches are the same,” Patrick McEnroe, the captain of the United States team, said in a telephone interview. “But therein lies the issue with the Davis Cup and the I.T.F.”On the official Davis Cup Web site, the first three articles on the home page late Wednesday had nothing to do with the semifinals.Much of this is because of Federer. For three seasons, he put the Davis Cup on the back burner, declining to play the opening round and then emerging in September, after another sweep of Wimbledon and the United States Open, to save Switzerland’s place in the World Group.Records show that he has participated in the Cup each year since 1999, but the reality is that it is now low on his priority list. It is hard to quibble with his logic considering that the three years in which he has downgraded the Cup are the years in which he won 8 of his 12 major titles and compiled a 225-15 overall record.Francesco Ricci Bitti, the Italian who is president of the International Tennis Federation, believes that Federer needs a Davis Cup in his trophy case to make his career complete.But Federer does not seem too worried about his legacy. How many people outside of Russia and Argentina recall that Marat Safin won the decisive match in last year’s Davis Cup final between Russia and Argentina in Moscow?The Cup still generates pockets of passion, as was evident when Croatia won its first title in 2005, and it will be evident when Djokovic takes the court in Belgrade and tries to put Serbia in the World Group for the first time since Yugoslavia broke apart.But what it does not generate is a global sports moment, one that transcends the borders involved. McEnroe would like to see a hybrid approach, where the early rounds are played with the current home-and-away model and the final rounds bring together several teams at one site.No overhaul is imminent, only tinkering intended to accommodate the men’s Tour and its top players, who have requested that the four Davis Cup weeks come immediately after big individual events like the Australian Open. After initially refusing, the I.T.F. is budging.“You have to accept many compromises in the tennis calendar and have to go forward,” Ricci Bitti said in a telephone interview from Moscow. “There are now some opportunities for the players and ATP to have bigger tournaments in terms of prize money and location and the opening of Asian markets. ”As negotiations continue, so does the hunt for this year’s Cup. For now, the Americans appear in the best position to win, which would be their first title after an unprecedented 12-year drought. They have top eight singles players in Andy Roddick and James Blake and the world’s top doubles team in Bob and Mike Bryan. Just as important, they have the unusual luxury of playing on the road in the semifinals on a fast surface instead of the usual anti-American clay.Though the fast court plays to American strengths, the site of the court — the Scandinavium — does not. It has already been the site of three Swedish upsets of the Americans: in the 1984 final, the 1994 semifinals and the 1997 final. With Robin Soderling, Sweden’s top singles player, out with an injury, the team captain Mats Wilander has Thomas Johansson, the doubles team of Jonas Bjorkman and Simon Aspelin and one large wild card in the huge-serving Joachim Johansson, who has missed most of the last two seasons with injuries.Though best-of-five sets sound like a stretch at this stage, Joachim Johansson was picked by Wilander to open against Roddick on Friday.In Moscow, where the Russian women just won the Fed Cup, the Russian men will be favored to get past Germany on indoor clay.But one Russian the Germans will not need to worry about is Safin, who withdrew from consideration citing an injured left wrist that is apparently not bothersome enough to keep him from attempting to climb the world’s sixth highest mountain, Cho Oyu in the Himalayas.“I think it’s fitting with the character of Marat; I’m not surprised by anything,” Ricci Bitti said. “He has perhaps to get away from tennis sometimes, and this is far away.”'"
"'07-09-21,'1','Mr. Novy, who owns a moving business, whiles away much of the weekend in a rowboat, smoking a cigar and fishing for bass. Ms. Novy, an instructor in an X-ray technician school, says she is content “talking to the rocks” and otherwise communing with nature.Come evening, she said, they “say good night to the world” by breaking open a bottle of red wine on their dock and watching the beavers build dams.The Yasgur dairy farm today forms the backdrop for the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, which opened in 2006. A sprawling complex, the center has parking for 10,000 cars and this summer featured performers like Bob Dylan, the country singer Brad Paisley and Little Anthony and the Imperials.Prompted by an “onslaught of new development proposals” in the last year, partly spurred by the performing arts center, said Harold Russell, the town supervisor, Bethel has placed a temporary moratorium on subdivisions over five lots. “We’re a small town that needs to catch our breath,” he said.Part-time residents like Eileen Grossman, a retired United Airlines flight attendant who owns a second home there with her husband, Stephen Rubin, a lawyer, said that when going out for dinner or an evening’s entertainment, she rarely puts on more than blue jeans, a T-shirt and lipstick.Residents of Scarsdale, N.Y., Ms. Grossman and Mr. Rubin are now empty nesters. Several years ago, anticipating visits from children and grandchildren, Ms. Grossman said, they built a rustic one-story, four-bedroom, six-bathroom house with four fireplaces on five acres in Chapin Estate. Chapin is Bethel’s most upscale community, and its 2,500 acres sit on the Toronto and Swinging Bridge Reservoirs, where swimming and boating are allowed.Blending farmland with new residential and commercial development, Bethel is also home to the Sullivan County airport on a 600-acre hilltop five miles from Monticello, and the Sullivan County Industrial Park, a 750-acre site owned by the county and its industrial development agency. Monticello Gaming & Raceway, which has year-round harness racing and video gaming machines, is in the neighboring town of Thompson.In addition to playing host to children and friends, Ms. Grossman and Mr. Rubin spend long weekends exploring on foot, monitoring the progress of bald eagles that have similarly nested in Bethel and are awaiting the arrival of future generations. At night, they share dinners with other second-home owners or visit the Bradstan Country Hotel, for cabaret entertainment.Many houses are clustered around lakes and have spectacular views. Sullivan County’s many waterways — Lake Superior, Toronto Reservoir, White Lake, Silver Lake, Sicans Pond, Chestnut Ridge Pond, Woods Pond and Filippini Pond — offer a broad range of fishing and boating. In addition, Bethel is just 20 miles from the Delaware River.Carolyn Ledwith, who owns a second home in Bethel with her husband, Henry Sladek, said she has had to stock up at a supermarket in Monticello on her way to their weekend house near Lake Superior. As the summer population has grown, though, new shops and restaurants, like Benji & Jakes, which specializes in brick-oven pizzas, have sprung up near old standbys like the Front Porch Cafe. And don’t expect to get anywhere fast; those back roads wind endlessly through the countryside.The region offers a wide range of prices for second-home buyers.Ms. Ledwith, who runs a cleaning service in Manhattan, and Mr. Sladek, an emergency preparedness officer for the Justice Department, were cramped in their New York studio apartment. Unable to afford a larger home in Manhattan, they bought a three-bedroom, one-bathroom Cape on an acre near Lake Superior State Park in Bethel three years ago for about $150,000 that’s now worth $200,000, according to Darren Wiseman, an agent at McKean Real Estate in White Lake.The houses where Ms. Grossman and Mr. Rubin live represent the market’s high end. At the gated Chapin Estate, houses start at 2,000 square feet and reach as high as 15,000. The average 4,000-square-foot house would cost about $1 million, not including the land, said Scott Samuelson, director of sales for Chapin Estate. Along the water, a five-acre lot might sell for $600,000 and an eight-acre lot for $1.3 million. In July, a five-acre lot sold for $800,000. “Our market includes buyers who might have been attracted to the Adirondacks,” Mr. Samuelson said, “but don’t want to travel that far to their second home.”At Black Lake Estates, a three-bedroom house with three bathrooms on five lakefront acres recently sold for $925,000, said Linda McKean, an owner of McKean Real Estate. It was on the market for five months. In other lake communities, many cabins are being torn down and replaced with larger, year-round houses. “But anything going for under $150,000,” she said, “would be a seasonal home or a handyman special.”POPULATION 4,522, according to a 2006 estimate by the Census Bureau.SIZE 90 square miles, according to the Census.LOCATION The Bethel area is just under 100 miles northwest of New York City.WHO’S BUYING “Lots of empty nesters from Manhattan, New Jersey, Long Island, Connecticut and Westchester,” said Linda McKean, a broker at McKean Realty in White Lake, one of Bethel’s hamlets.GETTING THERE The trip from Manhattan takes about two hours. Connect to Interstate 87 north and take Exit 16 (Harriman), then follow Route 17 west. Just past the center of Monticello, take Route 17B and continue west into the Bethel area.WHILE YOU’RE LOOKING Bradstan Country Hotel (1561 Route 17B, White Lake; 845-583-4114; www.bradstancountryhotel.com) has rooms, suites and cottages for $175 to $200 a night from June through October and $140 to $165 the rest of the year.'"

"'07-09-22,'0','The proposed trust would be financed primarily with cash and some G.M. stock, these people said. But it is not likely to contain contributions from G.M.’s pension plan, even though the plan is overfunded, they added.The total amount, expected to be in the tens of billions of dollars, will be calculated after bargaining on other issues is finished, these people said.“Every little percentage, every dollar is really more meaningful, because they’re really very close,” said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.Such voluntary trusts are funded at a discount to the liability, with investments generally ranging from 50 to 70 percent. The greater the funding, the less risk the union faces.The U.A.W.’s president, Ron Gettelfinger, is said to have been hesitant to agree to fund the trust with stock or pension assets. For one thing, they are riskier than cash, and G.M. cannot guarantee how its shares or pension investments will perform over decades.For another, G.M. workers, whose approval is necessary, might easily balk at the idea of anything that puts a portion of their medical benefits in jeopardy. Indeed, some union members have already stressed that point in arguing against the trust.But a trust would be protected in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, unlike pensions, which can be terminated and replaced with less expensive plans.G.M.’s contract with the U.A.W. expired a week ago and has been extended hour by hour as talks continue. That gives the union the leverage to call a strike at a moment’s notice, a threat that has been made several times during what has been described as an often emotional week of talks.On Sunday, for example, U.A.W. negotiators seemed close to declaring an impasse, which could have led to a walkout.“We are pushing to accelerate the negotiating pace at all levels,” Mr. Gettelfinger and a union vice president, Cal Rapson, said in a memo sent Friday to union locals at G.M. “It is our desire to reach an agreement without a strike, and we have demonstrated this by staying at the bargaining table up to this point.”The Detroit Free Press reported on the memo in Saturday’s editions.Contracts at Ford Motor and Chrysler have been extended indefinitely. Negotiators have continued to talk there, but agreements are unlikely to be reached until the G.M. talks conclude.The lack of a deal at G.M. has made some workers anxious, prompting leaders at union locals to issue a series of updates during the week. “Be patient and keep the faith,” read a notice on the Web site of Local 1714 in Lordstown, Ohio.G.M. and Ford have pushed hardest for the creation of voluntary trusts, which would assume responsibility for health care benefits for current and retired workers and their families. Collectively, the Detroit automakers have a health care liability of nearly $100 billion.But G.M.’s version of the voluntary trust, known sometimes by its acronym, VEBA, cannot be determined until the two sides complete bargaining on other major issues, especially the number of jobs that G.M. will keep in the United States.Mr. Gettelfinger was said to be demanding that G.M. protect all the hourly positions left in the United States after the company completes its overhaul next year.“The U.A.W. is saying, ‘If you want the VEBA, there has to be a quid pro quo involved,” Professor Chaison said.G.M. is in the midst of cutting 30,000 jobs and closing all or part of a dozen plants though 2008. In theory, that is much easier for G.M. to do than in the past, since its work force is less than a quarter of the 320,000 workers the company had in 1990.Any such job guarantees would cost the company billions of dollars, however, meaning less money that could go into a trust for health benefits.And G.M. is rapidly expanding its operations outside the United States, and now sells more cars and trucks abroad than in North America, long its biggest market. The company could conceivably ship cars from plants in China, Brazil and Europe, where it is producing a number of models for its Saturn division.Still, the health care trust would give G.M. more secure financial footing, as union leaders know, Professor Chaison said. “The concept of a VEBA is a huge savings for the company and a huge escape from risk,” he said. “But General Motors found out that you can’t get that for free.”'"
"'07-09-22,'0','Roger Clemens’s body pushed back, as he likes to say, and Clemens will miss another start because of it.After the Yankees’ 5-4 loss to Toronto in 14 innings on Friday, Yankees Manager Joe Torre said Clemens would not start as scheduled today because of a problem with his left hamstring. Clemens has also missed starts this season because of groin and elbow injuries.“We’re just taking the safe route and giving him a couple of extra days,” Torre said. “It’s a situation where the off-day we’ve had will help.”Torre can easily manipulate the rotation because of Thursday’s day off, meaning Phil Hughes will start today and Mike Mussina tomorrow with normal rest. But while Torre said that Clemens would pitch Monday, the pitching coach Ron Guidry said those plans were only tentative.Guidry said that Clemens felt a tweak in his hamstring while running on Thursday. He felt discomfort when throwing before yesterday’s game and reported the problem to Guidry, who told him not to pitch today.'"

"'07-09-22,'0','Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. cautioned lawmakers this week about the pitfalls in one of Congress’s key proposals to help defaulting homeowners.Several lawmakers want to temporarily expand Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big government-sponsored housing agencies, to allow for more mortgage lending and refinancings for homeowners facing foreclosure. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson expressed concern that the economy could be harmed if the agencies took on too much risk and then, by some calamity, needed a government bailout. Any larger role, they warned, would have to be accompanied by clear rules and strict oversight.We support expanding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and don’t have a problem with carefully regulating their activities. What is unacceptable is that neither Mr. Bernanke nor Mr. Paulson has called for new rules to constrain excessive risk-taking in the financial markets — activities like creating and selling securities backed by utterly reckless loans — even though those risks have greatly contributed to the markets’ instability and have repeatedly required government intervention.The worthy goal of the Fed’s recent interventions — including this week’s half a percentage point interest rate cut — is to prevent disruptions in the financial markets from harming the broader economy. But they come with considerable risk. The rate cut, for instance, could backfire, unleashing inflation for reasons not entirely within the Fed’s control.When it comes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the presumed government backing is called an “implicit guarantee.” On Wall Street, it has many names — ex-post insurance, a Greenspan put, or now, a Bernanke put. Whatever you call it, its existence demands that markets be subject to adequate rules and oversight.That’s clearly not the case at present. Hedge funds and private equity firms, which are allowed to operate largely in secret, need to be subject to more official scrutiny so that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have a grasp of their activities before big problems occur and so that investors affected by their actions can better assess the risks they’re taking. Regulators must develop and coordinate a system for staying on top of the overlapping instruments and transactions that fuel market activity.Currently, regulators can’t even decide if the derivatives at the heart of so much of today’s instability are securities, which would fall under the purview of the securities’ regulators, or futures contracts, the purview of commodities’ regulators.'"
"'07-09-22,'0','“The Anglican Communion is at a crossroads,” said Bishop Robert Duncan of Pittsburgh, who leads a network of conservative bishops, some of whom are considering breaking with the Episcopal Church. “Anybody who denies that is in denial of the crisis the communion is in.”The dispute over homosexuality began when the Episcopal Church consecrated an openly gay man, V. Gene Robinson, as bishop of New Hampshire in 2003.The Episcopal Church now urges, but does not require, dioceses and bishops to refrain from electing openly gay and lesbian bishops, and none have been elected since Bishop Robinson. The church does not have rites of blessing for same-sex unions, but some bishops permit blessing ceremonies in their dioceses.Conservatives in the Episcopal Church and the worldwide communion of 77 million members said that the Episcopal Church’s stance violated traditional biblical teachings on sexuality and have asked the church to repent.At a February meeting in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, three dozen primates of the Anglican Communion issued the directive on gay bishops and same-sex unions. They also demanded that the Episcopal Church create a parallel leadership structure to serve the conservative minority of Episcopalians who oppose their church’s stance on homosexuality. In March, Episcopal bishops rejected that proposal, saying it would compromise the church’s autonomy.At the time, the Episcopal bishops sent an urgent invitation to the archbishop of Canterbury to meet with them in New Orleans.At the news conference on Friday, Archbishop Williams said that other Anglican leaders who attended this week’s meetings would be “reading and digesting what the bishops have to say” and would share their opinions with him next week. He said he would also talk to primates and others in the coming weeks before giving his own opinion about what to do next.After years of discussion, some Episcopal and Anglican leaders seem to have reconciled themselves to the fact that some kind of break within the Episcopal Church or the greater communion is inevitable. If several months ago a sizable number of bishops would have argued for the unity of the communion at almost any cost, far fewer would do so now, several bishops said.Bishops also said that while the conversation this week was respectful, they felt disappointed it was so brief. And they said the archbishop and other Anglican leaders had failed to grasp and respect how the Episcopal Church was governed. Other provinces are much more hierarchical and bishops can legislate church policy, they said. Episcopal bishops assert that they cannot govern without the votes of clergy members and lay people, too.One bishop who spoke on condition of anonymity said, “What was said to us was, ‘All this talk of laity aside, if you acted like a real bishop, what would you do?’ ”On Monday and Tuesday, the bishops will fashion their response to the Dar es Salaam directive, and most expect the response to be an affirmation of the status quo.“My expectation will be that the bishops will say that the proper authorities of our church have already spoken,” said Bishop Stacy F. Sauls of the diocese of Lexington, Ky. “But I don’t expect after it a hammer coming down on us from others in the communion.”'"
"'07-09-22,'0','Artists frequently dislike the descriptions assigned to their work. The term minimalist irked some composers, and the Impressionist painters called themselves by another name.The modernist composer Charles Wuorinen has disputed the label “difficult,” which is invariably assigned, alongside “thorny” and “serial,” to much of his music.Difficulty, of course, is in the ear of the beholder, and many might indeed find Mr. Wuorinen’s “Iridule” challenging. The work received its world premiere Thursday by the admirable New Millennium Ensemble at Symphony Space.Ceaselessly prolific at 69 (“Iridule” was the first of seven premieres scheduled this season), Mr. Wuorinen continues to use an uncompromising and, yes, thorny language.But “Iridule,” inspired by a passage from Nabokov’s “Pale Fire,” is more colorful and communicative than some of his sterner earlier works. There are snatches of jaunty melody in the oboe over a rhythmically vibrant tapestry of jagged fragments from the other six instruments: flute, bass clarinet, violin, cello, vibraphone/marimba and piano. The oboist Jacqueline Leclair, a guest soloist, played with finesse and flair.'"

Pervez Musharraf, promoted a close ally to the important post of intelligence chief on Friday, shoring up his power base as he prepares to run for another term as president and possibly to resign from his position as army chief in the coming weeks.Nadeem Taj was appointed director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan’s main intelligence agency. He was one of six major generals promoted to lieutenant general. Two more appointments, to the senior positions of vice chief of army staff and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are expected in coming days.The appointment of General Taj is being received here as a clear indication that General Musharraf is moving to ensure that his allies hold the positions of power when and if he relinquishes his post of chief of army staff. General Taj most recently was the chief of military intelligence and is seen as one of General Musharraf’s most trusted allies.Maj. Gen. Mohsin Kamal was installed as commander of the 10th Army Corps, considered one of the most important positions in the army because it commands troops based just south of the capital, Islamabad, near army headquarters in Rawalpindi.The promotions of General Taj and General Kamal appear to open the way for the current intelligence chief, Lt. Gen. Ashfaq Kiyani, and the 10th Army Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Tariq Majeed, to move into the top two posts in the army when the current holders retire Oct. 7.General Musharraf, 64, has said he will resign his military post if elected to another term as president in balloting by the national and provincial assemblies on Oct. 6.

"'07-09-23,'0','It remained unclear how the two soldiers became separated from the Afghans.Gen. Ali Khan Hussainzada, chief of criminal investigations in western Afghanistan for the Afghan police, said that the interpreter was safe, but that he had no information about the driver.If the soldiers fell into the hands of the Taliban, it would be a significant propaganda coup for the insurgency, which is seeking to drive all foreign troops out of Afghanistan and topple the government in Kabul. While the Taliban has kidnapped numerous foreign civilians in Afghanistan, the group has apparently never captured a member of a Western military force, at least since its resurgence began last year.The Taliban has been most active in the east and south of the country, though it has conducted sporadic attacks in other regions. In western Afghanistan, the Taliban has been most active in the Shindand district of Herat and in the adjoining province of Farah. About half of the roughly 2000 Italian forces in Afghanistan are stationed in Herat, the Italian diplomat said.In Kabul, NATO officials said they were investigating a possible case of mistaken identity in the deaths of four suspected insurgents and the wounding of 12 others early Saturday afternoon in the Sarkani district of Kunar province.According to the NATO command here, helicopter gunships responding to a rocket attack on an Afghan military base fired on a group of about 30 men thought to be insurgents, killing 4 and wounding 12.A NATO statement said “initial reports” indicated that the victims were Afghan police officers and road construction security guards “who were dressed in civilian attire and carrying weapons on an uncoordinated patrol in the area.”The Afghan government and NATO were trying to determine the “official status of the engaged forces,” the statement said.The rising number of civilian casualties this year, most caused by aerial bombardments, has angered Afghans, driven a wedge between members of the coalition over differences in military tactics and eroded public support for the administration of President Hamid Karzai.A NATO service member was killed today in eastern Afghanistan, the military reported, offering no further details. It was at least the third death among allied forces in Afghanistan in the last four days.In the southern province of Zabul, the Taliban kidnapped three Afghan men accused of spying for the United States and executed them, said Wazir Khan, the police chief of Shamulzayi district, according to The Associated Press. One of the victims was beheaded and the other two were shot dead, The A.P. reported.'"

Mr. Case declined to be interviewed.In the private meetings with neighbors, business owners and elected officials, Canopy unveiled plans for a gated community that would include a 100-room hotel and spa and 100 to 300 custom vacation homes starting at $1 million. Mr. Horton described it as “a deep green health- and wellness-focused resort community.”Some here said that is what Rosendale needed to increase its tax base, add jobs and prompt a revival.“I think it would be good,” said Robert Gallagher, the town supervisor. “It would change Rosendale to some degree. You haven’t had that type of clientele in town in some time, since the hotel’s heyday, and this will bring that back to Rosendale. There will be an increase in traffic.”But many do not agree. Main Street is dotted with blue signs advertising www.friendsofwilliamslake.org, the Web site of an opposition group. The group, and others in town, worry about losing access to three lakes that have always been privately owned but open to local residents who pay $450 for annual beach club memberships. Hiking and cross-country skiing trails have also been available for a $12 day fee.Some are also concerned about the development’s environmental impact on sensitive land, including more than 400 acres protected under a conservation easement. And some wonder about the social impact of a gated community with potentially high-profile residents and guests, like Ms. Winfrey.“I’m hoping this project goes somewhere else,” said Mark Morgenstern, co-owner of the Rosendale Cafe on Main Street, who moved here with his family in the late 1980s. “As a business owner and resident of Rosendale, I think it’s a bad idea.”He described himself as philosophically opposed to gated communities.“Maybe a smattering of their guests will come and check out the town, like some kind of theme park, but I don’t think they’ll come down here and have a veggie burger after their spa treatments,” Mr. Morgenstern said. “They’re most likely going to have their own cuisine, on site. And if they do make an outing, they’re going to go to the best restaurants, in Rhinebeck or Woodstock, or to the Depuy Canal House in High Falls.”Mr. Horton said Canopy would reroute part of the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail, which goes through the property, to give the community access. He also said the company would talk to county officials about making other recreational areas public.Other developers, including those proposing similar projects described as environmentally friendly, have either withdrawn local proposals or changed them when confronted with opposition.In August, a group called Preserve Marbletown persuaded the owner of the 147-acre Stone Ridge Orchard to scrap plans for a 350-unit housing development. The plan was to feature “ecological agriculture” and “green building and clean energy technologies,” according to the Web site www.marbletowngreen.com. It also would have led to the tearing down of most of the trees.“If they’re taking down an active orchard, how green can it be?” said Manna Jo Greene, a Rosendale councilwoman and the environmental action director for Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, an environmental group.This month, Crossroads Ventures L.L.C. agreed to scale back plans for the Belleayre Resort at Catskill Park in Highmount after an eight-year standoff. Crossroads cut the project size and agreed to use organic methods to maintain a golf course.Many Friends of Williams Lake members hope that Canopy will go elsewhere and that Williams Lake can become a public space, like the nearby Mohonk Preserve and Minnewaska State Park.Nancy Schniedewind, a member of the group’s steering committee, likened the advocacy movement to one in the early 1980s that discouraged Marriott from purchasing Lake Minnewaska. The lake and surrounding mountains were purchased by private foundations, which made an arrangement with the state to maintain the area.“Some people will say making it public means a loss of taxes and revenue,” Ms. Schniedewind said. “But Mohonk Preserve did a very intense study that found that open space and state parks bring a great deal of money to local economies.”But not everyone wants Canopy to abandon its mission.Ms. Peck’s brother, a lawyer named Edward Williams, is among those opposed to the initial plans. But he said he hoped developers would come up with something smaller and more sensitive to the environment. He has refused to sell his private cabin and 1.79-acre parcel on Williams Lake. “I am not opposed to Canopy buying the property,” Mr. Williams said. “I am opposed to some of its preliminary plans, as recently disclosed to me, and Canopy’s lack of sensitivity to the local townspeople, particularly the former Williams Lake Beach Club members.”After the Williams Lake Resort was shuttered in June, club members offered to pay for insurance and lifeguards but were turned away. Mr. Williams and others oppose plans to create beaches on wetlands.“Such a development of Williams Lake would forever destroy and, in effect, smother the present peaceful and environmentally sensitive character of this small lake,” he said.While downsizing worked for the Belleayre Resort at Catskill Park, it is not clear if Canopy officials are open to that — or to a lengthy wait for approval from the Planning Board and the state.“We’ve had a dozen meetings with people, and we’ll probably have a dozen more before the end of the fall,” Mr. Horton said. “We’re trying to weigh the concerns and needs of all those stakeholder groups. We don’t want this to take a very long time. If we can’t come to a meeting of the minds about what is economically possible and what the community wants, then there won’t be a project.”'"
"'07-09-23,'0','And Senator John McCain’s campaign, short on cash, is weighing whether to accept federal matching funds, which would limit what it can spend, but could allow it to capitalize on its recent successes by broadcasting television advertisements in its must-win state, New Hampshire.Mr. Thompson, the former Tennessee senator, had been hoping to capitalize on widespread dissatisfaction among Christian conservatives with the rest of the Republican field. But his early rollout — which saw him ill-prepared to answer some questions on local and national issues, from oil drilling in the Florida Everglades to the racial tensions in Jena, La. — has done little to solidify conservative support. James C. Dobson, a prominent Christian conservative, sent out a withering e-mail message last week that questioned not only Mr. Thompson’s commitment to conservative positions on gay marriage and campaign finance restrictions but also his political skills.But Mr. Thompson’s advisers point to his Tennessee roots, which make him the only leading candidate from the party’s geographic base, and note that he polls well in the South, in the Midwest and among voters who identify themselves as Christian, own guns, oppose taxes and opposed the recent immigration bill in Congress.“You’re going to start to see us posing the question: what were you fighting for in 1994 when the Republicans took control of Washington?” said Todd Harris, Mr. Thompson’s communications director, referring to Mr. Thompson’s election to the Senate as part of that year’s Republican landslide. “Were you a foot soldier in the revolution?”The question, of course, may remind voters that Mr. Giuliani endorsed Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat and well known liberal, for governor of New York that year, while Mr. Romney ran for the United States Senate in Massachusetts that year as a socially liberal Republican who supported abortion rights and gay rights.They are betting that even if Mr. Thompson does not do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, where other campaigns have built stronger organizations, strong showings in South Carolina and Florida will position him to do well in the later voting. And they are employing a strategy that takes advantage of Republican convention rules that award extra delegates to states that voted for President Bush last time, or which have Republican governors, senators or state legislatures — states which they see as potential strongholds for Mr. Thompson.“If you look at the delegate count, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky and Georgia have more combined delegates than New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania,” said Spencer Abraham, the former federal energy secretary who is a senior adviser to the campaign.The Giuliani campaign is also looking past the first few contests, and is focusing on Florida, where a large number of former New Yorkers live and vote, and on Feb. 5, when primaries are held in big states like New York, California and New Jersey, where Mr. Giuliani is popular. Strong showings in those states could bolster Mr. Giuliani’s argument that he is the only Republican in the field able to put traditionally Democratic states in play.““I hate to compare all this to baseball, but I probably know more about baseball,” Mr. Giuliani said in an interview this summer. “It is always important to win the first game of the series, and the second game of the series. But teams have won World Series that have lost the first two games, including, by the way, the Yankees.”The Giuliani campaign does not plan to cede Iowa, aides say, wanting to force Mr. Romney to spend money there to defend that flank. And Mr. Giuliani has shown resilience in South Carolina, despite his liberalism on social issues. But this is where Mr. Thompson could be an obstacle.The Romney campaign believes it is impossible for a candidate to have any shot going into the Feb. 5 races if he has fared poorly in the earlier contests. So it has focused all along on an interlocking early-state strategy. Besides Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida, the campaign chose to focus on Michigan, even though it was unclear when it would vote, because Mr. Romney was born there, and his father was governor.In internal budget debates that followed, many proposed cutting back in Michigan. Now, however, it appears the state will likely go third, after Iowa and New Hampshire, an unexpected bonus for Mr. Romney, who is polling well in all three states.Campaign managers feel well-positioned in Iowa, especially if the caucuses are moved to a weekday, which would make their big organization there even more crucial in getting voters to the caucuses.New Hampshire is shaping up to be what they believe will be a much more difficult test, with Mr. McCain largely staking his campaign there and Mr. Giuliani nipping at Mr. Romney’s heels in recent polls.Some have wondered whether Mr. Romney will seriously compete in South Carolina, where he has yet to move up in the polls. However, he recently made his first significant purchase of television advertising there, as well as in Florida.One of the campaign’s struggles has been its dismal national poll numbers. The campaign began broadcasting commercials nationally on Fox News Channel in May that it had planned to continue into June, but after the national polls failed to move, they decided to scrap their plans and divert the resources to Iowa and New Hampshire.Although Mr. McCain is only concentrating on three states — Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina — his campaign’s financial collapse over the summer means that he has so little money that he will have to decide soon whether to accept federal matching funds, which would provide his campaign with an infusion of much-needed cash but limit how it can be spent.Accepting the funds would limit his spending in Iowa to roughly $1.5 million and in New Hampshire to about $800,000. But there are lots of ways to get around those caps, which do not count commercials bought in neighboring states (like Massachusetts, whose Boston television stations are widely seen in New Hampshire).Some advisers want Mr. McCain to go up with a television commercial soon in New Hampshire, to capitalize on the favorable media coverage he got after turning in a strong debate performance there this month and touring the early states on a “No Surrender” tour aimed at drumming up support for the current Iraq strategy.Mr. McCain himself acknowledges that he faces an uphill battle in Iowa, so the campaign is betting heavily on New Hampshire, hoping to repeat his 2000 upset victory. With the field wide open, Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, has waited longer than usual to offer his endorsement this year.“Usually it sugars off pretty quickly to between two candidates,” said Mr. Gregg, turning to a maple syrup-making phrase. “This is not sugaring off.”'"
"'07-09-23,'0','In those cases, Judge Mukasey was largely unyielding. And he showed little sympathy to people held as material witnesses after the Sept. 11 attacks.But overall, Judge Mukasey’s median sentence was 24 months, compared with the 18-month median sentence imposed by the more than 70 other judges who sat with him on the Federal District Court in Manhattan from 1988 to 2006, according to statistics compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.In drug and weapons cases, Judge Mukasey’s sentences were more similar to those of other judges. But his median sentence in immigration cases was just 75 percent of the overall rate, while his white collar sentences were double that of the other judges.A separate analysis by JudicialReports.com, published by the Institute for Judicial Studies, looked at how often the federal appeals court in New York reversed Judge Mukasey in the last seven years.In criminal cases, he was reversed 20 percent of the time, compared with an overall reversal rate from his court of roughly 15 percent in 2006. But in civil cases, his 24 percent reversal rate compared favorably with the overall rate of roughly 30 percent.Last year, when the Justice Department sought his permission to force a mentally troubled defendant to take psychotropic drugs to render her competent to stand trial, Judge Mukasey expressed a visceral disgust for the idea, even though the Supreme Court had endorsed it.“It is not inappropriate to recall in plain terms,” he wrote, “what the government seeks to do here, which necessarily involves physically restraining defendant so that she can be injected with mind-altering drugs.”“There was a time when what might be viewed as an even lesser invasion of a defendant’s person — pumping his stomach to retrieve evidence — was said to ‘shock the conscience’ and invite comparison with ‘the rack and the screw,’ ” he added, quoting from a 1952 Supreme Court decision.His writing was consistently cogent, lucid and self-assured, owing something to George Orwell, a hero of his. Indeed, Judge Mukasey kept a framed photograph of Orwell in his chambers.“He is a particular idol of mine for his clear writing and complete disdain for cant,” Judge Mukasey told a reporter for The Financial Times in 1989, not long after becoming a judge. “I try to recognize when some spongy abstraction is trying to cover up an excuse for thought or analysis.”His decisions almost always start with an exceptionally detailed account of the facts, often coupled with a keen awareness of how hard it is to know anything for sure.His writing benefited from a stint at United Press International, the news agency. “It was good practice in writing fast and making things comprehensible,” he told The Financial Times.In a 1989 copyright case brought by Kennett Love, a former New York Times reporter who claimed that too much of an unpublished manuscript of his had been used in the defendant’s book, Judge Mukasey revealed a deep knowledge of history and journalism.“It was once accepted,” Judge Mukasey wrote, “for journalists not to print information they believed disserved the national interest.” He went on to cite coverage of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s disability, of the overthrow of the Iranian government in 1953, of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.Judge Mukasey then quoted ruefully from an article by Max Frankel, a former executive editor of The Times, discussing how things changed after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination and as the Vietnam War progressed: “The essential ingredient was trust, and that was lost somewhere between Dallas and Tonkin.”Judge Mukasey has attracted occasional criticism for what was said to be a hardhearted and overly formal application of the law.In 2004, for instance, he dismissed a class-action suit against an Italian insurance company brought by the estates and survivors of people who died or lost property in the Holocaust.He said he was deferring to “a federal executive branch policy favoring voluntary resolution of Holocaust-era insurance claims” through a private commission.Thane Rosenbaum, who teaches law at Fordham University and is the author of “The Myth of Moral Justice,” was critical of that decision and said it was suggestive of how Judge Mukasey might approach the job of attorney general.“The fact that Mukasey ruled in favor of executive pre-emption in a case that was crying out for legal and moral relief,” Mr. Rosenbaum said, “might reveal his sentiments when it comes to the ultimate power of the presidency, for instance, in fighting terrorism.”In 1993, Judge Mukasey ruled against Prescott S. Bush Jr., a brother of the first President Bush. Mr. Bush had responded to a breach of contract claim from a Japanese company by saying he had been defrauded because the company, he asserted, was a front for a crime family.Even if the company was “a Japanese mob organization,” Judge Mukasey wrote, Mr. Bush and his own company “could and did contract with it.”The officers of the Japanese company, he added, “were not applying for membership in a country club.”In 1998, he ruled against several songwriters who claimed authorship of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” saying they had filed their suit too late.He allowed a contract case against the poet Maya Angelou to go forward in 2005 despite her protestations that she had become disgusted with her partner in the greeting-cards venture and felt it “morally wrong” to proceed.“None of these reservations,” Judge Mukasey wrote, “had anything to do with the terms of the contract Angelou signed.”Similarly, he dismissed a lawsuit by Anastasia Myskina, a tennis star, over the publication of nude photographs of her, finding that she had signed a valid release and that the photographs were newsworthy.In a 1997 securities fraud case, he reversed his own earlier decision and allowed the case over a cigarette company’s asserted lies about nicotine to go forward.Judge Mukasey did not tolerate sharp conduct in litigation before him. “There is a school of thought that teaches that the best defense is a good offense,” he wrote in imposing fines on a lawyer and his client for submitting an affidavit that he said contradicted the facts.“That school of thought may prevail on a battlefield or the athletic field; it should not prevail in the courthouse.”In 1995, he denied a request for a trial adjournment. “It is hard to credit a claim that counsel do not have the time to prepare for trial when they have used their energies to produce on the eve of trial 65 tendentious pages of argument” seeking the adjournment, Judge Mukasey wrote.When a former publicist for Marla Maples, Donald Trump’s second wife, filed a series of frivolous lawsuits, Judge Mukasey barred the courthouse door, forbidding him to file “any civil lawsuit in a court of the United States, regardless of the subject matter, without first obtaining leave of such court.”For good measure, he ordered the publicist, Charles Jones, “to staple a copy of this opinion to any future complaint.”Judge Mukasey’s court, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, handles more than its share of major commercial disputes, securities fraud cases and complex criminal prosecutions. But some of Judge Mukasey’s cases concerned quotidian matters.In 1992 he refused to halt a television commercial that mocked Coors Light.“The parties have vigorously disputed whether the taste of beer, unlike the taste of milk, is adversely affected by pasteurization,” Judge Mukasey wrote, responding with some newly coined legal Latin.“De gustibus cerevesiae non scit lex,” he wrote, meaning, presumably, that the law takes no account of taste in weak beer.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','YANGON, Myanmar, Sept. 22 (AP) — The wave of antigovernment demonstrations in Myanmar touched the doorstep of the detained democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on Saturday, as the police let more than 500 Buddhist monks through a roadblock to march past her home here.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate, came to her gate to greet them, a witness said.Five straight days of protests by the highly respected monks have jolted the country’s military junta. The latest protest movement began Aug. 19 after the government raised fuel prices, but has its basis in pent-up dissatisfaction with the repressive military government.Meanwhile, a monks’ organization for the first time urged the public to join in protesting “evil military despotism” in Myanmar, formerly Burma. The All Burma Monks Alliance issued the call in a statement received Saturday by The Associated Press.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','The blocks nearby, once filled with investment houses, are now home to apartments and luxury goods stores like Tiffany and Hermès.The decline in activity at the exchange’s headquarters at 11 Wall Street is palpable. Tourists no longer queue up by the hundreds to survey the floor from the visitors’ gallery or watch the ceremonial ringing of the opening and closing bells. Excluded for security reasons since 9/11, they can only wander by the building that has long symbolized the heart of American commerce.If they could get inside, they would see that a once-vital organ has been reduced to a reliable backdrop for financial shows on cable. Camera crews flocked there again on Tuesday to capture the reaction to the lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve.But even on its busiest days, the trading floor is a sideshow compared with the center-ring attraction it was several years ago. Most of the action in shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange happens electronically, between the computers of traders at brokerage houses, mutual fund companies and home offices in spare bedrooms.The instantaneous execution of trades those computers allow has diminished the value of much of what the humans on the floor used to do. For the last several months, the floor has accounted for less than half of the trading in the 2,700 stocks listed on the exchange. Three years ago, that share was about 80 percent.“The floor as we knew it is dead,” said James J. Angel, an associate professor of finance at Georgetown University. “The old days when Billy would trade with Vinny and swap information about orders so that they could get a better price for their customer are gone.”At the core of the old system was a small army of specialists, who staffed trading posts and were responsible for maintaining orderly markets in particular stocks. The specialists stand ready to buy or sell stocks with their own money, if necessary. But lately, that need arises less and less often.This summer, specialists were involved in less than one of every 30 trades, down from about one of every seven just five years ago, according to exchange statistics. Brokers on the floor, who carry out customers’ orders to buy and sell shares, handled an additional four of those 30 trades. The other 25 were without a middleman.With demand for their services dwindling, the remaining specialist firms have been shrinking and struggling to survive. One of the more prominent firms, LaBranche & Company, reported a loss of almost $370 million in the second quarter, much of it attributed to a drop in the value of its stake in the New York Stock Exchange.“Until the specialists and the brokers can make a satisfactory return on their investment on the floor, everything is in question,” said Patrick J. Healy, the chief executive of Issuer Advisory Group, which advises public companies on how and where to list their shares for trading. “Whether the floor can survive is a 50-50 proposition. The answer is, we’ll know soon.”For their part, exchange officials pointed out that the exchange was just one segment of a growing, global network of trading companies. After becoming a publicly traded company itself last year by merging with Archipelago Holdings, the exchange’s operator merged in April with Euronext, which owned stock and futures exchanges in London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon.Officials of the New York Stock Exchange have considered acquiring the New York Mercantile Exchange, which makes markets in oil, gold and other commodities, according to city officials. But no deal has materialized yet.Today, what happens on the 104-year-old trading floor on Wall Street accounts for only one-tenth of the revenue of the company, now known as NYSE Euronext.But exchange officials said that they were revamping their operations to make the floor more integral, not less. The opportunity to have people rather than computers make decisions on a customer’s trade distinguishes the exchange from its all-electronic competitors like the Nasdaq stock market, they said.“We intend to have the floor as part of our market model as far as we can see out into the future,” said Duncan L. Niederauer, the president of NYSE Euronext. “There are certain things that computers can’t do.”Mr. Niederauer said he could not predict how much of the trading would ultimately occur there, but he said he did not foresee further shrinkage of the floor. “I don’t see it getting a lot smaller than that,” he said, referring to the two rooms that will be left after November.One of those rooms is the grand, original trading room that was the centerpiece of the exchange when it was built in 1903. The other is a room indelicately named “the garage,” which was added in 1922. The rooms that are being closed were stitched on in 1969 and 1988. A fifth room was added in 2000 by building an overpass from the floor to a building across Exchange Place, but it was closed in February.When that last expansion occurred, Richard A. Grasso, who was then chairman of the exchange, had bigger plans. He had persuaded the Giuliani administration to provide about $1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives toward the creation of a new home base for the exchange across Broad Street. But the Bloomberg administration scrapped that plan, which would have been one of the city’s biggest offers to retain a large company.Two years ago, the city agreed to provide about $650 million in incentives to Goldman Sachs to build its new headquarters near ground zero instead of moving to Midtown. Goldman, which has about 30,000 employees, is thriving now, as the exchange is shedding jobs and shrinking its presence in the city.Ms. Mogavero, whose husband also was a floor broker until he retired a few years ago, said she hoped that the tighter quarters would revive some of the camaraderie of the more boisterous days when brokers like her weaved from room to room. She applauded the executives who oversee the exchange for not giving up on the floor altogether, as many exchanges around the world have done.“It would have been easy for them to flip a switch and say: ‘Let’s be electronic. Everybody go home,’ ” she said.City officials express hope that the executives who run the exchange will find a way to maintain its image as the gold standard of financial markets, but they are resigned to its diminished physical presence and the permanent loss of jobs on the floor.“The forces that will determine exactly how many people work within the stock exchange or are connected to it are so much larger than the city itself,” said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development. “The city can’t fight market forces. But I do feel confident that there will be a significant physical presence there. No matter what happens to the N.Y.S.E., that building, with all of the history that it contains, is still going to be viewed as the center of the financial world.”But in private, city and state officials are fretting about how “to position ourselves to remain the center of global finance if the anchor of the New York Stock Exchange isn’t there for us or doesn’t have the same meaning as it has had for the last century,” said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City.They understand, Ms. Wylde said, that the key components of exchanges in the 21st century are not people, but computers and technology. “The shift is happening; it’s inevitable, and it’s happening quickly,” she said.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','Second-half goals by Abby Wambach, Shannon Boxx and Kristine Lilly carried the United States into the semifinals of the Women’s World Cup with a 3-0 victory yesterday over England in Tianjin, China.Three goals in 12 minutes broke open a tight game for the top-ranked Americans. England is winless against the United States in 19 years. The United States will face the winner of today’s quarterfinal between heavily favored Brazil and Australia. That semifinal will be played Thursday in Hangzhou, with the final Sept. 30 in Shanghai.Wambach banged in a header in the 48th minute, directing home a corner from Lilly before a crowd of about 18,000 at the 60,000-seat Olympic Center Stadium in Tianjin, a northern industrial city of 10 million. It was her fourth goal of the tournament.“The first goal is always critical in a match,” United States Coach Greg Ryan said. “It was difficult for England to get their game going again after that. They lost the momentum and we kept pressing, going after them.”Boxx, a midfielder, made the score 2-0 in the 57th minute. In the 60th, Lilly, the American captain, broke through with her first goal of this tournament, and her eighth in World Cup play.The United States struggled early in the match, similar to the first three games — a 2-2 tie against North Korea and narrow wins over Sweden and Nigeria.Unable to manage long possessions, the Americans were most threatening on set plays.The Americans are seeking their third World Cup championship to go with titles in 1991 and 1999. They have never failed to reach the semifinals. Four years ago, they lost, 3-0, to Germany, the eventual champion.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','The Federal Reserve finally cut its benchmark short-term interest rate, and the stock market celebrated, racking up big weekly gains, but in the currency markets, the dollar declined sharply.The Fed cut the fed funds rate, its main short-term rate, by half a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, on Tuesday, and stocks rocketed upward in the United States and most markets overseas. The Dow Jones industrial average had its best daily performance in five years, and stocks rallied for much of the week. But the dollar weakened against other currencies. The euro was worth more than $1.40 for the first time and the Canadian dollar reached parity with the dollar for the first time since 1976. The prices of gold and oil also rose.For the week, the Dow gained 377.67 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 13,820.19. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 41.5 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 1,525.75. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 69.04 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 2,671.22.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.62 percent from 4.46 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER'"
"'07-09-23,'0','In the first eight months of this year, the average hedge fund generated after-fee returns of 6.1 percent, compared with 6.9 percent during the same period last year, according to Hedge Fund Research, a Chicago firm. In each year, those returns only slightly outpaced the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, and a basket of stocks linked to the index typically carries less risk than investments in the more highflying world of hedge funds. Investors who place their money with hedge fund managers expect them to handily outperform the S.& P. 500 over time, and they are willing to cede hefty fees to them for the privilege of doing so.For his part, Mr. Vavilov — who says his fund has garnered annual returns of more than 20 percent since its start in 2004 by placing global, macroeconomic bets that he declines to describe in any detail — remains unbowed by the challenges sweeping across the hedge fund landscape. He says that he is positioning himself to play a central role in the potential privatization of a Russian government fund that holds $130 billion in oil proceeds, and that his hedge fund should be a beneficiary if that state fund is privatized.He also says he brings another advantage to the table: smarts. “We’ve created a strategy that allows me to get high returns without some of the risks that are associated with volatility,” he says. “I sleep well and don’t have insomnia worrying about what’s happening to my money.”As the prices of oil and other natural resources like nickel and aluminum have soared, Mr. Vavilov joins the ranks of wealthy Russian business titans trying to put fresh riches to work here and in other markets outside their country. They say they are doing so in order to protect assets from corruption at home and to gain financial legitimacy in the West.“What you see is a glut of oil money in Russia seeking its way into calmer waters,” says Ariel Cohen, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington. “These Russian tycoons and oligarchs are looking to place their money in jurisdictions with more rule of law, and where they are not subject to expropriation by the state.”IN recent years, many of Russia’s wealthiest tycoons have gone on an overseas spending spree. Some of their transactions have been high profile, like Roman A. Abramovich’s purchase of the Chelsea soccer club in London and the oil giant Lukoil’s purchase of Getty Petroleum, a deal orchestrated by Vagit Alekperov. Other transactions have drawn less attention, like Vladimir O. Potanin’s acquisition of a 35 percent stake in Plug Power, a fuel cell developer, for $241 million this year.Many of the financiers behind these deals benefited lavishly from the pell-mell business privatizations of the years when Boris N. Yeltsin was Russia’s president and, having weathered the tumult that followed, now either toe the line in Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia or leave the country. Much of this has occurred against a backdrop of widespread graft.“There is really no such thing as local capital in Russia, only local corruption,” says Martha Brill Olcott, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. “The challenge for Andrei Vavilov will be succeeding in a market where things are mostly black and white, instead of Russia, a country where deals are done in the gray.”Mr. Vavilov has never been charged with a crime, and he says that anyone who does business in Russia is unfairly tainted by the country’s image as a haven for rampant corruption. Still, since his days serving as a deputy finance minister of Russia from 1992 to 1997, Mr. Vavilov has been saddled with suspicions that he grew rich through dishonest, insider deals. In 1997, Russian federal prosecutors began investigating whether Mr. Vavilov embezzled $231 million as part of a fighter-jet deal, according to Mr. Vavilov and others with knowledge of the inquiry. The investigation is continuing, and Mr. Vavilov has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.“If you succeed in Russia, everyone wants to get a piece of you,” he says. “Unfortunately, envy and jealousy is a big thing in my country and when you make a lot of money, people want some of it. I spend a lot of money on lawyers.”Mr. Vavilov brings more than attorneys to his new role as a hedge fund manager. He is also a Russian senator, with a seat in the upper house of Parliament. And he has criticized Russia’s central bank as not being more aggressive about how it invests the assets in the $130 billion government fund, also known as a stabilization fund, which the country maintains to protect the federal budget from fluctuations in the price of oil.Along with many others, Mr. Vavilov has also advocated privatizing the stabilization fund. He is among several business and political figures in Russia angling for access to those billions, and he sees his hedge fund as a logical repository for some of that money — as well as cash from well-heeled American investors.“I am confident that there will be no shortage of money coming in,” he says. “I don’t have to lift my fingers; people will line up to put money in. The money is the last thing that I am worried about.”Some people think that such confidence might be misplaced. “It’s a very tough time these days to start a hedge fund, regardless of strategy,” says Nicole M. Boyson, an assistant finance professor at Northeastern University. “Most investors are like, ‘Yikes, why would I go into a hedge fund when I already scared of the plain-vanilla market.’ ”Still, some experts say, Mr. Vavilov has one competitive advantage over most hedge fund upstarts: $200 million of his own money is invested in the fund. “Look, it’s always a tough sell unless you have an angle,” said James R. Fenkner, chairman of Red Star Asset Management, a hedge fund based in Russia. “But guys like Vavilov didn’t make this kind of money working the night shift. And to start a fund with $200 million of your own money is already a heck of an edge.”AS Mr. Vavilov recasts himself as a hedge fund manager, he is spending more time outside Moscow. He has also gained entree to the clubby world of top-tier hedgies. In April, for example, he flew his private jet — a Boeing 737 — to Las Vegas to attend an exclusive gathering of fund managers organized by Drobny Global Advisors, where he mingled with other millionaires amid conversations about such arcane investments as Turkish glassmaking stocks and Brazilian farmland. He says his taste for socializing goes only so far, however, and that he passed on participating in the conference’s charity poker tournament, called Hedge Against Poverty.“It is not fun for me to gamble,” he says. “You know why? I always win.”He says he relishes being the outsider, a role accentuated by his strained English and need for an interpreter. Born and raised at the boundary of Europe and Asia in Perm City, a small town in the Ural Mountains, he moved to Moscow as an adolescent. He says his father worked as a patent researcher in Moscow; his mother was a construction engineer. He showed an early aptitude for math and science and, after his father died, contributed to the family finances by working as a computer programmer in high school.He attended the prestigious Moscow Institute of Management, then enrolled in graduate studies in economics and mathematics at the Russian Academy of Sciences, where he received a doctorate in economics in 1987. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, several of his former academic mentors recruited him into government work — Yeltsin made him a deputy finance minister in 1992. Just a few years later, Mr. Vavilov was overseeing major bond issues for the government, working closely with Western banks to structure the deals. He helped pushed through privatizations and a flurry of other market reforms during these years, all of which Yeltsin advocated as a means of modernizing the Russian economy.Many of the Russian reforms threatened entrenched political and financial interests in the country and inevitably led to discontent. Critics in Russia and overseas have said that shady transactions followed some reforms and netted riches for insiders.As an architect of reforms, Mr. Vavilov earned plenty of enemies in Russia, political analysts say.“He’s a bit of a threat to the old establishment,” says Michael D. Intriligator, a specialist in Russian economic policy at the Milken Institute and a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “He’s a brilliant guy, but not very well liked.”Mr. Vavilov was the target of an assassination attempt in 1996 when his car was blown up in a Kremlin parking lot; he was not in the vehicle at the time. But, some people say, he still has enemies. “I still don’t think he has an appreciation of how many people are out for him,” says Ms. Olcott of the Carnegie Endowment.When he left the finance ministry in 1997, he founded the Institute for Financial Studies, a Moscow-based research group that today employs 15 specialists in macroeconomic theory and finance. Among its missions has been creation of sophisticated financial models that he says form the core of his hedge fund strategies. He says the work has led to improvements in assessing risks in global currency and derivatives markets.After gaining a seat on the board of Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, he bought a controlling stake in Severnaya Neft, a small independent Russian oil company on the brink of bankruptcy, with, he says, a $25 million private bank loan collateralized by the company’s assets. He says that under his stewardship, which included extensive cost cuts, the company invested heavily in oil production. Its reserves nearly doubled, he says, after it tapped into four promising oil fields in western Siberia. In 2002, Mr. Vavilov sold Severnaya to a major Russian oil company, Rosneft, for $600 million — in cash, he notes.“It was a big achievement for me from all points of view,” he said. “When I bought the company, nobody even took it seriously. It became one of the fastest-growing companies in the country.”Shortly after selling his company in 2002, he was elected to his senate seat as a representative of Penza, a city southeast of Moscow. The transition, some of his political critics in the Russian press have speculated, was shrewdly calculated — anyone who has a seat in the Russian Parliament is immune from prosecution. But Mr. Vavilov scoffs at that notion.“I joined the senate because I like to work for the public, not just in business,” he says. “The public interest is more important to me.”Some hedge fund managers question whether his plate — filled as it is with politics, philanthropy and constant travel — is too full to fight it out with some of the sharks prowling the waters in the industry. As Mr. Fenkner of Red Star says of Mr. Vavilov: “He’s not as hungry as most hedge fund managers are.”Mr. Vavilov enjoys all of the accouterments available to millionaires. He has a palatial Moscow home — equipped with an underground tunnel connecting it to his research center offices — as well as a residence in Monaco. His wife, Maryana Tsaregradskaya, is a Russian actress, and the couple, who have been married 13 years, have a 2 1/2-year-old daughter. Mr. Vavilov sold his Beverly Hills home for $13.5 million a few months ago and is shopping for a home in Manhattan. So far, he says, he is leaning toward a penthouse in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle.“I’m not hungry, I’m O.K.,” he says. “I’m lucky enough to support my family. But I strongly believe in my ideas.”His grand idea about Russia is that its government, long smothered beneath an unmanageable pile of foreign and domestic debt, is now contending with a very different issue. “The biggest problem in Russia isn’t debt, it’s surplus,” he says.Thanks to rising oil prices, Russia has $130 billion in the stabilization fund at a time of heated debate among the country’s leaders and economists over how to avert a pension crisis. According to government estimates, its population of working-age adults is shrinking and may fall to 108 million from its current 140 million over the next two decades, a result of fast-declining birth rates and higher death rates among the working class, primarily men.AS a result, Russian leaders are debating about how to fix the country’s pay-as-you-go pension system, from collecting unpaid taxes from businesses to more radical measures that would shift the country away from a state-guaranteed program. Mr. Putin has even encouraged larger family sizes to bolster the working-age population.Yet few in Russia have been more critical of the current system — or strident about how to fix it — than Mr. Vavilov. He has pressed his case for pension reform at international conferences and on the op-ed pages of Moscow newspapers. He argues that the $130 billion fund could be more effectively invested in order to shore up the pension fund’s finances.“This money is basically under a mattress now,” he says. “Figuring out how to invest this money should be the main goal of this administration.”He is urging the Russian government to invest the stabilization fund’s assets in the capital markets, using strategies developed at his research organization and which he says he has put to work in his hedge fund. Some analysts think that a more sophisticated approach in how the stabilization fund handles its assets is long overdue, and they say Mr. Vavilov’s thoughts are worth considering.“You don’t necessarily think of Russians as savvy investors,” says Barry W. Ickes, a professor at Pennsylvania State University and financial director at the New Economic School in Moscow. “They have tended to be very insular and domestic with their wealth. His ideas are very intriguing.”And if his hedge fund doesn’t wind up being a receptacle for pension fund proceeds, how will Mr. Vavilov raise the money he needs to give his fledgling venture a boost? In response, he, well, hedges. “Right now, I’m talking to everyone,” he says. “It’s like a beauty contest.”'"
"'07-09-23,'0','The convenience comes at a price. Appointment fees can range from $250 to $450, with additional tests and medication extra. And payment is due at the time of the appointment.Much of the time, that payment comes out of the customer’s own pocket. Some preferred-provider insurance plans may reimburse members for the fees for certain cases — much as they would any other out-of-network physician — or may apply the fee to the deductible. Depending on the insurance policy, the reimbursement is typically 70 percent to 100 percent of the cost. But most health maintenance organizations would not typically cover any out-of-network house calls.These doctors will see patients for most kinds of medical problems, except potentially life-threatening conditions like chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, serious trauma or problems with a pregnancy. In those cases, people should head to the hospital.Doctor delivery is one of many new approaches springing up to address the demand for faster, more convenient medical care. Walk-in clinics are opening in places like pharmacies, retail stores and airport terminals, though not everyone thinks this is a good idea. The desire of consumers for better access to a doctor has also given rise to “concierge medicine,” in which they pay thousands of dollars annually to get convenient, no-wait appointments. There is a separate fee for an actual appointment.“We have that perfect storm. The current system doesn’t work well for patients or physicians,” said Dr. Rick Kellerman, a doctor who works in Wichita, Kan., and is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. ""More doctors are coming up with new home business practice models. They’re exasperated with paperwork and insurance regulation.”The demand for primary care physicians outweighs the supply in many cities, so patients can wait weeks, and even months, for appointments, and hospital emergency rooms are becoming overloaded with nonemergency cases. Health insurance premiums, meanwhile, have continued to rise.Some doctors are doing things like taking only house-call appointments or operating “micropractices” in which they work without front-office staff and nurses and see their patients in a smaller one-room office, Dr. Kellerman said.When making house calls, “you get paid,” said Dr. Steven Meed, one of eight New York physicians working for Sickday Medical House Calls, which started last year and serves patients in Manhattan. “The paperwork overhead is kept at a minimum, the fee is fixed and it’s not going to be reduced.”Still, these kinds of doctor-delivery services are not likely to solve a big problem in health care: the 47 million uninsured Americans, many of whom probably cannot afford to shell out hundreds of dollars for an at-home appointment.Nor do these new businesses always address the need for continuity of care or the sharing of patient information among hospitals and doctors about any tests performed or medication prescribed, said David Barton Smith, a professor emeritus of health care management at Temple University. “There’s no common record-keeping,” Professor Smith said.My Home Doctor, based in Miami, does require its doctors to send an e-mail record of their appointment to each patient’s primary care doctor within hours of the visit and to follow up with phone calls to patients for the next 48 hours.Alex Leeds, a Miami mother of three, received two follow-up phone calls from My Home Doctor after a physician visited her home to examine her 3-year-old daughter in May. “That follow-up never happens with my pediatrician’s office. Never,” Ms. Leeds said.She called My Home Doctor after her daughter developed a fever late one evening after the pediatrician’s office had closed. Her husband was out of town, and she didn’t want to haul her daughter and two other children, ages 7 and 10, to the emergency room. The physician arrived, diagnosed a throat infection and gave her a two-day dose of an antibiotic until she could get to a pharmacy.“It was great,” Ms. Leeds said. “For me to go to a pharmacy with three kids is very inconvenient.”She called My Home Doctor a second time when her daughter had a respiratory infection. Ms. Leeds said she was trying to convince her H.M.O. to reimburse her for emergency visits for the two separate $300 fees she paid.IN other situations, employers provide some reimbursement to patients. Sickday in Manhattan has sent some of its eight doctors and four physician assistants to 20 advertising agencies, financial services companies and law firms to provide check-ups and other medical services for employees. The idea is that employees can have medical problems handled on the spot and get back to work quickly.“Would you rather have a lawyer who is billing $500 an hour be gone half the day for a doctor’s appointment or have Sickday come to your office?” said Aaron Baca, the C.E.O. of Sickday. “This mirrors people’s lifestyles better. People don’t want to wait to be seen.”'"
"'07-09-23,'0','Catalyst, a research organization focused on advancing women in business, regularly issues what it calls its “pyramid” report on women at Fortune 500 companies.The report shows that over the last decade, women have shown some progress in ascending the corporate hierarchy. But the data has always been shaped much like a pyramid, with the overall labor force near the bottom and the percentages of women at various levels mostly becoming smaller and smaller.In the most recent Catalyst pyramid, we find that women make up only 2.6 percent of chief executives at Fortune 500 companies.Now, pyramids may look great in Egypt, but Catalyst does not want its data to narrow like this. Ideally, the numbers should shape themselves into a cylinder, said Ilene H. Lang, president of Catalyst.That would mean that corporations, when they made hiring decisions at higher levels, would be drawing equally from a labor force that is nearly equal parts men and women.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','Calls to nominate the worst mission statement appear periodically on the Web. And the “mission statement generator” at www.dilbert.com strings together clumps of bizspeak to create fictitious mission statements. My latest favorite: “It is our responsibility to assertively administrate timely deliverables in order to solve business problems.”Ideally, “a mission statement defines a company’s business and its objectives and its approach,” said Darrell Rigby, the partner at Bain in charge of the firm’s management tools survey. “It becomes a bad thing when a mission statement devolves into platitudinous pabulum that employees clearly recognize as hypocrisy.”Some executives believe that the mere act of creating a mission statement is an important team-building experience. In a perfect world, that would be true: a broad cross-section of people would jointly write a statement both specific and lofty and then seek feedback from other employees.But mission statements rarely come together that way, according to Chris K. Bart, a professor of strategy and governance at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, who has studied mission statements. A chief executive is more likely to recruit several allies to sit through a few meetings and patch something together, he said. He estimates that only 10 percent of mission statements say something meaningful.“Most mission statements aren’t worth the paper they are written on,” Professor Bart said. “That’s the sad reality.”Undoubtedly, there are cases in which mission statements have helped organizations identify new directions or re-evaluate their work. For example, Johnson & Johnson managers referred to the company’s credo (its lengthy mission-statement equivalent) when they decided how to handle the Tylenol crises in the 1980s. At the time, the credo said: “We believe our first responsibility is to the doctors, nurses and patients, to mothers, and all others who use our products and services.” (In 1987, the word “fathers” was added.)Kellogg is updating its current mission statement, which reads, ""We build Gr-r-reat brands and make the world a little happier by bringing our best to you.” The changes are intended to better reflect Kellogg’s strategic focus, said David Mackay, president and chief executive since the end of 2006, who initiated the review.“Our mantra externally and internally has been we want to drive sustainable growth” during the six years since the existing statement was published, he said. “Our mission statement didn’t reflect that. We thought it could be a little more powerful.” Kellogg employees can decide if the new statement hits the mark when it is released in the fall.Too often, mission statements bear little relation to a company’s actual focus. And most elements of a mission statement have “little to no impact” on a company’s financial success, according to a study by Barbara R. Bartkus, an associate professor of management at Old Dominion University, and two colleagues. The study concludes that while some executives value the exchange of ideas that occurs when mission statements are created, many may also view them as public relations devices.Somehow, some large companies manage to go without a mission statement. Nestlé, for one, publishes a lengthy statement of values on its corporate Web site, but it has no mission statement.“Why do you need one?” said Robin Tickle, a company spokesman. “I don’t think we see a necessity to use jargon to explain our vision of our company.” He then proceeded to point out Nestlé’s recent strong earnings. “We have a very clear vision and strategy of where we are going as a company,” even without a mission statement, he said. “It must be possible to be successful without one.”'"
"'07-09-23,'0','ATTENTION shoppers: get these tax credits while they last.In August, Honda sold its 60,000th hybrid vehicle. That means the clock has started ticking on the phase-out, and eventual end, of credits for people who buy a Honda hybrid. Hybrid tax credits were part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.The 2007 Accord Hybrid qualifies for a $1,300 credit and the Civic Hybrid for $2,100. (Some earlier models still qualify technically for the credit, but it’s only for the vehicle’s original owner; credits are not available for pre-owned cars.)However, the Energy Policy Act sets a limit on the number of hybrids eligible. Once an automaker sells its 60,000th hybrid (all hybrid models combined), the tax credit begins to fade.In each case the consumer must take delivery of the vehicle, not just sign a contract. Here’s how it works:Between now and Dec. 31, consumers may claim the full tax credit.Between Jan. 1, 2008, and June 30, 2008, consumers get 50 percent of the original credit.Between July 1, 2008, and Dec. 31, 2008, consumers get 25 percent of the original tax credit.On Jan. 1, 2009, there will be nothing left but regrets.Toyota was the first automaker to run out of credits. As of Sept. 30, credits will no longer be available on the Toyota Prius, Highlander Hybrid and Camry Hybrid, or on the Lexus GS 450h and RX 400h.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','A POPULAR Mexican restaurant on Main Street remains closed after a May 31 fire, and the owner is considering moving to another location. An interior decorating store next door that was also damaged partially reopened after July 4, but is limping along. Only recently has work begun to rehabilitate the buildings, and the owners say the delay has cost them thousands of dollars in business.The nearly four-month closing has forced Gilberto Garcia, the owner of the restaurant Burrito Poblano, to lay off his workers.“The landlord said it wouldn’t be too long,” Mr. Garcia said. “So I paid them for three weeks, and then I realized it was going to take more time so I told them I couldn’t pay them anymore.”The landlord is Robert D’Agostino, the former mayor of Tuckahoe village, who also owns several residential properties, including a small apartment building in Tuckahoe and a single-family house in Eastchester.Louis Buccheri, a captain in the Eastchester Fire Department, said that county investigators had determined that the fire started when a fluorescent light fixture in the basement ceiling shorted out and dropped onto some materials in the basement.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','Richard Barenblatt, a mortgage broker with the Apple Mortgage Corporation, helped one client, Freda Gimpel, pay out less monthly than she had originally expected. But he stressed that the bargain occurred because she financed the deal with a conforming mortgage, a loan that falls under guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The ceiling on these loans is now set at $417,000, and the rates they carry overall have been dropping. Larger loans are considered jumbo or super-jumbo in industry parlance.Mr. Barenblatt pointed out that many buyers need to borrow far more than $417,000 — especially in Manhattan, where the average price for an apartment in June was $1.3 million.“She came out ahead,” Mr. Barenblatt said of Ms. Gimpel. “But it’s rare.”Brokers warn that some of the most adversely affected buyers will be those seeking to borrow a lot of money for new condominiums that cost $1 million to $2 million, without having been able to lock in rates on loans.Jeffrey Appel, director of new development financing at the Preferred Empire Mortgage Company, says he has seen buyers who have already made down payments on apartments this expensive, who are now having trouble setting mortgage rates. As he explained it, these buyers originally thought that they could borrow nearly the entire amount of the purchase, but now many banks won’t lend them as much, and they will have to come up with the difference.“I’m concerned about the folks who have been approved at the 90 or 95 percent level where the products or programs may change before they close,” Mr. Appel said.Many people hoping to buy new apartments are finding that, months before their closing dates, they cannot lock in rates. Buyers who do not qualify for the mortgages they need by the time they close also risk losing their down payments, because contracts for them tend to be ironclad. Last August, Hannah Taylor-Noren, 23, found a $495,000 one-bedroom in the Ikon, a building under construction at 50 Bayard Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with help from her agent, Lee Oelkers.She estimated that she could manage a monthly payment of about $3,200, including maintenance and without factoring in income tax savings based on homeownership. She hired a lawyer, got preapproved for a mortgage and had her bank draft a $78,000 check from her account for the down payment.But then Ms. Taylor-Noren, an event planner, watched the mortgage market unravel. No bank would guarantee that she would still qualify for a mortgage six months into the future without hefty fees, a problem since she wouldn’t be closing on the apartment until spring.Ms. Taylor-Noren knew she would not be able to afford higher payments if mortgage rates rose before she closed, and did not want to put down a nonrefundable deposit if there were any chance she might lose it.“It was a great price and perfect for my budget,” she said. “I couldn’t lock in a rate. It was terrible.” On Aug. 14, Ms. Taylor-Noren backed out of the deal.Adam Leitman Bailey, the head of a real estate law firm, said that in the last three weeks, five buyers represented by his firm had backed out of deals for apartments — ranging from $595,000 to $4.5 million — in Manhattan and Brooklyn.He said that several of them were financing their apartments partly with Wall Street bonuses, and that they had pulled out because their lenders folded, could not deliver financing right before closing or could not promise to lock in a rate because the apartments were in projects under construction. He said that while some of his clients could have found mortgages, they were concerned about what might happen to the real estate market, Wall Street and the broader economy.“It’s not only the financing,” Mr. Bailey said. “It’s the fear. They fear that prices are going to go down or we’re going to have a recession.”Other buyers have backed out of deals because they can’t afford their higher mortgage payments and they think prices may drop later this year.In June, Sam Payrovi, Elliot Chun and Michael Grossman — friends who met as students at the University of California at Los Angeles — decided to buy a $1.65 million bachelor pad at 123 Baxter Street, in Little Italy. They looked at 30 apartments and, when they found the place on Baxter Street, hired a lawyer to help them structure the purchase as a partnership and an architect to help with minor renovation plans.They had a commitment from a mortgage broker for a loan with payments of about $3,500 a month each before tax deductions. All their agent, James Coleman of Bond New York, had to do was hammer out the final contract details.But negotiations dragged out, as the three friends tried to work with the developer on contract language allowing them to convert the two-bedroom apartment into a three-bedroom. By September, they realized that with mortgage rates rising, their monthly payments had jumped to $3,800 each.On Sept. 12, they backed out of the deal before a contract was signed. Mr. Payrovi said that they lost nearly $3,000 in legal and architectural fees, but that they could not afford the $300 monthly difference and feared prices would drop after they closed.Not everyone, of course, has a bad mortgage story to tell. In early July, Ms. Gimpel put down about $150,000 to buy a $600,000 one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side. She had a commitment letter for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, but not a rate lock, from GreenPoint Mortgage, a division of Capital One Financial Corporation, at a rate that would have translated into a $2,950 monthly payment.In August, her mortgage broker, Mr. Barenblatt, found the rates had jumped so drastically that Ms. Gimpel’s monthly payments would be $3,375. Not only was this increased rate more expensive; it could also have affected her approval by the co-op board.Mr. Barenblatt arranged for her to get the $417,000 conforming mortgage and paired it with a $32,000 home equity loan. The combined loans will actually cost Ms. Gimpel $150 a month less than she would have paid.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','Monthly costs for seniors will be $2,200 to $2,800, which Mr. DePasquale said was less than half of the average monthly cost for other assisted living residences in the area. “The only difference with this senior residence is that it’s 100 percent affordable,” he said.The complex is the latest addition to New Rochelle’s affordable housing stock; since being created by the City Council in 1979, the Neighborhood Revitalization Corporation has built or renovated more than 1,200 affordable housing units. Housing advocates promote the complex as meeting the city’s intergenerational needs while also planting the seeds of renewal in a neighborhood long considered blighted.The $40 million project was financed by $13 million in government grants and a mix of state, city and private money, Mr. DePasquale said. The price of the seven-story building for the elderly, roughly $30 million, was reduced by about 30 percent by using modular, or factory built, construction for the six residential floors, he said.The building also is state-certified “green,” meaning it has environmentally friendly features like geothermal energy recovery for heating and cooling and energy efficient lighting.A far cry from early, high-rise housing projects, the West End look was designed to blend in with the older neighborhood and look like market-rate housing, Mr. DePasquale said.Sixteen buildings were demolished to make way for the West End complex, displacing 43 renters and 8 businesses; those renters who qualified as buyers were given first preference on the West End town houses, Mr. DePasquale said, and five of those families have moved in. After that, preference was given to city employees, school district workers, residents of New Rochelle and other county residents. (To qualify, potential buyers must earn no more than 80 percent of the median income for the county, which is $74,500 for a family of four.)Charles B. Strome III, the city manager, said the West End homes were the latest step in New Rochelle’s continuing effort to increase the stock of affordable housing in the city. Last year, for example, the City Council passed a law requiring all developers to set aside 10 percent of their square footage for affordable housing or contribute to the city’s affordable housing fund.“Most of us think the greatest strength of New Rochelle is our diverse population that varies over ethnic lines and income levels,” Mr. Strome said, adding that city and school employees have a hard time finding affordable housing in the city. “We’d like them to have the option of living here.”The West End project brings to 200 the number of affordable units that have been created in New Rochelle since 2000, less than half the goal of 418 by 2015 that the county set two years ago, said Craig King, the city’s commissioner of development. An expansion of the West End project, scheduled for 2009, will add 12 town houses and 40 units in a mixed-income building for seniors.For Mr. Coleman, who most recently lived in Mount Vernon, moving to West End was an opportunity to return to a neighborhood he knew well as a child, and to be close to his work and family.Returning, however, can also be a step forward and the start of things to come, he said. “This means everything,” Mr. Coleman said. “It means I can get married and start a family, or who knows?”'"
"'07-09-23,'0','In 1901 Scientific American’s Building Edition wrote that the carving on the capitals had been done by Charles Emmel, a Boston sculptor, and that the exposed pipes in the bathrooms were silver-plated.The Van Ness house next door is simpler, with four similar columns across the front, and a projecting rounded bay window on the first-floor porch, sheltered by the overhanging portico.The 1910 census lists Mr. Brush, a prominent builder, and his wife, Adelaide, as the residents, along with one servant. Mr. Van Ness, a stockbroker, is listed next door with his wife, also named Adelaide, and one servant. The Brushes and Van Nesses appear to be related through marriage. A 1920 census record calls Mr. Brush, then 60, the father-in-law of Mr. Van Ness, who was then 57.Conveyance records indicate that Mr. Brush lost the house in foreclosure in 1913 and that the Van Nesses sold theirs the next year. By 1940 the Van Ness house was still a residence, but the Brush mansion was a synagogue.Now the Van Ness house looks like an urban leftover of a fleeing population. A graffiti-covered truck with no license plates has been parked in the driveway for months, perhaps years. Much of the cornice and pediment, made of galvanized iron, is bare of paint; in fact the cornice is mostly gone, exposing the underlying timbers and brickwork.The fluted columns have been replaced by square ones. (Several vintage columns are rotting away in the front yard, but they seem far too short to be the originals.)A letter sent to the house and one to its listed owner, Bernice Schleicher, have produced no response.The Brush house, too, bears evidence of rough treatment: parts of its galvanized-iron cornice have rotted away and several windows boarded up. However, there are signs of fairly recent restoration activity, like blue painter’s masking tape on the windows and the hole in the brick facade, perhaps for a through-the-wall air-conditioner that has been removed.Dr. Gerald Valmé, a family practitioner, bought the house earlier this year; according to real estate records posted on nycpropertyresearch.com, the sale price was $1.5 million. Dr. Valmé said in a telephone interview that the interior woodwork and other finishes were intact and that he planned to use the mansion to house his office.For the most part Ditmas Park is an area of comfortable but much less assuming bungalows, although there are some big houses listed nearby in the low millions of dollars, and some brave souls are carefully restoring the elegant Georgian-style house a block away at 940 Ocean Avenue.Though much of the area is in the Ditmas Park and Prospect Park South Historic Districts, the “light harness brigade” has long since left Ocean Avenue. This stretch is a noisy thoroughfare. Nearby houses have neatly trimmed lawns, but the street consists mostly of middling apartment buildings. Litter mars many blocks.It will be a major accomplishment if Dr. Valmé is able to bring the Brush house back to its original condition, but it looks as if its down-at-the-heels sibling next door will be in that shape for quite some time longer.'"

The moment she realized she was looking at a personal file and not a work file, she should have averted her glance. An employee’s personal privacy is worthy of respect, even on the job.Having snooped, she should have interpreted better what she read. Anybody perusing a fiery diary entry, particularly one that torches the reader herself, might momentarily fail to put it in perspective. But once she calmed down, she should have realized that words written in anger seldom represent the writer’s true or complete thoughts — an error of literary analysis as much as ethics, and one with real consequences.While your boss need not help you get another job, her motives for refusing may be criticized. Regarding you as professionally inept — and apparently she did not — would be a good reason to withhold her imprimatur; nursing hurt feelings is not. To refuse a reference on petty personal grounds is an abuse of a boss’s power.Of course, under the circumstances, even if she came around, you would be foolhardy to encourage potential employers to consult her.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','World championships always generate excitement, and the Mexico City tournament, which opened Sept. 12 and continues through Sept. 30, is no exception. Fans are scrutinizing the openings as closely as the results. Often, the opening choices filter down to average players, setting trends that last for years.In 1990, there was a resurgence in the Scotch Opening after Garry Kasparov played it in his match with Anatoly Karpov. The Berlin Defense had a similar revival in 2000 after Vladimir Kramnik, the current champion, used it in defeating Kasparov.In the first five rounds in Mexico City, the hot openings were the Petrov and Ruy Lopez.Both are common and are not likely to get players to rethink their repertoires. That is particularly true of the Petrov, which has long been regarded as stodgy.All four Petrov games in Mexico City have been drawn, two rather quickly. But the other two — between Kramnik and Viswanathan Anand and between Peter Leko and Boris Gelfand — were real fights.Gelfand has been most responsible for the spate of Petrovs, playing it three times as Black — probably because he is the second-lowest ranked player at the Mexico City tournament. When given a chance, however, he has played with energy, as in his fifth-round win over Levon Aronian.The opening was a Benoni, but it quickly veered off any known path.Aronian’s 5 ... b5 grabbed space on the queenside but was risky because the b5 pawn was undefended. Gelfand quickly attacked it with the somewhat surprising 7 e4. The point was that 7 ... Ne4 could be met by 8 Bb5 Bd7 9 Bd7 Nd7 10 Qe2 Qe7 11 0-0 Nef6 12 Qa6 Qd8 13 Re1 Be7 14 Qd6 Kf8 15 Qf4 Nd5, when Black has regained his pawn but White has a clear positional advantage.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','What is the biggest risk you’ve ever taken? Readers of nytimes.com were asked that question last Sunday in connection with William Yardley’s article in the Week in Review examining why some people are driven to take up outsized challenges. Here are a few responses:Walking into a Peoria motel room in 1969 to get an illegal abortion.I went back to school in my mid-40s (1995), to earn a doctorate in psychology ... Some warned, “You’ll spend all that money on tuition, then die before you earn it back,” as though I’d spend my dying minutes doing the math.Moving to Manhattan from California when I was in my early 20s, with $500 in my pocket and two suitcases. I knew no one and I wore my California naïveté with a unselfconscious greenness.I think “risk” changes with age. When one is young, the mere fact of marriage, having children, buying a house seems commonplace. Today, I would shudder if I had to do that.My grandfather took an incomprehensible risk when, at the age of 15, he told his parents that he was leaving Germany for America, and that they could come with him or stay in Germany and perish. They chose to stay, and did end up perishing, while he left with only the clothes on his back ... He lived every day to its fullest for 85 years.Stepping away from a tall building’s roof edge 19 years — about half my life — ago. It’s working out pretty good.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','“Oh, my God,” my sister said.The picture was large on our laptops: a wide pale back, darkened only by a big black tattoo of skulls and ghostlike faces from a vintage cartoon shrouded in a kind of webbing. Thin strips of blood ran through the tattoo like rust. My eyes followed the blood upward to its source: four large silver hooks pierced the skin of his upper back, which was stretched far beyond what seemed safe or even possible.As I would soon learn, he is hardly alone in this practice. There are groups of “suspending” enthusiasts nationwide, worldwide even. They have Web sites with FAQs that explain the historical and cultural context of the “art” and promote safe techniques to prevent infection and trauma. But this knowledge would do nothing to dampen my sense of dislocation and bewilderment when it came to my ex-boyfriend.“Oh, my God,” my sister said again.“Oh, my God,” I echoed. My hands had been on that back.Behind him, the night was black. Something shone brightly in the top left corner of the photograph, a streetlight or maybe the moon. I could just barely trace the roof of a house and the outline of a pickup truck.Eight years earlier, he and I had met at a restaurant in where we both worked late nights. We were each in the midst of deteriorating relationships and through our commiseration became close friends, confidants and eventually a couple. Our relationship was brief, intense and tumultuous, more addiction than love — a scalding hot bath that feels like comfort but in reality is scorching you.I think we both knew we were wrong for each other but didn’t care. We were young, lost and unmoored, each secretly terrified of the phrase, “your whole life ahead of you.” Depressed and discouraged about the seemingly aimless path we were on, we partied too much, all the while treating each other as an extra added vice. More than anything we were grateful not to have to sleep alone.After just a few months, I discovered I was pregnant.I made an appointment at an abortion clinic before I even told him, never considering any other option. I was 20, a college dropout with nothing but a journal of badly written poetry and a résumé of restaurant jobs. He was 26, a short-order cook who liked to smoke, drink and acquire tattoos. We weren’t but children ourselves.When he said without hesitation that he wanted to keep the baby, I was shocked. Having come from an abusive family, he had long claimed that he never wanted children, that he would never bring a child into this messed-up world. But when actually presented with the opportunity, he changed his mind.“Maybe this is exactly what we need,” he said. “Exactly what we’ve been looking for. Maybe a child would give our lives meaning, a purpose. Maybe if we had a kid, we wouldn’t feel so lost anymore.”His pleading swung wildly from rational to heated, which rattled and confused me. At one point I even wondered if he was right, if maybe we should just give it a chance. I’d been raised in a religious family (albeit a fractured one) and was not without a sense of doubt myself, a sense of shame, of fate, of paying for my mistakes.But I didn’t love him. I cared for him, yes. I was inexplicably tied to him, dependent, attached. But I knew we wouldn’t last. We were too young. We didn’t have or steady jobs or savings accounts. But those were just excuses. Really it was about the fact that I couldn’t bring myself to have a child with someone I didn’t love. I couldn’t have a child with someone who didn’t love me.In the end, I called him from the driver’s seat of my mother’s car, idling in the driveway of a friend’s house in the suburbs where I’d been hiding out. “I’ve made my decision,” I told him. “My appointment is tomorrow.”He was so quiet I couldn’t even hear him breathing. The phone felt too big in my hand; its glowing numbers warmed my cheek.“You’re dead to me,” he replied. Then he hung up.As the years passed, I found myself devoid of regrets. I didn’t miss him or think of him often. In a way, his behavior toward the end only reinforced the fact that I had made the right decision.But every now and then I would be struck by the idea that I could have a 2-year-old child right now, a 4-year-old, and so on. I would be sitting in a restaurant, watching a server deliver a highchair or a pack of crayons to a thankful parent, and I would think, “Oh, yeah ... weird.”And then I would wonder about him, what he was up to, how he was. Did he have a wife by now? Children? I would wonder what might have happened if we had had the child, if we would still be together, trying to make it work for the baby despite all we had going against us, despite the fact that we were not in love.It was this curiosity that had led me to look him up time and again, and now that I’d found him I couldn’t get him out of my head: that pale wide back; those stripes of blood, the glowing moon. For weeks that image overtook me like a wave of nausea, a persistent . I scoured the Internet for more information, more images. I collected every fact, story and photograph I could find about people who hung from hooks. Maybe if I gathered everything there was, if I pieced together the puzzle, maybe then it would begin to make sense.I saw people hanging in backyards, warehouses and living rooms, slung up from their backs, chests and knees. I watched a video of hooks going into a young girl’s back for the first time, how she nearly passed out, how she had to lie down to keep herself from vomiting. I read someone’s account of the first time up, how it felt as if your insides were being ripped out. I learned that the best hooks for suspension are the ones used to catch salmon.The more I discovered, the more I found myself shaking my head like an old biddy, aghast at today’s youth. I battered myself with silent questions: What is wrong with these people? How could I have been with a guy who would want to do this? If we had stayed together and had the child, would he be hanging from hooks while I made dinner or changed a diaper?Or maybe it was the opposite. Maybe a child would have given his life purpose, as he had hoped, filling whatever void he was now plugging with this self-inflicted pain. So did that mean this was my fault? Was I responsible?AND then I recognized my attitude for the presumptuous narcissism that it was. Because what if he is happy? What if hanging from hooks gives him a sense of completion I can only dream of? I realized I needed to return to my investigation, but this time I wasn’t looking for who, what and where. I was looking for why.They call it “the art of suspension,” and suddenly something about that name struck me as lovely. I was reminded of a play I saw in which the actors were suspended from the ceiling with ropes and harnesses; the love scenes moved languorously, the two people never touching, just twisting themselves in circles like gymnasts in slow motion.At the Web site , I read that people are drawn to suspension for many reasons. Some are in it for the rush that occurs when your body experiences something so intense. But some are looking for something deeper: to conquer their fears or push the limits of the human body. They hope to learn to let go, to move around outside their body and to experience something most others never will. Others simply seek the unknown.I went back to his MySpace photo, hoping to notice something I hadn’t seen before. The picture was the same, of course, but something was different. What he had said to me seven years earlier played over and over in my head: “Maybe if we had a kid, we wouldn’t feel so lost anymore.”As I stared at the photograph, I couldn’t shake this gut instinct, this oddly comforting feeling, that maybe, when he hangs from hooks, he feels found.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','If Stevens is shrewd in the majority, he is fierce in dissent. He was especially exercised last term by a case involving death-penalty jurors, which he described to me as “a tremendous change in the law” and which prompted him to criticize his conservative colleagues with extemporaneous comments from the bench. He also assigned several dissents last term to his usually mild-mannered liberal colleagues — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and David H. Souter — that inspired some of their most scathing and memorable expressions of frustration with the court’s turn to the right. “I think I’ve made some awfully good assignments, to tell you the truth, in dissents,” Stevens told me, citing Ginsburg’s opinions in the cases last term about pay discrimination and the procedure known as partial-birth abortion. “I think assigning the two dissents that Ruth Ginsburg gave this year were two of my best decisions,” he continued, “because she did a really good job in both.” He added with a chuckle, “I’d rather assign majorities than dissents.”It may seem surprising that such a passionate leader of the court’s liberal wing bristles when he is called a liberal. But the fact that Stevens sees himself as a conservatively oriented centrist makes perfect sense given what judicial liberalism has become. There was a time, years ago in the Warren Court era, when liberal justices like Stevens’s predecessor William O. Douglas saw themselves as on a mission to recreate American society along boldly egalitarian lines by discovering newly minted constitutional rights. But for better or worse, this ambitious conception of judicial liberalism has been replaced, like much of political liberalism in America, by a more modest, conciliatory and technocratic sensibility. Even the most liberal justices today have little appetite for the old approach.Judicial liberalism, in other words, has largely become a conservative project: an effort to preserve the legal status quo in the face of efforts by a younger generation of conservatives to uproot the precedents of the past 40 years. Stevens, who wrote or supported many of those precedents, understandably objects when he feels they are distorted or mischaracterized by justices who were in college when he was appointed to the court. At the same time, merely conserving the achievements of the past is less than what many liberals today ultimately hope for. Can Stevens provide a model for a new vision of legal liberalism in the 21st century?On June 22, a week before the last term ended, I visited the Supreme Court for a conversation with Stevens. After greeting me cordially in his chambers, wearing a short-sleeved sport shirt and slacks, he motioned me toward a couch and relaxed in a nearby chair. He had a longstanding policy, he said, of not granting extended interviews; but he indicated he was now ready to talk publicly about his life and legacy, as well as the newly divided court.I asked about the new chief justice, and Stevens compared him with his predecessor, William H. Rehnquist. He praised Roberts as “obviously very, very smart, a very, very nice guy; he’s got a wonderful sense of humor.” He continued, “He does a fine job of running the conference, as Bill Rehnquist did, although I’m not sure I’m going to agree with him any more than I agreed with Bill Rehnquist.” I asked whether Roberts would succeed in his stated goal of persuading his colleagues to issue narrow, unanimous opinions. “I don’t think so,” Stevens replied. “I just think it takes nine people to do that.” He noted that Roberts had “a bit of a honeymoon period” during his first term. “I think maybe the first few months we all leaned over backward to try to avoid writing separately in a couple of opinions,” he said, “but I don’t think that will last.”In general, Stevens said, the idea that a justice can sway his colleagues through collegiality and personal lobbying — a talent often attributed to Justice William J. Brennan Jr. — is exaggerated. He suggested that in most cases, justices cannot be swayed to change their votes once they make up their minds, and when they can be swayed, it is only as a result of legal arguments, not charm or charisma. “I was very fond of Bill Brennan — loved the guy and had great admiration for him,” Stevens said. “But it’s simply not right to say that he was able to craft the majority. He just had five votes on his side!”Stevens himself, however, has been notably successful in building majorities by courting his fellow justices — in particular, Kennedy. His methods of persuasion are intellectual rather than personal, and they are closely tied to the court’s procedure for deciding cases. After the justices hear the oral arguments, they meet in a private conference to deliberate. After the chief justice speaks, each of the remaining justices speaks in order of seniority, so that Stevens speaks second. Then the justices vote, and the majority opinion is assigned. The majority opinion later circulates among the justices, and on rare occasions a justice may then change his or her vote, and a majority can become a dissent. But “you very rarely win votes if there aren’t five votes persuaded after our conference,” Stevens stressed. “Very rare.”When he is in the majority, Stevens is careful not to lose votes that start off on his side, often assigning the opinion to Kennedy when Kennedy seems to be on the fence. “Sometimes,” he told me, “in all candor, if you think somebody might not be solid” after casting a vote in conference, “it might be wiser to let that person write the opinion,” because after defending a position at length, people “tend to become even more convinced” than when they started. For example, Stevens was effective in winning over Kennedy by asking him to write the majority opinion in Lawrence v. Texas, the 2003 decision striking down sodomy laws, which many liberals consider the Brown v. Board of Education of the gay rights movement. “It worked out O.K.,” Stevens told me, with typical understatement. “I don’t know if I’m entitled to the credit or Tony’s entitled to the credit, because he wrote an exceptional opinion.” In other cases, Stevens has written the majority opinion himself in an effort to shore up Kennedy’s vote. In April, for example, in a 5-to-4 case, the court allowed a lawsuit to proceed against the Environmental Protection Agency for its refusal to regulate global warming under the Clean Air Act; by citing several of Kennedy’s previous opinions in his own opinion, Stevens persuaded Kennedy to stay in the liberal camp.On the issue of abortion, however, Stevens has failed to persuade Kennedy to vote consistently with the liberals. I asked Stevens about the decision last term in which Kennedy, writing for the five more conservative justices, upheld the federal ban on partial-birth abortion. Stevens said that the federal ban was deeply flawed and that Kennedy’s rhetoric about the need to protect women from the emotional trauma of abortions was frustrating. But he noted that the real-world effect of the defeat was minimal because of the widespread availability of alternative abortion procedures. “The statute is a silly statute,” he said. “It’s a silly statute.” He added, “It’s just a distressing exhibition by Congress, but what we decided isn’t all that important.”I asked whether Stevens thought the right to abortion recognized in Roe v. Wade would survive in his lifetime. “Well, it’s up to Justice Kennedy,” he replied. “I don’t know about the two new justices” — Roberts and Alito — “but I kind of assume it may well be up to him.” Abortion rights supporters may take solace in the fact that Stevens indicated that Kennedy seemed to view the regulation of so-called partial-birth abortions as consistent with Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld the central holding of Roe v. Wade. “I don’t think he thinks this” — the recent abortion opinion — “requires him to change his views at all,” Stevens said. “We’ll have to wait and see. I suppose there are a lot of people out there praying I get out of the way.”Stevens was born on April 20, 1920, the youngest of four boys. His paternal grandfather, James W. Stevens, made a fortune as the founder of the Illinois Life Insurance company, and in 1927, his father, Ernest J. Stevens, built the Stevens Hotel in Chicago, now the Hilton Chicago, which he called “the largest and finest hotel in the world.” Built for a staggering price of $30 million, the Stevens hotel included 3,000 guest rooms, a movie theater and an ice cream factory. As Charles Lane reported in a Washington Post article in 2005 about Stevens’s childhood, young Stevens and his brothers posed as models for the bronze sculptures by the grand stairway.At age 7, during the opening banquet of the Stevens hotel, Stevens remembers meeting Amelia Earhart, who asked him, “Aren’t you out late on a school night?” A few months later, Charles Lindbergh stayed at the hotel after returning from his historic flight to Europe and, eager to unload the gifts that were filling his room, gave young Stevens a dove.Stevens revered his father, a loyal Warren Harding Republican who mistrusted Franklin D. Roosevelt. Despite his political leanings, his father took the 12-year-old Stevens to the 1932 Democratic Convention in Chicago, where Stevens remembers not realizing Roosevelt had polio as he walked to the platform to deliver his acceptance speech. The same year, Stevens, an ardent Chicago Cubs fan, remembers sitting at Wrigley Field and watching Babe Ruth, in the fifth inning of Game 3 of the World Series, gesturing with his bat toward center field and hitting his famous “called shot” home run. (A scorecard from the game hangs in Stevens’s chambers.)“I had a very happy childhood,” Stevens told me with a faraway look in his eyes. But events took a darker turn in 1934, when the Stevens Hotel went bankrupt in the Great Depression, and Stevens’s father, grandfather and uncle were indicted for diverting money from the Illinois Life Insurance company to make interest payments on bonds for the hotel. Stevens’s uncle committed suicide, and his father was convicted in 1934 of embezzling $1.3 million. “A totally unjust conviction, I can assure you,” Stevens told me with passion. Indeed, later that same year, the Illinois Supreme Court overturned the conviction. “There is not a scintilla of evidence of any concealment or fraud attempted,” the court noted.I asked Stevens whether seeing his father unjustly convicted influenced his views on the Supreme Court. “I’m sure it did,” he replied. “You can’t forget about that.” Stevens said the experience had taught him a “very important lesson”: namely, “that the criminal justice system can misfire sometimes” because “it seriously misfired in that case.” As a Supreme Court justice, Stevens seems to have kept this lesson firmly in view. In criminal-justice cases from 1995 to 2001, according to numbers compiled by Christopher E. Smith of the School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University, of all the justices on the court, Stevens took the most expansive view of individual rights, voting against the government 69.7 percent of the time. (The next most liberal justices were Ginsburg at 60 percent, Souter at 57.6 percent and Breyer at 54.9 percent.)After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Chicago in 1941, Stevens enlisted in the Navy on Dec. 6, 1941, hours before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He later won a bronze star for his service as a cryptographer, after he helped break the code that informed American officials that Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto, the commander of the Japanese Navy and architect of the Pearl Harbor attack, was about to travel to the front. Based on the code-breaking of Stevens and others, U.S. pilots, on Roosevelt’s orders, shot down Yamamoto’s plane in April 1943.Stevens told me he was troubled by the fact that Yamamoto, a highly intelligent officer who had lived in the United States and become friends with American officers, was shot down with so little apparent deliberation or humanitarian consideration. The experience, he said, raised questions in his mind about the fairness of the death penalty. “I was on the desk, on watch, when I got word that they had shot down Yamamoto in the Solomon Islands, and I remember thinking: This is a particular individual they went out to intercept,” he said. “There is a very different notion when you’re thinking about killing an individual, as opposed to killing a soldier in the line of fire.” Stevens said that, partly as a result of his World War II experience, he has tried on the court to narrow the category of offenders who are eligible for the death penalty and to ensure that it is imposed fairly and accurately. He has been the most outspoken critic of the death penalty on the current court.Returning from the war in 1945, Stevens thought of becoming a high-school English teacher, like his mother, but instead was persuaded by his brother to enroll at Northwestern University Law School on the G.I. Bill. Two years later, he graduated first in his class, with the highest grade-point average in the history of the school. Based on the recommendations of his professors, who praised him as “the quickest” and “best balanced mind” they had ever seen, and the “most admired” and “best liked man in school,” he won a clerkship in 1947 with the Supreme Court justice Wiley Rutledge, a liberal New Dealer and former law-school dean appointed by F.D.R.As a law clerk, Stevens reviewed cases involving liberty and security after World War II. The experience, he told me, shaped his views about the importance of judicial oversight of the president’s aggressive actions in terrorism cases after 9/11. Stevens worked with Rutledge on a dissent from a 1948 opinion upholding the right of the attorney general to deport German nationals considered to be Nazis without any review by federal courts. Rutledge objected to the idea that federal courts couldn’t issue writs of habeas corpus because the Germans were held on Ellis Island rather than falling within the jurisdiction of a federal district court. Stevens cited Rutledge’s dissent when he wrote a landmark majority opinion in the 2004 Rasul case, which allowed foreign nationals held at Guantánamo Bay to challenge their detention in U.S. courts. (A portrait of Rutledge hangs in Stevens’s chambers.)Stevens was also influenced by Rutledge’s dissenting opinion in the Yamashita case in 1946, in which the court upheld the power of a military commission to try and to execute a Japanese general in the Philippines in violation of the Geneva Conventions. Emphasizing the dangers of denying anyone within American jurisdiction a fair trial, Stevens once again cited Rutledge’s dissent in his own opinion in the Hamdan case in 2006, which struck down President Bush’s military commissions because they were not specifically authorized by Congress. (Congress authorized them later that year.)But Stevens, like Rutledge, does not always follow the civil-libertarian line: he has a Greatest Generation sense of patriotism, which he expressed in unexpectedly emotional dissents in 1989 and 1990 insisting that Congress and the states should have the power to ban flag burning.After his Supreme Court clerkship, Stevens turned down an offer to teach at Yale Law School and instead became an antitrust lawyer in Chicago. He joined forces with moderate and liberal good-government Democrats, who were opposed to the corruption of the Daley machine. In 1969, he was appointed to investigate a political scandal on the Illinois Supreme Court, an investigation that made his professional reputation. A citizen activist named Sherman Skolnick accused the chief justice and another Illinois Supreme Court justice of accepting bank stock from a politically connected Chicago lawyer in exchange for deciding a case in his favor. The Illinois Supreme Court set up a special commission to investigate the allegations, and Stevens was appointed general counsel. After a six-week investigation, culminating in Stevens’s dramatic courtroom examination of the accused justices, the commission concluded that both men had, in fact, violated canons of judicial ethics, and both resigned.Stevens told me that the experience of investigating the scandal of 1969 profoundly influenced the way he has approached his job as an appellate judge and Supreme Court justice. In the course of his investigation, Stevens discovered that a third Illinois Supreme Court justice, who was not under suspicion for bribery, had originally written a dissent from the disputed decision that he decided not to publish, in the interest of maintaining collegiality. “My immediate and strong reaction was that the public should have been informed” of the dissent, Stevens has written.For that reason, Stevens went on to suggest, ever since he joined the Supreme Court, he has written more dissenting and separate concurring opinions than any of his colleagues. And his experience with the Commission of 1969 has made him even more skeptical of Chief Justice Roberts’s idea that unanimity is in itself a desirable goal. Ever since the early 19th century, there has been a vigorous debate about whether the Supreme Court and other appellate courts are best served by consensus or transparency — by unanimous opinions written by the chief justice, which was John Marshall’s view, or by separate opinions in which individual justices make their disagreements clear, which was the view of Marshall’s distant cousin and archrival, Thomas Jefferson. Roberts has explicitly embraced Marshall’s vision. Stevens, however, takes the Jeffersonian view. “I don’t believe in suppressing dissent,” he told me. “If you disagree you should say so. . . . I just feel I have an obligation to expose my views to the public.”Stevens’s work on the Commission of 1969 brought him to the attention of Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, a moderate Republican who had decided to promote merit appointments to the federal bench instead of political cronies or ideologues. On Percy’s recommendation, President Nixon appointed Stevens to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago in 1970. And five years later, when President Ford was looking for a replacement for Justice William O. Douglas, a liberal icon, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, he, too, decided to emphasize merit and competence over ideology or cronyism. Rejecting the advice of Barry Goldwater, who urged him to appoint the archconservative Robert Bork, and of his wife, Betty, who urged him to choose a woman, Ford chose Stevens as “the finest legal mind I could find.” The Senate enthusiastically agreed, by a vote of 98 to 0.As a sign of how significantly the Republican Party has changed since 1975, President Ford, until the end of his life, embraced Stevens’s jurisprudence even as a younger generation of Republicans was denouncing it. In a warm tribute to Stevens in 2005, Ford wrote, “I endorse his constitutional views on the secular character of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause, on securing procedural safeguards in criminal cases and on the constitution’s broad grant of regulatory authority to Congress.” I asked Stevens what he thought of Ford’s letter. “It was amazing to see that,” Stevens said, grinning like a proud schoolboy. “I was delighted, as I’m sure you understand.”I suggested that someone who held Stevens’s views would never be appointed by a Republican president today. “I suppose that’s probably right,” Stevens replied, shaking his head. Nevertheless, he emphasized that he still thinks of himself as a judicial conservative, which he defined as someone who tries to follow precedents and “who submerges his or her own views of sound policy to respect those decisions by the people who have authority to make them.” He insisted that although some people have called his record a “surprise,” his votes on the court have been consistent with the views he expressed during his confirmation hearings and as an appellate judge. “I don’t think that my votes represent a change in my own thinking,” he said. “I’m just disagreeing with changes that the others are making.” His own politics, he added, were far from liberal, noting by way of example that he believes in the powers of the free market and isn’t sure if the minimum wage is a sound policy. I asked whether he still considers himself a Republican. “That’s the kind of issue I shouldn’t comment on, either in private or in public!” he said with a smile.Stevens is modest, friendly and even-tempered, and after he was appointed to the Supreme Court he got along well with his new colleagues. But he has made few close friendships on the court, with the exception of Souter, and during Stevens’s early years, he became known as something of a maverick. His opinions were hard to classify in ideological terms, and he seemed less interested in persuading his colleagues than in explaining his own reasoning about every case as thoroughly as possible. “At the beginning, he got a reputation as being a nit-picker,” says his longtime friend Abner Mikva, former chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit. “The majority and dissent were fighting about major issues, and he was worrying about the edges.”Stevens’s reputation as an idiosyncratic loner was enhanced by his unique work habits. Unlike his colleagues, for example, Stevens did not let his law clerks join the common pool of shared clerks who collectively review the more than 7,000 petitions that the court receives each year from litigants and make recommendations to the full court about which cases should be heard. Only when a justice and his clerks individually review each of the petitions, Stevens says, can they ensure that the other justices aren’t overlooking important allegations of wrongdoing from marginalized applicants whose voices deserve to be heard, like Sherman Skolnick, the Chicago activist.Since Stevens joined the court, he has also been the only justice routinely to write the first drafts of his own opinions — the other justices have generally relied on clerks to write their first drafts and then rewritten (or at least edited) the drafts to various degrees. “Sometimes the draft is pretty short,” Stevens told me, “but at least I write enough so that I’ve had a chance to think it through.” Stevens said writing a first draft was “terribly important” because “you often don’t understand a case until you’ve tried to write it out.”Stevens also distinguished himself as the only justice to spend a substantial part of each Supreme Court term away from Washington. He and his wife have a condominium in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and they spend two weeks a month there from November through April. (In 1979, Stevens was divorced from Elizabeth Jane Sheeren, whom he married in 1942, and married Maryan Mulholland Simon.) “I do much more work in Florida than I do here,” Stevens told me, looking contented. He sometimes reads briefs on the beach. “One of my favorite memories is the time I was sitting” on the Supreme Court bench in Washington just after returning from Florida, he recalled. “I shook the sand out of the brief!” During his early years on the court, Stevens was known as “the FedEx justice” because he would hand-write his drafts on a yellow pad, dictate them for his secretary, FedEx them to Washington so she could type them up and then FedEx back and forth with his law clerks for editing. “That was cumbersome,” he recalled. But he switched to computers about 20 years ago and, with a secure Internet connection and phone line, he has become the first telecommuting justice.Stevens has no security agents in Fort Lauderdale — he says they would only attract attention — and is so low-key that most of his neighbors don’t seem to realize they have a Supreme Court justice in their midst. “I’m basically anonymous down there, which is the way I like it,” he said. Stevens said some good friends in a nearby building didn’t know who he was for quite a while. “I’d be reading briefs by the pool, and one of them would say, ‘That’s awful stuffy!’ ” He swims every day in the ocean, plays tennis at least three times a week and plays golf two or three times a week. “I get a lot of exercise down there, and my wife feeds me very well, so it works out very well,” Stevens said happily. He tries to maintain this vigorous exercise schedule when he is in Washington, playing tennis two or three times a week, often with one of his three daughters. (His son died in 1996 of cancer.) He is in such good physical shape that, in 2005, at age 85, he threw the first pitch at a Cubs-Reds game at Wrigley Field and got it right over the plate.During Stevens’s first years on the court, he sometimes commuted to Florida in an unusual way: as the pilot of his own private plane. “My secret ambition was to get Gerry Ford to take a ride in my airplane,” he said. “Any plane that contains the president becomes Air Force One,” Stevens explained, so “I would be able to call the tower and say, ‘This is Air Force One!’ ”Stevens’s approach to the job changed noticeably when Blackmun retired in 1994 and Stevens became senior associate justice. He devoted more attention to using his new assignment power to build majorities and to persuade the swing voters, Sandra Day O’Connor and Kennedy, to join the liberal block. And abandoning his initial, case-by-case approach, he began, as he gained confidence on the court, to develop a compelling judicial vision. Though no one has succeeded in reducing his vision to a simple label — “I like to have people think I’m a good lawyer, to tell you the truth,” Stevens said. “I’m not big on labels” — his legal thinking has returned repeatedly over the years to a set of identifiable ideas and themes.The first is that the government has a duty to behave impartially, rather than favoring one group over another for partisan or sectarian reasons. “It seems to me that one of the overriding principles in running the country is the government ought to be neutral,” Stevens told me. “It has a very strong obligation to be impartial, and not use its power to advance political agendas or personal agendas.”Consider affirmative action, an area in which many people believe Stevens became more liberal. In 1980, he dissented from the court’s decision upholding racial preferences in federal contracting, explosively comparing them with the Nazi laws excluding Jews from citizenship. More recently, however, he has voted enthusiastically to uphold affirmative action in universities and public-school enrollment plans, comparing them to welcome mats rather than no-trespassing signs. To Stevens, however, his views have been consistent. “There’s a tremendous difference in using affirmative action when you get a group to build a highway and affirmative action in the educational context,” he told me. “I think my rhetoric was probably a little strong,” he continued, but the federal law authorizing racial preferences for highway contracts was a “slapdash statute” that was based on pork-barrel politics, benefiting one group of contractors rather than citizens as a whole. In schools and universities, by contrast, “the whole student body profits from having diversity in the classes. So I really don’t think I’ve changed my views about this.”Stevens has been prescient in cases involving race discrimination. As early as 1948, when he was a law clerk, he wrote a memo to Rutledge suggesting that segregation was unconstitutional, as Diane Amann, a visiting professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley, has noted. And in 1986, he was the first justice to suggest that affirmative action for African-Americans should be justified not as a group-based remedy for past discrimination but as a way of securing the benefits of racial diversity for all citizens in the future. That insight informed his powerful dissent from Roberts’s 5-to-4 decision last June striking down the use of race in school enrollment. The notion that judges should treat all racial classifications alike, he told me, “doesn’t make any sense.”Abortion is another area in which Stevens has insisted on the duty of the government to act impartially rather than favoring some groups over others for sectarian reasons. He has suggested that restrictions on a woman’s right to choose may be unconstitutional because they reflect religiously motivated views about human life — thus violating the government’s responsibility under the First Amendment to be neutral between religious and secular viewpoints. “I think the less judges have to decide the better, and I frankly look at who should decide this,” he told me. “Obviously, I think basically the woman is the person most affected by it and has tremendously important interests; better to have her decide these questions with her own counselors and guidance than to have judges and legislators deciding something like this.”Stevens says he thinks if Roe v. Wade had been written more narrowly, the court might have avoided some of the criticism that ensued. “In all candor,” he told me, “I think Harry [Blackmun] could have written a better opinion. I think if the opinion had said what Potter Stewart said very briefly” — namely that the right to marital and family privacy previously recognized by the court included a right to choose abortion — “it might have been much more acceptable, instead of trying to create a new doctrine that really didn’t make sense.”When he went through the confirmation process in 1975, just two years after Roe, Stevens recalled, he was not asked a single question about it. Only later, because of the reaction that followed Roe, did abortion become a central issue in national politics. “I’m really not sure that it’s fair to blame the court for the hostility that’s come on, but I do think that a better opinion might have avoided some of the criticism.”Stevens’s conservative critics have been skeptical of his claims of judicial neutrality. In a critique of Stevens’s “sometimes eccentric” jurisprudence, Robert Nagel of the University of Colorado Law School described Stevens as a man with an “ambitious moral agenda” who often disregarded established legal doctrine in what could be viewed as the “overconfident imposition of highly debatable personal preferences.” For example, writing about Stevens’s opinion in 2000 upholding a Colorado law prohibiting abortion protesters from approaching within eight feet of a clinic, Nagel suggested that Stevens may have distorted free-speech doctrine because he found the legal protection of abortion protesters “morally and institutionally unattractive.”Another of Stevens’s longstanding themes is the need for judicial oversight of broad claims of executive power, starting in the post-Watergate era. Stevens’s repeated insistence that the president isn’t above the law has led him to rule not only against President Bush in cases concerning the prosecution of the war on terror but also against President Clinton in Clinton v. Jones, in which Stevens wrote the majority opinion in 1997 allowing the Paula Jones sexual-harassment suit to proceed while Clinton was in office. I mentioned that many people had ridiculed his prediction that the Clinton v. Jones case “appears to us highly unlikely to occupy any substantial amount of” the president’s time. “I remember somebody writing, ‘That’s the dumbest statement in history,’ ” Stevens said with a laugh. But Stevens is convinced he was absolutely right. “The discovery in that case should have taken a day or two,” he told me. “Of course, I didn’t realize at the time we wrote it that the independent counsel was going to get involved, and we didn’t realize that the president wasn’t going to tell the truth!”Nevertheless, Stevens insisted, it wasn’t fair to blame the court for having precipitated Clinton’s impeachment. “The issue in that case was whether he could have the trial postponed until he left office. But everyone agreed that the deposition had to go forward — even Clinton’s lawyers,” he said. “So the decision had absolutely no impact on the impeachment, but I know I get heat for it.”Stevens is similarly confident about the other recent majority opinion he wrote for the court that has inspired fierce criticism — Kelo, which held in 2005 that the city of New London, Conn., could use its power of eminent domain to seize a woman’s house and redevelop private land into a commercial office park. The decision has energized the grass-roots property rights movement. To Stevens, however, the decision is a textbook example of judicial restraint, deferring to the policy decisions of elected officials and following clearly established precedents. “As you know there are pressure groups that have very strong feelings about property rights,” he told me. “I sympathize with all that, but I thought that was a clear case of what the law compelled.” He added: “It’s part of the job to write unpopular decisions. No doubt about it.”Stevens’s final judicial theme is that the court has an obligation to protect ideals of equality and liberty in light of the nation’s entire history, rather than legalistically parsing the original understanding of the Constitution. As the court moved right during the past 20 years, Stevens increasingly saw it as his role to interpret the Constitution with fidelity to all of American history, rejecting the claim of Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas and Judge Robert Bork that the original understanding of the 18th-century framers is all that matters. I noticed a copy of Bork’s book “Slouching Toward Gomorrah” on Stevens’s coffee table and expressed surprise. “He and I were good friends,” Stevens said laughing, and confessing that he hadn’t read the book. But Stevens disagrees with Bork’s exclusive emphasis on original intent: “Originalism is perfectly sensible. I always try to figure out what the original intent was, but to say that’s the Bible and nothing else counts seems to me quite wrong.”In Stevens’s most eloquent opinions, he has often invoked his own personal history to illustrate the narrative arc of the American experience. Last June, in his dissent from Roberts’s opinion upholding the power of a school principal to suspend a student for a banner that read, “Bong Hits for Jesus,” Stevens mentioned some “personal recollections that have no doubt influenced my conclusion that it would be profoundly unwise to create special rules for speech about drug and alcohol use.” He went on, “The current dominant opinion supporting the war on drugs in general, and our anti-marijuana laws in particular, is reminiscent of the opinion that supported the nationwide ban on alcohol consumption when I was a student.” Just as prohibition in the 1920s and early 30s was “secretly questioned” by thousands of otherwise law-abiding citizens, he continued, so opponents of the war on drugs today may express their views only silently for fear of majority disapproval. In a concurring opinion, Justice Thomas insisted unapologetically that, because teachers in the colonial era imposed strict discipline “with an iron hand,” students today should have no First Amendment rights of freedom of speech in public schools. Stevens, by contrast, interpreted the amendment in light of the reality of 20th-century protest movements, including anti-Vietnam demonstrations at the Democratic convention of 1968, which took place in Grant Park outside the Stevens Hotel in Chicago.Some legal scholars view Stevens’s sense of history as a reason for his warm embrace by liberals. “Stevens became the leader of the left on the court,” says Robert Post, a professor at Yale Law School, “because he’s able to say, ‘I remember, and I’m faithful to what has happened in the past, but my fidelity is to all of American history.’ ”Stevens looks to be in remarkable shape for an 87-year-old man and, as he stressed in his confirmation hearings, his family has a history of longevity. His father died a week before his 88th birthday, and his mother lived until 97. Stevens told me that he has no intention of retiring. “Harry Blackmun used to complain about how hard the job was, how it was a real burden, and he was a workaholic,” Stevens told me. “But I like the job,” he said with a laugh. “I wouldn’t stay here if I weren’t enjoying it, and I’m really privileged to have this job.” He looked at me earnestly. “It’s not everybody my age who is able to continue to do work that he likes to do,” he said. “I think I’m making probably a positive contribution at it still, so I don’t think I have an obligation to quit, although probably a lot of people out there think I should.”Nevertheless, Stevens can’t remain on the court forever. Buoyed by the hope of a Democratic president, liberal legal scholars are already speculating about the possibility that Stevens might be succeeded by a similarly liberal justice in the next few years.A natural place for a Democratic president to start looking for candidates would be to choose a justice in the model of Breyer, Ginsburg or Souter. But liberal interest groups are unlikely to be satisfied with a justice in their molds for the simple reason that none of them are considered liberal enough.If a Democratic president wants to replace Stevens with a justice even more liberal than he is, another possibility would be to look backward to the old-style liberal philosopher kings of the Warren era, exemplified by Stevens’s predecessor, William O. Douglas. But a Democratic president would be unlikely to choose a candidate from among the liberal philosopher kings, because a political constituency no longer exists to support the 1960s-era notion that the courts are equipped to reconstruct American society along egalitarian lines. An opposite strategy, recently advocated in The New Republic by Douglas Kendall of the Community Rights Counsel and James Ryan of the University of Virginia, would be to appoint a “progressive originalist” who could turn Scalia’s methodology against him, invoking the original understanding of the Constitution to justify liberal rather than conservative results. In a response to Kendall and Ryan, however, Post and his fellow progressive scholar Reva Siegel, also of Yale Law School, have argued that the attempt to beat Scalia at his own game is a capitulation to the conservative terms of debate that is also unlikely to resonate with liberal voters in the country as a whole.I recently asked Post and Siegel to identify a progressive vision for the next liberal justice that could mobilize Democratic voters as well as provide an effective counterweight to the four movement conservatives on the Roberts Court. They answered that the next truly liberal justice would have at least four qualities. First, in an age when the conservative justices are determined to cut off access to the courts in cases from civil rights to terrorism, the next liberal justice would interpret the Constitution to provide “access to the courts to enforce the rule of law” and would “understand that even the most powerful president is not a king.” Second, the justice would “interpret the Constitution in light of the entire history of the nation, and not just in light of the Constitution’s drafting history.” Third, the justice would “interpret the Constitution to create conditions of equal liberty to participate in the life of the nation” — in areas ranging from abortion and sex equality to affirmative action and campaign finance reform. Finally, instead of reading the Constitution in a cramped, legalistic fashion, the justice would “interpret the Constitution to create a partnership between courts and the popular branches,” encouraging Congress and the American people to debate and define constitutional values. They provided, in effect, a list of the very qualities that defined the mature vision of Justice Stevens.Identifying potential Stevenses in their 40s or 50s may not be easy: Stevens after all, hadn’t evolved into the justice he would become when he joined the court at age 55. But one way to identify future Stevenses may be to focus less on ideology than on temperament. Stevens’s successor should share his dedication to preserving the deeply rooted precedents of the past, and that dedication reflects his sensibility and character more than his personal politics. When we talked, I was especially impressed with Stevens’s character: his engagement, curiosity, combination of toughness and vision, strong internal compass and refusal to go along with the crowd, his decisiveness, analytical power, modesty (but not false modesty), devotion to the court as a steady institution and sense of wonder and gratitude for the remarkable opportunities that had come his way.Near the end of my interview with Stevens, as I started to leave his chambers, he almost shyly suggested that I might want to consult some of the opinions he wrote on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, before he joined the Supreme Court. I should be sure, he said, to look up a case from 1970, in which his colleagues, at the request of an incumbent U.S. senator from Indiana, stopped a recount in a close election on the grounds that it might compromise the integrity of the ballots. Stevens dissented, insisting that the recount procedures were perfectly fair and that the state judges should be trusted to handle the litigation honestly, without having their impartiality questioned by interference from federal courts. I asked Stevens why the decision was important. “Because,” he said, his eyes flashing, “I had it very much in mind when I wrote Bush against Gore.”Even as his opinions have made him a model for liberals around the country, Stevens is more interested in demonstrating his intellectual consistency and temperament as a judge’s judge. “You write what you think is correct and important,” he told me matter-of-factly. “I don’t consider myself a mobilizer.”'"

"'07-09-23,'0','“This is about us,” Mr. Steen, a 36-year-old disc jockey and music producer, recalled thinking. “We should enjoy this. Let’s go somewhere we can take a memory home.”They flew in their best man and maid of honor and their toddler, Anton, but didn’t tell their families.Here’s how they did it.THE MARRIAGE Marriage Central in Manhattan is in the Municipal Building (1 Centre Street, second floor). The details can be found online at www.nycmarriagebureau.com, but people still manage to mess it up.For the license part on Friday, both of you must get there well before 3:45 p.m., when the office closes. And you need identification, and a $35 money order. (When you forget your money order, you can go the photo lab at the Duane Reade pharmacy two blocks down Chambers Street at Broadway.)Gay couples can’t apply for a marriage license, although they can register a domestic partnership for $36. There is no apparent reason it costs a dollar more.When Mr. Steen and Ms. Heitkaemper arrived on Monday around lunchtime, the officiant was nowhere to be seen, and at least a dozen couples were left waiting. A spokesman for the city clerk said that the wait was unusual and that there was no official break for lunch.This time, you need a $25 money order and two witnesses, preferably ones who will not object when asked if anyone knows any reason you two should not be married. (They need IDs, too, a requirement Mr. Steen’s best man was able to get out of.)Don’t expect romance. Or a sermon. The group was in and out of the chapel in less than two minutes. “You need more time at the counter in the airport,” Ms. Heitkaemper said.THE RINGS Even if you’re from a diamond-engagement-ring-shunning culture like Germany’s — “We only know about that from American TV series,” Mr. Steen said — you’ll still need wedding bands. And a walk down 47th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, the Diamond District, will provide you with dozens of options. Mr. Steen and Ms. Heitkaemper found what they were looking for at Prince Jewelry, one of the sellers at 20 West 47th.THE FUN The choices of what to do during your weekend are, of course, endless. You could go the romantic route, and plan the weekend around a trip to see “La Traviata” (on two consecutive Saturdays in November at the Metropolitan Opera). Or take in Cirque du Soleil’s latest production, “Wintuk,” at the WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden from Nov. 1 to Jan. 6.Our German visitors opted for some shopping, including picking up a belt with a silver star for $17 on Canal Street (which Mr. Steen wore to the wedding with an all-black outfit). But a potentially highly useful prenuptial trip is a visit to the Museum of Sex (233 Fifth Avenue, www.museumofsex.com). One exhibition, “Kink,” catalogs in visual and tactile detail an astonishing number of fetishes and behaviors you (perhaps) never imagined.THE HOTEL Where to stay? It’s up to your budget, but a Sunday night at the Brooklyn Marriott (333 Adams Street, www.brooklynmarriott.com; doubles from $229) allows you a Monday morning stroll down one glorious aisle: the pedestrian walkway of the Brooklyn Bridge. (The Municipal Building is at the other end.) The night before, you can wander the Brooklyn Promenade for what is the clichéd-but-worth-it most romantic view of the city.POST-KNOT You’ll need a place to eat lunch after, preferably within walking distance of the ceremony. One choice, for those wishing to keep with the bureaucratic theme, is the restaurant City Hall (131 Duane Street, www.cityhallnewyork.com), an elegant spot in a 19th-century landmark building that serves steaks, salads and a burger that’s 20 percent brisket meat.Consider spending the night at the Ritz-Carlton Battery Park (2 West Street, www.ritzcarlton.com), in a $900 suite with views of both the city and the Statue of Liberty. If you look at it one way, that’s very expensive. If you look at it another way, that’ll get you about half a wedding cake.'"
"'07-09-23,'0','WITH a bohemian heritage going back to the 1920s, Potts Point is Sydney's answer to Paris's Left Bank or London's Notting Hill — coffee shops, galleries, bookshops — though much smaller in area. At one end is Darlinghurst Road, lined with tattoo parlors, adult book shops, massage parlors, strip joints — an area popularly called Kings Cross. At the El Alamein Fountain, erected in 1961, the street curves left, becoming Macleay Street, which is the heart of Potts Point and where seedy gives way to sophistication.Before starting down Macleay, just at the curve, at 1A Elizabeth Bay Road, a small street abutting the Kings Cross Police Station, is the artist-run Cross Bay Gallery, displaying mostly Asian and aboriginal artists (61-2-9361-5758; www.crossbaygallery.com).Back on Macleay (pronounced M'Clay), before going too far, take a left on Orwell — he never lived in Australia but the name indicates how the neighborhood saw itself — and look at the Metro Theater, a classic Art Deco structure where “Hair” had its first Australian performance, around 1970. It is now the offices of the film director and producer George Miller (“Babe: Pig in the City,” “Mad Max,” “Happy Feet”).Just across the little park, inhabited by backpackers and the down and out, is Regents Court (18 Springfield Avenue, 61-2-9358-1533) a boutique hotel, where the stack of design, art and architecture books on the table in the warm and welcoming reception area speaks to the type of guests that occupy its 30 spacious rooms, with kitchenettes and Wi-Fi. If Regents Court is full, the staff will cheerfully recommend another of the numerous boutique hotels, usually Simpsons Hotel of Potts Point (8 Challis Avenue, 61-2-9356-2199).On Macleay, a simple “Bookshop” sign hangs between the Indian Home Diner and Seven Day Food. It is easy to miss. But don't. It is the Macleay Bookshop (103 Macleay Street, 61-2-9358-2908), and has been around since the 1950s. Its eclectic collection is housed in shelves put up in the pre-adjustable days.'"

"'07-09-24,'0','Judge Mukasey’s comments at the 2001 hearing were revealed in a once-secret 16-page transcript provided to The New York Times by a lawyer for Mr. Awadallah.Although Mr. Mukasey is otherwise widely admired by prosecutors and defense lawyers alike in New York, his handling of the cases of Mr. Awadallah and other material witnesses taken into custody in terrorism investigations after Sept. 11 produced some rare, sharp criticism of his performance on the bench and raised concern among civil liberties groups. Senate Democrats have suggested they will focus on the issue when Mr. Mukasey is questioned at his confirmation hearings.The White House has declined to answer detailed questions about Mr. Mukasey’s record pending the Senate hearings. But the retired judge appeared to defend himself in an opinion article that was published in The Wall Street Journal last month in which he rebuffed criticism of the treatment of material witnesses after Sept. 11, saying their due process was protected.“Each individual so arrested was brought immediately before a federal judge where he was assigned counsel, had a bail hearing and was permitted to challenge the basis for his detention, just as a criminal defendant would be,” he wrote. The article made no reference to Mr. Awadallah’s detention.Critics say a 1984 material witness law was abused by the Justice Department, and by Judge Mukasey and his judicial colleagues, to hold terrorist suspects indefinitely after Sept. 11 without having to accuse them of a crime and afford them the rights of a criminal defendant.The roundup of men like Mr. Awadallah under the material witness law in September and October 2001 was an early effort by the Bush administration to rewrite or reinterpret laws on the detention, interrogation and surveillance of people suspected of terrorist ties after the Sept. 11 attacks — a campaign that is now the subject of furious debate between the White House and the Democratic leaders of Congress.Critics say the material witness cases before Judge Mukasey after Sept. 11 offer insight into his performance and temperament at a time of duress. The cases came before him at a time when New York was still in turmoil, with the courthouse in Lower Manhattan, only blocks from the rubble of the World Trade Center, partly shut down and operating under extraordinarily tight security.Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have said they will try to review cases like Mr. Awadallah’s in detail before Mr. Mukasey, who retired last year after 18 years on the court, appears before them.Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who encouraged Mr. Bush to consider Mr. Mukasey for the Justice Department job, said that he was aware of the concerns over the nominee’s record on material witnesses cases, and that they would be studied by the committee. “There will certainly be those questions for him,” Mr. Schumer said.Congressional aides said that while the committee’s chairman, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, thought it was too early to discuss specific questions that would be put to Mr. Mukasey, the senator has long been concerned about the possible abuse of the federal material witness statute in the indefinite detention of terrorist suspects.The records of most material witnesses cases are sealed, so there is no way to determine whether Judge Mukasey’s tone in the October 2001 hearing for Mr. Awadallah reflects his handling of other witnesses picked up after Sept. 11.Some of Mr. Awadallah’s records became public because he, unlike most of other material witnesses, was eventually charged with a crime. His odyssey in the federal court system ended last November, more than five years after his initial detention, when he was acquitted on charges that he lied to a grand jury when he denied that he knew one of the Sept. 11 hijackers.After his acquittal, Mr. Awadallah returned home to California. As he awaited trial last year, he continued his studies and graduated with honors last year from San Diego State University.Prominent defense lawyers and legal scholars have said that Judge Mukasey and other federal judges were too quick to accept the administration’s reasoning after Sept. 11 that young Arab men should be held as “material witnesses” in terrorism investigations.It was a ruse, the lawyers say, for the government to detain them, often for months at a time, without any need to cite evidence of possible wrongdoing.Randy Hamud, the San Diego lawyer who represented Mr. Awadallah in the courtroom on that first hearing in October 2001, said he was startled by how “injudicious and malicious” Judge Mukasey had been toward his client.He said Judge Mukasey seemed not to care that Mr. Awadallah and other witnesses had been whisked away to New York from San Diego without any notice to the lawyers and were denied the right to contact lawyers for hours after their arrival in New York.“I wasn’t aware that they were in New York until approximately 8:30 yesterday morning,” Mr. Hamud told the judge at the Oct. 2 hearing, according to the transcript. Mr. Hamud said he had been required to fly overnight to New York from California to attend the early morning hearing.“You are now aware of it,” the judge replied without elaboration.When Mr. Hamud asked Judge Mukasey why he was not admonishing prosecutors for blocking his contact with Mr. Awadallah, the judge replied: “Your question is ridiculous. The government isn’t interfering with the attorney-client privilege.”The lawyer continued, “It is, Your Honor.”Mr. Hamud said he was also taken aback at the hearing when Judge Mukasey sided with prosecutors and refused to allow a prominent Arab-American criminal defense lawyer, Abdeen M. Jabara, to help defend Mr. Awadallah.Prosecutors argued that Mr. Jabara had a conflict of interest because he defended Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric convicted in 1995 in a terrorist plot to blow up New York City landmarks. Judge Mukasey was the judge in that trial.The transcript shows that Mr. Hamud, who had no background in criminal law, told the judge that he needed the help of an experienced New York criminal defense lawyer like Mr. Jabara.“I am obviously a practitioner from Southern California,” he said. “I am not familiar with the nuances of the Southern District.” It was a reference to the Southern District of New York, the judicial region that includes the Manhattan courthouse.Judge Mukasey replied, “Which nuances are you not familiar with?”Mr. Hamud said, “Mr. Jabara has not had a chance to let me know those yet.”Judge Mukasey replied: “I got news for you. Mr. Jabara is not terribly familiar with the nuances either.” He said that Mr. Jabara “was before me in a case that arguably has some relationship to this.” He did not detail what that relationship might be.In the years since the Sept. 11 attacks, federal law enforcement agencies have found no clear relationship between Sheik Abdel Rahman’s followers and the 9/11 plot. Mr. Jabara did not return phone calls to his law office.The Justice Department’s widespread use of the 1984 federal material-witness law to detain dozens of young Arab men after the Sept. 11 attacks has been widely criticized by legal scholars as an abuse of the law, which was intended to prevent witnesses in criminal cases from fleeing before they could testify.In a report in 2005, the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch said they had found evidence of at least 70 cases in which men living in the United States, all Muslims except one, had been “thrust into a Kafkaesque world of indefinite detention without charges” because they had been labeled material witnesses.Jesse Berman, a New York lawyer who joined Mr. Awadallah’s defense team after the Oct. 2 hearing and provided The Times with the transcript, said that there was no excuse for Judge Mukasey’s performance at the hearing, even in the chaotic weeks after 9/11, when there was fear of another terrorist attack.“It was a hard time, but it was a hard time for the material witnesses, too,” he said. “Mukasey was not objective. He’s an advocate of the prosecutorial side of things.” But Judge Mukasey’s handling of the cases is likely to have support among some in the Bush administration. Viet D. Dinh, a former assistant attorney general in the Bush Justice Department and now a law professor at Georgetown University, said Judge Mukasey was following a “fairly straightforward application of the material witness statute” in the post-9/11 cases.What was different, Professor Dinh said, was how many more of the cases there were after the terror attacks.“It would be like criticizing a judge for applying the murder laws because too many prosecutors have been bringing murder cases,” he said. “It’s certainly not a fair criticism.”'"
"'07-09-24,'0','Stem cell research in the United States has been hobbled for years by severe and misguided restrictions on federal funding. But now a vexing additional problem is slowing even privately financed research. There are distressingly few women willing to donate their eggs for experiments at the frontiers of this promising science.A respected team of stem cell researchers at Harvard spent nearly $100,000 over the course of a year advertising for egg donors. Hundreds of qualified women were interested enough to call but, after hearing what was entailed, not one was willing to donate eggs. Many were likely deterred by the time, effort and pain required — including daily hormone injections and minor surgery — to retrieve the eggs. And they were almost certainly discouraged by the meager compensation.Although women can be paid thousands of dollars to donate eggs for fertility treatments, ethical guidelines and some state laws say they cannot be paid much for donating to research. These restrictions are meant to protect the women against exploitation, but they have created a dearth of egg donors for stem cell research.Surplus embryos from fertility clinics can seldom be used to study specific diseases or develop treatments for them. Scientists need to develop new stem cell lines genetically matched to patients with diseases like diabetes or Parkinson’s. They typically take the nucleus of a patient’s skin cell and inject it into an egg whose nucleus has been removed. If all goes well, the desired stem cell can be derived from the result.With few human eggs available, some privately financed stem cell scientists are studying animal eggs to see if they can work the same magic when injected with a human nucleus. That may send shivers of apprehension through people who imagine rogue scientists creating grotesque half-human, half-animal creatures in the laboratory. But a thorough examination of the process by British regulators should alleviate such fears.The British have approved, in principle, the creation of “cybrid embryos,” produced when scientists grow human embryos in animal eggs. Although the embryos would be, in some sense, animal-human hybrids, there would be remarkably little animal — only about 0.1 percent — in the mix. The embryos, and the stem cells derived, would be virtually identical to cells in the patient.'"
"'07-09-24,'0','“It was unnerving to be with them for any amount of time, because they would begin to speak of their imminent death,” the Rev. Alan Dunn told the crowd of nearly 1,000 mourners who filled Trinity Baptist Church in Montville on Sept. 15.Addressing the overflow audience, some in suits and ties and others in tunics, some from neighboring states and one man who traveled from China, Mr. Dunn said: “Pakistan is a place of dense spiritual darkness. The Khans understood the reality of such opposition in their daily experience.”Mr. Khan’s seven brothers and sisters, all born to a pastor in Pakistan and now living in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, consider themselves devout Christians. But they said their brother’s devotion far surpassed their own.Days after the funeral, one of Mr. Khan’s brothers, Rizwan Khan, said in an interview, “We were always worried about them and sometimes told them about our concerns.” He added: “But Arif was very confident that he was safe there because that was his calling. He said, ‘This is my country and I am going to stay here.’ ”The circumstances of the missionaries’ deaths are still murky.According to the Islamabad police and news accounts in Pakistan, this much is known:On the morning of Aug. 29, Fauzia Haveed, and her husband, Honey — both members of Grace Baptist Church in Rawalpindi, which Mr. Khan founded seven years ago —went to the Khans’ home, accompanied by another man. They told police that they were seeking to retrieve a videotape alleged to show Mr. Khan sexually assaulting Mrs. Haveed.The Khans’ security guard told police that he allowed the three to enter the home, in a wealthy section of Islamabad, and soon there was shouting followed by gunshots. When the guard entered the house, he said, the couple were lying on the floor dead, both shot in the head.Neighbors apprehended the Haveeds, whom the police are holding but who have not been charged. The other man, a Muslim identified as Said Alam, who the police said fired the fatal shots, escaped.The police in Islamabad say Mrs. Haveed claimed that three months earlier, Mr. Khan sedated and sexually assaulted her, although she never reported an attack.The Haveeds said they visited the Khans in an effort to retrieve the videotape, but neither they nor the police found one.Both the Khan family and church members who knew the Khans dismissed the assault accusations. “If there was something with a man or a woman, why would they kill Kathy, too? Why would someone design such a brutal killing?” Rizwan Khan said.The Khans’ church, Grace Baptist, had about 40 members. The couple also operated a radio ministry and translated Scripture into Urdu.They had spent much of their careers in Iran and the United Arab Emirates, but before moving to Pakistan, they lived in Pequannock.A State Department official and Elizabeth O. Colton, the spokeswoman for the United States Embassy in Pakistan, said the embassy was working with the family and the Pakistani police to solve the case. Ms. Colton said privacy laws prevented her from commenting further.Intent as they are on seeing the mystery solved, friends and relatives of the Khans consoled themselves with the belief that the missionary life is a struggle. But even though their worst fears have been realized, the family is stunned by what happened.“We cannot explain what we are going through,” said another of Mr. Khan’s brothers, Irfan Khan. “Everyone loves their brother no matter what kind of life he had, but Arif was a man of principle, a true Christian. He never compromised anything.”'"
"'07-09-24,'0','“If Blackwater left at this moment, it might leave a security gap because most of the embassies and most of the foreign organizations that are working in Iraq” rely on Blackwater, Mr. Sheikhly said at a news conference with a spokesman for the American military in Baghdad. “This will create a security imbalance.”“That’s why the Iraqi government preferred to be patient on activating this decision to stop them,” he said. “But the government is still serious in finding certain rules” to govern private security contractors. “We would like to have some laws,” he said.Meanwhile, an American soldier was killed and another was wounded when a sophisticated roadside bomb, known as an explosively formed penetrator, detonated near their patrol during combat operations in East Baghdad on Saturday, the United States military said.A British soldier died Friday in Britain from wounds sustained in Iraq last week, the Defense Ministry said Saturday.Over all, however, the American commander in Baghdad said violence had continued to diminish in the capital. In a statement released Sunday, the commander, Maj. Gen. Joseph F. Fil Jr., said there had been a 70 percent decrease in the casualties caused by car bombs since an increase in the number of American troops in the city in mid-February. His statement also said that there had been a 125 percent increase in the rate at which car bombs were discovered by security forces before they were exploded by insurgents.Before February, just one-fifth of Baghdad’s neighborhoods were free of organized insurgent activity. Now, more than half of Baghdad’s neighborhoods have improved to the point that economic investment can begin, General Fil said.The counterinsurgency doctrine embraced by the top United States’ commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, is “clear, hold and build” — meaning that insurgents first need to be removed from neighborhoods, then the military needs to keep them from returning and then it is possible to start making investments and building up the area.However, in a signal that violence remains the norm here, 10 bodies were found in Baghdad on Sunday and there were clashes in Basra between two Shiite militias. There was also a reminder of the longstanding antagonism in Iraq toward the United Nations when a roadside bomb exploded Sunday near the organization’s former headquarters in Baghdad, which is now deserted.The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, recently announced that the international organization would have a more robust presence in Iraq and would consider expanding its offices in the northern city of Erbil and perhaps would open an outpost in Basra, in the south of the country.'"
"'07-09-24,'0','UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 23 — The Iranian government said Sunday that it would allow family members of a former F.B.I. agent they believe is missing in Iran to travel there to try to find him.The government granted the permission in a statement from its mission to the United Nations, which said it was responding to a written plea to Manouchehr Mottaki, the Iranian foreign minister, from Christine Levinson, the wife of the missing man, Robert Levinson.The statement said that Iranian authorities had “made every effort to find any clues” of Mr. Levinson’s whereabouts, but that they could not corroborate his presence in Iran.The statement said that despite the fact that “no sign of his presence in Iran has been traced so far,” the government was giving Mrs. Levinson a positive response “if this trip may in any way help allay her concern and anxiety as well as those of the Levinson family.”Mrs. Levinson said her husband disappeared March 8 after flying from Dubai to Kish, a resort island off the southern coast of Iran. Kish belongs to Iran, but it is a free-trade zone, and foreigners are not required to have a visa to go there.Mr. Levinson, 59, was an F.B.I. agent for more than 20 years until his retirement in 1998. He has since worked as a private investigator.'"
"'07-09-24,'0','Not anymore. Now, in large swaths of Mr. Sanders’s district in southeastern Queens, For Sale signs are as common as trees, as people try to bail out before losing what little equity remains in their homes. Similar scenes are found in central Brooklyn and the northeast Bronx, strongholds of minority homeowners whose fortunes have declined. While regulators have long been reluctant to rescue individuals they considered victims of their own greed or bad decisions, entire communities are now facing the consequences.“Whole neighborhoods are wiped out, crime increases, the neighborhood’s reputation goes down, quality of life is undermined, and people can’t sell their houses,” said Susan Saegert, a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, who recently completed a study of homeowners facing foreclosure. “That has already happened in Ohio and the Rust Belt. And it is starting to happen in New York.”This has not come as a surprise to housing policy analysts and advocates who have been warning about the disastrous consequences of the freewheeling subprime market. At least five years ago, they sounded alarms over the spike in foreclosures among elderly homeowners who had been persuaded to take out costly refinancing loans to do repairs or raise money for emergencies. More recently, they saw a surge of first-time buyers taking out $500,000 mortgages at unfavorable terms even though they earned only $50,000 or less annually.Sarah Ludwig, the executive director of the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, said many people — first-time buyers who relied upon one-stop shops that provided a mortgage broker, appraiser and lawyer, and homeowners who refinanced their existing mortgages — were lured by offers of low monthly payments on adjustable rate loans. But those loans could become unaffordable once the interest rates reset, as is expected to happen in the coming months for many mortgages that began in 2005.Ms. Ludwig’s group estimates that by year’s end, at least 14,700 homeowners in the city could be in default, mostly in minority neighborhoods, which she said were singled out for these loans.“We have seen for the last 10 years a very serious problem with the concentration of high-cost loans, foreclosures and people losing their homes,” she said. “What is the toll of these loans?”In many cases, when the true costs are revealed, the brokers who arranged the mortgages at unfavorable terms have long moved on with their fees, while the original lenders have already sold the loans on the secondary market to banks that used them to back securities. Increasingly, housing advocates have taken to task the big banks that scooped up these high-risk loans.“The mortgage broker and the lender know this would not work if Wall Street had not been willing to buy these loans,” said Oda Friedheim, a Legal Aid Society lawyer in Queens who deals with many homeowners. “I look at this as a civil rights issue in those neighborhoods where people thought having a home was key to building individual wealth. But what happened is the wealth people built through their hard work has been transferred to Wall Street.”Predatory lending was just part of a larger problem facing people whose budgets were already stretched thin, Dr. Saegert found in her study. In many cases, she said, family responsibilities pushed stressed homeowners over the edge. “We saw people who had relatives move into an apartment in the house and not pay anything,” she said. “They use resources but don’t contribute, and that just stretches you out more. We had one older couple who took in grandchildren when their daughter died, but they were on a fixed budget and had no way to take on the extra jobs to support them.”She noted that while people often felt shame at their financial predicament, their efforts to get help were often rebuffed by companies who handled the payments. Unaware of local housing groups that could counsel them, many homeowners skipped paying other debts, ran up huge credit card bills or fell victim to so-called foreclosure rescue scams that tricked them into signing over their deeds.“Their state of mind is the worst,” Dr. Saegert said. “The people who can legitimately help them are already overwhelmed and not looking for new clients. The people who are not legit are looking for them and they treat them nice. That is why people end up signing papers now not even thinking about it.”When Carolene Brown and her husband, Patrick, faced foreclosure on their two-bedroom home in the Bronx, hardly a week went by that they were not visited by a friendly stranger offering to help. Five times, she said, they paid $500 in cash to swindlers, who claimed they could stop the foreclosure. In time, a friend of her husband’s offered to help them save the house. Instead, she said, they wound up signing over the deed to him and had the house sold out from under them.“People always came to us to help,” said Ms. Brown, who said she has contacted prosecutors to help her reclaim her home. “I’m a strong person, and I do not like to talk about certain things. My family is big, and they could have helped me out. But I do not like to complain and ask for stuff. I always said I’d try to make this on my own.”Councilman Sanders has heard that often.“People always believe they can turn it around,” he said. “But in the end, they’re out of here and go to live with one of their children or wherever people go when they’re dying of shame.”Along the many side streets of Arverne, where low-flying planes approaching Kennedy Airport regularly drown out conversation, Mr. Sanders pointed to block after block where homes were for sale or where failed developments turned into rushed rentals. Even closer to his office in Far Rockaway, unsold town houses have been rented to people he said are receiving government subsidies.“That creates a different problem of changing the composition of the community,” he said. “They tip it from working class and middle class and into a concentration of poverty. You put people into homes who never learned how to manage living in one.”Down one block of such homes, young men darted inside at the sight of strangers. Outside another drab development, overflowing garbage cans sat atop dusty patches of weeds and gravel.“There always seemed to be an endless supply of people willing to buy these,” Mr. Sanders said. “Now the chickens have come home to roost. And the community is the one that’s hurt.”'"
"'07-09-24,'0','DAMASCUS, Syria, Sept. 23 — In a widely expected move during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, President Bashar al-Assad on Saturday pardoned criminals who had committed minor offenses, the state news agency SANA reported, but he refrained from granting a general amnesty to political prisoners.The pardon, which also granted freedom to prisoners over the age of 70 and those with terminal diseases, came just months after Mr. Assad began his second seven-year term as president, and at a time of rising public frustration at his handling of the economy.After taking power from his father, Hafez, in 2000, Mr. Assad released thousands of Islamists and political prisoners from Syrian jails in a gesture of good will that seemingly marked the beginning of a new era of political openness in the repressive country.But over the past year, human rights advocates and political dissidents have been arrested and jailed, and individual freedoms have been steadily eroding.“The people will certainly be disappointed now,” said Razan Zaitoneh, a Syrian human rights advocate. “It’s Ramadan now, and families were hoping that their loved ones would be let out of jail to spend this time at home.”'"

"'07-09-24,'0','As the fourth convergence of Advertising Week begins in New York this week, what seems to be Topic A? The flight of ad dollars online? The effect of TiVo on television commercials? Try this: how prominent a role popular brand characters like Charlie the Tuna and the Geico cavemen should play in the annual event.Since 2004, consumers have been asked each year to vote for their favorite characters to join a “Walk of Fame” on Madison Avenue. Among the nine icons elected so far: the Aflac duck, Mr. Peanut and Tony the Tiger. The first three years, organizers of Advertising Week also put on parades in Midtown that featured costumed versions of the nominated and winning characters.Some industry executives said the characters were overshadowing the more substantive aspects of the week’s events. That view was articulated most loudly by the trade publication Advertising Age, which missed few opportunities to mock their participation.Jonah Bloom, the editor of Advertising Age, owned by Crain Communications, said: “It’s not that the icons aren’t a fun part of the industry. But the industry is more sophisticated than that. An industry with smart tools to move the sales needle, that wants to attract smart people, was being represented by Mr. Clean and Mr. Peanut.”This year, while the voting for favorite characters and slogans continues at advertisingweek.com, the parade has been canceled.“Jonah didn’t kill it,” said Matt Scheckner, the executive director for Advertising Week 2007. Rather, “the parade was a huge amount of work,” he said, and “at the end of the day the return on investment just wasn’t there.”'"
"'07-09-24,'0','This approach applies nicely to another of the claims lobbed at teenagers: the “neuroscientific” assertion that teenagers lack the capacity to plan for the future.Today’s adults save less than any generation since the Depression. They have failed to mount a serious response to global warming. They have raided the Social Security trust fund and have run up a $9 trillion national debt to finance their spending and tax cuts.The hasty decision to invade Iraq and the subprime mortgage debacle also constitute failures of long-term planning.Today’s teenagers are going to have to clean up after the boomers’ oil and spending binges. Let’s hope they act more mature than their parents.A small amount of time invested toward understanding the dynamics of cultural transmission among human beings would benefit those in the scientific community. Those who proclaim that the development of the brain’s cognitive control system alone is responsible for maturational behavior are arguing against the weight of thousands of years of human social evolution.Adolescents have always been initiated into adult behavior by the tribal systems they were born into, regardless of locale or history. It was never unusual for 15-year-olds to take their place in the circle of adulthood and be accepted as thus when this occurred.Our contemporary culture does not have a very good system in place for fostering psychological maturation. Thousands of chronological adults remain in adolescence, while the adolescents themselves are not mentored to cross that maturational threshold.My practice is spent with both teenagers and adults. I have found that both age groups are searching at the deepest level for someone or something to pull them, as Robert Bly has stated, “over the line” to full psychological adulthood.While it’s true that neuroscientists don’t know everything about the brain and how it functions, we do know that adults do not suddenly become violent, irresponsible, accident-prone, beer-swilling, pill-popping reprobates in midlife.Typically, their misbehavior is only the most recent example of a longstanding pattern that began, ironically enough, in adolescence and illustrates the downside of having an adaptive brain, which can change for the worse as well as for the better.Perhaps if we had known then how experience, such as youthful experiments with addictive drugs, alter the physical fabric of the brain in long-lasting ways, or had intervened while their immature brains were still maximally pliant, more baby boomers would be good examples for their children, rather than an embarrassment to them.Debra NiehoffNewtown, Pa., Sept. 18, 2007The writer is the author of a book about the biology of the brain and violence.There may be a bigger picture than the one Mike Males presents when he reveals the hypocrisy of middle-age adults wagging fingers at adolescents.I suspect that many of these badly behaving adults come from the lower and middle economic classes.Given this era of unprecedented wealth for an exclusive few; the decline of real wages; astronomical higher-education costs; health care and housing woes; the obsolescence and theft of pensions; not to mention mergers, layoffs and outsourcing, it’s no surprise that adults increasingly turn to alcohol, crime, drugs and risky sex to escape their woes.Mr. Males has laid out the human costs of American capitalism. The remedy? Electing politicians whose ideas will create positive social and economic change for all, not for the few.It’s time we take care of the families on Main Street, not just Wall Street.'"

"'07-09-24,'0','In 1974, as Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, made plans to visit, officials offered to house him and his delegation on Governors Island or some other secluded area, and suggested he travel by helicopter or boat to United Nations headquarters. An Army helicopter ended up flying him there from Kennedy Airport, and he and his colleagues lived not in seclusion but in style, at the Waldorf Towers in Manhattan.In 1938, as Nazis persecuted the Jews overseas, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine created a special police squad to protect visiting German officials and the German consul general in New York. It was led, not by accident, by Jews: Capt. Max Finkelstein, president of the department’s Shomrim Society; Lt. Jacob Lickers; and Sgt. Isaac Goldstein. The idea had perhaps been inspired by former President Theodore Roosevelt. When Mr. Roosevelt served as police commissioner in the late 1800s, he assigned 40 Jewish police officers to keep the peace at a speech given by Hermann Ahlwardt, a visiting anti-Semitic German author.During his 1960 trip to the city, Mr. Castro complained of the “unacceptable cash demands” by the management of the Shelburne Hotel at Lexington Avenue and 37th Street. He and the Cuban delegation moved into the Hotel Theresa in Harlem instead. If forced to, he could have found housing anywhere, he told reporters, even in Central Park.“We are mountain people,” Mr. Castro said. “We are used to sleeping in the open air.”Mr. Castro, displeased with the reception at the Shelburne, the hotel that would later auction off the chicken feathers, was greeted by courteous crowds in Harlem.He and other leaders soon discover this about their trips to New York: They may be unwanted by some New Yorkers, but they are loved by others.In October 1979, when Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the deposed shah of Iran, was secretly flown to New York for treatment of a gall bladder ailment at a Manhattan hospital, anti-shah demonstrators marched outside as a plane towing a pro-shah banner flew overhead.Even President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who came to New York last September and called President Bush the devil at the United Nations, was greeted by cheers and applause — and the actor Danny Glover — the next day when he spoke in Harlem. He spoke about the cheap heating oil he was sending to poor New Yorkers and mocked the president, who he said tried to walk “like John Wayne.”Kenneth T. Jackson, a history professor at Columbia University and the editor of the Encyclopedia of New York City, said the city had more than a legal duty to accommodate controversial figures from abroad.“It’s a moral obligation as a great city,” Professor Jackson said. “New York’s record is one of toleration of difference. Political difference, ethnic difference, whatever it is. It’s not a perfect record, but it’s better than the record of any other place in the world, and it’s something we need to celebrate.”The city provides some of the most ardent critics of the United States with the same gifts it bestows on millions of ordinary tourists: the simple pleasures of sightseeing.It was unclear how much of New York Mr. Ahmadinejad, who is to address the General Assembly tomorrow, would get to see on his trip. He is allowed under international law and diplomatic protocols to travel freely within a 25-mile radius of Columbus Circle.Last night, at the New York Hilton, Mr. Ahmadinejad addressed people invited by the Iranian mission. The speech was closed to the news media.Some of those invited said that while they did not agree with all of the president’s positions on matters like the role of women in Iran, they stood behind him on the involvement of Israel and the United States in the Middle East.After the speech, some in the audience said Mr. Ahmadinejad downplayed the interest Iran had in developing nuclear weapons. Mina Z. Siegel, an Iranian-American, said he called building a nuclear weapon “a waste of money” and characterized Iranians as “very peaceful.”Another Iranian, Ali Zareinejad, 68, said: “What he said is true, a reality that the whole world needs to accept. He said we are peaceful all over the world. So we don’t need an atomic bomb.”Earlier yesterday, elected officials and students held a rally at Columbia to protest the university’s decision to invite him to speak on campus. Another demonstration is scheduled at the university today.“He should be arrested when he comes to Columbia University, not speak at the university, for God’s sake,” said Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who noted that his mother is a survivor of Auschwitz. “I call on New Yorkers to make the life of Ahmadinejad as he is in New York miserable.”About the same time, another visiting dignitary received an altogether different greeting. President Leonel Fernández of the Dominican Republic went to the Bronx, where he was given one of the highest New York honors. He threw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium.'"

"'07-09-25,'1','“The main reason behind all these attacks are the signs of improvement of the security situation mentioned in the Crocker-Petraeus report,” said Tahseen al-Sheikhly, the Iraqi spokesman for the security plan, in a reference to the recent Congressional testimony of General Petraeus and the ambassador to Iraq, Ryan C. Crocker. “The terrorist groups are just trying to say to the world that the report did not reflect the reality of the security situation in Iraq.”Mr. Sheikhly played down the recent violence, though, saying the groups were seeking publicity to compensate for their inability to conduct major offensive operations, which has been sharply curtailed by the American troop increase.Indeed, the enormous car and truck bombs that plagued Baghdad for so long have been absent in recent weeks. But the string of attacks this week served as a reminder of the insurgency’s persistence, particularly in areas outside of Baghdad and its environs.In addition to the attack on Monday in Diyala, insurgents have struck in Basra, Mosul, Kirkuk, Falluja, Kut and Samarra. The strikes occurred primarily in mixed areas of Shiites and Sunni Arabs or in exclusively Sunni Arab areas where there is fighting between Sunni Arabs tribes and extremist groups like Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.The new assassination campaign was announced on an Islamist Web site on Sept. 15, just two days after the killing of Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al-Rishawi, also known as Abu Risha, the Sunni Arab leader of the tribal Awakening Council in Anbar Province, which was leading the fight there against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.The militants announced on an audiotape that they would begin a new series of attacks to mark the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and that they would focus their efforts on rival tribal figures and collaborators. Sunni Arab militant groups have a history of using such high-profile killings to sow fear in the public and to discourage people from working with the government.That promise seemed to have been borne out in the Baquba and Samarra attacks. In both, the target was meetings in which tribal figures were discussing efforts to defeat Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.On Tuesday, in taking responsibility for the Baquba bombing, the Islamic State in Iraq said the attacks fulfilled its earlier promise to administer “painful hits” to the Iraqi government during Ramadan, according to a translation made available by the SITE Institute, which tracks extremist Web sites.Throughout the war, the Iraqi Army and the police have been regular targets of insurgents, who regard the security forces as agents of the Shiite government. In the recent incidents, several of the attackers were suicide bombers — a signature of Sunni Arab extremists — either driving cars or wearing suicide vests.The most lethal attack was Monday evening in Baquba, when a man wearing a suicide vest walked into a reconciliation meeting at a Shiite mosque in Shifta, a suburb of the provincial capital, and exploded a bomb as the gathering of several hundred people was drinking tea after breaking the daylong Ramadan fast, according to an American military report.The police chief, Brig. Ali Dlyan, was killed along with 11 other police officers, two of whom were senior commanders. There were differing accounts of the death toll, with the American military saying that 24 died and 37 were wounded, and Diyala health officials saying they received 18 bodies. The Baquba hospital reported receiving 27 with wounds.The governor of Diyala Province, who was injured in the attack, was saved from death by his bodyguards, who saw the bomber making for the governor and threw themselves on top of him. All five of his bodyguards died and the governor had to be dragged from underneath them, said a provincial official in Diyala who rushed to the scene to help with the rescue. He requested anonymity for fear of becoming a target.The attacks continued Tuesday, with the bodies of three more policemen turning up in Diyala.In Basra on Tuesday, a suicide car bomber attacked the police headquarters during the morning check-in, killing three people, including a policeman, and injuring 17 police officers.In the middle of the afternoon on Tuesday in the northern city of Mosul a suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt attacked Col. Abid Hamid, police chief of Abu Tamam, an area of Mosul, said Brig. Said al-Jubori, the police media officer for Ninevah Province. He survived, but is in critical condition.A roadside bomb exploded at dawn in Falluja as an Iraqi police patrol passed. One policeman was killed and another injured.In Kirkuk on Monday, a roadside bomb detonated near the convoy of Maj. Gen. Jamal Taher, the city’s police chief. It failed to kill him, but injured one of his bodyguards.In Samarra on Monday, a local citizens group that had gathered at the mayor’s house to organize opposition to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia was attacked by gunmen. Four people were badly injured. In Kut, the provincial capital of Wasit province, the provincial police chief, Abdul Haneen al-Amara, who took the job on Sept. 9, survived an assassination attempt on Sunday night. Gunmen opened fire on his convoy as it was driving through the northeastern part of the province.Eight bodies were found in Baghdad on Tuesday.'"
"'07-09-25,'1','He also said it was too early to determine what the long term military relationship between the two nations would be, saying it was premature to draw parallels with a place like South Korea, which senior American officials sometimes mention as a model.The crowd of several hundred people filling the mosque in the building that also houses the offices of Al-Khoei Foundation was mostly sympathetic, prone to dismiss the criticism from American senators and other officials that Mr. Maliki should be replaced. Much of that criticism centers on his failures to overcome sectarian differences in Iraq, the lack of an agreement on such key factors as dividing the country’s vast oil wealth, and his inclination to remain too sympathetic to his own Shiite faction.“He is trying to put all the Sunnis and Shiites together, but the Sunnis push him away,” said Mustapha al-Nasiri, 46, an Iraqi petroleum engineer now selling real estate in Boston. He argued that while not all Sunnis are bad, they formed the core of the Baath Party and of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a home-grown insurgent group that American intelligence agencies say is foreign led.Another Iraqi immigrant worried that all the criticism would only help Iraq’s enemies. “They make him weak,” said Hussein Al-Jabouri, a 41-year-old businessman from Dearborn Heights, Michigan. He said he also wanted to know what the prime minister’s plans were for developing mostly Shiite, southern Iraq, plans he said were long overdue.Mr. Maliki, however, was long about the difficult struggles still ahead but short on specifics.“The deeper it goes, the more complicated it gets, so Iraqi politicians stay on the surface,” said Sheik Husham Al-Husainy, a visiting cleric from Dearborn. “Besides, when it comes to Iraq, on a lot of questions only God knows.”Still, audience members like Sheik Husainy and Mr. Jabouri said they got what they came for — a little taste of Iraq.Indeed, the sponsor, Al-Khoei Foundation, one of the largest Shiite Muslim charitable and educational associations in the world, made the mosque feel a little like Iraq. The Ramadan iftar, or breakfast in Arabic, was held inside the mosque itself, known for its distinctive blue dome, near the expressway leading from Kennedy International Airport.Long plastic sheets covered the floor, with places set for as many as 100 people along one row.After extended prayers, which the prime minister joined midway, most of the crowd broke the fast with a few dates and water. Then, sitting cross-legged on the floor, they ate a meal that included lamb curry, chicken biriyani, creamed spinach, roasted eggplants, hummus and salad.The prime minister, surrounded by his top aides, sat at the end of one such row with Sheikh Fadhel al-Sahalani, the director of Al-Khoei Foundation in New York and the North American representative of Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the top cleric in Iraq.Sheik Sahalani introduced Mr. Maliki by asking everyone to say a prayer for all Iraqis and others who sacrificed themselves in fighting for the country. “We are still waiting for a change for the better,” he said.When it came to the question and answer period, some of the faithful asked when Iraq would be peaceful enough for them to visit, including making the pilgrimage to the holy city of Najaf. Shiite Islam broke away from the main Sunni branch in the fights over succession in the years after the Prophet Mohammed died in 632, with the Shiites backing Ali, the prophet’s son-in-law and cousin. A huge mosque has been built around the shrine in Najaf, where tradition holds that he was buried.“When will Najaf be safe enough to make the pilgrimage?” yelled out Azzam Mirza, a 60-year-old Indian-American.“You can come with us now!” responded the prime minister.“He said he wanted to visit, not to die there,” quipped Sheik Husham Al-Husainy, a visiting cleric from Dearborn.'"
"'07-09-25,'1','Johnson & Johnson was rebuffed yesterday in an attempt to gain the upper hand in a patent case in which its lawyers tried a high-risk tactic: highlighting safety concerns about the company’s own product.The lawyers hoped to persuade a federal judge in Delaware that because Johnson & Johnson’s drug-coated Cypher stent had been linked in clinical studies to blood clots, it fell outside the safety profile of a Boston Scientific patent.That position appeared to contradict Johnson & Johnson’s repeated assertions in its communications with doctors and the public in the past year that Cypher is no more likely to induce clots than older bare-metal stents.And it did the company no good. Judge Sue L. Robinson refused to throw out a jury verdict that the Cypher, made by the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Cordis, infringed on a Boston Scientific patent covering drug coatings. She also upheld a jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson in a separate patent case involving the design of the underlying metal stent.The Johnson & Johnson motion reflected the complexity of the legal maneuvering the companies have tried after back-to-back jury trials two years ago left them in a legal standoff. The juries decided that each company had infringed patents owned by the other.Follow-up trials in which potential damages were to be weighed have been postponed while the two companies sought to overturn the infringement verdicts. Judge Robinson made all the verdicts final yesterday. Both companies said last night that they would now proceed to appeal the verdicts against them to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.'"

"'07-09-25,'1','“In the U.S. or the U.K., you can pop into a grocery store to buy nonprescription drugs,” said James Dudley, a consultant on the industry in London. “But that’s an option that doesn’t exist in most of Europe.”Efforts to pry open the market to competition are being resisted by many politicians, who view it as an experiment, perhaps a dangerous one. “Everyone is after this because it’s big money,” said Mr. Dudley, noting that Europeans spend 40 billion euros ($56.4 billion) annually on nonprescription drugs.But for consumers, the trend toward greater competition means cheaper and more readily available treatments for simple ailments. In France, Spain and Italy, the share of nonprescription medications sold outside pharmacies last year was less than 5 percent. And with sales restricted to pharmacies, Europeans have often paid startlingly high prices for basic remedies.Consider ibuprofen, a common analgesic sold under many brand names. A 100-pill bottle of Advil in the United States can cost as little as $9. Twelve pills of Moment, the brand name here, cost 6 euros ($8.45) at a pharmacy.The guild system, whose roots reach back before the Renaissance, spins a web of protections over the pharmacists and pharmacies in the largest European cities and the smallest towns. Many countries will allow only pharmacists to own a drugstore, and each pharmacist may own only one. In lands like Italy and Spain, the number of pharmacies is limited by law — only one in a small town — and they are passed on to children like property.Pharmacists, and even some health ministries, insist that such controls are needed. “The system is justified for the protection of public health” and “to preserve the professional independence of pharmacists,” Patrick Brasseu, a spokesman for the French health ministry, said.They argue that even limited change will put high-quality pharmacies out of business and pose a potential threat to consumers like Mr. D’Ambrosio, who are so used to receiving advice from pharmacists that they may not know how to choose wisely for themselves.“Commercial chains respond to the market, not to professional needs,” said Giorgio Siri, president of Federfarma, the Italian industry trade group. “The transformation of an efficient decentralized system of 17,000 independent professionals into a system of a few huge groups that can control the market and limit citizens’ choices will have a negative effect.”Pharmacists supply health advice across much of Europe. In Italy, for example, the local pharmacist checks blood pressure. Some items, like emergency contraceptive pills, require prescriptions in the United States but can be dispensed without one in Europe because the pharmacist can advise patients before a sale.But in an age when simple nonprescription drugs are sold even at gas stations and airport shops in Britain and the United States, governments in the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Poland and the Czech Republic have begun to crack open the old system and are allowing the chains to move in, making these medications more widely available.Two years ago, Norway changed its laws to allow nonprescription drugs to be sold outside pharmacies and opening the market to drugstore chains. Now, 98 percent of the country’s pharmacies are part of chains like Celesio, Boots and Phoenix. In Germany, a Dutch online drug retailer, Doc Morris, is seeking to purchase a pharmacy, challenging a German law that limits ownership to pharmacists.A recent European Union consultation said the system “protects the monopoly held by existing pharmacists, to the detriment of consumers and competition.” The European Commission, the union’s executive arm, is challenging restrictive ownership laws in several countries.Part of the divide in how nonprescription medicine is sold in North America and Continental Europe stems from a history of different health care systems. In the United States, where people often pay out of pocket for doctors’ visits and medicine, there have long been efforts to minimize office visits and to sell nonprescription drugs directly to consumers and in bulk to minimize costs.In Europe, with its government health programs, office visits were free, as was medicine, including nonprescription drugs, if recommended by a doctor. So European patients have felt far less pressure to become knowledgeable consumers about medicine and to make some treatment decisions themselves.As state systems became financially strained in recent years, that generosity has ebbed, and Europeans in many countries are now paying for basic medicine. That, in turn, has led to more consciousness about costs and a willingness by patients to educate themselves.There are cultural issues, too — although they are being quickly overcome by consumers. The Italian customers here at the Carrefour in Assago, just outside Milan, scrupulous readers of food labels, tend to look at medication cartons from afar, knowing little about brand names and ingredients.Massimo Caemi brought a friend to help him look for something for an infected finger. “Eccola!” — here it is — he said as the pharmacist-in-residence guided him to a shelf containing tubes of antibiotic ointment.“I think it’s great and about time,” Mr. Caemi said after he learned to navigate the drug displays. “And it’s 20 percent cheaper than at the pharmacist’s.”'"
"'07-09-25,'1','The Americans will play host to defending champion Russia from Nov. 30 to Dec. 2 in a city that will be announced later this week but appears likely to be Portland, Ore. The surface will almost certainly be a quick indoor hard court or carpet. “We’re going to try to export all of the clay out of the state of Oregon for the tie,” Roddick cracked at his postmatch news conference.Clay has indeed been the biggest barrier to American success in the 12-year drought since they last won the Cup in 1995. With neither Roddick nor any of his sidekicks particularly effective on the surface, opposing captains have routinely rolled out clay to greet them.The French did so when they beat the Americans in 2002 in the semifinals in Paris. The Spanish certainly did so when they beat them in the finals in Seville in 2004. The Russians then laid down indoor clay in the semifinals in Moscow last year when they eked out a 3-2 victory, with Roddick losing his singles matches to Marat Safin and, in an epic match that stretched to 17-15 in the fifth set, to Dmitry Tursunov.The Swedish captain Mats Wilander took a less conventional approach: laying down a fast indoor carpet that suited his team and the United States, too. He might have looked smarter if Thomas Johansson had not fallen ill and been scratched from Sunday’s reverse singles matches. Facing the 35-year-old Bjorkman, Roddick won in straight sets to give the United States an insurmountable 3-1 lead.Johansson was not the only player to miss a match during the long weekend of Davis Cup play. In the other semifinal, won, 3-2, by Russia over Germany in Moscow, Tommy Haas was unable to play singles Sunday because of a viral infection.Roddick has never played the will-he-or-won’t-he game. Since joining the team in 2001, he has missed only one match for the United States, which might have affected some of his tournament results but does make him the most committed top American player since John McEnroe.That particular McEnroe proved a less committed captain, resigning after one season in 2000. He was replaced in the chair by his brother Patrick.Patrick has a less polarizing personality, and he has fostered a team ethos, which has not been difficult considering how well this generation of American players appears to get along.“I know we talk about it ad nauseam, but I really do love the guys that I play with,” Roddick said. “They’re like brothers.”Patrick McEnroe has also accepted the risk of picking the doubles team of the twins Mike and Bob Bryan, even though neither is an effective singles substitute in case Roddick or James Blake is injured. They have repaid McEnroe’s confidence, compiling a 12-1 record in the Cup.All the United States is missing is the Cup to go with the camaraderie, and though this is clearly the Americans’ best chance since 1995, the Russians have a clever tactician in the longtime captain Shamil Tarpishchev. They also have the depth to adjust to any surface with Nikolay Davydenko, Mikhail Youzhny, Igor Andreev, Tursunov and maybe Safin, who reportedly cut short his expedition in the Himalayas last week and plans to return to the circuit this season if his latest left wrist injury heals.Roddick, who failed to reach a Grand Slam final this year, certainly sounds eager.“As a kid I had four dreams that I thought were just completely out of reach,” Roddick said. “One was to win the U.S. Open. One was to be No. 1. One was to win Wimbledon, and one was to win Davis Cup.”The first two have been checked off. The third may never be if Federer keeps playing like Federer on English grass. But the fourth is within reach and, for a change, close to home.'"
"'07-09-25,'1','SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 24 (AP) — Apple warned on Monday that iPhone owners who have used unauthorized programs to unlock the cellular service feature of their handsets may end up with a phone that does not work after the company’s next software update.Since the iPhone made its debut in June, hackers have posted a number of methods online to make it possible to use iPhones on cellular networks other than that of AT&T, the exclusive official carrier.Apple executives say they have discovered that many of those unauthorized unlocking programs damage iPhone software. A software update that Apple plans to issue later this week that will add features such as accessibility to the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store may end up making the cellphone completely inoperable if it has been altered.“This has nothing to do with proactively disabling a phone that is unlocked or hacked,” Philip W. Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president for worldwide product marketing, said in an interview. “It’s unfortunate that some of these programs have caused damage to the iPhone software, but Apple cannot be responsible” for those consequences.As with any Apple product, hacking will void the warranty of an iPhone, Apple said.Apple has sold over a million iPhones since the device hit the market June 29.'"
"'07-09-25,'1','Facebook is seeking a minimum valuation of $10 billion but interested bidders have expressed a willingness to value it as high as $13 billion, on the assumption that, in the future, Facebook will become a powerful player in the online world.These numbers might have little basis in actual revenue or profit. Facebook is a private company and does not reveal its income. But earlier this year, a Pali Research analyst, Richard Greenfield, estimated that the company brought in $60 million to $96 million in annual revenue, with no real profit. Much of that revenue comes from a year-old advertising relationship with Microsoft, which places display advertisements on the site.Mr. Greenfield said the investment price that Microsoft was considering might have more to do with keeping the prize out of the hands of its powerful rivals. “There may be competitive reasons to be connected to this asset beyond what the specific valuation is today,” he said. “You may be paying a premium to keep others out.”The lack of a track record for Facebook might actually be driving the price up. “Trying to delineate a value today of what was a new industry five years ago is challenging right now,” Mr. Greenfield said.Last September, Yahoo was in acquisition talks with Facebook. It reportedly offered $900 million to buy the site outright and was rebuffed by Mr. Zuckerberg, the 23-year-old chief executive, who has said that he was determined to keep the company independent and take it public through an initial public offering.Google and Microsoft are jockeying for a stake in a social networking site that is said to be creating a new way for Internet users to meet people and interact with friends on the Web.In May, Facebook redefined itself as a platform, allowing other companies to create features like games, photo-sharing tools and music players that run in Facebook.That strategy, just four months old, has unleashed a flood of interest in the company, with thousands of independent software developers creating a range of programs for the service.“We have this situation where every developer worth his salt here in Silicon Valley seems to be working on a Facebook application,” said Charlene Li, an analyst at Forrester Research.Facebook is full of activities, from the goofy, like “biting” friends with a virtual vampire, to the more utilitarian, like seeing what parties and events Facebook friends are attending. There are more than 4,000 third-party applications on Facebook, the company said.The strategy has drawn plenty of attention and new users to the site. Facebook has more than 40 million members, up from 9 million last year.There may be personal reasons that Facebook would align itself with Microsoft, according to a person with knowledge of the companies’ executives. Mr. Zuckerberg has a personal friendship with Ray Ozzie, Microsoft’s chief software architect and one of the people stepping in for Bill Gates, the co-founder who is giving up his day-to-day responsibilities at the company.Also, Jim Breyer, a managing partner at the venture capital firm of Accel Partners and one of three Facebook board members, was an investor in Groove Networks, Mr. Ozzie’s company, which Microsoft purchased in 2005.The discussions between Microsoft and Facebook were first reported Monday on the Web site of The Wall Street Journal.'"
"'07-09-25,'1','Automotive companies, for example, reported more research into hybrid electric vehicles, while chemical companies said they were developing storm-resistant construction materials and crop-protection products.But there was little agreement among companies within industries on the effect of climate change. Boeing, for example, said it had not identified any “specific physical risks” from climate change, while Northrup Grumman detailed the damage that “severe weather conditions” could cause its operations.More troubling to the project’s executives, though, is that few companies include climate-related data in their filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The result, the report said, is that the ramifications of climate change have not yet translated into “concrete investment decisions on any scale.”The project released the report, which included responses from 1,300 companies, at a standing-room-only event yesterday at Merrill Lynch headquarters in Lower Manhattan. The data is available at www.cdproject.net.“We provide a huge stage on which corporate actors can say their piece to investors,” Mr. Dickinson said.There was ample star power on stage. Harold E. Ford Jr., the former congressman who became a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch this year, moderated.Former President Bill Clinton gave the keynote address, in which he said that the United States was way behind countries like Denmark and Britain, which had created many jobs from the process of curbing greenhouse gases. He cited plentiful “anecdotal evidence” that curbing climate change can be an economic boon to wealthy and emerging nations alike.“But I can’t prove that,” he said, “because we don’t have the data and systems in place to demonstrate the likelihood of best outcomes.” The project is important, he said, “because the payouts are measurable only if you keep score.”Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, appeared on video, reiterating his company’s commitment to curbing global warming. And John Fleming, the vice president for merchandising at Wal-Mart Stores, announced a pilot program that his company is initiating with suppliers of seven common items — DVDs, toothpaste, soap, milk, beer, vacuum cleaners and soda — to measure and reduce the amount of energy they use.“We are reaching out to the next generation of consumers, who may well choose stores on the basis of climate change practices,” Mr. Fleming said.The project is working with Wal-Mart on that initiative, and Mr. Dickinson said he hoped to set up similar collaborations with automotive and aviation companies, consumer products manufacturers, and other retailers.“We look forward to other global corporations following Wal-Mart’s lead,” he said.While the overall tenor of the written report and the oral presentations was optimistic, there were notes of caution. The project operates on the honor system, in that there is no independent verification by which to judge corporate claims. In fact, the report specifically cautions investors against acting on unverified information.Nor are environmentalists uniformly supportive of the report. The Rainforest Action Network displayed banners outside the event, protesting Citigroup and Bank of America — both companies that reported low levels of emissions — for continuing to invest in coal projects. The carbon project “does ask about that, but it is an often ignored question,” said Brianna Cayo Cotter, a spokeswoman for the Rainforest Action Network.'"

Donald Sutherland plays Patrick (Tripp) Darling III, an elder statesman with a wily side; Tripp’s tippling wife, Letitia, is played by Jill Clayburgh; and the eldest son, Patrick Darling IV, the New York attorney general, is played by William Baldwin.Alex is a Cuban immigrant who was adopted by Pancho Duque (Hector Elizondo) and his wife, Amalia (Rita Moreno), after his parents died. Alex married Pancho’s daughter, Isabel, and is Pancho’s favorite to run the family rum business, a decision that infuriates the eldest Duque son, Frank (Nestor Carbonell).The Duque family has important connections and powerful enemies, chief among them the Samuelses, rival growers who resent their Cuban neighbors’ success and want to take their land.Clashing clans are a device that dates back to the days of “Dallas” and “Dynasty.” The main distinction is that the Duques are Hispanic, first- and second-generation Cubans who speak snatches of Spanish to one another, words that are dutifully translated in subtitles.The Samuelses are sleazy and conniving, but CBS is careful to keep Mr. Smits in a positive light — he is a loving husband, caring father, fair employer and loyal surrogate son. And that strips the drama of at least one layer of mystery: the heroes and villains are distinct and unlikely to change sides.Manichaean characters work on soap operas as long as they come with plenty of machinations. Unfortunately, there are no J. R.’s in sight on “Cane,” and the one Samuels with Alexis Carrington potential, Ellis, is played by a surprisingly subdued Polly Walker. Ms. Walker, who was sexy, slithery and manipulative as Caesar’s niece Atia in “Rome” on HBO, is so unsuspicious in the premiere that she might as well be Caesar’s wife.On “Dirty Sexy Money” Nick is a do-good lawyer who was estranged from his own father, mostly because he resented the way his father’s work as the Darling family lawyer sucked up all the free time and attention. When Nick’s father dies, however, Tripp coaxes him to take his father’s place and he reluctantly agrees, over the objections of his wife and the needs of his small child.His new job demands a lot more than handling trusts and estates. At first sight, the Darling siblings fit into easy stereotypes. While fending off the sexual advances of the slutty older sister, Karen (Natalie Zea), Nick has to corral the twins, Juliet (Samaire Armstrong) — a Paris Hilton-ish celebutante — and Jeremy (Seth Gabel), a dissolute little playboy lost. Another brother, Brian Darling (Glenn Fitzgerald), is an Episcopalian minister with a family and also an illegitimate son, and he hates Nick with unbridled passion.But Nick’s biggest burden is Patrick (Mr. Baldwin), a family-values Senate candidate whose private life includes a sultry transgender lover, Carmelita (Candis Cayne).Over time, the Darlings grow more complicated and surprising. The Duques remain single-faceted.“Cane” could use less sugar and more spice. “Dirty Sexy Money” lives up to its name.Created by Cynthia Cidre; Ms. Cidre, Jonathan Prince, Jimmy Iovine, Polly Anthony, Peter Noah, executive producers; Jimmy Smits, co-executive producer.

"'07-09-25,'1','After three games against the Devil Rays, the Yankees will end their season against the Baltimore Orioles.The Yankees (90-66) might have felt deflated over squandering an opportunity to close the gap on Boston, but it certainly did not show. Per team custom, all the rookies dressed in costume for the final trip. This year’s theme was “The Wizard of Oz.”Joba Chamberlain boarded the bus dressed as the Cowardly Lion. Phil Hughes was the Tin Man, Shelley Duncan was the Scarecrow and Ian Kennedy was Dorothy. The movie’s soundtrack played as the players packed their bags.“I got to have fun with it,” Kennedy said, looking embarrassed by his wig and dress but then slightly amused by the swell of reporters at his locker. “It’s kind of hard when you’re Dorothy, but you got to.”As the Yankees walked out of the clubhouse, they passed over a mock yellow brick road. They hope it leads to more home games in October.The Yankees have enjoyed a home-field advantage in more ways than one this season, finishing 52-29 at Yankee Stadium. Only the Los Angeles Angels have won more games at home (54). The Yankees’ unofficial attendance of 4,271,356 was a franchise record, according to the club.As impressive as that record was, Yankee Stadium lacked energy yesterday. The game was a makeup for a rainout April 25. All of the tickets were sold, but the stadium was more than half empty.Day games are rarely played on Mondays for a reason.“You could definitely tell it was a makeup game, let’s put it that way,” said Andy Pettitte, who lost for only the second time in 11 starts.Pettitte (14-9) surrendered three runs in the second inning and another in the third as the Blue Jays jumped to a 4-0 lead. He lasted six innings and said afterward that he felt great the entire time.But the Yankees’ offense was held scoreless through five innings by Jesse Litsch, a rookie right-hander who was a late replacement.A. J. Burnett had been scheduled to start but was scratched because of a personal emergency.Litsch handcuffed the Yankees, who have won 14 of their past 18 games, by throwing cutters, curveballs and changeups, and by getting ahead in the count. The Yankees cut their deficit to 4-1 on Alex Rodriguez’s sixth-inning groundout. But they did not mount another charge.“You’ve got to give him credit, too,” Derek Jeter said of Litsch. “He wasn’t walking anybody and was pretty much hitting all his spots.”The Yankees were playing their third consecutive day game, a scheduling oddity. The first two combined lasted more than eight and a half hours. Doug Mientkiewicz said the team was thankful it could sleep on the plane to Florida.The Yankees were also thankful during yesterday’s finale. Throughout the game, the video screen behind right-center field played clips of different players thanking the fans for their support. The Yankees can truly show their gratitude by returning home for a postseason appearance.“Seriously, I don’t sit around and think about wild card, division or anything like that,” Jeter said.“Like I said two months ago, if we go out and win our games, at the end of the year, we’ll be where we want to be. You shouldn’t change that now.”If Roger Clemens is unable to start today at Tampa Bay, Kei Igawa or Matt DeSalvo will probably get the nod, Joe Torre said. Clemens has been bothered by soreness in his left hamstring. The Yankees would like him to pitch at least a few innings before the playoffs, should they make it that far, Torre said.'"
"'07-09-25,'1','But a billionaire doesn’t have to answer to voters. You can take the long view of Mars as our next home, a wilderness to be “terraformed” into a livable backup planet in case of disaster on Earth. And you can get to Mars much more quickly and cheaply than NASA, because you can avoid pork-barrel spending and you can take more risks. It’s not a public scandal when private explorers make fatal mistakes.Robert Zubrin, the head of the Mars Society, figures a private explorer could get there within a decade for $8 billion to $10 billion, and a good chunk of that cost — maybe all of it — could be offset with revenues from media rights and marketing tie-ins. Elon Musk, the Paypal founder who’s now building rockets in his new company, SpaceX, guesses it could be done for just $5 billion.“It would be neat to have a one-time $5 billion mission to Mars,” he told me, “but $5 billion is still far too much. There’s no way that we could establish any kind of base on Mars or any kind of self-sustaining biology there. We need to get that first mission to under $1 billion, and then the later missions down to under $100 million.”Mr. Musk says his goal is to help establish a colony on Mars by lowering the cost of launching payloads into space, but his company’s not ready to go up there until the venture looks profitable.Sir Richard Branson is in a similar position with his new company, Virgin Galactic, which is hoping to make money by taking customers on suborbital flights.“We’d leap at the chance to go Mars,” he told me, explaining that he’d be glad to start working on it if NASA offered prizes for entrepreneurs who came up with the best plans and pieces of hardware for the mission. The prizes would be a wonderfully cheap way to spur innovation, but NASA and Congress show no interest in offering them.So for now it takes someone with deep pockets to aim for Mars. If you don’t want to put up all the cash yourself, you could form a consortium, like the Peary Arctic Club that financed the attempts to reach the North Pole, or the private investors who joined Ferdinand and Isabella in sponsoring Columbus.There’s also a clever way that you could raise money — and stoke public interest — while retaining control. Offer everyone a chance to ride on your spaceship. You could run a straight lottery on the Internet, or sell shares in a corporation that gave each shareholder a ticket in a lottery. There could be regular drawings, with each winner getting a chance to undergo training and testing with the astronauts.The grand winner, the one who gets a seat on the spaceship, could be chosen either by you or by the public. Imagine the ratings for “Martian Idol.” (If you’d like to see some preliminary market research on the lottery, check out tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com, where I’m asking nonbillionaire readers how much they would spend on tickets.)I think you could more than break even on the expedition, but maybe it sounds too complicated. If you’re too busy to organize an expedition yourself, you could instead offer a prize or a series of prizes (and let the X Prize Foundation manage it for you). By putting up $5 billion, preferably more, you might start a competition as exciting as the race to the South Pole a century ago.A prize would be blessedly simple for you, but it does have one drawback. Although prizes spurred many of the early feats in aviation, we remember the winners, not the sponsors. How many people know that a New York hotelier named Raymond Orteig put up the $25,000 prize won by Charles Lindbergh for flying from New York to Paris?But everybody remembers the Spirit of St. Louis, just as they remember the Santa Maria and the Mayflower and Apollo 11. So here is my last piece of advice. Whether you offer a prize or send your own expedition, insist that the ship carrying the first humans to Mars be named after you. Sure, you’ll be accused of egotism, but pay the critics no heed. They’ll be dead soon enough. Your name will live forever.'"
"'07-09-25,'1','In Europe, cultural attitudes have long been hostile to business jets, given the association with vulgar tycoons flying their poodles to the Côte d’Azur. That has changed.Part of the shift can be explained by the growth of NetJets. The company, founded by Richard T. Santulli and now a Berkshire Hathaway holding, started a European subsidiary in 1996. It sells fractional ownership of business jets and also markets per-hour flying in increments of 25 hours.The European venture wasn’t an instant success, Berkshire Hathaway’s chairman, Warren E. Buffett, said in his annual letter to investors for 2006.“After five years of operation there, we had acquired only 80 customers,” he said. “And by midyear 2006, our cumulative pretax loss had risen to $212 million. But European demand has now exploded, with a net of 589 customers having been added in 2005-6.” NetJets, he said, “is now operating profitably in Europe.”In the business jet industry, where sales have been growing annually since 2003, Honeywell’s annual forecast, considered a bellwether, is eagerly anticipated. The forecast said that deliveries of business jets next year were expected to be around 1,300, or 300 more than this year.Rob Wilson, the president of Honeywell Aerospace’s business and general aviation division, said he thought hard-nosed business decisions were driving growth abroad. A weak dollar against the euro is part of the reason, he said. But most of the European sales are because of the rapidly growing number of charter operations, rather than sales of company planes.In Europe, he said, “a businessperson often has the need now to be in several cities or countries in the same day.”“Although ground transportation and air transport is efficient in Europe, this really opens up new waves of productivity for these people.”Business jets can fly into more than 1,000 airports in Europe, compared with about 100 airports for commercial airlines.In Asia, sales are being driven partly by growing demand for trans-Pacific flights on long-range planes. Across the board, long-range business jets will account for more sales than any other segment of the market, Honeywell said. Over the five years of the forecast, the United States will take about 49 percent of deliveries; Europe 22 percent; Asia 15 percent; Latin America 10 percent; and the Middle East and Africa region 4 percent.In a recent interview, Mr. Santulli of NetJets marveled at the vast wealth driving this growth. He also said that not all of the big long-range luxury jets, like Gulfstreams, are ferrying teams of executives across the seas.“Take a wild guess. What do you think the most common city pair for our Gulfstream fleet is?” he asked.“Not even close. It’s New York to Washington, D.C.,” he said.'"

"'07-09-26,'1','The next census is in 2010. But whether the Census Bureau has the means to ensure the accuracy of the count — which determines everything from how federal aid is apportioned to how many Congressional seats are given to each state — will be decided this week. Right now, the portents for an accurate count are not good.By Friday, Congress is expected to pass a stopgap funding measure to keep the government operating through mid-November. It would hold government spending at last year’s levels and give Congress and the White House more time to try to iron out their differences on the actual appropriations bills.Many parts of the government can hold spending flat for a while. But this close to a decennial census, the Census Bureau cannot — even for six weeks. The bureau is currently ramping up for a full dress rehearsal for the next census. If funding is not forthcoming, the rehearsal will have to be scaled back or canceled.That would virtually guarantee a flawed census. The rehearsal has been an integral part of the census since 1970. It tests and fine-tunes every detail of the process, including recruiting census takers, advertising, mailing questionnaires and coordinating the computer and statistical systems used to scan, tabulate, analyze and compile the results.Especially imperiled by a funding delay is a contract for the hand-held computers that the bureau intends to use for the first time in 2010.It is still possible to make an exception in the stopgap measure to ensure the necessary funding for the census. Mr. Bush requested full funding for the bureau’s preparatory efforts in his 2008 budget, so there is no disagreement about the money. And at the White House’s request, several other exceptions are in the works, including additional spending for the Department of Homeland Security to detain illegal immigrants.'"
"'07-09-26,'1','In 1982, he took an unpromising site in Pawling, N.Y., and fashioned it into a 150-acre sculpture park called Top Gallant. He ran it until 1996, and displayed large-scale works by Mr. Caro, Alexander Liberman, Alexander Calder, Mark di Suvero and George Rickey as well as the work of emerging younger artists like Keith Haring. A swimming pool had its inside painted with mock waves by Mr. Hockey.Always interested in the work of ancient peoples, Mr. Emmerich mounted insightful exhibitions of pre-Columbian art and classical antiquities. He became an authority on pre-Columbian art, lecturing and writing two books on the subject: “Art Before Columbus” (1963), and “Sweat of the Sun and Tears of the Moon — Gold and Silver in Pre-Columbian Art” (1965), a scholarly survey. He stopped showing the work because of increasing export restrictions.In 1996, Mr. Emmerich sold his gallery to Sotheby’s but continued to direct it. After a run of 45 years, however, it was closed by Sotheby’s in 1998.Mr. Emmerich had recently worked on an autobiography, “My Life With Art,” excerpts of which have been published in Art News, The Wall Street Journal and The New Criterion.André Emmerich was born in Frankfurt on Oct. 11, 1924, to Hugo and Lily Emmerich. Feeling the rise of anti-Semitism in Germany, they took André, at age 7, and his younger sister, Nicole, to Amsterdam. In 1940, when he was 15, the family emigrated to the United States, settling in Queens. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1944 at the age of 19.For 10 years he lived in Paris, where he was a writer and editor, working at Réalités and Connaissance des Arts magazines, the Paris edition of The New York Herald Tribune and Time-Life International. But, interested in art and following the example of his mother’s father, an art dealer in Paris, he left publishing to return to New York and devote himself to representing artists.His early choices were much influenced by the critic Clement Greenberg, who favored the Color Field painters and Anthony Caro sculptures. In an excerpt from his autobiography published in The New Criterion in December 2004, Mr. Emmerich acknowledged Mr. Greenberg’s influence but pointed out that the gallery also showed work by artists who did not have that critic’s support, like Mr. Hockney, Mr. Francis and Mr. Held.Although some of his artists were what might be called hot properties, Mr. Emmerich did not approve of buying art for investment. “Art has much more to do with the gut than with anything else,” he once told an interviewer.Mr. Emmerich twice served as president of the Art Dealers Association of America and remained active on its board.In addition to his wife, Mr. Emmerich is survived by his sister, Nicole Teweles of Milwaukee; three sons from his earlier marriage, to Constance Emmerich, Adam and Noah, of New York City, and Toby, of Los Angeles; and four grandchildren.A meticulous man, Mr. Emmerich did not hesitate to show his displeasure when a staff member left the top off a marking pen. On the other hand, Mr. Caro said, speaking by telephone from his studio in England, Mr. Emmerich showed great aplomb when dealing with his sometimes-trying stable.“It was amazing how he got on all of our wavelengths,” Mr. Caro said. He added: “He was loyal. He tried to do a hard thing, bringing difficult art to the public and never worrying how it was received. If it didn’t go, he stuck with it.”'"
"'07-09-26,'1','In a move that seems calculated to provoke Viacom, DreamWorks Animation SKG, the animation company controlled by Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, yesterday announced that Tom Freston, the former chief executive of Viacom, was joining its board.The appointment comes as tensions run high between Viacom and its DreamWorks film unit, a separate company also founded by Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Geffen and Mr. Katzenberg that Viacom’s Paramount Pictures bought in 2005 for $1.6 billion.At a recent investment conference, Philippe P. Dauman, who succeeded Mr. Freston as the head of Viacom a year ago, said that the company would do just fine even if it lost the services of Mr. Spielberg.“The financial impact to Paramount first and especially to Viacom over all would be completely immaterial in the event somebody shows up to help them start a studio from scratch,” Mr. Dauman said.That remark so angered Mr. Katzenberg that in another session of the conference he described Mr. Spielberg as a “national treasure.”This year, DreamWorks produced several moneymakers for Paramount, including “Norbit” and “Disturbia,” and co-produced “Blades of Glory” and “Transformers,” which alone took in more than $300 million at the domestic box office.There has been widespread talk in the entertainment industry that Mr. Geffen and Mr. Spielberg, who signed contracts with Viacom when they sold DreamWorks, would not renew them when they end in 2008. Their relationship with Brad Grey, Paramount’s chairman, has been testy for some time.'"
"'07-09-26,'1','about an hour’s drive from Manhattan. It was one of three places on Long Island where the authorities said that dealers cooked up steroids. Two were less than five miles apart, one on Verdi Street and the other in a new upscale development in Melville.At the labs, raw ingredients were pressed into pills or cooked into injectable liquids and supplied to a sprawling underground distribution network for steroids, human growth hormone and other illicit bodybuilding drugs, according to the complaint.On Monday, federal authorities announced the results of a two-year investigation that they called the biggest crackdown on illegal steroids in the nation’s history.It resulted in the arrests of 124 people, including nine Long Islanders who were accused of running sophisticated rings of mail-order steroid sales involving large quantities of ingredients from China.The operation revealed a much wider trade in performance-enhancing drugs than previously known, with a collection of bathroom and basement manufacturers and distributors. That contrasted with more centralized drug manufacturing operations in past years.On Long Island alone, federal and state agents reported seizing nearly 2.5 million doses of steroids, with a street value of roughly $13 million. The dealers engaged in illegally manufacturing and selling anabolic steroids over the Internet, the authorities said, and tried to avoid detection through anonymous e-mail services and password-protected chat rooms.Customers contacted encrypted e-mail addresses and often sent cash to post office boxes.“There was a definite local customer base on Long Island. However, the clientele was also outside this jurisdiction — they didn’t just cater to Long Island,” said Teri Corrigan, chief of the street narcotics and gang bureau for the Nassau County district attorney’s office, which worked with federal agents on the investigation.She said that many sellers advertised on bodybuilding chat rooms and online bulletin boards, and that investigators placed Internet orders for steroids and observed sellers mailing packages. Web site operators are suspected of using savvy techniques to screen customers by checking their e-mail addresses to see if they had a history of visiting bodybuilding Web sites.“They did not want first-time visitors,” Ms. Corrigan said. “We had to establish some credibility before placing an order.”The idea of rampant steroid sales on Long Island came as no surprise to bodybuilders at the local gyms favored by young men with bulky physiques.The term Strong Island is used frequently, especially among bodybuilders and rappers, to convey swagger and toughness.Richard Schultz, 16, a junior at Farmingdale High School, said many athletes he knew took creatine, a legal substance used to help build muscle mass.“I have heard rumors that one kid is doing steroids,” he said Tuesday after school. “There are always rumors that someone is doing it.” He added, “I heard you can get steroids on the Internet, but I am not doing it.”James Roth, 45, said that the gym he used in Queens was shut down recently by the authorities because of reputed steroid sales there.“There are two types of gyms: bodybuilding gyms and those gyms you use to just stay in shape,” he said. “The bodybuilding gyms have the drugs, lots of free weights and grunting. That is the difference.”A Melville man, Christopher Lance, 36, who was arrested on Sept. 12 on drug-possession charges after officials said he ran a steroid lab out of his home, committed suicide last week, shortly after being released on bail. Mr. Lance was arrested along with his wife, Debra Rosenbach, 33, and his mother, Karen Lance, 55, in connection with the case.At her house in Massapequa, Mr. Lance’s grandmother, Mary Smith, said on Tuesday that Mr. Lance was married five months ago and moved to the Melville house. She said she believed he killed himself because of “the shame his arrest brought upon our family.”“He couldn’t believe they’d put his mother in jail because of what he might have done, and he killed himself out of love for his family,” she said. “His car was in the shop, and he gave his mother a package to mail, and they go and arrest her.”Ms. Corrigan said her office was eager to diminish the supply of steroids on Long Island, where young people are susceptible because of an emphasis on athletics, peer pressure and concerns about their bodies.“We have a county filled with athletic children,” she said. “And the last thing that D. A. Kathleen Rice wants is for our children to think it is accepted behavior to take steroids to look better or perform better at athletics.”'"
"'07-09-26,'1','Under the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, which was written in part to limit the entry of communists or their sympathizers, the United States has had a history of barring prominent intellectuals. Those denied entry visas over the years under McCarran-Walter have included the writers Gabriel García Márquez and Graham Greene as well as political figures like Pierre Trudeau, long before he became prime minister of Canada.“It sometimes does seem that what the government has done is taken the communist-era playbook and replaced every instance of the word communist with terrorist,” said Jameel Jaffer, an A.C.L.U. lawyer who said those excluded rarely appeared to be national security threats.Critics also say the exclusions are making Americans increasingly isolated from international opinion. They say that at a time when the United States is seen by many foreigners as arrogant, it is important to admit foreigners and to let them express their opinions, if not necessarily endorse them.“We see it as violation as our First Amendment rights as Americans to engage in international ideas and with international figures face to face,” said Larry Siems, director of Freedom to Write at the PEN American Center, an international organization of writers. “To impose new barriers at the border is an act of international antagonism.”Supporters of exclusion say the A.C.L.U. and other organizations are ignoring the welter of opinions that reach Americans, and some argue that exclusions made under the USA Patriot Act are weaker than the 1950s legislation.“What the A.C.L.U. and those extreme liberal groups are trying to do is focus a magnifying glass on a small part of the picture rather than focus on the entire picture,” said James R. Edwards Jr., an immigration expert and adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute, a Washington public policy group.“There are certainly some diverse opinions from foreigners that are voiced regularly in this country,” Mr. Edwards added, pointing, for instance, to the speech on Monday by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran at Columbia University.The lawsuit filed yesterday, in Federal District Court, names as defendants — in addition to the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security — Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, and Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security. It seeks to force the government to issue a visa for the South African Muslim academic, Adam Habib, who has been a vocal critic of United States foreign policy in the Middle East.Other organizations who joined the lawsuit, and who had sought Mr. Habib as a speaker, included the American Sociological Association, the American Association of University Professors, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the Boston Coalition for Palestinian Rights.Mr. Habib, who obtained his doctorate from the City University of New York, was a frequent visitor to the United States until his visa was revoked last October.Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the State Department would comment on the lawsuit.'"
"'07-09-26,'1','When students ask when they should apply, Mr. Fox said, colleges always answer, “The earlier, the better.”“The colleges are thinking about building their freshman class,” he continued. “We thought that being accepted to college should be a 12th-grade activity. Actually, a lot of high school counselors thought it should be pushed back later, until the second semester of senior year. If juniors are going to be accepted to college, what are the implications for senior year?”Even among elite institutions, the admissions calendar is up for debate. Last year, Harvard and Princeton announced that they were ending early admissions and hoping others would follow suit, both to allow students to compare financial aid offers and to tone down the admissions frenzy.“I think it will improve the climate in high schools,” said Derek Bok, then Harvard’s interim president, “so that students don’t start getting preoccupied in their junior year.”The University of Virginia followed their lead, but the rest of the Ivy League, and hundreds of other elite colleges and universities, did not.A few, like Yale, offer early admission without requiring a commitment to attend. But many highly selective universities now lock in a third or more of the freshman class through binding early decision. Students who promise to enroll if admitted can apply in the fall and have an answer by mid-December. Colleges are reluctant to tamper with a mechanism that helps them predict and shape freshman enrollment early.“We’re happy with where we are, so we’re not thinking of changing it,” said Tom Parker, the admissions dean at Amherst, where almost 30 percent of this year’s freshmen were admitted by early decision.Given Harvard and Princeton’s withdrawal from early admissions, Amherst and other elite colleges are expecting early applications to increase this year.At community colleges and less-selective state universities, competition is not the issue; most applicants are accepted, and students with good grades and scores may be guaranteed admission and aid. Most of these institutions use rolling admissions, and give students until May to commit. So why all the fuss about Sept. 15, they ask?“If you look at admitting a student between June after junior year or waiting three months, what difference does it make?” said Larry Moeder, director of admissions at Kansas State University.At colleges like these, the issue is less calming admissions anxieties than ramping up the pressure to attend college. Open-door community colleges like Iowa Lakes, in Emmetsburg, Iowa, use admissions offers as a springboard to academic counseling.“We don’t screen them in any way for acceptance,” said Anne Stansbury of Iowa Lakes, who opposes the Sept. 15 policy. “Then, after they’re accepted, we talk about what they need to be successful in college. It’s a carrot you can hold in front of the junior who doesn’t want to take senior math, to say, ‘You’ve been accepted, but you’re not going to be prepared unless you take that class.’”A survey by the national association two years ago found that about a quarter of the colleges that responded, most not very selective, said they had made some admissions offers before the September of senior year.In letters to the national association, Michigan public universities and some Big 12 universities said admitting students before Sept. 15 lessened pressure on students beginning their senior year.At its annual meeting this weekend, the association will consider a proposal allowing most colleges to admit students any time after junior year, and giving open-admissions colleges like Iowa Lakes the right to accept students at the time they apply.Whether it will pass is uncertain.“There’s been a very lively debate over our e-mail list, and at this point, it’s anybody’s guess how it will come out,” said David Hawkins, director of public policy for the admission counseling association.'"
"'07-09-26,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (AP) — The Treasury Department on Tuesday announced the formation of two advisory groups to develop recommendations for best practices in the operation of hedge funds, the giant pools of capital that were heavily involved in the recent turmoil in the financial markets.The groups were formed under the direction of the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, an interagency panel started after the 1987 stock market crash that seeks to improve market operations.One advisory group will comprise investors in hedge funds and the other will be composed of asset managers.Russell Read, chief investment officer for the giant California Public Employees’ Retirement System, will be chairman of the investors’ committee. Eric Mindich, the chief executive of Eton Park Capital Management, will head the asset managers’ committee.Mr. Read said he expected to come up with some recommendations by the end of the year. The groups will make their suggestions available for public comment before they become final.'"
"'07-09-26,'1','LOS ANGELES, Sept. 25 (Reuters) — A California appeals court declined on Tuesday to reinstate a long-running case against the Walt Disney Company over royalties it paid for its popular Winnie the Pooh character.In 2004, a Los Angeles trial court dismissed the case brought by the estate of Stephen Slesinger, the agent who helped popularize Winnie the Pooh in the United States, on the grounds that the Slesinger legal team illegally obtained documents by trespassing on Disney property.Mr. Slesinger’s widow and daughter sued Disney in 1991, saying the media company had underreported Pooh sales and owed the estate billions of dollars in royalties.A spokesman for Mr. Slesinger’s daughter, Pati, said she would appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court and would proceed with a federal lawsuit against Disney.A Disney lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, said the state case “never had merit from the outset.”'"
"'07-09-26,'1','Mr. McAndrews’s proposed system, called “conversion attribution,” would track all of the online places where consumers see ads and give advertisers a fuller picture of the various ways that consumers reach them. Tracking is important, because the site that gets credit for prompting a user’s visit is the one that gets paid for it.Mr. McAndrews contends that search engines, which long have claimed credit for sending people to companies’ Web sites, do not deserve it all.“Google gets all the credit, and in fact, you might have just gone to Google to type in the U.R.L.,” Mr. McAndrews said, pointing out that people often search for companies’ names after seeing their ads elsewhere.Using technology from aQuantive’s Atlas division, Microsoft will be able to provide advertisers with a log of all the places on the Internet where people see ads before going to the advertisers’ Web sites. The data is based on individual computers’ electronic signatures, not individual people.Atlas, which delivers online ads to Web sites, has been working on such a system for more than a year and is running pilot tests with it. DoubleClick introduced a similar technology in July.But Atlas contends that the system will be expensive to deploy without Microsoft, because it requires vast server capacity to analyze billions of ad impressions each day, said Young-Bean Song, a vice president of Atlas. He said that Microsoft would be able to use the new tracking capability to prove the value of its ad space, much of which is unrelated to search.“Microsoft recognizes that in order to get TV dollars and traditional advertising dollars, you need this type of measurement to really show this value; otherwise the answer over and over again is: ‘buy more search,’” Mr. Song said. “All the portals, including MSN, have a lot to gain from this.”While this system is still a work in progress, Microsoft today will announce a more modest advance: changes to the MSN Video site that are supposed to make the ads there less intrusive and more ubiquitous. This development is a response to Google’s announcement in August that its YouTube site would overlay advertisements on the bottom of some online videos.MSN Video will play fewer video ads in a session, but increase the reach of the ads by showing them once every three minutes. Until now, video ads have appeared at the start of every two clips, even if those clips were only 10 seconds long. The change is also meant to make sharing videos easier, which MSN hopes will encourage more online video watching.Since announcing the deal to buy aQuantive, Microsoft has been expressing its online advertising ambitions more loudly. “We are hell-bent and determined to allocate the talent, the resources, the money, the innovation, to absolutely become a powerhouse in the ad business,” said Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, at the company’s financial analyst meeting in July.He pointed to aQuantive as a crucial piece of the plan during his speech. “We’re emerging, but we’re also looking to redefine the way online advertising gets done, because we have so much smaller a footprint than the two market leaders,” he said, referring to Google and Yahoo. “This is a chance to invest in, or to reinvent and rethink the whole business model of online advertising,” he said.Microsoft has signed up more than 80,000 advertisers since introducing its Ad Center hub in May 2006. The company wants to offer advertising throughout its product line, and says it has technology to predict many details about Web users, ranging from where they come from to whether they intend to make a purchase. This summer, Microsoft opened a research center dedicated to online advertising.The company also named Mr. McAndrews the senior vice president of a new advertising unit, the advertiser and publisher solutions group. His assignment will be to build what Microsoft calls its advertising “monetization engine,” and his group will oversee advertising products across some of Microsoft’s own Web sites, cellphone and game platforms as well as on thousands of other publishers’ sites.Both aQuantive and DoubleClick have built pipelines that send ads to Web sites each time someone logs on. The companies serve as middlemen between advertisers and Web site owners, exporting banner ads, videos and text ads to land on the right Web sites at the right times.“We’ve been competing with DoubleClick for years,” Mr. McAndrews said. “Google, if that deal closes, is obviously an industry leader, a formidable player.”But, he said, “it’s a long game. We’re not going to, you know, count this by the number of outs in the first inning. We’re going to look at this as a nine-inning game.”Unlike DoubleClick, which does not own an advertising agency, aQuantive owns Avenue A Razorfish, the agency where the technology for Atlas was incubated. When Atlas was made into a separate business unit in 2001, it was a controversial decision, Mr. McAndrews said, because some people within the agency feared that the technology was a “secret sauce” that should not be shared. But Atlas became successful in its own right, and Avenue A Razorfish now makes up less than 10 percent of its revenues, he said.The Atlas technology was a big attraction for Microsoft, and people in the online ad business suggest that Avenue A Razorfish may be sold. But Mr. McAndrews said that the agency business was important to retain because it provided firsthand insight about the needs of advertisers.'"
"'07-09-26,'1','WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 — The White House on Tuesday withdrew the nomination of John A. Rizzo to become the Central Intelligence Agency’s top lawyer amid mounting opposition from Democrats over his role in the harsh interrogation of C.I.A. detainees.The nomination of the 32-year agency veteran to become general counsel is the most prominent casualty of the partisan fight over the spy agency’s program of detaining and questioning top terrorism suspects since the Sept. 11 attacks.The Senate Intelligence Committee had been scheduled to vote on the nomination on Tuesday, but it has been clear for weeks that it was doomed in the face of strong Democratic opposition and only tepid support from Senate Republicans.Mr. Rizzo has been the C.I.A’s acting general counsel on and off for most of the past six years, including the period in 2002 when the Bush administration was constructing a legal foundation for the agency’s then-secret detention and interrogation program.At a Senate hearing in June, Democrats pressed Mr. Rizzo about whether he agreed with a 2002 Justice Department memorandum that gave legal guidance to the C.I.A. program. The memorandum argued that nothing short of the pain associated with organ failure constituted illegal torture.'"
"'07-09-26,'1','SUSSEX, Va., Sept. 25 (AP) — Michael Vick and three co-defendants were indicted by a grand jury Tuesday on state charges related to a dogfighting ring operated on Vick’s property in Virginia.Vick, the suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback, was indicted on one count of beating or killing or causing dogs to fight other dogs, and one count of engaging in or promoting dogfighting. Each count is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.The grand jury declined to indict Vick and two co-defendants on eight counts of killing or causing the death of a companion animal, which would have exposed them to as many as 40 years in prison if convicted.Vick has already pleaded guilty in federal court to a dogfighting conspiracy charge and is awaiting sentencing Dec. 10.Gerald G. Poindexter, the Surry County Commonwealth’s attorney, asked that the four be arraigned Oct. 3 and requested that each be released on a $50,000 personal recognizance bond. None of the defendants or their lawyers were in court.“We are disappointed that these charges were filed in Surry County, since it is the same conduct covered by the federal indictment for which Mr. Vick has already accepted full responsibility” and pleaded guilty, Billy Martin, one of Vick’s lawyers, said in a statement.Martin said the charges would be examined to ensure that Vick “is not held accountable for the same conduct twice.”'"
"'07-09-26,'1','PARIS, Sept. 25 — A group representing some of the world’s leading banks will urge the United States and other industrial nations this week to move quickly to introduce a lightly regulated system for trading carbon emissions permits.Permit-trading systems offer banks a potentially vast new business. For it to grow, leading economies — particularly the United States — will need to set limits on the quantities of greenhouse gases that can be released and to allow companies in other parts of the world to buy emissions permits.“Where politicians opt to implement carbon constraints, then it should be cap-and-trade,” said Imtiaz Ahmad, head of emissions trading at Morgan Stanley in London and vice president of a lobbying group called International Carbon Investors and Services, which is being created to represent the banks.The banking companies, which include Citigroup, Lehman Brothers Holdings and Morgan Stanley, are giving strong signs that Wall Street wants Washington to open the way to reduced emissions using a trading system based on the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement the United States did not ratify, rather than by enacting carbon taxes.The group also includes European institutions like BNP Paribas, Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank, as well as niche investment banks like Climate Change Capital and the law firms of Baker & McKenzie and DLA Piper.'"
"'07-09-26,'1','Microsoft has sold nine million Xbox 360s since the introduction of the console in 2005. But Nintendo has sold just as many Wii machines since their debut late last year, largely because their simplicity appeals to a broader group of players. The PlayStation 3, which also was introduced in late 2006, has sold about four million units.Halo 3 might also help to restore the Xbox 360’s image, which was tarnished by serious design defects that caused as many as a third of the machines to suddenly stop working. Microsoft said it had corrected the problem and was fixing defective units at no charge.For the serious gamer at least, all was forgiven yesterday morning. More than 10,000 stores across the country, many of them converted into miniature carnivals Monday night for fans awaiting the game, opened their doors to long lines of Halo fans who started camping out as early as Sunday afternoon.Microsoft said it would not announce sales figures until today, but the new game has been expected to be the most lucrative introduction of any entertainment product. The previous game in the series, Halo 2, set a record for first-day sales in the entertainment and media industries when it brought in more than $125 million in the United States in its first 24 hours.“In our first few hours on sale, all signs indicate that we will indeed have achieved the biggest entertainment retail day in history,” Microsoft said in a statement.“This is the Mecca of the video game world right here, right now,” Carl Gunther, a 23-year-old marketing researcher from Brooklyn, said Monday night as he joined hundreds of other fans in a long line outside a Best Buy in Midtown Manhattan.“Halo is the ‘Star Wars’ of this generation,” Mr. Gunther added. “Thirty years ago my father waited in line to see ‘Star Wars,’ and I know I’ll tell my kids I stood in line to buy Halo 3. It’s like saying you were at Woodstock or something.”Microsoft’s shares rose yesterday by 1.7 percent, closing at $29.56, on the expectation of strong sales. The Halo franchise, which has sold more than 15 million copies since its introduction in 2001, has been Microsoft’s most successful foray into the entertainment business, anchoring the growth of the video game unit.Sony of Japan, one of Microsoft’s main competitors in games, has struggled to provide comparably popular titles for its PlayStation 3 console. Games exclusively for the PlayStation 3 this holiday season include the fantasy diversions Lair and Heavenly Sword.While Sony and Microsoft have focused mostly on young men, the core base of video game players, Nintendo of Japan has pursued a different strategy of appealing to broader demographic groups with easy-to-use products like its Wii console and DS (for dual screen) hand-held player. Super Mario Galaxy, potentially the Wii’s biggest seller of the year, is expected to be introduced in November.Halo 3, a science-fiction game set in a future when humanity is battling for its survival against a hostile alien species, has generally received excellent reviews in game publications. The game has been produced in 17 languages and is being released in Europe today and in Japan tomorrow. One potential hiccup is that in some cases the packaging for the $70 version can scratch the game disc; Microsoft said yesterday that it would replace any unusable discs.In Atlanta, an arc of young men lined a balcony at Lenox Square, the city’s biggest shopping mall, as they awaited the game’s debut at a GameStop store. Ari Velazquez and Dan Gibson, roommates at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said they had converted their apartment into a sort of high-tech video game cave, sealing windows with blankets and cardboard and stocking up on ramen noodles, chips and white-cheddar popcorn.“We expect that, like, no one’s going to go to class tomorrow, and the teachers are going to know,” said Mr. Gibson, 20.The narrative of the Halo series is fairly standard science-fiction fare. Halo 3 begins in the year 2552 and an alien alliance called the Covenant is continuing its quest to dominate the galaxy by activating immense ring-shaped doomsday devices called, unsurprisingly, Halos.An interstellar commando known as Master Chief, controlled by the player, must stop them, not through negotiation but rather with an arsenal of high-powered weapons.Halo 3 completes the saga, and the fate of Master Chief and the series’ other characters has been a subject of as much speculation among game players, as the eventual outcome of Harry Potter was among readers of fantasy fiction.“We’ve been in Internet seclusion for like weeks,” to avoid any leaks about the game’s plot, Mr. Gibson said. Mr. Velazquez gestured toward the balcony in the Atlanta mall and added, “If I found out the ending of the game right now, you’re going to have to hold me back from jumping.”Joseph Hunter, 19, a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, said the series has “sort of become an obsession” and said entire dormitories at Morehouse face off against one another in Halo combat.Regarding Halo 3, he said, “I knew that if I didn’t have it, my life would be over.”Halo 3 is rated M for mature, which means the game is not intended for sale to unaccompanied consumers under 17. Most customers in line appeared to be in their 20s and 30s, but there were also children accompanied by parents or other guardians.Outside a Circuit City store in Miami on Monday night, Patty-Jo Toor, a nurse from Orlando, accompanied her son, Neil, 16, and two friends, Phillip Allanson, 15, and Alex Ferguson, also 15. She said the group had set up an Xbox 360 in their hotel room so the children could play all night after buying the game.“All three of these kids got good grades in school, so I brought them here,” she said. “They are worth the drive.”Naturally in this self-conscious media age, for some fans the lure of transient celebrity was perhaps as appealing as Halo 3 itself. Outside the Best Buy store in Manhattan, the first person in line, Uche Nwachukwu, a 28-year-old Web site designer from Staten Island, said he had been waiting since 6 p.m. Sunday.“I camped out for Halo 2, and I camped out for the 360 itself, but I was always third in line or fifth in line,” he lamented Monday afternoon, standing by his red folding chair with a bag of Starburst candy on the seat. “This time I was determined to be first. I won’t lie to you, I wanted to be on TV and in the newspapers. I’ve slept about 20 minutes since I got here, but it’s been worth it.”'"
"'07-09-26,'1','Nearly 50 years after Frank Lloyd Wright chose a paint chip for the color of his beloved Guggenheim Museum, New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Commission agreed to consider the museum's request for the correct hue to be applied to the 1959 building. The museum is seeking the commission’s permission to paint the exterior in Benjamin Moore HC-35, an egg-finish shade recommended by outside conservation experts, as they found it was the closest match to a paint chip that was signed by Wright and stamped July 24, 1958. The commission’s approval is needed because of the Guggenheim’s status as a protected landmark and its location in the Carnegie Hill historic district. Experts say the building’s original coat was supposed to be the darkest of three samples of a color called Cocoon. Instead, the building was coated in the lightest of the three Cocoon samples, with no clear explanation, the landmarks commission said. A thorough analysis of the museum’s finish has revealed as many as 12 coats of paint, including four grayish-white layers applied since 1992; four buff layers applied from the 1960s back to the 1950s; the original light Cocoon; and, finally, the blue primer. According to the analysis, Wright’s intent was always to coat the building in an egg finish. “He apparently hated white,” said Elisabeth de Bourbon, a commission spokeswoman.Correction: September 27, 2007  Because of an editing error, a report in the ""Arts, Briefly"" column yesterday about plans to paint the Guggenheim Museum misstated the action taken by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on an application by the museum to paint its exterior in a different shade. The commission said it would consider the request; it did not clear the way for the painting.'"
"'07-09-26,'1','“Lucia di Lammermoor” is a tale of rival families, and poor Lucia is caught in the middle. Her brother, Lord Enrico Ashton, panicked that he has squandered the family holdings through his obsessive battling with the hated Ravenswood clan, wants Lucia to marry the wealthy Lord Arturo. But she has fallen for the Ravenswood heir, Edgardo, whose passion is in some ways as oppressive as her brother’s bullying. Lucia has become a fragile thing who keeps seeing a ghost of an ancestor who was killed by a jealous Ravenswood lover.Ms. Zimmerman has done some miraculous work in the theater, including her adaptation of Ovid’s “Metamorphoses.” She is newer to opera, and her work here, though compelling, seems less confident. As she has said in recent interviews, “Lucia” is sometimes milked for psychological subtexts, sometimes treated as historical melodrama. A director could present Lucia’s ghostly visions as evidence of her shaky mental state or as a real part of the world Scott depicts.Ms. Zimmerman opts to do a little of both these approaches, which could have been a recipe for disaster. Not here, for the most part. The sets deftly mix abstract and storybook imagery: in the first scene, for example, where a mossy mound of grass and brush sits atop shiny geometrical floorboards, with a background of leafless trees.In trying to make the phantoms of the opera real, Ms. Zimmerman sometimes goes too far, as in Lucia’s first scene, when she appears at the fountain where she has met Edgardo and encountered the ghost. Ms. Dessay looked both striking and pitiable in her sensible walking dress, complete with hat and boots. But as Lucia tells her companion, Alisa, of the ghost she has seen, singing the alluring aria “Regnava nel silenzio,” we see the ghost, a haunted, pasty-faced young woman, who beckons Lucia.Though a powerful image, it proved a distraction to Ms. Dessay’s lustrous singing. Sometimes in opera the music alone is the drama, especially when performed as vibrantly as it was here.Ms. Zimmerman also seems to have been impatient with the dramatically static sextet in Act II, when the distraught Lucia, duped into thinking Edgardo unfaithful, marries Lord Arturo. Edgardo comes bursting into the wedding party, and everything stops as the justly famous sextet begins. Donizetti meant for the main characters to be frozen in place as they mull over their own thoughts. Nothing happens. That’s the point. The tension is internalized in the soaring and elegant music.Instead Ms. Zimmerman invents an action: the wedding participants and guests are assembled by a photographer for a formal photo. Though the moment is beautifully directed, this staging device, again, overwhelmed the stirring performance.But mostly Ms. Zimmerman has imaginative staging ideas and elicits nuanced portrayals from the cast. In Ms. Dessay’s first scene Lucia breaks into an ecstatic cabaletta to sing of her heady love for Edgardo. Racing about the stage as she sang, Ms. Dessay, in midphrase, skidded on a floorboard and fell down. Born actress that she is, she just kept singing, shrugging her shoulders as if to say, “What are you going to do?,” then finished the aria in triumph. Her response was actually in character for a young woman all giddy in love.Staging and singing worked in tandem arrestingly during Lucia’s Mad Scene. The set was almost abstract, just a bare balcony and spiral staircase against a backdrop of blue night sky and moon. The crazed Lucia, having stabbed her husband to death on their wedding night, appears on the balcony to the terrified guests. With her huge, vacant eyes, just as in those posters all over town, and her bloodied dress, Ms. Dessay moved not with halting steps but in nervous spurts. When she recalled melodic phrases from the love duets, she sang in a voice by turns tremulous, pale, throbbing and unsettlingly brilliant.Ms. Dessay’s Edgardo was the Italian tenor Marcello Giordani. His singing was not flawless. He sometimes bellowed and lacked pianissimo subtlety. Still, he has genuine Italianate style and an exciting, robust voice. Mariusz Kwiecien has emerged in recent seasons as a major baritone. This handsome and dynamic young Polish artist was a vocally impassioned Enrico, who made that sometimes flat character seem in ways as desperate as the sister he controls.The commanding bass John Relyea brought rare dignity to the often cardboard role of Raimondo, the chaplain who advises Enrico, causing no end of trouble. An appealing young tenor, Stephen Costello, had a solid Met debut as the well-meaning Arturo.Presiding over it all was Mr. Levine, who conducted with pliant bel canto grace while keeping the overall performance taut, crisp and articulate. This familiar score has seldom sounded so virile, sweeping and multilayered.When Mr. Levine appeared for curtain calls, Ms. Dessay bowed and touched the stage floor in tribute. She probably thinks photographs of Mr. Levine should be plastered all over New York as well. She looks better and will sell more tickets, especially when word gets out.Opera in three acts by Gaetano Donizetti; libretto by Salvatore Cammarano, after Sir Walter Scott’s novel “The Bride of Lammermoor”; conductor, James Levine; production by Mary Zimmerman; sets by Daniel Ostling; costumes by Mara Blumenfeld; lighting by T.

"'07-09-27,'1','Ms.Rice called on conferees to agree on a long-term goal for greenhouse gas reduction; to set individual mid-term national targets — “Every country will make its own decisions, reflecting its own needs and interests,” she said — and to work with private industry to develop energy technologies.But critics in Europe and elsewhere say that approach will allow countries to avoid the tough choices they say are needed to slow climate warming and temper its disruptive effects: a rapid retreat of sea ice, and precipitation changes that have brought droughts and floods, damaging crops.They favor tough new standards under a treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, signed by 170 countries but rejected in 2001 by President George W. Bush. The Kyoto pact expires in 2012. The Europeans and others are looking toward a U.N.-sponsored conference this December in Bali, Indonesia, to move closer to those goals.In a speech at the U.N. earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany made her view clear: Contributions to fighting climate change from individual countries or groups of countries were welcome, but could “never be a replacement for a post-Kyoto agreement under the umbrella of the United Nations.” She called for global emissions to be halved by 2050.Washington conferees may seek to gloss over their differences. The meeting was expected to issue only a “summary” of various nations’ plans or commitments.European officials have complained openly about the American approach as possibly helpful, potentially a distraction, but in any case insufficient.But Jim Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, insisted today that the conference was meant to supplement, not undercut, the Bali meeting. “The goal of our discussions here today is to do what we can to reinforce and to accelerate progress in the United Nations,” he said.Yvo de Boer, the top U.N. climate-change official, welcomed the Bush administration initiative as a complement to his organization’s efforts. “I think that this initiative of President Bush can be a very significant contribution,” he said.Boyden Gray, the United States. ambassador to the European Union, argued today against European suspicions that the Washington conference was meant to subvert the U.N. climate change process or the Bali conference.By calling together only representatives of the largest economies, Mr. Gray wrote in the Financial Times, the Bush administration was seeking to avoid what he called a “sclerotic U.N. process” that was “being hobbled by an unwieldy number of participant countries.” The U.N. process, he added, involved “an endless series of international conferences” that “produce no discussion or new facts.”Mr. Gray also mentioned another “undercurrent of suspicion” in Europe that because the Bush administration is not widely trusted to support the Bali negotiations, “the world should wait to see what happens in the 2008 elections.” But realistically, he said, that would mean waiting at least until 2010 for serious action, given the time it would take a new administration to engage with the issue.“The world cannot afford to wait that long,” he wrote.'"
"'07-09-27,'1','New home sales in August plunged to their lowest rate in over seven years, as tighter credit and rising inventories continued to cripple a national housing industry that was booming only a year ago.Purchases of new homes fell to an annual rate of 795,000, an 8.3 percent decline from July, as inventory levels rose to their highest level since March, the Commerce Department said this morning. The median price for a new home was down 7.5 percent from a year ago, to $225,700, marking the steepest monthly price drop since December 1970.The sales figures were released as KB Home, a major home builder, reported a $35.6 million loss in the third quarter, or 46 cents a share, compared to net profits of $153.2 million a year earlier. KB Home, based in Los Angeles, had a 32 percent drop in revenue from the same period last year.KB was forced to write down almost $800 million in inventory and goodwill value after the subprime mortgage crisis caused turmoil in the credit market and high rates of foreclosure. Those losses outpaced the company’s gains from selling its 49 percent stake in a French subsidiary. The company’s stock was up 0.54 percent, to $24.22, in early trading.The latest data gave a fuller picture of the distress in the housing sector. This morning’s news comes on the heels of a 4.3 percent drop in existing home sales and a dismal third-quarter report from Lennar, another large home builder, which recorded the largest quarterly loss in its history. The rate of new home sales is now down over 21 percent from a year ago.“Our third-quarter results reflect the seriously challenging market conditions that prevail for home builders across most of the nation,” KB’s chief executive, Jeffrey T. Mezger, said in a statement. “At this time, we see no signs that the housing market is stabilizing and believe it will be some time before a recovery begins.”'"
"'07-09-27,'1','OTTAWA, Sept. 26 — The Canadian police charged the founders of a once-wealthy hedge fund, now bankrupt, with fraud on Wednesday.Boaz Manor, who left Toronto for Israel after the collapse in 2005 of the fund, Portus Alternative Asset Management, was charged with 13 counts of fraud, three counts of money laundering, and one count each of obstructing justice and possession of property obtained by crime.His former partner, Michael Mendelson, was charged with a dozen counts of fraud, as well as money laundering and crime-related property possession.In a statement, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said money collected from about 26,000 clients, mostly Canadians, was not placed in investments as Portus promised. Instead, the police said, some of the money was used to finance Portus’s operations or was paid to its executives and employees in a variety of ways, including management fees, performance fees and salaries.'"

"'07-09-27,'1','As the poorest state in the country, Mississippi should have no trouble finding low- and moderate-income homeowners to share in the more than $5 billion in emergency federal aid funneled into the state after Hurricane Katrina.But a startling new analysis by a coalition of state and national housing advocates accuses Mississippi of using loopholes in the law to spend far too much on middle- and upper-income households and far too little on those most in need of help.The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the program, needs to take a close look at how Mississippi is spending that money.The aid was channeled through the Community Development Block Grant program, which was set up by Congress in the 1970s to improve housing for the poor and provide a better quality of life and more economic opportunities. The law requires states and localities to spend 70 percent of the money they receive on projects that will clearly benefit low- and moderate-income people.After Katrina, Congress lowered that requirement to 50 percent for the Gulf Coast states, partly because people at all income levels had lost their homes. That seemed reasonable, given the nature of the emergency.Low-income housing advocates were rightly uneasy about a second provision that allowed the Gulf Coast states to waive the income test altogether for some projects. They feared that the states would use waivers to reward cronies and boost pet projects. Indeed, Mississippi’s critics now claim that only about 20 percent of the money spent so far has gone to help low- and moderate-income families.'"
"'07-09-27,'1','PRINCETON, N.J., Sept. 26 — Gov. Jon S. Corzine, making his first public appearance since having surgery nine days ago on the leg he broke in a near-fatal car crash, appeared eager Wednesday to let New Jerseyans know that his recovery was not distracting him from the task of running their state.At a news conference on the back terrace of Drumthwacket, the governor’s mansion here, Mr. Corzine spoke at length on a range of issues, from the potential impact on New Jersey if Congress does not override President Bush’s expected veto of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program to refinancing the New Jersey Turnpike so the state can pay down its heavy debt load.Mr. Corzine stood unassisted for nearly 30 minutes, occasionally shifting his weight from one leg to the other while taking questions from reporters.He showed few outward signs of being under any physical strain from the injuries he sustained in April, when the speeding Chevrolet Suburban he was riding in slammed into a guardrail after swerving to avoid a pickup truck. Mr. Corzine, who was not wearing a seat belt and was tossed from the front passenger seat to the back, broke his thigh bone in two places, 11 ribs, his breastbone, collarbone and a lower vertebra.He spoke about the progress of his recovery only after he was asked by a reporter whether he felt he was making enough progress on his campaign pledges. “I feel pretty good about where we are and the kind of things that we’ve done,” he said. “Do I feel satisfied? No. And is there a lot of work to do? Yes.”He drew an analogy between his injured left leg and the progress his administration has made. “Every day, I work on this leg to make sure that it gets stronger, more flexible and will be better. But I’m not out running a 100-yard dash today. I’m not about to do the things that I was able to do before I got injured.”Most of the news conference, however, focused on topics unrelated to his health. He said that the Bush administration’s position on the child health insurance proposal was “morally reprehensible.” Advocates say the program would provide coverage to 10 million children in need, and Mr. Corzine predicted that failure to enact the bill could cost New Jersey $65 million to $70 million.'"
"'07-09-27,'1','People close to the consortium said J.C. Flowers had told those at the meeting that the group was prepared to walk away, expecting Sallie Mae to begin talks on a new accord.Instead, the meeting ended abruptly — some executives walked out — and Sallie Mae immediately issued a statement contending that the investor group was violating its contract.If the deal falters, the student lender would become the biggest casualty of the recent market turmoil. Last month, Home Depot was pressed to renegotiate the sale price of its professional supply unit down by 17 percent, or $1.8 billion, amid the credit crisis and the housing market problems.On Friday, the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the investment bank Goldman Sachs announced that they planned to back out of the $8 billion buyout of Harman International Industries, arguing its business had deteriorated.And on the same day, the footwear retailer Genesco filed a lawsuit in a Tennessee state court in an effort to force a rival retailer, the Finish Line, to complete the $1.5 billion merger that it had said it would abandon.Sallie Mae appears to be trying to call the investor group’s bluff. In a statement, Sallie Mae’s parent, the SLM Corporation, said that it “firmly believes that the buyer group has no contractual basis to repudiate its obligations under the merger agreement and intends to pursue all remedies available to it to the fullest extent permitted by law.“The investor group may be taking a risk by claiming it is prepared to walk away. If a court were to rule that Sallie Mae’s business did not deteriorate as a result of the new legislation or the recent turmoil in the credit markets, the investor group would be forced to pay Sallie Mae $900 million.It is unclear whether that payment would be shouldered equally by all investors or if the banks would pay most of the fee. If J.C. Flowers or Friedman Fleischer & Lowe were forced to pay the fee, they would have to tap capital from its investors, automatically recording a major loss.Shareholders still appear to be betting that talks will continue and a deal will be struck, albeit at price in the low-$50 range.Shares of Sallie Mae fell last week from $48.55 share to $46.25 after The New York Times reported that an investor group planned to renegotiate the price. They declined again yesterday, closing at $45.01, down $1.24.Yesterday marked the first time the two sides had broached the subject of renegotiating the price despite not-so-subtle hints for several months. Last month, Sallie Mae disclosed that the investor group had questioned whether the legislation, which is expected to be signed into law today, could represent a material adverse change, thus undoing the agreement.At the time, Sallie Mae has argued that the impending law does not constitute a material change, citing disclosures in its annual report that mention more onerous proposals. Sallie Mae contends that the legislation will reduce net income by 1.8 percent to 2.1 percent a year over the next five years.After the report last week, Sallie Mae issued another statement: “Our contract is with Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, two of America’s largest and strongest banks. We expect these banks to honor their commitments under that contract, not breach the contract.”Some people close to the investor consortium said that the statement infuriated James Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of America’s chairman and chief executive, because it appeared that Sallie Mae was trying to embarrass the banks into completing the deal, without citing J.C. Flowers, the leader of the buyers.'"

But Torre said he seemed fine, noting that Steinbrenner was annoyed at Tuesday’s extra-inning loss.“I said, ‘How are you doing?’ and he said, ‘Not so good,’ ” Torre said. “I knew right away he was fine.”CLEMENS TO STAY IN TAMPA Roger Clemens will stay behind when the Yankees leave for Baltimore on Thursday night. Brian Cashman said Clemens would continue working out at the Yankees’ complex in Tampa as he tried to recover from a strained left hamstring.Clemens played catch Wednesday and is resting his legs in hopes of making a playoff start. The Yankees want him to throw a simulated game before clearing him for their playoff roster.Asked if he was confident Clemens would be a part of the playoffs, Joe Torre said, “We’ve got to be a part of it first, and when that happens, we’re confident he will be, too.”MARCH TO 3,000 HITS Derek Jeter recorded his 200th hit of the season Tuesday, giving him six seasons with at least 200. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, that is the most 200-hit seasons by a shortstop in major league history.Jeter, 33, entered Wednesday’s game with 2,350 hits, and is a near lock to get 3,000. He already has more 200-hit seasons than Willie Mays, Dave Winfield, Rickey Henderson, Carl Yastrzemski, Eddie Collins, Robin Yount, Craig Biggio, Rafael Palmeiro and Cap Anson combined.All of those players had at least 3,000 career hits. Among players in the 3,000-hit club, only Pete Rose, Ty Cobb, Paul Waner and Wade Boggs have more seasons with 200 hits than Jeter.DIVIDING THE MONEY All of the Yankees who were here Wednesday and have been on the roster the entire season took part in the annual playoff-shares meeting before batting practice.Mike Mussina, the team’s union representative, tallied up the number of days each player has spent on the roster, and gave the full-season players that information. The meeting is held to determine how much of a share each player and staff member should get. Players who have spent all season on the major league roster or disabled list (or five and a half months on it, in Carl Pavano’s case) are automatically given a full share.Last season, a full share for members of the World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals was worth $362,173.DUNCAN’S CHANCE Shelley Duncan started at designated hitter against the Tampa Bay left-hander J. P. Howell on Wednesday, and Joe Torre said he planned to start him against another lefty, Scott Kazmir, on Thursday. Duncan would seem to have secured a spot on the postseason roster as a power bat off the bench, but Torre wants to see more.“We have to make some decisions,” Torre said. “Having Duncan out there against lefties, we have to see what we can see. If Shelley’s going to get any time here, it’s going to be against left-handers.”HOME RUNS ARE NICE, BUT ... For all his impressive power numbers this season — 53 homers, 151 runs batted in through Tuesday — Alex Rodriguez stressed the importance of small ball Wednesday.“Home runs are not what’s going to win in October,” he said. “It’s going to be doing the little things, hitting balls the other way, taking walks. If you run into one or two, that’s awesome. But playing the little game is what’s going to be productive, for me and everyone.”'"

"'07-09-27,'1','Boeing receives “lavish” government subsidies that give it an unfair competitive edge over its rival aircraft maker Airbus, the European Union told the World Trade Organization at a hearing yesterday.The two-day proceeding is the first time that judges have heard the European Commission’s aircraft subsidies case against Boeing and comes after a complaint by the United States about aid granted to Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, France and is the biggest producer of commercial aircraft. The European Union says Boeing has received $23.7 billion in Defense Department and NASA research subsidies, as well as state and local funding.“The core of the E.U.’s challenge is the lavish R.&D. support, as well as Boeing-specific support” from state governments, said the commission, the European Union’s trade authority. “The support clearly aims at weakening Airbus’s position and competitiveness and boosting that of Boeing.”The European Union and the United States filed countercases in September 2004 over aid to Airbus and Boeing, the only two makers of large commercial aircraft in a $150 billion market. Together, the challenges are the largest to go before the World Trade Organization. Efforts to resolve the dispute by replacing a 1992 accord that set limits on government financing for the plane makers have failed.The United States presented its argument last November, saying government subsidies to Airbus in the form of risk-free grants amounted to $23 billion over the last four decades, or $205 billion if interest is included.At the heart of its case is the argument that the European Union offers loans below commercial rates and that Airbus uses the loans to begin new projects and repays them only if the aircraft are commercial successes.Each side has accused the other of supplying inaccurate data. The commission says the United States “grossly inflates the numbers” on Airbus support, while the United States argues that the European Union unfairly counts as government grants $10.4 billion that Boeing received from NASA for research services.'"
"'07-09-27,'1','“This is right at the heart of the problem,” said Susan Crawford, a visiting professor at the University of Michigan law school, referring to the treatment of text messages. “The fact that wireless companies can choose to discriminate is very troubling.”In turning down the program, Verizon, one of the nation’s two largest wireless carriers, told Naral that it does not accept programs from any group “that seeks to promote an agenda or distribute content that, in its discretion, may be seen as controversial or unsavory to any of our users.” Naral provided copies of its communications with Verizon to The New York Times.Nancy Keenan, Naral’s president, said Verizon’s decision interfered with political speech and activism.“No company should be allowed to censor the message we want to send to people who have asked us to send it to them,” Ms. Keenan said. “Regardless of people’s political views, Verizon customers should decide what action to take on their phones. Why does Verizon get to make that choice for them?”A spokesman for Verizon said the decision turned on the subject matter of the messages and not on Naral’s position on abortion. “Our internal policy is in fact neutral on the position,” said the spokesman, Jeffrey Nelson. “It is the topic itself” — abortion — “that has been on our list.”Mr. Nelson suggested that Verizon may be rethinking its position. “As text messaging and multimedia services become more and more mainstream,” he said, “we are continuing to review our content standards.” The review will be made, he said, “with an eye toward making more information available across ideological and political views.”Naral provided an example of a recent text message that it has sent to supporters: “End Bush’s global gag rule against birth control for world’s poorest women! Call Congress. (202) 224-3121. Thnx! Naral Text4Choice.”Messages urging political action are generally thought to be at the heart of what the First Amendment protects. But the First Amendment limits government power, not that of private companies like Verizon.In rejecting the Naral program, Verizon appeared to be acting against its economic interests. It would have received a small fee to set up the program and additional fees for messages sent and received.Text messaging programs based on five- and six-digit short codes are a popular way to receive updates on news, sports, weather and entertainment. Several of the leading Democratic presidential candidates have used them, as have the Republican National Committee, Save Darfur and Amnesty International.Most of the candidates and advocacy groups that use text message programs are liberal, which may reflect the demographics of the technology’s users and developers. A spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee, which is in some ways Naral’s anti-abortion counterpart, said, for instance, that it has not dabbled in text messaging.Texting has proved to be an extraordinarily effective political tool. According to a study released this month by researchers at Princeton and the University of Michigan, young people who received text messages reminding them to vote in November 2006 were more likely to go to the polls. The cost per vote generated, the study said, was much smaller than other sorts of get-out-the-vote efforts.Around the world, the phenomenon is even bigger.“Even as dramatic as the adoption of text messaging for political communication has been in the United States, we’ve been quite slow compared to the rest of the world,” said James E. Katz, the director of the Center for Mobile Communication Studies at Rutgers University. “It’s important in political campaigns and political protests, and it has affected the outcomes of elections.”Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia, said it was possible to find analogies to Verizon’s decision abroad. “Another entity that controls mass text messages is the Chinese government,” Professor Wu said.Jed Alpert, the chief executive officer of Mobile Commons, which says it is the largest provider of mobile services to political and advocacy groups, including Naral, said he had never seen a decision like Verizon’s.“This is something we haven’t encountered before, that is very surprising and that we’re concerned about,” Mr. Alpert said.Professor Wu pointed to a historical analogy. In the 19th century, he said, Western Union, the telegraph company, engaged in discrimination, based on the political views of people who sought to send telegrams. “One of the eventual reactions was the common carrier rule,” Professor Wu said, which required telegraph and then phone companies to accept communications from all speakers on all topics.Some scholars said such a rule was not needed for text messages because market competition was sufficient to ensure robust political debate.“Instead of having the government get in the game of regulating who can carry what, I would get in the game of promoting as many options as possible,” said Christopher S. Yoo, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “You might find text-messaging companies competing on their openness policies.”'"
"'07-09-27,'1','“It’s a little sore,” Burress said Monday, referring to the ankle. He added, “I really didn’t think I was going to make it through the whole game.”Burress and the Giants’ vice president of medical services, Ronnie Barnes, traveled to meet with Dr. Robert Anderson, a foot and ankle specialist. Burress has had ankle injures before. In the off-season, he had surgery to remove bone spurs in his other ankle.The prospect of playing without Burress on Sunday at Giants Stadium is troubling for the Giants. He has made the offense click for much of the season, catching 15 passes for 262 yards. His five touchdowns lead the team. And Burress always seems at his best against the Eagles (1-2). He had 234 yards against them in two regular-season games last season and two touchdown receptions in a 23-20 playoff loss in Philadelphia.The Eagles’ coach, Andy Reid, offered few words when asked why the 6-foot-5 Burress was so difficult to defend.“He is big, fast, strong and smart,” Reid deadpanned Wednesday during a conference call with reporters.If Burress is unable to play, Anthony Mix might replace him, joining Amani Toomer as an outside receiver. Sinorice Moss, who is nine inches shorter than Burress, would play as the slot receiver. It is not a combination the Eagles would fear. Mix is a rookie with three catches. But he may already be the answer to a trivia question.Against the Packers, Mix caught passes from Eli Manning, Jared Lorenzen and Anthony Wright. He may be the first player to catch his first three N.F.L. passes from three different quarterbacks in the same game.Mix said Burress was an outstanding receiver even when playing injured. He added that a lack of experience would not hinder his ability to fill in.“Today I didn’t have such a good day; dropped two balls in practice,” said Mix, who is the same height as Burress. “Got to put that behind me. It’s gone. Just go out there and feel confident.”Burress’s absence would give the Eagles plenty of options. They could double-team tight end Jeremy Shockey and force Manning to throw to Mix, Toomer, Moss or David Tyree, who has not caught a pass this season. Steve Smith, a second-round pick this year, is not available after fracturing his scapula against Green Bay.Or the Eagles could put extra pressure on Manning and force the Giants to run the ball. The ground game is already hurting, with Derrick Ward and Brandon Jacobs coping with knee injuries. Ward said that he expected to play against the Eagles. The Giants seemed less certain about Jacobs’s status.Ward and Jacobs did not practice Wednesday, but at least they were with the team. Burress was glaringly out of sight. Coughlin and Mix indicated that Burress desperately wanted to return to practice. But first he must obtain a doctor’s note.If that does not happen, the Giants will adopt a new game plan. What might it look like?“I don’t think it changes much,” Manning said. “We just got to do our offense and just go out there. Whoever’s in there at his spot has to perform well for us.”'"

"'07-09-27,'1','As the subprime market has been rocked by a wave of mortgage defaults and worthless mortgage-backed securities, the rating agencies have come under renewed scrutiny by regulators and lawmakers.After criticism of the credit agencies for their role in the corporate accounting scandals earlier in the decade, Congress adopted a law last year that gave the S.E.C. new authority to inspect and punish the agencies. But the new law also prevents the commission from regulating the procedures and methods the agencies use to determine ratings.Although there is no expectation that Congress will rewrite the new law soon, executives from the rating agencies tried to defend themselves from an onslaught of criticism from Democrats and Republicans on the Banking Committee.“It seems to me that credit rating agencies are playing both coach and referee,” said Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, dismissed the observation of one of the heads of a rating agency who had told him in a private meeting that the agencies had done nothing wrong. “To say nothing went wrong, that ain’t going to fly,”’ he said. “We need to find ways to prevent this crisis from happening again.” He proposed that the system be changed so that investors, rather than underwriters, pay the credit agencies’ fees.Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the committee, joined other lawmakers in complaining that the credit agencies were being paid by the underwriters instead of investors. “It seems to me that money’s trumping ethics,” Mr. Shelby said.But executives from the credit agencies said that while the agencies may have miscalculated the quantity of low-quality loans, their mistakes were unintentional and not the product of any conflicts of interest.“We have learned hard lessons from the recent difficulties in the subprime mortgage area,”’ said Vickie A. Tillman, an executive vice president at Standard & Poor’s. “Some have questioned whether the ‘issuer pays’ model has led S.&P. and others to issue higher, or less rigorously analyzed, ratings so as to garner more business. There is no evidence — none at all — to support this contention with respect to S.&P.”Michael Kanef, head of the asset-backed finance rating group at Moody’s Investors Service, said his company likewise had no conflicts of interest that led to inflated ratings. “The integrity and objectivity of our rating processes is of utmost importance to us,” he said. “Our continued reputation for objective and independent ratings is essential to our role in the marketplace.”'"

"'07-09-27,'1','“You might say it’s defacing,” Ecko said. “Others might say that it’s validating the way most people feel about the ball.”Since the Hall chronicles the history of baseball, Idelson said it was the museum’s responsibility to accept the ball as a vital part of history, put it on display in Cooperstown, N.Y., and allow fans to make their judgments about Bonds, the ball and the fresh asterisk.Ecko, who cast three online votes for the ball to have an asterisk, said the voting was emblematic of the cynical way fans often view sports these days. Since many fans become emotionally attached to athletes, Ecko said, they want to believe that the athletes are not cheating. Based on Ecko’s poll, almost two-thirds of the voters had doubts about Bonds’s achievements.“The 10 million votes were cast,” Ecko said. “This is not about the electoral college of media opinions. A private person bought this ball and the people voted to decide what to do with it.”Pete Nash, a baseball historian who was also one of the members of 3rd Bass, a defunct rap group, said writing on baseballs dates from the 1850s. Nash said players used to scrawl on important baseballs before saving them. In that respect, Nash argued, the asterisk on Bonds’s 756th home run ball was not as rare as it appeared.“Is writing on a ball the exact same thing as putting an asterisk on a ball?” Nash said. “It’s similar. You’re trying to put something on this ball that happened with this ball. This is his 756th and it’s in question, so there’s an asterisk.”Still, Jerome Holtzman, who is M.L.B.’s historian, said he was surprised that a ball with an asterisk was accepted by the Hall.“I’ve never heard of anything like that,” Holtzman said. “I’ve never heard of anything being doctored and sent to the Hall of Fame. But if the Hall agreed to take it, so be it.”Dale Petroskey, the Hall’s president, said there was no precedent for a ball being donated after it been intentionally defaced.Petroskey said he did not know why fans voted the way they did, “but we’ll take it.”“It’s still a very important part of baseball history,” Petroskey said.After Bonds, a left fielder with the San Francisco Giants, surpassed Hank Aaron’s record, he donated his batting helmets from the games in which he hit 755 and 756 to the Hall. Bonds hinted that he might also donate one of his uniforms at a later date.Noting how Idelson trailed Bonds while Bonds pursued Aaron’s record, Nash said: “Jeff Idelson followed Bonds around the country for two weeks and he ended up getting a helmet. The Hall would be crazy not to take this ball.”One day after Ecko announced his plans for the ball, Idelson met with him in New York to discuss it. Idelson noted that all 35,000 artifacts in the Hall have been donated, so, since two of Ecko’s three options involved donating the ball to the Hall, it was his duty to speak with him.Still, an asterisk is one thing. How would the Hall have reacted if Ecko had included an option to write “steroid user” on the ball and it wound up with the most votes?“In terms of if it were marked in another way, fortunately, that’s a bridge we don’t have to cross,” Idelson said.The former Chicago Cubs slugger Billy Williams said he was pleased that the ball was heading for Cooperstown.“A lot’s been said about Bonds as an individual,” Williams said. “A lot’s been said about his use of steroids. But nothing has been proven. This guy, I look at him as a great player. Before the steroid era he was having great years.”The former Baltimore Orioles pitcher Jim Palmer hinted that a tarnished legacy represented by a defaced baseball could be Bonds’s just reward.“I think time will sort out how you want to view it,” Palmer said. “But the fans, they must have a pretty good sense of what has gone on, or at least what they think might have gone on.”One person who was not enamored with Ecko’s plan was Bonds. He called Ecko “an idiot,” which did not bother Ecko.“I’ve been called worse,” Ecko said. “Honestly, I’ve been called worse by family and friends.”Ecko is reviewing ways to put the asterisk on the ball, but stressed that he wanted it to be done elegantly and tastefully. The Hall has promised Ecko that the asterisk would not be obscured.“This is an artifact worth keeping at the Hall of Fame,” Ecko said.'"

"'07-09-27,'1','Today, Mr. Nelson called that “an incorrect interpretation of a dusty internal policy” that “was designed to ward against communications such as anonymous hate messaging and adult materials sent to children.” The policy, Mr. Nelson said, had been developed “before text messaging protections such as spam filters adequately protected customers from unwanted messages.”But the program requested by Naral would have sent messages only to people who had asked to receive them.Nancy Keenan, Naral’s president, expressed satisfaction today. “The fight to defeat corporate censorship was won,” she said. But Ms. Keenan added that her group “would like to see Verizon make its new policy public.”Verizon did not respond to repeated requests for copies of the policy or an explanation for why it is withholding it.Text messaging is an increasingly popular tool in American politics and an established one abroad. In his statement, Mr. Nelson acknowledged that the technology is “being harnessed by organizations and individuals communicating their diverse opinions about issues and topics.” He said Verizon has “great respect for this free flow of ideas.”But the company did not retreat from its position that it is entitled to decide what messages to transmit.Legal experts said Verizon’s position is probably correct under current law, although some called for regulations that would require wireless carriers of text messages to act like common carriers, making their services available to all speakers on all topics.“This incident, more than ever, shows the need for an open, nondiscriminatory, neutral Internet and telecommunications system that Americans once enjoyed and took for granted,” said Gigi B. Sohn, the president of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group.Some of Verizon’s customers said they were outraged by the company’s initial stance.Gary Mitchell, a lawyer in New Jersey, said he called a Verizon customer sales representative on this morning to cancel his wireless service in protest. After spending a few minutes on hold, he said, the representative read him an e-mail message that she said all the customer service representatives had just received. The message instructed representatives to tell callers that the policy had been reversed.Verizon kept Mr. Mitchell’s business but lost some of his respect. “It was an incredibly foolish corporate decision,” he said.Wyn Hoag, a photographer in California, said he was still considering whether to cancel his Verizon service.“I’m a supporter of abortion rights, but I could be a Christian right person and still be in favor of free speech,” Mr. Hoag said. “If they think they can censor what’s on my phone, they’ve got another thing coming.”'"

"'07-09-28,'0','An eagerly prurient dip into the sex-trafficking trough, “Trade” teeters between earnest exposé and salacious melodrama. Minus the film’s near-visible weight of conscience, success in the second category would have been virtually guaranteed.Based on a controversial 2004 New York Times Magazine article by Peter Landesman, “Trade” is essentially an odd-couple road movie in which the extras are perverts and the victim is virginity. When 13-year-old Adriana (Paulina Gaitan) is kidnapped in Mexico City, her older brother, Jorge (a ferocious Cesar Ramos), assisted by an uptight Texas cop (Kevin Kline), tracks her abductors to New Jersey and an Internet sex auction.Presenting Mexico as a country where everyone is corrupt and all visitors are fair game, Jose Rivera’s highly improbable and sensationalized screenplay leaves its actors no room for authenticity. Marco Kreuzpaintner directs with commendable energy, but squanders Daniel Gottschalk’s gold-dust-strewn images on hyperventilating voyeurism and an ending that sticks to your shoes, if not your heart. His intentions may be laudable but his goals are conflicted: in seeking to educate as well as tease, he ends up doing neither.“Trade” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Characters are raped, beaten, drugged and driven to suicide.Directed by Marco Kreuzpaintner; written by Jose Rivera, based on the New York Times Magazine article “The Girls Next Door” by Peter Landesman; director of photography, Daniel Gottschalk; edited by Hansjorg Weissbrich; music by Jacobo Lieberman and Leonardo Heiblum; production designer, Bernt Capra; produced by Roland Emmerich and Rosilyn Heller; released by Roadside Attractions.

"'07-09-28,'0','The members of the cast, which includes two recent Academy Award winners (Jamie Foxx and Chris Cooper), do not trouble themselves exploring the finer points of their craft, but their unpretentious professionalism is nonetheless satisfying to watch. Mr. Foxx does most of his acting with the muscles in his jaw and his upper arm, delivering terse dialogue in a silky whisper. Mr. Cooper punches the folksiness buttons as a forensics expert whose aw-shucks manner masks a steel-trap mind. Jason Bateman is the class clown, and Jennifer Garner, no slouch in the jaw-flexing department, also exercises her tear ducts and her trigger finger.The four of them play F.B.I. investigators who travel to Saudi Arabia (the kingdom of the title) to investigate a horrific double terrorist attack on American oil company workers and their families. The team’s trip is opposed by the State Department and the lily-livered attorney general (Danny Huston), who don’t want to antagonize an important ally. Backed up by their no-nonsense boss (Richard Jenkins), the Forensic Four nonetheless head to Riyadh.Their motives are personal as well as professional, since one of their colleagues was killed in the attacks. Their presence is barely tolerated by the Saudi authorities, many of whom are either incompetent or in cahoots with the jihadis. Meanwhile, Jeremy Piven shows up as an embassy flunky whose job is to prevent Special Agent Fleury (Mr. Foxx) and his colleagues from doing theirs.But Fleury recognizes a fellow good cop in the person of Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), a Saudi colonel who helps the Americans both before and after the bullets and rocket-propelled grenades start flying. Once they do, the good guys are in the familiar, physically perilous but morally gratifying position of being outmanned and outgunned with the cavalry nowhere in sight.“I’m not saying America is perfect,” Fleury says a while before the climactic barrage, “but we’re pretty good at this.” If by “this” he means making high-impact action movies, it’s hard to argue. And “The Kingdom,” hair-raising as it is, is also curiously soothing in its depiction of American competence and righteousness.Just as “Rambo” offered the fantasy of do-over on Vietnam, “The Kingdom” can be seen as a wishful revisionist scenario for the American response to Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. In some ways it’s an anti-Iraq movie, not because it expresses opposition to the war there but rather because it makes no mention of it. Instead, the film spins a cathartic counternarrative. After a murderous terrorist attack a few of our best people — four, rather than a few hundred thousand — go over to the country that spawned the terrorists, kill the bad guys and come home. And they even leave the door open for a sequel.“The Kingdom” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for intense, graphic violence.Directed by Peter Berg; written by Matthew Michael Carnahan; director of photography, Mauro Fiore; edited by Kevin Stitt and Colby Parker Jr.; music by Danny Elfman; production designer, Tom Duffield; produced by Michael Mann and Scott Stuber; released by Universal Pictures.

"'07-09-28,'0','The unanimous approval by local leaders “gives us a pretty good indication that the agreement will be accepted by the membership nationwide,” Mr. Gettelfinger said at a news conference this afternoon.The centerpiece of the new contract is a voluntary employee benefit association, or VEBA, a health care trust that would assume responsibility for the benefits G.M. expects to pay its retirees. G.M. estimates its liability at more than $50 billion.The trust requires court and regulatory approval that is expected to take about two years. Once the trust is established, G.M. will fund it with an initial investment of $24.1 billion. It told the union that it would invest $5.8 billion in following years, bringing the total to $29.9 billion.G.M. pledged to provide more, up to an additional $1.6 billion, over 20 years, if the trust’s investments do not achieve the earnings that G.M. expects.The VEBA would take effect Jan. 1, 2010. Until then, G.M. would pay $5.4 billion to maintain the current retiree health care plan. Retirees would receive lump-sum bonuses of up to $700 annually in the next four years.Along with taking the liability off G.M.’s books, the trust would protect workers in the event of a bankruptcy, since its assets would not be held by G.M.The company would pay workers a $3,000 bonus once the contract is signed. They would receive lump-sum payments in the next three years, but those would not be folded into their wages.Over the four-year term of the contract, those bonuses and cost-of-living pay increases will be worth an estimated $13,056 more to an average worker than the previous agreement, the brochure said.G.M. would permanently hire 3,000 temporary workers, who would then receive regular wages and benefits.Wages for an assembly worker will increase to $28.85 after four years from $28.12 now. Certain “non-core” positions will be split into a two-tiered system under which new hires will earn $14 to $14.61 an hour — or roughly half as much as current workers in those jobs are paid.The agreement continues an often-criticized job-security provision known as the Jobs Bank, which enables workers to continue receiving pay and benefits after being laid off, but Mr. Gettelfinger said it would have new restrictions on the duration of eligibility.Among G.M.’s commitments to the union was a promise to build the Chevrolet Volt, a hybrid-electric car, in its Hamtramck, Mich., plant, beginning in 2010. G.M. has said production of the car could start a year later, however.The Volt is a pet project of G.M.’s vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, who said today that G.M. was pleased with the contract.“Anything that improves America’s competitiveness is great, and this contract we believe very seriously does,” Mr. Lutz said in an interview. “It eliminates a lot of obstacles that were clouding the future of the automobile business.”Local leaders attending this morning’s meeting said much of it was spent discussing the health care trust. Some union members have come out in opposition to the concept.Many said they expect their members to ratify the deal. “It’s impressive,” said Doug Rademacher, president of U.A.W. Local 602 in Lansing, Mich.Eldon Renaud, president of U.A.W. Local 2164, said he was “very excited” about news that G.M.’s Bowling Green, Ky., plant will add production of the Saturn Sky and Pontiac Solstice in 2012. The factory now builds the Cadillac XLR and Chevrolet Corvette sports cars.“I’ve been actively trying to get those cars because we only have a one-shift operation,” Mr. Renaud said.He said the new cars would probably bring the plant’s production up to a full two shifts, which in essence would assure its future. Car plants with just one shift of production are seen as vulnerable to shut downs.Mr. Renaud said he expected the plant’s employment to triple from the current 960.“I’m just elated,” he said. “My feet haven’t touched the ground.”The U.A.W.’s previous contract with the Detroit automaker expired Sept. 14. It still must negotiate deals with the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler LLC.Mr. Gettelfinger said the union would begin talking with those companies next week but said he had not decided whether to conduct talks simultaneously or in succession.'"
"'07-09-28,'0','Ward is on pace for 1,456 rushing yards, 1,925 from scrimmage and maybe that Pro Bowl that Jacobs envisioned.Jacobs has taken his bad luck and Ward’s seized opportunity in stride, though it’s a stride with a slight limp. He said that he was pulling for Ward, a good friend, and looked forward to the two of them creating a formidable combination when he returns in the next week or two. Sharing the load is a concession that he did not consider before the injury.But Jacobs does not want to lose his starting job because of a minor injury. He jokes with Ward about not giving it up, and he carries a defiance that matches his straightforward personality.“My job’s kept, believe me,” Jacobs said. “If not, I’ll be a starter again at some point in my career, whether here or somewhere else.”Jacobs hurt his knee on his seventh carry against the Dallas Cowboys, in the second quarter of what became a 45-35 loss. The play did not count, because the Giants were called for holding. But it counted to him.“It’s tough for someone to deal with,” Jacobs said. “Especially when you’ve got an opportunity to be a starter and the first game of the season. It’s tough.”The Giants said Jacobs irritated the meniscus. He was cleared to practice Thursday. Ward, nursing a sprained ankle, is expected to start Sunday night against the Eagles at Giants Stadium.If and when Jacobs is ready to carry the ball, the Giants will have a running back controversy. And while such debates can be unsettling at quarterback, they are welcomed at running back.Ward entered the season as the third-down back. At 230 pounds, 30 less than Jacobs, he is considered bullish enough to earn hard yards and nimble enough to make tacklers miss. He offers a combination of soft hands and strong legs, but for most of the last three seasons, he has carried only potential and caught only bad luck. Buried behind Barber, Jacobs and others, and knocked down by injuries, Ward entered the season with 35 carries and 2 receptions in his career.It did not appear that this would be a breakout season for Ward. Reuben Droughns was acquired in an off-season trade and was expected to push Jacobs for the job. But the Giants moved Droughns to fullback during training camp. Then Jacobs was injured.Like a perfectly blocked trap play, everything opened for Ward. The more yards he gains, the more the opportunity for Jacobs closes behind him. And although for now it seems that Jacobs will regain his job, there is no script for these things.“Hopefully it goes back that way,” Jacobs said. “I would love to have it be me and D-Ward and carry the thing together. But it doesn’t matter. I have to get back first to figure out how things are going to go.”Ward knows how rare chances at playing time can be. He also knows what it feels like to be Jacobs — stuck on the sideline, hoping to heal, waiting for another chance.“It is what it is,” Ward said. “I’m going to continue to play like I know how to play. When B.J. comes back, we’ll have a great 1-2 punch.”For all of six official carries, Jacobs was 1, Ward was 2. With the numbers Ward is compiling now, the Giants may have to rework the math.Receiver Plaxico Burress said he expected to play Sunday despite a sprained right ankle, and the Giants plan to curtail his practice time in coming weeks to help him prepare for games. Burress met a specialist in Charlotte, N.C., on Wednesday and was told that the best treatment is ongoing therapy and rest. “He wants to be in the fray,” Coach Tom Coughlin said. “And he wants to help his teammates win. So that is a very good thing. You would love to have him practice. But we are going to have a routine whereby he is going to work on the ankle. He will catch the ball and he will work, with permission from the medical people, a little bit on Fridays, and then hopefully be ready to go on Sundays.”'"

"'07-09-28,'0','“If sales continue to fall, builders will continue to cut back on construction, which will be a direct drag to economic growth,” said Michelle Meyer, a Lehman Brothers economist who specializes in the housing industries. “Inventories remain elevated, home prices will fall as a result, and a decline in home prices will depress consumer spending.”KB Home wrote down almost $800 million in inventory, joint venture impairment and good will in the latest quarter. That offset the company’s gains from selling its 49 percent stake in a French subsidiary. KB shares finished up 2.6 percent yesterday, at $24.71, still close to their 52-week low.The company’s chief executive, Jeffrey T. Mezger, said in a statement yesterday: “Our third-quarter results reflect the seriously challenging market conditions that prevail for home builders across most of the nation. At this time, we see no signs that the housing market is stabilizing and believe it will be some time before a recovery begins.”Analysts concurred, predicting that the disappointing data signified only the start of an unfolding decline in housing that could last several quarters.“Anybody that’s expecting a turnaround in housing anytime soon is going to be disappointed,” said Mike Schenk, a senior economist at the Credit Union National Association. “It’s going to be a long, slow process.”Richard Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm, predicted a jump in foreclosures that would add to inventory woes. “When you combine that with the tightening lending standard we’ve already seen,” he said, “and the tighter credit market conditions we’ve seen since August, it’s going to take that much longer to work all this off.”Consumer spending was already starting to slow in the second quarter, according to the final reading on the gross domestic product released yesterday by the Commerce Department. Consumer purchases rose 1.4 percent in the quarter, compared with 3.7 percent in the first quarter.Consumers also had little relief from rising prices. The price index for personal consumption increased 4.3 percent, up slightly from an earlier estimate of 4.2 percent. In the first quarter, it rose 3.5 percent. Excluding food and energy, the index was up 1.4 percent compared with 2.4 percent in the first quarter.The gross domestic product, a tally of most goods and services across the economy, increased 3.8 percent in the second quarter, a revision downward from a previous estimate of 4 percent, the Commerce Department said. Exports and consumer spending were behind the increase, the department said, though the growth occurred before the subprime crisis became evident this summer. The G.D.P. increased 0.6 percent in the first quarter.In one bright spot for the economy, the number of new unemployment claims filed last week dipped to 298,000, its lowest level since early May. That figure, a decrease of 15,000 from the week ended Sept. 14, was better than Wall Street expectations, though some analysts warned against extrapolating a trend from a single week’s data.“Firing hasn’t picked up, but new hiring has slowed down,” said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for the research firm MFR.'"

"'07-09-28,'0','A fertility drug, clomiphene, will also be available for $9, Wal-Mart said.Versions of the two birth control pills — known by the brand names Ortho Cyclen and Ortho Tri-Cyclen — account for 20 percent of oral contraception prescriptions in this country.Although the average woman would save only $1 at Wal-Mart if she had insurance coverage for the pill, she would save $21 if she did not have coverage. The pills frequently sell for $30.Establishing a new $9 price point for certain generic drugs may prove a crucial step, according to analysts, some of whom have considered Wal-Mart’s pharmacies an underused asset.“What they’ve done here is, they’ve gotten a bit more aggressive in creating a second tier,” said Ronny Gal, who follows the generic drug industry for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “This is a very important development. Rather than just sell for $4 and be stuck with only the cheapest generics, they’ve now created a tier and they have a business model for more expensive generics, as well.”Mr. Gal predicted that the company might very well add more drugs to the $9 list and, ultimately, create a third, higher-priced, tier.A Wal-Mart senior vice president, John Agwunobi, said that there was more to come, adding that the company planned to “grow the program and continue it into the future.”Wal-Mart announced the program’s expansion yesterday, just over a year after introducing the $4 generic plan. The discounts have prompted similar steps by many other retailers, including Target, which said yesterday that it would match Wal-Mart’s latest moves.Government economists recently credited the discount pricing plans with contributing to a slowdown of inflation in the Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs, which is currently running at about 1 percent, a three-decade low.Still, two of the nation’s largest prescription drug retailers, Walgreens and CVS, have said the Wal-Mart promotions have not affected their businesses and they have not matched the discount prices.A spokeswoman for Walgreens said yesterday that the company’s share of the nation’s retail pharmaceutical market had increased a percentage point, to 17 percent, since the Wal-Mart $4 plan began last year.In a conference call with the media and investment analysts yesterday, Wal-Mart’s chief operating officer, Bill Simon, estimated that the company has saved individual shoppers and the nation’s overall health care system $610 million since the program began last year.In all, the company said its generic plan would now cover 361 prescriptions representing various formulations of 157 medications, an increase of about 24 prescriptions.Wal-Mart said its $4 program now covered about 40 percent of the prescription drugs sold at its Wal-Mart, Sam’s Club and Neighborhood Market pharmacies.Wal-Mart has sought competitive bids from generic makers for at least some of the products, enabling it to still make money while selling the generics for $4.Two of the drugs the company added to its list yesterday — versions of the heart medication Coreg and the nail-fungus drug Lamisil — only recently became available as generics.Generic drugs are typically sold at small discounts just after their approval before falling to as low as 10 percent of the original brand-name drug cost a year or so later. In this case, however, generic versions of both Coreg and Lamisil have been heavily discounted early because of competition among the numerous generic manufacturers that received Food and Drug Administration approval to sell them.Coreg, used to treat congestive heart failure and hypertension, became available in this country as a generic drug this month. Wal-Mart, which said the brand-name version had been $119 just a month ago, said that its inclusion on the $4 list meant that customers would be saving $115 a prescription.The generic version of Coreg — made by more than a dozen manufacturers — is widely available from various Internet sources at retail prices from $37 to $102.Wal-Mart said that savings on the generic version of Lamisil would be extensive, comparing its $4 price with an average price a month ago of $337 for the branded version. Lamisil, however, has been available as a generic since July. Some retailers were selling it this week for as low as $45.'"
"'07-09-28,'0','In yesterday’s statement, Mr. Nelson called that “an incorrect interpretation of a dusty internal policy” that “was designed to ward against communications such as anonymous hate messaging and adult materials sent to children.” The policy, Mr. Nelson said, had been developed “before text messaging protections such as spam filters adequately protected customers from unwanted messages.”But the program requested by Naral would have sent messages only to people who had asked to receive them.Nancy Keenan, Naral’s president, expressed satisfaction yesterday. “The fight to defeat corporate censorship was won,” she said. But Ms. Keenan added that her group “would like to see Verizon make its new policy public.”Verizon did not respond to repeated requests for copies of the policy or an explanation for why it is withholding it.Text messaging is an increasingly popular tool in American politics and an established one abroad. In his statement, Mr. Nelson acknowledged that the technology is “being harnessed by organizations and individuals communicating their diverse opinions about issues and topics.” He said Verizon has “great respect for this free flow of ideas.”But the company did not retreat from its position that it is entitled to decide what messages to transmit.Legal experts said Verizon’s position is probably correct under current law, though some called for regulations that would require wireless carriers of text messages to act like common carriers, making their services available to all speakers on all topics.“This incident, more than ever, shows the need for an open, nondiscriminatory, neutral Internet and telecommunications system that Americans once enjoyed and took for granted,” said Gigi B. Sohn, the president of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group.Some of Verizon’s customers said they were outraged by the company’s initial stance.Gary Mitchell, a lawyer in New Jersey, said he called a Verizon customer sales representative yesterday morning to cancel his wireless service in protest. After spending a few minutes on hold, he said, the representative read him an e-mail message that she said all the customer service representatives had just received. The message instructed representatives to tell callers that the policy had been reversed.Verizon kept Mr. Mitchell’s business but lost some of his respect. “It was an incredibly foolish corporate decision,” he said.Wyn Hoag, a photographer in California, said he was still mulling whether to cancel his Verizon service.“I’m a supporter of abortion rights, but I could be a Christian-right person and still be in favor of free speech,” Mr. Hoag said. “If they think they can censor what’s on my phone, they’ve got another thing coming.”'"
"'07-09-28,'0','Ms. Giannini has established that she likes the Italian fashion for young women in boyish trousers, biker jackets and classic print blouses with a “twist.” This season she offers black checked trousers, contrasting plaid shirts and a stylish black snakeskin jacket. The clothes are nice, as are some of the printed toga dresses and full skirts with origami-like pleats, typically shown with a snug belted jacket.Accessories remain strong, with glossy snakeskin bags, metallic clutches and strappy patent-leather stilettos. Yet, in terms of clothes, there is a gulf between what we’ve come to expect from Gucci since the Tom Ford era and what it actually now delivers. This was underscored by a new television commercial that David Lynch directed for a Gucci fragrance, and which was played on multiple screens before the show. Whatever Mr. Lynch saw in the Paris nighttime scene with three women, it was not the same feeling or perspective that Ms. Giannini had on her runway. Somehow, when the show started, we were back in Milan.There was no escape at Marni, either. A dungeon might be more fun than some of Consuelo Castiglioni’s sad sacks. The general idea behind these cruelly linear shapes — cruel, at least, if you’re not a giraffe — is to take some expensive cotton, print it with a streaky esoteric pattern and then make a shift that’s gathered in random places. If this weren’t such a cool label, you’d wonder how much design or thought was involved.Marni may be at one of its periodic crossroads. Ms. Castiglioni continued with her use of techno fabrics, which lent a blunt squareness to a shiny black skirt worn with a bright orange top. When you consider the impact of the intense, clear colors at Jil Sander this season, the blotchy prints at Marni just seemed boring.What did look fresh was the proportion of a billowy sleeveless top in pale gray silk with a full melon-colored skirt in what appeared to be washed organza. You wanted more of that sensuous lightness, and less of the boxy jackets, the plastic-adorned dresses we’ve seen before, and the tortured minimalism.Angela Missoni opened her mellow-yellow collection with minidresses and sportswear in a black woodcut pattern, spliced with colored bands, and a print that seemed to be a blowup of a flower. Nature was a theme of the show, with some terrific tunics and smock dresses that had large, off-center flowers. Ms. Missoni seemed to like the idea of combining small shapes with exaggerated effects. Occasionally it worked.Yet, ultimately, it was hard to see what connected a baby-doll dress of beige silk knit and stone-embroidered chiffon with a mustard tunic of lace-cut cotton, its top and sleeves dotted with boho mirrors. If you were to say a “Missoni sensibility,” Ms. Missoni didn’t make a strong enough case.And she was another designer this season tempted by the weirdly distracting effect of damp faces. The models looked as if they had had a good boohoo backstage.The Milan shows, which effectively end tonight with Versace, seem as soggy as the weather. Lightness and layered transparency are certainly trends, with vibrant colors and patterns — from ikat prints to microchecks to romantic art nouveau — replacing embroidery.'"
"'07-09-28,'0','“It’s important to clear up all these doubts,” said one prime proponent of the investigation, Víctor Leopoldo Valencia de los Santos, a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. “He has provoked this.”The investigation has put Mr. Fox on the defensive. This week, he declared he had nothing to hide from investigators. “He who owes nothing has nothing to fear,” he said. On Tuesday, he declared in an open letter that his political enemies were trying to smear him “with false facts and fantastic stories.”“Before Mexico and the Mexicans, and my mother in heaven, I declare I am telling the truth,” he wrote.Questions began to surface about whether Mr. Fox had used his position to enrich himself after Quién, a celebrity magazine, published photographs of the newly renovated ranch, in San Cristóbal. It was a ramshackle affair with modest furnishings before he took office.Mr. Fox’s ranch is not luxurious compared with the estates of many wealthy and influential Mexicans, but the transformation raised suspicions in a country where power often goes hand in hand with corruption. Other former presidents, like José López Portillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari, amassed immense fortunes in office, historians say.Still, Mr. Korrodi’s broadside against his former friend and boss pushed members of Congress to demand an inquiry. “It is evident he got rich during his six years in office, in a very shameless and cynical way,” Mr. Korrodi told the newspaper El Universal last week.Though Mr. Fox was a highly paid executive at Coca-Cola, he is said to have drained his savings while he was a congressman and state governor for the conservative National Action Party. One sign of this was the run-down condition of his family farm, Mr. Korrodi said.Mr. Fox made history in 2000 when he became the first opposition politician to wrest the presidency from the PRI after 71 years of autocratic, corrupt rule. In his administration, however, his wife, Marta Sahagún de Fox, and her sons faced allegations of influence-peddling to win government contracts for the sons. No allegations were proved, despite a congressional inquiry, and the family denied wrongdoing.Mr. Fox also made many enemies during last year’s presidential campaign in the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution and the former ruling party. Some political analysts have called the investigation revenge.Mr. Fox campaigned openly for Felipe Calderón, his party’s candidate, which is not legal, in Mexico, and used public service advertisements to highlight his administration’s achievements, helping Mr. Calderón gain the presidency.As president, Mr. Fox earned $245,000 a year, and since leaving office last December, he has received an annual pension of about $270,000.Proponents of the new inquiry say the renovation was only one of its facets. The commission, to be impaneled next week, will also examine the relationship between Mr. Fox and several businesses that became lucrative under his administration.Congress also wants a full accounting of federal money spent to build on a national library that has serious structural problems and a nationwide system of digital books for grade schools that never got of the ground.The political storm battering Mr. Fox is so strong, President Calderón has not publicly come to his defense, though the Interior minister, Francisco Ramírez Acuña, said Wednesday that he considered Mr. Fox honest.'"
"'07-09-28,'0','Senator John McCain of Arizona will begin running his first television advertisements of the campaign this weekend in New Hampshire, where he won his upset primary victory in 2000 and where he is now pinning his hopes for a comeback.PRODUCER Foxhole Productions, a tongue-in-cheek name for the media consultants, including Mark McKinnon and Justin Germany, who stayed with the campaign after its other top media consultants left during the McCain campaign turmoil this summer.ON THE SCREEN Grainy black-and-white archival film of a 31-year-old Mr. McCain being interviewed in a hospital bed as a prisoner of war in Vietnam gives way to images of Mr. McCain on the campaign trail, Mr. McCain walking with President Ronald Reagan, Mr. McCain speaking at the Republican National Convention, a young Mr. McCain in his flight suit and Mr. McCain giving a salute upon his return to the United States.“How old are you?” a French journalist asks Mr. McCain in the scene from the hospital.“What is your rank in the Army?” the journalist asks.“Lieutenant commander in the Navy,” Mr. McCain replies, “hit by either missile or anti-aircraft fire, I’m not sure which.

"'07-09-28,'0','Eight years before its anticipated opening on the National Mall in Washington, the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture is up and running online, The Associated Press reported. An interactive Web site (nmaahc.si.edu) made its debut Wednesday, allowing visitors to help produce content for future exhibitions through essays, vignettes or recorded oral histories. “The culture of the African American experience is too important to wait 5 or 10 years until the building is open.” Lonnie Bunch, the museum’s founding director, said. The museum plans to open its first physical exhibition on Oct. 19 at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington; titled “Let Your Motto Be Resistance,” it will trace 150 years of history through 100 photographs of abolitionists, scholars, artists and athletes who challenged negative attitudes about race and class.'"
"'07-09-28,'0','The S.E.C., which also filed civil fraud allegations, says the actions brought in $12 million for the traders. This is a $700 billion market, according to calculations by Vodia Group, a research firm, but one that is so hidden from view that this suspected fraud could go on for more than five years without being detected.The stock loan market is quite profitable to brokerage firms because short sales create what amounts to free cash to be invested. The shares that are sold are paid for with cash, but that cash does not go to the seller because he did not own the shares. Instead, it is held as collateral to assure the seller’s repayment of the loan.The price of borrowing shares is stated as a percent of their value — and is usually negative because the lender and the borrower share in the profits of the cash being invested. But it can be positive — and get very high — if the shares are especially hard to borrow.If the stock loan market were transparent, then it would be clear how much money a trader who failed to borrow shares was saving, argues James Angel, an associate finance professor at Georgetown University. “The problem won’t go away,” he said this week, “until the economic incentives are fixed.”Mr. Angel has suggested that the S.E.C. drop its complicated rules on the subject, known as Regulation SHO, and simply tell stock markets to levy fines for violations that would be higher than the costs the traders avoided. That would, he thinks, end the problem of naked short selling. There would still be some failures to deliver, caused by paperwork problems, but they would be relatively rare.It is not that simple, as Mr. Angel concedes. Such a change could lead to short squeezes in the form of sky-high borrowing costs, which could amount to stock manipulation on the upside, and he says it might be a good idea to put a cap on the fee. He would also like the S.E.C. to take steps to make more shares available for lending, by allowing brokerage firms to lend out shares held in all customer accounts, not just margin accounts.Mr. Angel is a longtime critic of Regulation SHO, and he told me he had been approached about being a witness for the plaintiffs in one of the pending lawsuits against brokers by investors who say they lost money because their stocks were manipulated through naked shorting. But he also, like most economists, deems short selling to be an important and vital part of markets — “our first line of defense against pump-and-dump manipulators.”There could be complications in making the share loan market transparent. Because such loans are a continuing relationship, not a one-time transaction like a stock purchase, lending rates may vary based on such things as service and willingness to avoid calling loans.But that is not the only reason brokerage firms may not like the idea. Profits can be lower for market makers in transparent markets, and while institutional investors share in the profits generated by lending their shares, individual investors generally do not. There might be pressures to let them in on the money, which Wall Street would not much like.But surely the people who run the big brokerage firms would welcome changes in a market where they seem to have been robbed for years, without noticing it. This is a market that could use a dose of sunlight.'"
"'07-09-28,'0','Several historians said the new questions successfully incorporated more ideas about the workings of American democracy and better touched upon the diversity of the groups — including women, American Indians and African-Americans — who have influenced the country’s history.Would-be citizens no longer have to know who said, “Give me liberty or give me death,” or who wrote “The Star-Spangled Banner.” But they do have to know what Susan B. Anthony did and who the speaker of the House of Representatives is.Alfonso Aguilar, a senior official at Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that designs and administers the test, said it was not intended to be punitive.“We don’t seek to fail anyone,” said Mr. Aguilar, an architect of the test.Immigration officials said they sought to move away from civics trivia to emphasize basic concepts about the structure of government and American history and geography. In contrast to the old test, which some immigrants could pass without any study, the officials said the new one is intended to force even highly educated applicants to do reviewing.“This test genuinely talks about what makes an American citizen,” said Emilio Gonzalez, the director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, speaking at a news conference in Washington.The $6.5 million redesign was shaped over six years of discussions with historians, immigrant organizations and liberal and conservative research groups. The questions were submitted to four months of pilot testing this year with more than 6,000 immigrants who were applying for naturalization.The agency will begin to use the revised test on Oct. 1, 2008, leaving a year for aspiring citizens to prepare and for community groups to adjust their study classes.The overall format has not changed. Legal immigrants who are eligible to become citizens must pass the civics exam as well as a test of English proficiency in reading and writing. In a one-on-one oral examination, an immigration officer asks the applicant 10 questions of varying degrees of difficulty selected from the list of 100. To pass, the applicant must answer 6 of those 10 questions correctly. The questions released yesterday will remain public along with their answers.Immigrants are eligible to become citizens if they have been legal permanent residents for at least five years (or three years if they are married to a citizen) and have “good moral character” and no criminal record.In the pilot runs of the revised test, Mr. Aguilar said, the pass rates improved over the current tests, with 92 percent of participants passing on the first try, as opposed to 84 percent now. At least 15 questions were eliminated as a result of the pilot because they proved too difficult. For example, a question about the minimum wage was dropped because test takers were confused between federal and state rates, Mr. Aguilar said.In the new test, the pilgrims have been replaced by “colonists,” and they are the subject of fewer questions, while slavery and the civil rights movement are the subject of more. A question was added asking what “major event” happened on Sept. 11, 2001.The new test drops questions about the 49th and 50th states, but adds one about the political affiliation of the president. There are no questions about the White House. Instead, one question asks where the Statue of Liberty is.In a statement today, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, one of the groups consulted in shaping the new test, denounced it as “the final brick in the second wall.” The group said the test included “more abstract and irrelevant questions” that tended to stump hard-working immigrants who had little time to study.But several historians said the test appeared to be fair.“People who take this seriously will have a good chance of passing,” said Gary Gerstle, a professor of American history at Vanderbilt University. “Indeed, their knowledge of American history may even exceed the knowledge of millions of American-born citizens.”John Fonte, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, called the new test “a definite improvement.” But he said it should have included questions about the meaning of the oath of allegiance that new citizens swear. “I would like to see an even more vigorous emphasis on Americanization,” he said.About 55 percent of the applicants who participated in the pilot test were from Latin American countries. Some Latino groups noted yesterday that no question on the new test refers to Latinos.Mr. Aguilar said that the test was not intended to be a comprehensive review, but rather to include “landmark moments of American history that apply to every single citizen.”Naturalizations have surged in recent years, to 702,589 last year from 537,151 in 2004, according to official figures. In July the fees to become a citizen increased sharply, to $675 from $405.'"
"'07-09-28,'0','Those prices, coupled with a fervent desire to rub up against the good life, have made my wife, Ingrid; our 2-year-old son, Lazar; and me fervent Hamptons campers. We first visited Cedar Point three years ago, and in June we spent three days in a tent at Hither Hills.On a Friday afternoon, as the rich and famous were alighting from their chartered helicopters, we pulled our battered minivan into Hither Hills (631-668-2554; www.nysparks.state.ny.us), between East Hampton Beach and downtown Montauk. We claimed a spot with a picnic table and a clear shot at the restrooms — nothing that would make a showbiz celebrity regret having plunked down several hundred thousand dollars to rent a seaside mansion in East Hampton, but not bad for $87, including reservation and service fees.In some ways, camping at Hither Hills is like camping anywhere else. There are a lot of fishing and swimming by day, a lot of talking and singing around the campfire at night and a lot of families with children. Our campsite neighbors, Doug and Debbie Snider of Bohemia, N.Y., rode herd over six adolescent girls (their two daughters and four of the girls’ friends), a nephew and his girlfriend all crammed into one midsize R.V. and a gigantic tent. With towels hanging everywhere, a steady stream of relatives and Mr. Snider’s puttering around in Bermuda shorts, the whole scene suggested a low-rent version of the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod.In other respects, however, camping at Hither Hills is unusual. For starters, there’s very little to suggest that anyone is actually roughing it.“I have to rent a storage space just to store my camping gear,” said Marcia Margolin, a lawyer from the Upper East Side of Manhattan who was sharing a tent with her husband, Ron Levy, also a lawyer, and a friend, Karen Binder. Her tent — spacious and well kept — looked like something plucked from a Cabela’s catalog, with collapsible cots, stainless-steel percolators, an air mattress and a hanging mesh organizer stuffed with clothing and accessories.They were joined by friends from New Jersey — Christopher Horan, a radiation safety physicist; his wife, Marcia Schupak. a physician; and their two sons, ages 12 and 14, in a spotless Coleman pop-up camper. They represent the kind of white-collar types that one expects to see renting million-dollar homes in the Hamptons, not opening cans of beans over a campfire. Yet, they are drawn to Hither Hills by frugality.“We would not come to the Hamptons if it were not for camping,” Ms. Schupak said. “It’s too expensive,” added her husband, who was busy making grilled cheese sandwiches at a propane stove.More than a few people seem to have figured this out. Hither Hills drew about 110,000 campers last year. And it wouldn’t be the Hamptons if the campsites weren’t coveted. Walk-ins arrive at the park entrance as early as 4 a.m. in hopes of snagging a cancellation. Despite the threat of severe thunderstorms, all 165 campsites were occupied during the weekend of our visit. Cedar Point County Park on the northern tip of East Hampton seemed to be less exclusive, with only 22 out of the 190 sites occupied during our visit.CEDAR POINT (631-852-7620; www.co.suffolk.ny.us) offers a woodsy environment that is quite different from the sun-bleached coastal setting of Hither Hills. The sprawling grounds are approached via a long, winding road that passes a pond that harbors a fleet of rowboats. The campsites themselves are off a maze of interconnected dirt roads with names like Red Fox and Wood Duck.Cedar Point seems to attract a less genteel crowd. On a warm and steamy Saturday, a clutch of post-prom high-school seniors had erected a mock hobo encampment, with a ramshackle tent and an ancient R.V. held together by duct tape. A group of 18-year-old girls in jeans and bikini tops lounged around a smoldering log cradled in a rusty, sawed-off oil drum.In the distance, a clutch of tall-masted yachts riding the wind-swept waters of Northwest Harbor could be seen near the refined precincts of Sag Harbor.And that, in the end, is what makes camping in the Hamptons such a trip. After pitching your tent and slathering on your bug repellent, you can stock up on high-end comestibles at the local Citarella, wander the aisles at Coach and Tahari and reserve a table at Della Femina, possibly spotting a celebrity or two.And when you’re done, you can head back to your campsite for some toasted marshmallows and a different kind of stargazing under the glittering Hamptons sky.'"
"'07-09-28,'0','Jim Dierberg, who is also from St. Louis and has had a second home in Hermann since the early 1970s, liked it so much that he bought the local bank.“We came here for Maifest, and it was instantaneous love,” he said, referring to one of the town’s annual German festival. “So on Sunday, we inquired if the bank was for sale, and on Tuesday we bought it.”Mr. Dierberg is the chairman of First Banks, and he added the bank in Hermann to his family’s company, which now has more than 200 branches. But he did not stop there in his involvement.His local investments also include stakes in the Hermannhof Winery; Tin Mill Brewing, a European-style brewery in two old mills; and six old family wineries that were dismantled stone by stone, reassembled above Hermannhof and converted into guesthouses.Hermann is steeped in wine culture, with eight wineries within a 20-mile radius. Some are cottage industries, growing grape vines the way their neighbors grow grass. They’re a vestige of the late 19th century, when Hermann was America’s leading wine producer. Cuttings from Hermann were once sent to France, and even to a valley in California called Napa.The wineries bring tourists who stay in the region’s more than 70 bed-and-breakfasts, nose around the antiques shops and buy authentic German sausages from the Swiss Meat Market 12 miles south of town. Local residents are more often found downing a burger and a Bud at the Barrel.Those with a taste for elegance and a beverage that isn’t Busch-bred are better off at restaurants like Europa, whose name sums up its menu; the Vintage, where the German food is good but the Stone Hill wines are better; and the Cottage, which has a limited menu but a lush hilltop setting.Hermann also officially celebrates its German roots. On the third weekend of May, there’s Maifest, which focuses on dancing, parades and crafts. Octoberfest brings four weekends of wine tours, music and food, and in December, the town features a traditional German Christmas market.But for Mr. Dierberg, the town is not just about German wines and German heritage, it’s about the way it looks.“Mainly, it’s the buildings that do it for me,” he said. “But it’s also the way the hills sit against the water, and how they come down into the valley. I can be driving out of St. Louis, and I might be in a hurry and talking on the phone, and even if it’s cloudy, I come into this valley and it’s like the sun comes out, and everything’s nice.”Unlike the Ozarks several hours south, the Hermann hills have no water parks, music theaters, casinos or magic shows — just rambling woods cut by fields, white-fenced horse farms, brick farmhouses enveloped in ancient trees and wineries. And its residents like it that way.Being nestled in a crook of the wide Missouri has two major disadvantages: Hermann is steamy in summer, and the low-lying areas near the Missouri River and its tributaries are susceptible to flooding after heavy rains. Cultural and arts events are scarce, and to take in something in St. Louis is a 160-mile round trip.Jim Grebing, Hermann’s tourism director, said: “It’s not really a child-friendly place in that instead of water parks, we have wineries and bed-and-breakfasts. And many of the bed-and-breakfasts don’t take children because of the antiques and breakage and so forth. On the other hand, many of the people who go to the bed-and-breakfasts go there to get away from the kids.”With little building going on, old houses trump new ones in Hermann. Compact three-bedroom cottages deliver four-season views of the river and low upkeep for $150,000. A furnished B & B-ready cottage is listed for $169,900. Roughly 10 percent of the housing stock in the area are second homes, according to Mr. Grebing.The median price for a house in Hermann is $170,000 to $180,000, said Judy Warden of Warden Real Estate. Recent sales include a four-bedroom house that was built in 1941 for $88,500. And an 1880s two-bedroom brick cottage with a backyard grape arbor and a separate summer kitchen sold for $96,500.Unusual for Hermann, which likes to consider itself the anti-Branson, a development of five second homes, each one on 32 acres, is being built on the other side of the river around an artificial lake. Jeff Kelly, a builder from Chesterfield, near St. Louis, who is on the development team (and is building his own second home), said, “We figure it’ll be removed from the sprawl of St. Louis for another 15 or 20 years.”Speaking of the development, Mr. Kelly added: “The wine-country aspect adds to the appeal tremendously. Plus the culture, plus the rolling Midwestern countryside, plus the occasional alpaca farm.”Even so, Katy Wehrle, a broker with Wehrle Real Estate, said: “It’s slow right now. Interest rates have held things back, and gas prices haven’t helped. But even with that, people who have a 6,000-square-foot home in St. Louis are buying a 1,500-square-foot home in Hermann. They see it as a steppingstone to get them to where they really want to be.”She added, “This has always been a well-kept secret in that regard, but I think its days as a secret are about done.”POPULATION 2,751, according to a 2006 estimate by the Census Bureau.WHO’S BUYING Mainly people from St. Louis and others from throughout the Midwest.GETTING THERE The airport in St. Louis has flights from around the country. From there, it’s about a 75-minute drive to Hermann.WHILE YOU’RE LOOKING The Hermann Hill Vineyard Inn and Riverbluff Cottages (711 Wein Street, 573-486-4455; www.hermannhill.com) is a bed-and-breakfast that offers rooms or cottages from $169 to $331 a night.

"'07-09-29,'0','WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 — Senator John McCain said in an interview posted on the Internet today that the Constitution established the United States as a Christian nation and that his faith is probably of better spiritual guidance than that of a Muslim candidate for president.“I just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on Christian principles, that’s a decision the American people would have to make, but personally, I prefer someone who I know who has a solid grounding in my faith,” Mr. McCain said in response to a question about the possibility of a Muslim running for president.The interview was conducted by beliefnet, a Web site that writes extensively about religious issues of virtually every denomination. After the interview, Mr. McCain contacted the Web site to clarify his remarks, saying, “I would vote for a Muslim if he or she was the candidate best able to lead the country and defend our political values.”Mr. McCain said in the interview that he agreed with the results of a poll that showed that a majority of Americans believe the Constitution establishes a Christian nation.“I would probably have to say yes, that the Constitution established the United States of America as a Christian nation,” he said. “But I say that in the broadest sense. The lady that holds her lamp beside the golden door doesn’t say, ‘I only welcome Christians.’ We welcome the poor, the tired, the huddled masses. But when they come here they know that they are in a nation founded on Christian principles.”Mr. McCain, who has seen the erosion of his popularity as a Republican presidential candidate from front-runner to near-collapse, has worked hard at mending relations with conservative religious groups. Last year he appeared at Liberty University, standing next to its founder, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the conservative religious leader whom he had once described as an agent of intolerance and a threat to the party.'"
"'07-09-29,'0','Federal prosecutors from the office of the United States attorney in Manhattan, Michael J. Garcia, have been examining a range of accusations against Mr. Kerik, including bribery, tax fraud and wiretap conspiracy, people briefed on the inquiry said. Some alleged crimes were said to be committed while Mr. Kerik served in city posts under Mr. Giuliani, others while he was in the Giuliani consulting business, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case.Mr. Fratto would not discuss the Kerik case or any other matters that might require Judge Mukasey, a widely respected jurist, to recuse himself, nor the specific reasons he might do so.But among the issues the judge would face is one involving his son, Marc Mukasey, a former prosecutor who works at the Bracewell & Giuliani law firm. Mr. Mukasey was among the lawyers who advised Mr. Giuliani last year as he prepared for his April testimony before a Bronx grand jury that investigated Mr. Kerik on state charges, a person who was briefed on that matter said.In that case, Mr. Kerik pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court in the Bronx to two misdemeanor counts and admitted accepting $165,000 in renovations to his Bronx apartment from a construction firm accused of having mob ties. The company, which has denied any ties to organized crime, had sought Mr. Kerik’s help in getting a license to do work in the city.The federal investigation appears to be moving forward, with a grand jury in White Plains hearing evidence in the case in recent weeks, several people briefed on the matter said.In February, federal prosecutors offered to end their inquiry in exchange for a guilty plea from Mr. Kerik that would have included two years’ prison time, but he declined the offer, his lawyer, Kenneth M. Breen, and others have said. Mr. Breen, of Paul Hastings Janofsky and Walker LLP, said he expected the federal investigation to be concluded without any charges being filed against his client.""We are confident that whomever at the Department of Justice reviews this matter will conclude that there is no case here,"" he said.Correction: October 2, 2007  An article on Saturday about a decision by Judge Michael B. Mukasey, the nominee for attorney general, to recuse himself from any matters involving his close friend Rudolph W. Giuliani rendered incorrectly the name of Mr. Giuliani’s law firm, for which Mr. Mukasey’s son works. It is Bracewell & Giuliani, not Bracewell Giuliani.

"'07-09-29,'0','“We fear the steady rise of food prices will hit those on the front lines of hunger the hardest,” said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the United Nations World Food Program. The United States is the biggest contributor to the agency.She warned that food aid spending would have to rise just to keep feeding the same number of people. But the appropriations bill for the coming year now moving through Congress does not promise any significant increases in the food aid budget.The impact of rising food prices on food aid is part of a broader debate about the long-term impact on the world’s poorest people of using food crops to make ethanol and other biofuels, a strategy that rich countries like the United States hope will eventually reduce dependence on Middle Eastern oil.Some advocates for the poor say rising food prices could benefit poor farmers in developing countries, providing them with markets and decent prices for their crops. But others warn that the growing use of food crops to make fuel, especially if stoked by large subsidies in rich countries, could substantially increase food prices. That could push hundreds of millions more poor people into hunger, especially landless laborers and subsistence farmers, according to a recent article in Foreign Affairs magazine. The authors were Benjamin Senauer and C. Ford Runge, food policy analysts and professors at the University of Minnesota.Production of food crops to make biofuels will also tend to favor growers with plenty of capital and large land holdings, they say, rather than small-scale, impoverished farmers lacking modern grain storage facilities in poor countries. “The policies put in place are going to be crucial to whether the small producer and the people who live where hunger is concentrated can benefit,” Mr. Senauer said.But for now food aid is suffering, as are poor people in poor countries, economists say. And their situation may get even tougher next year, relief agencies warn. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization is projecting that low-income countries reliant on food imports, including most of sub-Saharan Africa, will see the amount they pay to import cereals rise 14 percent.The world’s ability to absorb fresh price shocks has shrunk along with food stocks. “We’re very worried,” said Henri Josserand, who heads the organization’s global information and early warning system. “World food stocks are much smaller than they used to be.”The food aid declines may also continue. Catholic Relief Services, a major distributor of American food aid, has projected substantial increases in what the federal government pays for food aid next year, based on an analysis of the futures market for the wheat, corn and soybean products that are mainstays of aid. “It’s bad news and it’s not just going to affect U.S. food aid, but food aid from every source,” said Frank Orzechowski, a retired commodity trader who now advises Catholic Relief Services.This year’s decline in food aid follows a period when the sharply escalating costs of shipping American-grown food aid to Africa and Asia already reduced the tonnage supplied. The United States Government Accountability Officementnd this year that the number of people being fed by American food aid had declined to 70 million in 2006 from 105 million in 2002, mainly because of rising transportation and logistical costs.Now food prices are also playing a role. New data from the Department of Agriculture show that the cost of food for the federal government’s main food aid program, Food for Peace, rose 35 percent over the past two years.The amount of food bought for American food aid programs has fallen to 2.4 million metric tons this year from 4 million metric tons in 2005 and 5.3 million metric tons in 2000. Thomas Melito, who supervised the Government Accountability Office’s food aid investigation this year, called the escalating costs of food aid “frightening.”“In a situation where there are 850 million hungry people in the world and the program was only providing enough for 70 million people in 2006, the new totals will be even lower,” he said.Congress is considering changes to the food aid program as part of the omnibus farm bill that some economists and advocates for the hungry say would improve the efficiency of the program and allow it to feed more people. They point to a Bush administration proposal that would allow the government to use up to $300 million of the food aid budget to buy food in African countries close to hunger emergencies rather than shipping it from the United States on mainly American-flagged vessels as current law requires.In his speech to the United Nations this week, President Bush said the proposal would speed delivery and help provide a market for poor farmers in developing countries.The House version of the farm bill includes no such provision. The Senate Agriculture Committee has not produced a farm bill.“To my mind, that’s the way out of this pincer,” said Emmy Simmons, an agricultural economist and retired senior manager at the United States Agency for International Development.“But the shipping guys are hanging tough,” she added. “They’re defending that little chunk of revenue. They aren’t super concerned whether you feed less people.”Groups representing shipping companies and agribusiness interests have opposed using the budget of the main food aid program to buy food in developing countries instead of relying on American food shipped overseas.Gloria Tosi, who represents most of the American ship owners involved in the food aid system, said buying commodities abroad would erode domestic political support for the program and lead to lower food aid budgets from Congress. She said it was “politically naïve” to think the food commodity groups and ship owners that have for decades supported food aid in Congress would favor buying commodities abroad.“None of us will be working toward that,” she said.'"
"'07-09-29,'0','WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 — An important test of the system to defend against long-range ballistic missiles was rated a success on Friday when an interceptor collided with a mock warhead high over the Pacific, Pentagon officials said.A target missile was launched from Kodiak Island, Alaska, and tracked by radar at Beale Air Force Base, near Sacramento. The interceptor missile was fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base, north of Santa Barbara, Calif., striking the target warhead about eight minutes later, officials said.“This was a very operationally realistic test,” said Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency.The $85 million test was a replay of one from late May that was not completed because the target rocket fell short of the designated interceptor range in the Pacific. Because the attacking rocket and its mock warhead never reached the area to be defended, the interceptor missile was not launched in that test.The previous major missile test was held a year ago. It was deemed a success.The Bush administration proposes a missile defense system of 40 interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska, along with 4 at Vandenberg and 10 to be located in Poland. The ground-based interceptors would be guided by a series of radar sites, including one proposed for the Czech Republic.But efforts to place elements of an American missile defense system at the two Central European sites have angered Russian officials, and the proposed sites face possible budget cuts from skeptical Democrats in Congress.The administration argues that the system is a limited defense against a small attack from nations like North Korea or Iran and that the small number of interceptors is no threat to the large Russian missile arsenal.'"

"'07-09-29,'0','The centerpiece of the new contract is a voluntary employee benefit association, or VEBA, a health care trust that would assume responsibility for the benefits G.M. expects to pay its retirees. G.M. estimates its liability at more than $50 billion.The trust requires court and regulatory approval that is expected to take about two years. Once the trust is established, G.M. will make an initial investment of $24.1 billion. It told the union that it would invest $5.8 billion in following years, bringing the total to $29.9 billion.G.M. pledged to provide more, up to an additional $1.6 billion over 20 years, if the trust’s investments do not achieve the earnings that G.M. expects.The VEBA would take effect Jan. 1, 2010. Until then, G.M. would pay $5.4 billion to maintain the current retiree health plan.Along with taking the liability off G.M.’s books, the trust would protect workers in the event of a bankruptcy, because its assets would not be held by G.M.When the contract is signed, the company will pay each worker a $3,000 bonus. They will also receive lump-sum payments in the next three years, but those will not be folded into wages.Over the four years of the contract, those bonuses and cost-of-living pay increases will, on average, be worth an estimated $13,056 more for each worker than the previous agreement, the brochure said.G.M. also will permanently hire 3,000 workers who are now temporary. They will then receive regular wages and benefits.Wages for an assembly worker will increase to $28.85 after four years, rather than the $28.12 level under the current contract. Certain “noncore” positions will be split into a two-tiered system, under which new hires will earn $14 to $14.61 an hour.The agreement continues an often-criticized provision known as the jobs bank, which enables workers to receive pay and benefits after being laid off, but Mr. Gettelfinger said the deal would have new restrictions on the duration of eligibility.Among G.M.’s commitments to the union was a promise to build the Chevrolet Volt, a hybrid electric car, in the plant in Hamtramck, Mich., starting in 2010. The Volt is a pet project of G.M.’s vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, who said Friday that G.M. was pleased with the contract.“Anything that improves America’s competitiveness is great, and this contract we believe very seriously does,” Mr. Lutz said in an interview Friday.Local leaders attending this morning’s meeting said much of it was spent discussing the health care trust. Some union members oppose the concept, but many leaders said they expected their members to ratify the deal.Eldon Renaud, president of U.A.W. Local 2164, said he was “very excited” about news that G.M.’s plant in Bowling Green, Ky., which makes the Cadillac XLR and Chevrolet Corvette, would add production of the Saturn Sky and Pontiac Solstice in 2012.He said work on the new cars would probably bring the plant up to two full shifts. Car plants with just one shift of production are seen as vulnerable to shutdowns.Mr. Renaud said he expected the plant’s employment to triple, from the current 960 workers.“I’m just elated,” he said. “My feet haven’t touched the ground.”The U.A.W.’s previous contract with the Detroit automaker expired Sept. 14. The union still must negotiate deals with the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler.'"
"'07-09-29,'0','“They want to make mainland China hesitate before launching any attack,” said Andrei Chang, a Hong Kong-based expert on the Chinese and Taiwanese militaries and editor in chief of Kanwa Defense Review magazine. “These missiles could not only destroy military targets, but financial and economic targets as well.“They want to create massive panic,” he added.There have also been unconfirmed news reports in Taiwan that the military is developing short-range ballistic missiles. Mr. Chen’s independence-leaning administration refuses to comment on the existence of such a program.At a time when Taipei has angered China with a decision to hold a referendum on the island’s bid to rejoin the United Nations under the name of Taiwan, the deployment of missiles that could strike the mainland could further increase tensions. The Bush administration has signaled that it opposes Taiwan’s developing such weapons.There were reports in the Taiwanese news media this month that, under pressure from Washington, the Chen administration had dropped plans to deploy surface-to-surface missiles on outlying Matsu island near the coast of Fujian Province, China.Missiles deployed on Matsu would be able to strike targets on the mainland where China has concentrated air, missile and land forces opposite Taiwan.Taiwan’s military refused to comment, but Beijing this week reacted sharply to the reports.“We sternly warn the Taiwan authorities not to play with fire,” Li Weiyi, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, told a regular news briefing on Wednesday, according to a report carried by the official Xinhua news agency. “Whoever plays with fire will get burned.”But analysts believe it will be difficult for the Bush administration to restrain Taipei while China continues its rapid buildup of missiles that could strike military targets and vital infrastructure on Taiwan.The American and Taiwanese militaries estimate that China adds up to 100 new missiles a year to those arrayed against the island.“Taiwan will go ahead,” said Andrew Yang, secretary general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a Taipei-based security policy institute. “It sends a signal that Taiwan will not be sitting and waiting for Beijing to conduct a strike against Taiwan.”Mr. Chang, the Defense Review editor, and other experts are confident that the land attack cruise missile, the Hsiung Feng-2E, developed at the Taiwan military’s Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, could soon be in production after its test in February.“I am sure it is almost ready,” Mr. Chang said.But Mr. Yang and some other analysts held out the possibility that, despite the successful test, some of the reports about the new missile’s capabilities could be exaggerated.He said that the missile had been tested only to about 200 miles, a third of its theoretical maximum range. The shorter range would be enough only to reach coastal targets on the mainland.But there was potential for improvement as development continued.“In five years’ time, the range could be extended,” he said.'"

"'07-09-29,'0','SEATTLE, Sept. 28 — No one had heard from Tanya Rider for more than a week. Her husband, having already opened up their bank and phone accounts to investigators, was just sitting down to take a polygraph test to prove that he had not harmed her.Then they found her, alive.Twenty feet down a roadside ravine, still strapped into the front seat of her Honda Element, Ms. Rider, 33, responded faintly when rescuers called her name through the blackberry bushes that had helped conceal her since her car ran off the road near the Seattle suburb of Renton on Sept. 19. Her kidneys were failing from dehydration and a buildup of toxins caused by muscle damage. Her clavicle and ribs were broken, her shoulder dislocated, her left leg severely hurt.It was the signal from her cellphone that finally led investigators to Ms. Rider on Thursday, after what her husband of eight years, Tom, said Friday were days of futile efforts to have her disappearance investigated as a missing person case.On Friday, Ms. Rider was in critical but stable condition at Harborview Medical Center here, said Dr. Lisa McIntyre, her attending physician. The doctor declared Ms. Rider’s survival “a feat” and credited her youth and relative good health with helping to see her through.Mr. Rider, weary, relieved and frustrated as he sat before reporters and television cameras at the hospital on Friday, expressed gratitude to the police officers who found his wife, but not for what he said were the restrictions that kept them from finding her sooner.“The policy that tied their hands nearly cost my wife her life,” he said.Ms. Rider was last seen leaving work at a Fred Meyer department store in Bellevue, Wash., on Sept. 19. Mr. Rider, 39, said that he has two jobs, delivering pizza at night and working as a superintendent of housing developments during the day, and that he did not know for sure that his wife was missing until the morning of Sept. 22. At that point, he said, he called the police in Bellevue, which is about 15 miles north of their home in Maple Valley. He said they told him the case was out of their jurisdiction and they referred him to the King County Sheriff’s Office.'"
"'07-09-29,'0','“If you went away sometime in July and came back about now, you might say, ‘Nothing happened while I was gone,’” he said.In yesterday’s trading, the main indexes fell slightly, with the S.& P. 500 down 4.63 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,526.75. The Dow slipped 17.31 points, or 0.12 percent, to 13,895.63, and the Nasdaq fell 8.09 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,701.50.That still left the Dow and the Nasdaq with gains of more than 11 percent this year, and the S.&P. up 7.7 percent for the year.The market appears to be buoyed by a belief that the problems in the housing and credit markets will not pull the broader economy into a recession and that growth in Asia and Europe will help offset those ill effects. The optimism is most vividly manifest in the performance of foreign markets, particularly in the fast-developing countries like China and India.A widely followed Morgan Stanley index that tracks emerging markets is up 26 percent since Aug. 16, when it hit a low. Markets in developed countries excluding the United States are up nearly 12 percent in the same period.Even in the United States, the market’s return has been led by sectors like energy, industrials, materials and technology, which investors believe are best positioned to take advantage of the growth abroad.The financial and consumer discretionary sectors have lagged; they are seen as having the most to lose from a declining housing market and slowing consumer spending domestically.Indeed, investors in September poured $1.1 billion into mutual funds that specialize in emerging markets, while they withdrew about $3.2 billion from domestic equity funds, according to AMG Data Services, a research firm.Expectations that the rest of the world will outperform the United States are also reflected in the depreciating dollar, which dropped yesterday to $1.4265 against the euro, a new low. The dollar has fallen 2.8 percent against the euro since Sept. 14, when the Fed cut rates and is down 8 percent for the year. Gold prices rose 1.4 percent, to $742.80 a troy ounce, the highest since 1980.Currency traders, and others in the financial markets, are operating under the assumption that central bankers in Washington have taken a more activist and accommodating stance.That view started to take hold in mid-August when the Fed cut the discount rate — what it charges banks to borrow directly from it. Investors became even more convinced last week when the Fed cut its benchmark rate by half a point, to 4.75 percent, rather than the expected quarter point.The futures market is now predicting that the Fed will cut rates at least once more, to 4.5 percent, at its meeting on Oct. 30 and 31.But one Fed official, William Poole, said yesterday that “it would be a mistake for markets to bake into the cake the assumption of ongoing rate cuts,” according to Bloomberg News.Mr. Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, responding to a question after a speech in New York, said he was expressing his own views and not speaking for the Fed.In the credit market, the Fed’s rate cutting and its lending at the discount rate and through open market operations have eased the logjam somewhat.This week, banks raising money for the private equity buyout of the First Data Corporation, a credit card processor, were able to sell more debt than they had planned.Still some of the roughly $300 billion debt backlog that needs to be sold may never be worked off. The private equity acquisitions that are falling apart or being withdrawn include the purchases of the student loan provider Sallie Mae and Harman International Industries, a maker of high-end audio speakers.“You still have a big overhang of supply out there,” said Eric G. Takaha, director of corporate and high-yield debt at Franklin Templeton, the investment company. “But the path has become a little clearer.”One mortgage company, Thornburg Mortgage, said the market for “jumbo” home loans — those with a face value of more than $417,000 — appeared to be improving. In recent weeks, investors have been more willing to buy bonds backed by pools of the mortgages, but are demanding higher returns and more safeguards against default.Home buyers searching for jumbo loans will notice a slight drop in interest rates but will have to shop around, said Larry A. Goldstone, president and chief operating officer at Thornburg, based in Santa Fe, N.M.“The market has improved modestly and it is certainly not deteriorating,” Mr. Goldstone said. “I think it has a ways to go before it’s back to functioning in a completely normal way.”'"

"'07-09-29,'0','There’s a measure of truth about the dark side of globalization in all this, but that’s a lot to lay on poor Milton.Ms. Klein pins the blame for much of the misery in the world squarely on what she views as Friedman’s misguided philosophy and the many people in its thrall. And here she includes not only a litany of expected conservatives like Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and George W. Bush, but what others might think of as conventional liberals, people like Bill Clinton and Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist who advocated economic “shock therapy” in post-socialist countries like Bolivia and Poland and now is one of the leading proponents in the effort to increase sharply aid to the world’s poor.“Since the fall of Communism, free markets and free people have been packaged as a single ideology that claims to be humanity’s best and only defense against repeating a history filled with mass graves, killing fields and torture chambers,” Ms. Klein writes. “Yet in the Southern Cone, the first place where the contemporary religion of unfettered free markets escaped from the basement workshops of the University of Chicago and was applied in the real world, it did not bring democracy; it was predicated on the overthrow of democracy in country after country. And it did not bring peace but required the systematic murder of tens of thousands and the torture of between 100,000 and 150,000 people.”Friedman’s association with Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean dictator, was indeed the worst stain on his career. His defense that his economic advice to Pinochet was no different from what a doctor might give a government on how to deal with an outbreak of AIDS is not very persuasive.Moreover, it is no secret that capitalism does not require a democratic political system to thrive: China is proof of that. Ms. Klein is not alone, either, in pointing out that many governments serve to protect the interests of the rich, and that as inequality grows, the threat rises that the establishment will turn to undemocratic means to thwart the will of the majority.Ms. Klein exposes the hypocrisy behind those who promote free enterprise but accept autocratic regimes to carry it out, which makes her book a useful corrective to some of the uncritical celebrations of the spread of globalization since the collapse of the Soviet empire.But her argument constantly overreaches, because her goal is not really to tame capitalism so much as to taunt it.While Ms. Klein occasionally nods to Scandinavian-style social democracy as an alternative to the “neo-liberal” American-style model she condemns, it turns out that nothing short of a socialist utopia — an economy of worker collectives running environmentally benign enterprises with nationalized banks to direct investment — will actually do.What she is most blind to is the necessary role of entrepreneurial capitalism in overcoming the inherent tendency of any established social system to lapse into stagnation, as all too many socialist countries — and some nonsocialist ones, too — have shown. Like it or not, without strong economic growth and its inevitable disruptions , there is little hope for creating the healthy middle classes necessary to sustain democracies, much less an improvement in the lot of the poor and dispossessed Ms. Klein seeks to represent. And yes, that means some people will become rich and powerful.In the end, I suspect that Ms. Klein’s goal in writing “The Shock Doctrine” is not so much to persuade others to join her anti-globalization, anti-corporatist cause as it is to reinforce the dreams of those already convinced of its righteousness.“We did not lose the battles of ideas,” she said in a recent speech to the American Sociological Association. “We were not outsmarted and we were not out-argued. We lost because we were crushed. Sometimes we were crushed by army tanks, and sometimes we were crushed by think tanks. And by think tanks I mean the people who are paid to think by the makers of tanks.”That must be a comforting thought. If only it were that simple.'"

Nothing in the N.P.T. forbids Iran to enrich uranium for nuclear power.That extralegal demand comes from the United States and on its insistence the Security Council, in response to Iran’s previous concealment of nuclear activities. Such concealment was contrary to the N.P.T., and Mr. ElBaradei has demanded and begun to get answers from Iran. But halting uranium enrichment would make Iran dependent on foreign supply for nuclear fuel — a demand that Tehran rejects after years it has been unable to obtain even civilian aircraft parts thanks to United States sanctions.The Iranian leadership has made uranium enrichment a point of national pride. It cannot back down without domestic political humiliation, as Washington’s “regime change” advocates know well.The nuclear crisis is, among other things, about regime change or war, and therefore it is all too likely to end in war.

"'07-09-29,'0','Born in the Dominican Republic to Haitian parents, Ms. Pierre, 44, has spent her life advocating on behalf of Haitians and ethnic Haitians who hold Dominican citizenship but are subjected to racial discrimination in a society that places a high value on lighter skin. At the age of 13, she organized a protest by sugar-cane workers in one of the Dominican slums — known as bateyes — where she grew up seeing Haitian workers oppressed by their Dominican bosses.Her current troubles with the government stem from 2005, when her organization, Movement for Dominico-Haitian Women, took to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights the case of two ethnic Haitian children who were denied Dominican birth certificates. The court found in their favor, ordering the government to provide the birth certificates and pay $8,000 in damages to each of the children.The court could hardly have found otherwise. The Dominican Constitution grants citizenship to those born on Dominican soil, except the children of diplomats or those “in transit” through the country. That has long meant that the children of Haitians who came to the country to work, legally or illegally, gained Dominican citizenship.But after the decision, the Dominican Supreme Court ruled that Haitian workers were considered “in transit,” and that their children were therefore not entitled to citizenship. (Those children are entitled to Haitian citizenship, however, because Haiti grants citizenship to the offspring of Haitians no matter where they are born.)THE decision has been decried by human rights groups, who say it has prompted government officials to begin questioning the citizenship of many Dominicans of Haitian descent, putting them at risk of deportation. But Dominican officials respond that there is only one person to blame for the crackdown: Ms. Pierre.She scoffs at that notion, saying that the problem is racism, not her efforts to end it.Race is a complicated issue in the Dominican Republic, where much of the population traces its ancestry to the African slaves brought to the island, but where few regard themselves as black. Ms. Pierre said it was considered a compliment for a light-skinned Dominican to tell a dark-skinned one that he had the soul of a white person. Saying that someone thinks like a black person, Ms. Pierre says, is the equivalent of labeling the person ignorant.“On TV, the maids are always black and the models are always white,” she said.The American Embassy recently urged its staff members not to patronize one of Santo Domingo’s most popular nightclubs, Loft, because African-American diplomats were denied admission at the door while whites got past the bouncer. Ms. Pierre said she was not surprised.“I’m sure they were confused with being Haitian,” said Ms. Pierre, who speaks Spanish as well as Haitian creole and is a flurry of activity in her office, sometimes pressing two phones to her ears at once.“Haitianization” is what Dominicans call the negative influences that poor Haitians bring to their side of the island. Mr. Morales, the foreign minister, explained in his letter protesting Ms. Pierre’s award that his country could not handle the huge numbers of illegal Haitian immigrants. He put the blame on the United States and other countries for failing to improve conditions in Haiti.Mr. Morales did not mention that as Haitians head to the more prosperous economy of the Dominican Republic, many Dominicans emigrate to better opportunities in the United States — sometimes legally, sometimes not.Even as Haitians are shunned, Ms. Pierre argues that the Dominican economy relies on them. Haitian laborers can be seen on construction sites throughout the capital, including the new subway that is the personal project of President Leonel Fernández.Ms. Pierre’s office, just down the road from the presidential palace, has become a gathering spot for Dominicans of Haitian descent who find their nationality questioned.ON a recent day, there was a mother who had tried to get a government identity card for her 19-year-old daughter but was told that her daughter, who was born in the Dominican Republic, was a foreigner. The girl’s plans for college depended on her getting the card.A father, an English teacher at a Dominican public school, came to Ms. Pierre’s office after trying for five months to get a birth certificate for his newborn daughter. “I’m as Dominican as they are,” he said, adding angrily that the government had begun issuing pink birth certificates for children it suspected of being foreigners as opposed to the white documents given to Dominican children.In Ms. Pierre’s case, officials questioning her nationality have focused on disparities in her record. Her name is listed on her birth certificate as Solain Pie, which she says is a result of a government clerk’s error. She said her first name should be Solange (Sonia is a nickname), whereas Pierre is her last name.Both her parents, she said, were Haitians who came to the Dominican Republic for work. Her mother had two children in Haiti, both of whom remain there, and 12 more in the Dominican Republic.“I’m not Haitian, no matter what the government says,” Ms. Pierre said. “My parents were, but I’m not. I’m Dominican, and I have the same right of any citizen to criticize my country.”'"

"'07-09-30,'0','Ms. Villarosa said the military must now seek a peaceful resolution through a dialogue with the opposition “rather than just relying on gunfire, which has succeeded in clearing the streets but does not address the underlying grievances of the people.”Mr. Gambari came to Myanmar as the representative of a world that has watched in outrage as a military government that has ruled through force and intimidation called out its troops to fire into crowds of demonstrators.Some political analysts doubted that the visit could have a significant effect on a ruling junta that has resisted all international efforts — both confrontational and friendly — to modify its behavior over the years.Repeated visits by United Nations envoys have failed to bring reconciliation between the junta and the political opposition or secure the release of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. Mr. Gambari visited her a year ago, the last time she had been seen by any senior foreign official.“Reconciliation is now farther away than ever from reality,” said Aung Naing Oo, a Burmese political analyst who is based in Thailand. “The military’s violent response took the lid off the anger and pent-up frustration that has accumulated over the past 19 years and it will be difficult for the military administration to put things back in order.”Political analysts said a key to modifying Myanmar’s behavior would be pressure from China, its main trading partner and political buffer in the outside world.On Saturday, China’s prime minister, Wen Jiabao, said that his country was “very much concerned about the current situation,” and that “China hopes all parties in Myanmar exercise restraint and use peaceful means to restore its stability as soon as possible.”But there was no indication that China would join international efforts to boycott or sanction Myanmar.On Sunday, a senior Japanese official headed for Myanmar to protest the shooting death of a Japanese photographer, Kenji Nagai, 50, as he covered a military assault on protesters in the streets.His killing drew outrage in Japan, which is Myanmar’s largest foreign aid donor, giving about $25 million last year. But the Japanese prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, said he would refrain for now, like China, from withdrawing aid or taking other steps to pressure Myanmar.Video of the shooting, filmed from a high floor of a building above and posted on YouTube.com, shows a helmeted soldier running up behind the photographer and apparently pushing him to the ground before shooting him and running on. Mr. Nagai raises his arms for a moment, camera in hand, then lies still.Myanmar authorities have shut down access to the Internet in their country, and the police were reported to be searching pedestrians and confiscating cameras in a continuing attempt to halt the flow of photographs and video images like these.The World Food Program reported that it had received assurances that it could resume delivering aid to hundreds of thousands of people who had been cut off by government restrictions on transportation. The program’s country director and representative, Chris Kaye, said local authorities in Mandalay, the nation’s second largest city, had issued a permit that would allow deliveries to remote areas of northern Myanmar.The program provides aid to vulnerable people including those with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, to children in poor areas of the country and to impoverished former poppy-farming areas.'"

"'07-09-30,'0','WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 — Senator John McCain said in an interview posted on the Internet on Saturday that the Constitution established the United States as a Christian nation and that his faith is probably of better spiritual guidance than that of a Muslim candidate for president.“I just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on Christian principles, that’s a decision the American people would have to make, but personally, I prefer someone who I know who has a solid grounding in my faith,” Mr. McCain said in response to a question about the possibility of a Muslim’s running for president.The interview was conducted by beliefnet, a Web site that writes extensively about religious issues of virtually every denomination. After the interview, Mr. McCain contacted the Web site to clarify his remarks, saying, “I would vote for a Muslim if he or she was the candidate best able to lead the country and defend our political values.”Mr. McCain said in the interview that he agreed with the results of a poll that showed that a majority of Americans believe the Constitution establishes a Christian nation.“I would probably have to say yes, that the Constitution established the United States of America as a Christian nation,” Mr. McCain said.'"
"'07-09-30,'0','And if the bust becomes worse, candidates for president could be put on the spot to pledge even more federal support for the industry, particularly here in Iowa, whose caucus in January is the first contest in the presidential nominating process.Many industry experts say the worst problems are temporary and have been intensified by transportation bottlenecks in getting ethanol from the heartland to the coasts, where it is needed most. And even if some farmers who invested in the plants lose money, most of them are reaping a separate bounty from higher prices for corn and other commodities, which are expected to remain elevated for some time.Even so, companies are already shelving plans for expansion and canceling new plant construction. If prices fall more, as many analysts predict, there is likely to be a sweeping consolidation of the industry, and some smaller companies could go out of business.The falling price of ethanol comes in sharp contrast to the rise in crude oil prices. Lower ethanol prices help reduce gasoline prices at the pump, where ethanol is available, but because it constitutes 10 percent or less in most blends, the impact for the consumer is marginal.Congress essentially legislated the industry’s expansion by requiring steadily higher quantities of ethanol as a gasoline blend, a kick-start that was further spurred by the proliferation of bans on a competing fuel additive used to help curb air pollution.But the ethanol industry, which is also heavily subsidized by federal tax incentives, got far ahead of the requirements of the law, rapidly building scores of plants and snapping up a rising share of the corn harvest. Many of those plants have gone into operation in recent months, and many more are scheduled for completion by the end of next year.The resulting ethanol oversupply is buffeting the market. Here in northern Iowa, deep in the corn belt, newly cautious farmers and ethanol executives are figuring out how to cut costs and weighing their options should the situation get worse.“We don’t know what, ultimately, the marketplace will price ethanol at,” said Rick Brehm, president and chief executive of Lincolnway Energy, a midsize distillery here. “It could go lower.”Since construction crews broke ground on the Lincolnway plant in 2005, the price of ethanol on the local market has fallen to $1.55 a gallon from about $2, Mr. Brehm said. Over the same period, the price of corn, representing 70 percent of production costs, has risen to $3.27 a bushel from $1.60. “We’re trapped between two commodities,” he said.Lincolnway was once virtually alone in the region, but now a handful of new competing distilleries are operating and pouring even more ethanol onto the market, offering blenders more options to negotiate lower prices and driving up demand for corn.“Obviously, I’m concerned about where we’re going,” said Bill Couser, chairman of Lincolnway Energy, though he added that his company is still making money and he is optimistic about the future.The ethanol boom was set off when Congress enacted an energy law in 2005 that included a national mandate for the use of renewable fuel in gasoline, obliging the market to consume 7.5 billion gallons a year by 2012, compared with 3.5 billion gallons in 2004.Already, ethanol producers are poised to outpace that mandate, with capacity expected to reach 7.8 billion gallons by the end of 2007 and 11.5 billion gallons by 2009, although some in the industry are now predicting that the expansion could slow.The number of ethanol plants in the country has increased to 129 today from 81 in January 2005, according to the Renewable Fuels Association, while plants under construction or expanding have mushroomed to about 80 from 16 during the same period.“As ethanol supply increases over the next 12 months, the challenge will be to find a home for it,” said Mark Flannery, head of energy equity research at Credit Suisse. “The ethanol surplus is here already.”Because ethanol is corrosive and soaks up water and impurities, it cannot be shipped through the country’s fuel pipeline network. So it must be transported by train, truck and barge, a more expensive transportation network that is suddenly finding it hard to keep up with the surge in ethanol production.There is a long backlog in orders for specialized ethanol rail cars to ship the surplus production. Many rail terminals at the ethanol plants do not have spurs large enough to accommodate the long trains that ethanol promoters like to call “virtual pipelines.” And pumps from the storage tanks to the rail cars at the terminals often do not have sufficient capacity to load trains quickly and efficiently.Phillip C. Baumel, economics professor emeritus at Iowa State University, said that in many cases ethanol producers ramped up their production so rapidly that they gave “inadequate attention to meeting transportation and distribution needs.”Gasoline wholesale marketers have been slow to gear up ethanol blending terminals, in part because they had to invest simultaneously in equipment to manage low sulfur diesel and tougher product specifications.Prices of ethanol range widely around the country, even differing from one county to the next in the same state on a daily basis. [The average rack, or wholesale, price reported by the DTN Ethanol Center on Tuesday was $2.42 a gallon in New York and $1.77 in Iowa.] Generally, prices are highest in states farthest away from the Midwest farm belt and in ones that have federal or state clean-air requirements that encourage the use of ethanol.In a new study, the Agriculture Department warned of “several supply chain issues that could inhibit growth in the ethanol industry,” including a backlog in rail tank car orders that grew to 36,166 rail cars by the end of the first quarter in 2007 from about 10,000 in the third quarter of 2005.“You just can’t scale it up overnight,” said Chuck Baker, vice president and executive director of the National Railroad Construction and Maintenance Association.Stiff blending regulations in some southern states like Florida have also been an impediment to ethanol. And so far, only about 1,000 pumps at the 179,000 gasoline stations around the country offer E-85, a fuel that is 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline, intended for the five million flex-fuel vehicles on the road that can run on high ethanol blends.Major ethanol producers and lobbyists describe the developing gulf between production output and transport capacity as a temporary growing pain that will be alleviated over time.“We have an industry that has doubled in size in just the past couple of years,” said Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association. “It is going to take a little time for the infrastructure to catch up.”Some analysts outside the industry think the current market upheaval may be more than simply a hiccup.Aaron Brady, a director at the consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said the current market problems could worsen if combined with other “unintended consequences that may be lurking” from increased ethanol production. He said pressure on corn and other food prices, water shortages, soil and fertilizer runoff could hurt political support for the industry.“If Congress doesn’t substantially raise the renewable fuel standard,” Mr. Brady said, “then this is not just a short term problem but a long term issue, and there will be more of a shakeout in the industry.”The Senate has approved a bill that would require gasoline producers to blend 36 billion gallons of ethanol into gasoline by 2022, an increase from the current standard of 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. The House did not include such a provision in the version it passed, and it is uncertain whether any final legislation will emerge this year and what it will say about ethanol if it does.Ethanol proponents say a new energy law is virtually inevitable at some point, and that even if it does not pass this year, lower ethanol prices will provide an incentive for refiners to blend more ethanol into expensive gasoline. A higher renewable fuels standard would force refiners and blenders to work faster to process increased amounts.A strong energy law would also increase investment and research into ethanol production from nonfood sources, like switch grass, and persuade auto companies to make more cars that run on blends well beyond the standard low percentage ethanol mixture, ethanol proponents argue.“This is an industry that is going to continue to grow,” said Bruce Rastetter, chief executive of Hawkeye Renewables, a private company based in nearby Ames that has two distilleries and two more under construction. “Once you see an energy bill, I think you will see the industry respond again.”Still, he has dropped plans to build a fifth plant and take Hawkeye public.'"
"'07-09-30,'0','New York will have its first rodeo season this fall. Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida have associations, too.Davis, who lives in South Lebanon, a suburb north of Cincinnati, lifts weights for a couple of hours after school, then heads to the backyard where he balances on a barrel to practice his riding technique.“Seven days a week I work out just to get on a bull for eight seconds,” Davis said before competing at a September rodeo at the Auglaize County Fairgrounds in Wapakoneta, Ohio.“It’s kind of like riding a roller coaster,” he said. “You get that feeling like you’re going down the first hill the whole time.”Except the roller coaster is not out to maim you.Davis spent eight weeks in a cast last year after a bull at a rodeo in Oklahoma kicked him into the air, detaching his right femur from his kneecap.“I’ve tried to get him to quit all the time,” Tom Davis, his father, said. “Anytime they climb on a bull, they’re laying their life on the line.”Concussions are common, and so are broken bones. The danger is accepted — although reluctantly by the parents who cannot hide their anxiety as they pace alongside the rodeo ring.“I’ve been beat up,” said Cody Stephens, a 16-year-old bareback rider from Hodgenville, Ky., who was kicked in the knee at this year’s national finals. “You gotta love it or you can’t do it.”Many competitors come from farms and have grown up around animals.“As long as I’ve been able to sit up I’ve been riding horses,” said Cayla Cox, of Carrollton, Ga. “I won my first ribbon when I was 3.”She takes part in all the girls’ events and is the state’s rodeo queen. “Everyone at my school knows me as the rodeo girl,” she said.Ohio’s high school association puts on 20 rodeos each year in the spring and fall. Events include bareback riding, goat tying, breakaway roping, barrel racing and steer racing.Families from across the state camp out in tents and trailers. The students play volleyball and go bowling after they are done with the day’s events.They do not compete as teams or for prizes. College scholarships are awarded by the state organization and at the national finals.Cowgirls astride horses and wearing all shades of plaid shirts chase down calves, trying to rope them within 30 seconds. Cowboys in black and white hats hop off their horses to wrestle steers in the fastest time.It all takes a lot of time and dedication.Nicole Hope, who also is a cheerleader and pole-vaulter, spends five hours a night taking care of her six horses and practicing roping, barrel racing and goat tying at her home in Wilmington.Allison Walker, of Wilmington, started out in rodeo three years ago even though she has been riding horses since she was 2. “I had no idea what I was doing,” she said.Wearing a straw hat with purple and pink ribbons and a matching plaid shirt, she fits in fine.She brushed her horse, put on the saddle and wished others good luck before the rodeo began. “Everyone cheers everyone,” she said.There are no hint of rivalries around the ring.They share equipment and ride each other’s horses.They kneel in prayer together before everything starts.And their friends usually think they are crazy.Some are watching Philip Davis ride bulls, and a few have even tried it.“They never want to do it again,” said Davis, who lives in Belle Center. “They say ‘What’s wrong with you.’”Davis, a high school junior, draws on his faith before he rides. He listens to Christian rock on his iPod and prays. After he rides, he takes a knee once he is clear of the bull.“I feel a lot closer to God,” he said. “Bull riding has made me a better person. It gives me a goal.”'"

Two of these projects, a study of Union Square Park and the opening of a store, provided children exposure and experience with the following: writing stories, counting, problem solving, mapping, measuring, designing, drawing and research.They became citizens of the community and greater New York. These children were prepared for any kind of school — progressive, traditional, public or private.I have to argue with those who say these children aren’t “ready” for challenging programs.

Clearly, Columbia needs to take the use of eminent domain off the table for there to be any realistic chance of Columbia and the West Harlem community coming together over the expansion plan.The condemnation and taking of private property by the government and giving it to a private university for its benefit should not be an element of the expansion plan.

"'07-09-30,'0','Many individual investors have been drawn to these funds. Tim Meyer, the E.T.F. business manager at Rydex Investments, estimated that only about 30 percent of the roughly $1.1 billion that has flowed into the company’s eight currency E.T.F.’s this year was from institutional investors, like pension plans and hedge funds. He said 50 percent probably came through financial planners and the other 20 percent from online brokerage accounts.Rydex Investments, based in Rockville, Md., has created many of the new E.T.F.’s. Each holds currency in a bank account at JPMorgan Chase in London. The funds pay interest, which is based on the overnight money market rate in each currency, minus fund expenses.Although the dollar has fallen against a broad range of currencies this year, Mr. Yardeni said the picture might soon become more complex. The dollar could rise against some major currencies over the next six months, while falling against others, he said, depending on economic conditions and interest rates in each country.For example, the Japanese yen, which has been floundering for years, has surprised investors by rallying against the dollar recently. But Mr. Yardeni said the yen could level off — or even reverse course — unless Japan’s central bank raised the country’s razor-thin interest rates. With fresh signs of deflation in Japan, he said, that may not happen soon.As for the euro, which traded above $1.40 for the first time this month, Mr. Yardeni said he could imagine it going as high as $1.45 but not $1.50. And he predicted that the British pound, now trading at more than twice the value of the dollar, could fall to around $1.85 over the next six months.“We might see a little divergence, where the dollar weakens against the euro and strengthens relative to the pound,” Mr. Yardeni said, because Britain’s economy has a lot of the same risk factors that the American economy does now — including a shaky mortgage market.The currencies with the best outlook are the Australian and Canadian dollars, he said, “because they have what the world wants now, which is raw materials.”Earlier this month, the Canadian dollar reached parity with the American dollar for the first time in more than 30 years. But Mr. Yardeni said he thought both the Canadian and Australian dollars might rise an additional 5 percent or so against the American dollar.Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, said it was too late to buy the British pound or the euro, calling both currencies “grossly overvalued.” He said the Japanese yen was still attractive but not as much as it was in February, when Rydex introduced the CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust.“When that E.T.F. was created, the yen was the cheapest currency around,” Mr. Metz said. “But if you want an alternative to the dollar now, I think it’s the Swiss franc.” He said that the Swiss currency had not appreciated in tandem with the euro, largely because Switzerland has lower interest rates.Many investors do not want to pick and choose among foreign currencies, said Bruce Bond, the president and chief executive of PowerShares Capital Management in Wheaton, Ill. PowerShares offers two E.T.F.’s that use futures contracts to make bets on the dollar versus a basket of six currencies: the yen, euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc. If the dollar rises against these currencies, investors in one of the E.T.F.’s, the PowerShares DB U.S. Dollar Bullish fund, would make money. If the dollar falls, the PowerShares DB U.S. Dollar Bearish fund would come out ahead. Neither fund uses leverage.The company has also created an E.T.F., PowerShares DB G10 Currency Harvest, intended to allow investors to bet against currencies in countries with low interest rates and to take long positions in those with higher rates. Currently, the fund has long positions in the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar and the British pound, and short positions in the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and the Swedish krona.THERE are special tax consequences associated with the three PowerShares funds. Investors who own E.T.F.’s that use derivatives, like futures contracts, have to declare capital gains each year — even if they still own the funds — and 40 percent of the gains will be taxed at the higher rate for short-term capital gains. So experts recommend holding such E.T.F.’s in a tax-advantaged account like an Individual Retirement Account.Alternatively, Mr. Metz said that it might be simpler for investors who are worried about a further decline in the dollar to put a small portion of their portfolios into gold. He recommended one of the E.T.F.’s that invest in actual bars of gold, like the StreetTracks Gold Shares fund or iShares Comex Gold Trust.“I think there will be a big move by central banks to build up their gold reserves, which they have really sold off in recent years,” Mr. Metz said.'"
"'07-09-30,'0','Consider the question of Google’s greatest business secret. Is it the algorithms behind its search tools? Or is it the way it organizes vast clusters of computers around the globe to answer queries so quickly? Perhaps predictably, Google won’t disclose the number of computers deployed in its vast information network (though outsiders speculate that the network has at least 450,000 computers).I believe that the physical network is Google’s “secret sauce,” its premier competitive advantage. While a brilliant lone wolf can conceive of a dazzling algorithm, only a superwealthy and well-managed organization can run what is arguably the most valuable computer network on the planet. Without the computer network, Google is nothing.Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, appears to agree. Last year he declared, “We believe we get tremendous competitive advantage by essentially building our own infrastructures.”Process innovations like Google’s computer network are often invisible to the public, and impossible to duplicate by rivals. Yet successful companies realize that maintaining competitive advantage depends heavily on sustaining process innovations. Great process innovators often support basic research in relevant fields, maintain complete control over the creation of every aspect of a product and refuse to rely on outside suppliers for important components. Certainly, there are exceptions to these patterns, but even companies like Apple that buy essential processes on the open market nevertheless invest in gaining a working knowledge of the technologies and an understanding of their future arc.Intel treats its process innovations as a competitive weapon, striving to create a “new generation” every two years. That enables the company’s chips, even if there were no changes in their design, to perform better and cost less to make.Consumers are usually blind to the importance of novel processes. Even when they learn about these innovations, they tend to think only of the product itself.“The average consumer doesn’t care what processes are used,” says Mark T. Bohr, an Intel physicist who oversaw what is arguably the most important advance in decades in the technology for making microprocessors, the brains inside computers and other digital devices.Faced with ever-faster chips that threatened to explode into flames, Intel searched desperately for new processes to make microprocessors. Enter hafnium, a rare metal. Designers led by Mr. Bohr in Hillsboro, Ore., chose hafnium to replace silicon oxide, the venerable insulator in chips and a material used in making glass. Mr. Bohr also helped to identify new materials, whose identity Intel is keeping secret, for the crucial transistor “gates” that sit atop a chip’s insulators.On Nov. 12, Intel will begin shipping its first chips using the new processes. Gordon E. Moore, Intel’s co-founder, recently declared that the hafnium-and-gate process innovations should allow his so-called Moore’s Law, whereby chips grow ever faster and less expensive, to hold true for some time.Despite the enormity of the achievement, Mr. Bohr is relatively anonymous, even within Intel. “The work of process development comes second to creating new designs for chips,” he says. Not surprisingly, when Intel starts shipping the new chips, neither the hafnium nor the gates innovations will be trumpeted as selling points. Rather, Intel will emphasize how customers can benefit from using the chips.If process innovations are unheralded, consumers may misunderstand the nature of technological change.“Process innovation tends to receive less attention from the informed public for the same reason that incremental innovation tends to receive too little attention: it is more difficult to encapsulate in a press release or photo opportunity,” says David C. Mowery, a business professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a scholar of technological change.“Process innovation, even more than most product innovations, also tends to realize its economic potential through a lengthy process of incremental improvement based on learning by doing and other types of learning,” he added. “So ‘breakthroughs’ in process engineering are, if anything, even rarer than in product innovation.”As a result, process gurus are resigned to playing in the shadows, leaving fame, if not fortune, to others. John Feland, human interface architect at Synaptics Inc. in Santa Clara, Calif., knows this enduring truth of invention. He helps design arrays of sensors that drive the touch screens in the newest cellphones like the Prada from LG. Such touch screens are earning raves from consumers, yet Mr. Feland is essentially an invisible man.“My job is to make our customers look like heroes,” he says philosophically. Then he sums up the special role played by fellow members of the process tribe: “We are like Q to James Bond.”'"
"'07-09-30,'0','DaShiv posts mostly to MetaFilter, a Web site that allows anyone to submit items of interest or questions inviting comment by other people. Another user there, Chad Okere, a 27-year-old computer programmer in Ames, Iowa, who uses the screen name Delmoi, has posted more than 13,000 comments. On the conservative politics blog Little Green Footballs, nearly 4.3 million comments have been left by tens of thousands of users since its creation in 2001.“People are doing it for the same reason another generation of people called in on talk radio,” said Shel Israel, a social media consultant and a columnist for Blogger & Podcaster magazine. “They are passionate, they live in a world where nobody listens to them, and they suddenly have a way to speak.”Since many blogs have a readership of one — or, at best, the writer, his mother and some guy he sat next to in seventh grade who found him on Google — piggybacking on a more popular site offers a wider audience for a keyboard jockey’s gripes and quips. Not everyone is up to the task of creating a blog with the kind of consistent tone and provocative topics that attract visitors.“There are people who react rather than act,” Mr. Israel said. “As much as we talk about joining the conversation on the Internet, the most popular bloggers start a conversation.”Seth Chadwick has posted his reviews of 207 restaurants in Phoenix on Chowhound, the online bulletin board where all things food are discussed with fathomless detail. Far more readers see his reviews on Chowhound than on Mr. Chadwick’s own Web site, Feasting in Phoenix. In two years, the Google ads on his site have yielded him a grand total of $110, he said.That’s more than the zilch his Chowhound posts have earned him, but Mr. Chadwick, a project coordinator at a retirement investment fund, spends about six hours a week writing about food because he has adopted the mission of using Chowhound’s bulletin boards to lift his desert city’s culinary reputation.“There are some small, wonderful places here that people don’t know about because they are hidden behind huge neon signs for Applebee’s, Cheesecake Factory and the like,” he said by telephone.Like the narrator of the Elton John song “Rocket Man,” frequent commenters can spend a little time every day inhabiting the identity of their wished-for selves — Mr. Hsiao becomes DaShiv, or Georgia Logothetis, a second-year lawyer in Chicago, metamorphoses into the respected liberal commenter georgia10 on Daily Kos. Online they indulge the sweet fantasy that “I’m not the man they think I am at home.”“You are one of the millions of people who sit at a computer all day,” said Marshall Poe, a professor of history and new media at the University of Iowa, who has studied Internet communities. “Every hour you have 10 minutes where you’re not doing anything productive at work, and you can’t look at porn. So you make a comment and fulfill this desire to show yourself off as a smarty-pants.”What point there might be to someone putting all his creative sweat into a 1,700-word exegesis on the cultural status of Bonobo apes, which a few hundred strangers might read, can be partially explained by a writer’s desire to be recognized within an online community, Mr. Poe said. On MetaFilter, readers can mark other users’ comments as a favorite, and commenters derive pride from how many times they have been “favorited,” he said.On Gawker, the media gossip Web site, editors select the best comments of the week and conduct commenter executions, in which users judged to be unclever are stripped of their commenting privileges.Sometimes, would-be Rocket Men pop up in strange places. The real-life identity of one of Gawker’s most frequent contributors, and a best of the week honoree, LolCait, was a mystery to the editorial staff until a few weeks ago. That’s when Richard Lawson, a 24-year-old sales coordinator in the Gawker Media ad department, who was worried his insider status could be discovered and ethically embarrass the company, confessed that he was LolCait.His success shows how good commenting has become social currency online. Mr. Lawson, who studied playwriting in college, said he started leaving comments after he was hired five months ago, just to see if he could survive the audition as a Gawker-approved commenter. He made it, and was later singled out for a comment that was in the form of a fake entry from the socialite Tinsley Mortimer’s diary.“That was when some of the other commenters started saying, ‘Hey, I like your stuff,’” Mr. Lawson said in a telephone interview.His basic style is “easy jokes, puns, random celebrity jabs,” he explained. In response to a news item about the rapper Foxy Brown slapping a neighbor with her Blackberry, LolCait commented, “This is like the time Spinderella stabbed me with her Treo.”Since he confessed, Mr. Lawson’s job responsibilities have grown, although he has not received a raise. He was put in charge of choosing the best comments of the week.Not every commenter is a frustrated office worker yearning for pinprick shafts of fame. Some already have the real thing. The restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow commented on an item that Eater, the restaurant business blog, wrote about an advertisement Mr. Chodorow had placed in The New York Times criticizing a restaurant review by Frank Bruni. (Is this meta enough for you?)After explaining why he’d focused on the topic of salmon in the ad, Mr. Chodorow referred to the title of the Eater item, “Chodorow Edging Closer to Insanity, Places ‘Dear Frank’ Ad,” and wrote, “If you worked in this business, you’d be crazy too.”David Sifry, the founder of Technorati, the site that tracks 107.4 million blogs, said that when he learned of a blog post in which he or Technorati was mentioned, he went to that site to leave a comment, a practice that let people know they were being heard. “If you can do this,” he said. “People who are often your harshest critics become your evangelists.”Commenting has become such a widely played sport that new tools are being deployed to separate the “trolls” — unwelcome commenters — from the favorites. Eater plans to offer readers the option of custom-filtering comments to exclude certain writers. Little Green Footballs started a rating system that lets users vote a comment up or down on a page, “to help the better ones be noticed,” the site creator, Charles Johnson, wrote in an e-mail message.DaShiv’s posts on MetaFilter, which has about 30,000 active users, have been “favorited” 297 times. In addition to dispensing dating advice online (“Mathematically speaking, being good friends after a breakup makes it 258.1 percent harder to move on than a no-contact breakup”), DaShiv began snapping photos at San Francisco Bay Area real-world get-togethers, or meetups as they are called, of MetaFilter users. He posted them on Flickr, the photo-sharing site, which shares content with MetaFilter.“He’s a MetaFilter star,” said ThePinkSuperhero, the screen name of a woman who helped organize a meetup in Astoria, Queens, on Wednesday in DaShiv’s honor. “He came to be known as a great portrait photographer. Wherever he goes, people flock to him to have their picture taken.” (The woman, a 24-year-old director of operations at a financial operations firm, asked that her real name not be printed because “I don’t want my MetaFilter comment history tied to my Google index forever and evermore.”)Soon, those organizing meetups in other cities started asking DaShiv if he would show up to take photos. This summer, Matthew Haughey, the founder of MetaFilter, flew DaShiv to Portland, Ore., for the site’s eighth-anniversary party.When Mr. Hsiao announced he was coming to New York for 10 days, at least five people he’d never met in person offered couch space, and three meetups were organized.He said he chose the mean-sounding online moniker DaShiv when he was younger and posting to dial-up computer bulletin boards in Los Angeles. “I chose it mostly because I was a sarcastic little brat growing up,” he said.Despite his growing fame, he doesn’t see himself creating his own blog soon. “It’s easier to join in on a conversation than to start one,” he said matter of factly.Some have parlayed commenting into a profession, even if only part time. Matt Diggs was a college student so obsessed with high school football in the Dallas/Fort Worth area that he began filing reports for the message boards at the Web site that is now called Texas Prep Insider in exchange for free entry to high school games.He has since graduated and is now paid $20,000 annually to make 30 to 50 entries a week on the site, a nice addition to what he earns teaching psychology at a community college. Recognized as the area’s foremost expert on his subject, Mr. Diggs, 29, also leaves comments, gratis, on The Dallas Morning News high school sports blogs.His obsession with high school football started when he was a freshman at Plano East Senior High School. “I played tight end,” he said. “But I never made it to varsity.”'"

"'07-09-30,'0','One of the mysteries of the Corzine administration is how little progress has been made in building affordable housing.Time after time, Gov. Jon Corzine has stated his enthusiastic support for the concept of providing housing that families of modest incomes can afford, and that New Jersey clearly needs. But the actions of his own administration have done much to keep that from happening.Foremost was Mr. Corzine’s failure to immediately replace Susan Bass Levin as head of the Department of Community Affairs, which has the major say about affordable housing. As mayor of the South Jersey suburb of Cherry Hill, Ms. Levin fought affordable housing requirements, and advocates believe she never really changed her views after taking the state job.And then the state continued its virtual exemption of affordable housing requirements for both the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission, which governs that huge tract of land, and the Xanadu entertainment and shopping complex, which is being built in the Meadowlands. Last spring, a court struck down a major part of that exemption, and the Meadowlands Commission has moved to require affordable housing in many of the area’s development projects.Now, there is some prospect of greater progress. Mr. Corzine announced this month that State Senator Joseph Doria Jr., a Democrat from Hudson County, was his choice to replace Ms. Levin, who has been moved to a top job with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. While not exactly a past champion of affordable housing requirements, Mr. Doria has not opposed them either. In private meetings just before Mr. Corzine’s announcement, he assured housing advocates that he realized the need for more modest-priced housing in the state.Besides his long career in the Legislature — he was once the speaker of the Assembly — Mr. Doria is the mayor of Bayonne, where he no doubt saw firsthand the shortage of housing in New Jersey. On the downside, he is the ultimate pol, comfortable with many of the cozy dealings in Trenton and Hudson County. (He will have to resign as senator and mayor before starting as community affairs commissioner.)But he also has great potential to improve the relationship between the Legislature, where he has friends in both parties, and the governor, many of whose top appointees come from business and lack much feel for New Jersey politics.'"
"'07-09-30,'0','CITING myriad financial oversights, errors and discrepancies, the New Jersey Department of Education said last week that it would appoint a monitor to oversee finances in the Asbury Park school district, as it has in five other troubled districts.Jon Zlock, a department spokesman, said it would appoint the monitor under the New Jersey Quality Single Accountability Continuum, a program that began in May 2006. It allows the state to oversee a school district’s finances without actually taking over its operations, as the state had in the past with Jersey City, Newark and Paterson.“We’re in sort of a transition period on this,” Mr. Zlock said. The program “allows us to give some control back to the local folks in a way a takeover can’t.”Among the problems the Education Department found in the Asbury Park district were $898,447 in overspending in budget items for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006; misclassification of purchase orders; contract and bidding irregularities; and other accounting problems.“This is to be a good thing to help the board help the superintendent,” said Robert DiSanto, the Asbury Park school board president, who said he was nonetheless disappointed that the department appointed the monitor without first discussing it with the board. “Whatever it takes, whatever we need. It is important for a district that has been in decline for more than 30 years.”'"
"'07-09-30,'0','Q If a tenant inherited succession rights to a rent-stabilized apartment from a family member and the building has been converted to a condominium, can the tenant force the condo association to give him a rent-stabilized lease in his own name?A Blaine Z. Schwadel, a Manhattan lawyer, said the letter writer’s question basically provides the answer. “If you’re already a rent-stabilized tenant as a result of succession, then you’re entitled to a renewal lease in your name, even if the building has been converted to a condominium,” he said.But it’s possible the condo association does not agree the writer is entitled to succession rights.Mr. Schwadel outlined the requirements: First, he said, the person claiming succession must be a member of the tenant’s family. That is defined as a husband, wife, son, daughter, stepson or stepdaughter, parent, stepparent, sibling, grandfather or grandmother, grandson or granddaughter, or son-in-law or daughter-in-law. “Uncles, aunts, nieces and nephews just won’t qualify,” he said.Also included as “family member” is a person who can prove an “emotional and financial commitment and interdependence” with the tenant — in other words, a significant other.'"
"'07-09-30,'0','There was a time when students were considered capable people. They were allowed to make their own decisions and learn from their own actions. When did personal accountability shift from the individual to the institutions that surround them? Protectionism is no longer just a term of economics; rather its principles have seeped into the process of educating America’s youth.There comes a point when people must learn for themselves. Scaring students away from drinking for four years in college teaches them nothing about behaving responsibly when they reach legal age. College is more than just textbooks and exams. It is a time for the next generation to learn how to become responsible adults.Re “Court May Have Last Say in Mall Fight” (Sept. 23):Oyster Bay’s supervisor, John Venditto, and the Town of Oyster Bay have turned the role of government on its head.

Spinner of State Supreme Court in Riverhead must exert New York State’s proper role as both the protector of property rights and overseer of town authority and instruct the Town of Oyster Bay to issue a permit for an 860,000-square-foot mall, thereby sending a clear message to all towns and villages that property rights will be respected in New York State.State government must keep local government power in check, so as to protect individual property rights, preserve a market economy and not place local self-interests above the common good.'"
"'07-09-30,'0','Peter Taylor’s office on the 25th floor of the MGM Building in Century City looks out over the Fox movie lot and a golf course; in the distance downtown Los Angeles rises. Taylor has lived in an artsy neighborhood of Los Angeles called Silver Lake since he was a child. In the aftermath of the Watts riots, his father, then a school administrator and one of the few black men to hold such a job, became the principal of Locke High School in South-Central Los Angeles. Taylor himself went on from U.C.L.A. to earn a master’s degree in public policy and work for Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign before joining Lehman Brothers. When we were talking in his office, he apologetically interrupted our conversation and spent 10 minutes on the phone trying to persuade the person on the other end not to make any changes in a coming bond offering. There was, he kept saying, no point in doing something that might upset the market. But Taylor’s cautious, corporate style can be deceiving. He doesn’t mind a good fight. “Prop. 209 has made things more challenging,” he said. “It has created a new paradigm. But there are still things that can be done.” I asked him whether those things might include civil disobedience, and Taylor surprised me by replying: “Exactly when you cross over into civil disobedience is not always clear. And I probably come down on the side of pushing the outer limits. I’m much more of the attitude of, ‘So what if someone sues?’ If you lose, you at least define the line a little more clearly. You say, ‘Mea culpa,’ and you don’t do it anymore.”The heart of California’s higher-education problem, according to Taylor, is that Proposition 209 created a patently impossible situation. The law says that universities can’t consider race, even though race has an enormous effect on the lives of applicants. California’s best high schools offer so many A.P. and honors classes — which confer bonus points on a student’s G.P.A. — that the average G.P.A. of white and Asian freshmen at U.C.L.A. is now 4.2. At many of the largely black high schools around Los Angeles, it is sometimes impossible to do much better than a 4.0, because of the relative lack of A.P. classes. Black students at better high schools have a much easier time, but it’s not as if they are keeping up with their peers. Even if U.C.L.A. tried to get around Proposition 209 by giving a big leg up to low-income applicants, it wouldn’t increase its black population very much. At every rung of the socioeconomic ladder, the academic record of black students is worse than that of other groups. As Taylor says: “There is a great deal of pressure to look for a proxy for race. There is no proxy for race.”He and many other defenders of affirmative action consider this to be a self-evident fact, but there has also been a good deal of social science to support the view that the specific problems surrounding race — including discrimination — endure. One illustrative study found that résumés with typically black names are less likely to lead to job interviews than those with typically white names. Other recent studies have looked at intelligence testing. There have long been two uncomfortable facts in this area: Intelligence, indisputably, is in part genetic; and every intelligence test shows a gap between black Americans and others. For a long time, scientific research wasn’t very good at explaining this gap. But it has gotten better lately. For one thing, the gap between white and black adults has narrowed significantly since 1970, according to work by the noted researchers William Dickens and James Flynn. Four decades is too short a time period for the gene pool to change, but it’s not too short for environment to improve. Most intriguing, Roland Fryer and Steven D. Levitt, two economists (the latter is one of this magazine’s Freakonomics columnists), have found there to be essentially no gap between 1-year-old white and black children of the same socioeconomic status.There are still vigorous debates about all this work — intelligence tests of 1-year-olds are iffy, for instance — but it points in one direction. Innate intelligence may be partly genetic, but it doesn’t seem to vary by race. So while race may not be the only source of disadvantage in today’s society, it is certainly one of them.Since affirmative action began in the mid-1960s, it has had both an explicit role and an implicit one in American life. Explicitly, it has been about race and, to a lesser degree, sex — a policy to make up for centuries of oppression and to ensure diversity. But there has always been a broader notion to affirmative action as well. It has been the most serious effort of any kind to ensure equality of opportunity, without regard to wealth or poverty. When all else failed — the War on Poverty, welfare, public schools — affirmative action would be there to help less-fortunate Americans overcome the circumstances of their origins. “Ability is not just the product of birth,” Lyndon Johnson said when he effectively created affirmative action during a graduation speech at Howard University in 1965. “Ability is stretched or stunted by the family that you live with and the neighborhood you live in — by the school you go to and the poverty or the richness of your surroundings. It is the product of a hundred unseen forces playing upon the little infant, the child and, finally, the man.”The more expansive idea of affirmative action as a counterweight to those “unseen forces” has become tightly linked to the self-image of American universities. Above all else, they are supposed to be meritocracies. To be truly meritocratic, a college must be diverse — or else accept that some groups in society have less merit than others and their underrepresentation can’t be helped. University administrators clearly reject this second view, and as a result the best colleges are now filled with students of both sexes and every imaginable race and religion. If you were to ask admissions officers whether they also gave special consideration to low-income applicants — whether they gave them credit for overcoming Johnson’s unseen forces — the officers would say that, absolutely, they did.In truth, however, they did not. Three years ago, William Bowen (the former president of Princeton) and two other researchers discovered what was really going on. They persuaded 19 elite colleges — including Harvard, Middlebury and Virginia — to let them analyze their admissions records. The easiest way to understand the results is to imagine a group of students who each have the same SAT scores. Holding that equal, a recruited athlete was 30 percentage points more likely to be admitted than a nonathlete. A black, Latino or Native American student was 28 percentage points more likely to be admitted than a white or Asian student. A legacy received a 20-percentage-point boost over someone whose parents hadn’t attended that college. And low-income students? They received no advantage whatsoever. A poor white kid from upstate New York would be treated no differently from a white kid in Chappaqua. Frances Harris would get no more of a leg up than the black daughter of corporate lawyers.Bowen says he doesn’t believe that admissions deans were lying when they said that their affirmative-action programs took social class into account. The colleges apparently put even more stock in the polish that comes with affluence — the well-edited essay, the summer trip to Guatemala, the Arabic language lessons. In any case, the poor lose.There are some big problems with this approach to affirmative action. For one thing, it rests on a very rickety base of political support. Colleges often resort to huge preferences to create a racially diverse student body, especially if they haven’t been giving any advantage to low-income applicants, who are of course disproportionately minorities. And many of the beneficiaries of the preferences end up being upper-middle-class minority students, since they tend to have better test scores than poor minorities. The helping hand that goes to these relatively well-off nonwhite students strikes many people as unjust. It makes it seem as if affirmative action isn’t making good on its larger promise. Affirmative action becomes about mere diversity — and not even all forms of diversity — rather than fairness. Politically, that has made it weaker and weaker.In the mid-1990s, a businessman in California named Ward Connerly began making some of these very criticisms. Connerly was born in Louisiana in 1939; his father left the family, and his mother died when he was a little boy. So he was sent West to Sacramento to be raised by his grandmother. He eventually began working for the state government, where he became friends with Pete Wilson, a young Republican legislator. After Wilson was elected governor in 1990, he named Connerly to the University of California’s board of regents, and Connerly began pressuring the university to cut back on race-based preferences. His efforts culminated in Proposition 209.Connerly, not least because he is black, was the politically perfect face of the anti-affirmative-action movement. He argued then, as he still does, that the patchwork of diverse campuses and workplaces created by affirmative action has deluded the country into thinking that it is solving its racial problems. In truth, he says, the policy has actually made it harder for blacks to close the achievement gap with whites. “It’s not genetic, I’m convinced,” he told me this summer. “So what is it? I think it’s largely self-imposed by black people who don’t put as much emphasis on academic achievement as they once did and as other groups do now.” Connerly will tell you that he ended up going to college (at Sacramento State) because his grandmother pushed him to read books all the time.Many people reject his argument as simplistic, if not worse. But whatever you think of his solution, it’s hard not to find some truth in his critique of traditional affirmative action. Certainly, voters seem to feel this way. Last year, Michigan passed an initiative identical to Proposition 209, and, thanks to Connerly, several other states are likely to vote on such proposals next year. Soon, more universities may find themselves in the same situation as the University of California.There is almost an iron law of higher education: the more selective a school is, the fewer low-income students it has. At Harvard and Yale, only about 10 percent of undergraduates receive federal Pell Grants. (Typically, students from the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution are eligible for the Pell.) Even at top public universities, the share is often 15 percent or less. The colleges that are filled with poor and middle-class students almost invariably have low graduation rates. So their graduates are more likely to end up on the wrong side of the 21st century’s educational divide. A bachelor’s degree seems out of reach to a large portion of the American population, and, as a result, other countries have closed the gap in educational attainment with the United States over the last generation.There are really only two exceptions to the rule, two universities that are both elite and economically diverse: U.C.L.A. and Berkeley. A chart on U.S. News & World Report’s Web site does a nice job of summarizing just how unusual they are. It lists the percentage of Pell Grant recipients at each university in the magazine’s famous Top 25 ranking. U.C.L.A. tops the list, at 37 percent, and Berkeley comes next, at 31 percent. In third place is Columbia, with just 15 percent.To be fair, the main explanation for this gap is demographic happenstance. California is filled with low-income immigrant families, especially from Asia and Latin America, with high-achieving children. But a set of deliberate policies also plays an important role. The University of California accepts far more transfer students, mainly from community colleges, than most colleges. At U.C.L.A., about one-third of the admitted students arrive as transfers instead of as freshmen. When I was on campus, I met a 27-year-old Mexican immigrant named Daniel Flores, who was admitted three years ago as a junior even though, as Flores told me, “I barely graduated high school.” His first job after high school was in one of U.C.L.A.’s dining halls, where he realized that he would need more education if he ever wanted to make much more than minimum wage. He then enrolled in a community college in West Los Angeles and excelled there. When he was 18 years old — the only point in life when elite colleges usually consider candidates — no sane admissions officer would have let him in. By the time he was 23, it was clear he had mainly just lacked for good opportunities. Earlier this year, he graduated from U.C.L.A.; and there are hundreds of other students with life stories not so different from Flores’s who are walking through the Italianate buildings on the university’s lush campus.If anything, Proposition 209 may have helped keep the U.C. campuses as economically diverse as they are. Desperate to maintain some racial diversity, university officials set up outreach programs in lower-income school districts, as James Traub described in this magazine several years ago. One of them, run by U.C. Davis, which is outside of Sacramento, visited Frances Harris’s elementary school. It was around this time that Harris first told her parents that she planned to go to college. Over the years, when things got tough, they both made a point of reminding her of her vow. “At times I got discouraged, and they said, ‘You’ve said you’re going to go to college, and you’re going to go,’ ” she recalled. A framed “reservation for college” certificate from the Davis program still hangs in her bedroom.After the initiative passed, the U.C. campuses also put more weight on students’ socioeconomic backgrounds when they made admissions decisions. Richard Sander, a U.C.L.A. law professor who has become a critic of affirmative action, studied admissions data at Berkeley and found that, all else being equal, lower-income students had a better chance of getting in after 1997 than before. Together, these various class-based efforts have helped the share of Pell Grant students at both U.C.L.A. and Berkeley to hold steady over the last decade, even as it has declined at many similar colleges.You can make an argument, in fact, that the single most impressive university in the country today is U.C.L.A. It receives more freshman applications than any other — 50,744 this year — and, unlike many of its peers, it can legitimately claim to be an engine of opportunity. About 90 percent of its students, whether they enter as freshmen or transfers, eventually graduate. What City College of New York was to the 20th century, U.C.L.A. is to the 21st.And now, maybe, it is figuring out ways to solve its race problem.One night in march of this year, Peter Taylor and three other U.C.L.A. alumni met in his office to go over a big stack of U.C.L.A. applications from students who had already been admitted. Over sandwiches, the four of them — none of whom was a university employee — helped determine how much financial aid each student would get. This was one of the “bureaucratic cover-me exercises,” as Taylor puts it, at the heart of the new diversity push at U.C.L.A.In the previous few months, Taylor and his group had raised $1.7 million for scholarships, the plan being to offer virtually all of it, immediately, to admitted black students. The easiest thing to do would have been to hand over the money to the U.C.L.A. Foundation, which holds and invests the university’s endowment, and then allow financial-aid officers to give it away as they saw fit. But U.C.L.A.’s general counsel said that allowing the foundation to handle funds specifically set aside for black students might violate the law. And letting the financial-aid office disburse the money almost certainly would have done so, since Proposition 209 prohibited colleges from recruiting students and offering scholarships based on race. But it didn’t prevent student and alumni groups from doing so. In effect, Taylor and his task force began outsourcing work that normally would have been done by the university.Students and alumni stepped up their recruiting efforts. They visited high schools and set up a phone bank, with the help of a sympathetic alumnus who owned a call center, to reach out to black high-school seniors. Southwest Airlines donated plane tickets, helping black students who had been admitted to visit the campus. (A survey in 2005 had shown that admitted students were far more likely to choose U.C.L.A. if they had visited it. If you’ve been to the campus, this won’t surprise you.) One program that greeted prospective black students, called Black by Popular Demand, was run by the African Student Union and the Black Alumni Association. Another program — Scholars Days — was aimed broadly at less-than-privileged students, and it was run by the university. The two were scheduled to overlap.This outsourcing was the second part of the task force’s two-pronged strategy. The group also urged U.C.L.A.’s faculty senate last year to alter the admissions process. In the past, the admissions office divided every application between two readers: one evaluated a student’s academic record, the other looked at extracurricular activities and “life challenges.” Berkeley, by contrast, had taken a more holistic approach, with a single reader judging an entire application, and Berkeley was attracting more black students than U.C.L.A. Why? Maybe the holistic approach takes better account of the subtle obstacles that black students face — or maybe the readers, when looking at a full application, ended up practicing a little under-the-table affirmative action.Last fall, U.C.L.A. made the switch. Two applications readers I interviewed said that they had received clear, written instructions not to consider race and that they hadn’t. (There are 150 readers in all, a mix of university employees and paid outsiders.) On the other hand, applicants seemed to understand that something had changed. Daniel Fogg, a computer programmer in the admissions office and an application reader, told me that he noticed more students mentioning race in their essays this year.Whatever the reasons, every phase of Taylor’s campaign turned out to be a success. More than 2,400 black students applied last spring, up 13 percent from the previous year. Their admission rate rose to 16.2 percent, from 11.5 percent. Of those who were admitted, slightly more than half said yes, up from 41 percent in 2006. In all, about 200 African-American freshmen started classes last week, double the number the year before.One of them was Frances Harris. Back at her high school in Sacramento this spring, a group of seniors decided to celebrate their school’s turnaround by photocopying their college acceptance letters and taping them to the walls. An entire hallway was filled with hundreds of letters. Until I stood in the hallway with Harris, I wasn’t sure it was possible to find any part of today’s college-application process inspiring. Eleven of the letters were hers, including ones from Pitzer College, Boston University, U.C.L.A. and U.C. Davis. (Berkeley rejected her.) She liked B.U., but it seemed too far away, especially from her mother’s perspective. So Harris’s decision came down to Pitzer, which offered her nearly a full scholarship, and U.C.L.A. In the end, a $1,000 scholarship from Taylor’s group, a campus visit (flight courtesy of Southwest) and a phone call from U.C.L.A.’s director of financial aid — a combination of official recruiting and outsourced recruiting — pulled her toward U.C.L.A. “The biggest thing was seeing so many beautiful, intellectual black young students, being cool and having discussions about calculus,” she said. “It was so pure. I was so impressed. It was amazing.”Harris’s parents and her biological father all attended her high-school graduation. In late July, her parents drove her to Los Angeles so she could attend a six-week voluntary summer school that is officially open to incoming freshmen of all races but is dominated by black and Latino students. I saw Harris on campus in August, and she told me that she missed her friends from home but was happy to be a college student. On her first paper, in English composition, she got a B-plus, and on her second she got an A-minus. She’s thinking about becoming a pre-med student. Next summer, she plans to go to Washington to work as an intern with the new chancellor of the school system there, Michelle Rhee, whom Harris met through her high school.A few weeks after getting to U.C.L.A., Harris wrote an e-mail message to P. K. Diffenbaugh, one of her old teachers, telling him to send some of his current students to visit her soon, so they could get excited about college. “In my comparative English class we read a book a week. It goes superfast so encourage your students not to fall off,” she wrote. “It’s like the major leagues. . . . Academia!!!!”The big question that hangs over U.C.L.A.’s success, of course, is whether the university broke the law. Looking at the numbers, it’s hard not to conclude that race was a factor in this year’s admissions decisions. The average SAT score for admitted African-American students fell 45 points this year, to 1,738. For Asian, Latino and white students, the averages were much more stable. “I’m quite confident that U.C. factors race in, in various ways,” said Sander, the U.C.L.A. law professor and affirmative-action critic. “There is no way to explain the disparities otherwise.” He has filed a public-information request that would allow him to examine the data more closely.In particular, U.C.L.A.’s experience suggests that some tension between race and class in the admissions process may be inevitable. Even as the number of low-income black freshmen soared this year, the overall number of low-income freshmen fell somewhat. The rise in low-income black students was accompanied by a fall in low-income Asian students — not a decline in well-off students. U.C.L.A. administrators say they don’t fully understand why.In a way, though, the question of whether race was a factor is itself misplaced. Proposition 209 forbids universities to consider race, but it doesn’t stop them from considering disadvantage. So what if U.C.L.A. is somehow taking into account the disadvantages that black students face because of their race? Isn’t that legal? And isn’t it just? As Tom Lifka, a U.C.L.A. assistant vice chancellor who oversees admissions, said, “It’s the fallacy of 209 that you can immediately move to a system that doesn’t take account of race and that treats everybody fairly.” Lifka said he was confident that U.C.L.A.’s current system could withstand legal scrutiny.I asked these same questions about race and fairness of Connerly, who does favor preferences based on socioeconomic status (as do almost 85 percent of Americans, according to a 2005 New York Times poll). His first objection was constitutional: he believes the Supreme Court has given colleges very narrow instructions on when and how to consider race. Beyond that, he finds it hard to imagine that colleges would be able to strike the appropriate balance. “I suppose you could craft some kind of system that says, ‘We’re going to acknowledge that there has been and continues to be discrimination in our society,’ ” he said. “But I believe it is almost impossible to decide on the acceptable range — say, from 1 to 10 — to take race into account.”He may well be right. But it sure seems worth the effort. Somewhat accidentally, U.C.L.A. appears to have gotten much closer to the ideal answer than most American universities. Unlike those of other elite colleges, its student body isn’t dominated merely by the best and brightest of the upper middle class. U.C.L.A. has also figured out how to do a bit better by the standard diversity benchmarks than it had been doing. Despite all the political heat that still surrounds the issue in California, its universities seem to be pointing to a better version of affirmative action — one that uses a little less race and a lot more class. “What would be nice is if we could craft a social compromise that could keep the best of the program while admitting some of its flaws,” says Sander, who supports the idea of affirmative action, despite his criticisms of the current system. “It’s way beyond, ‘Mend it, don’t end it.’ Let’s fundamentally restructure this and be much more aware of class. If we did that, we’d build a much bigger consensus and take a lot of wind out of the sails of Ward Connerly.” Such a consensus might show us, finally, how to put the accomplishments of a student like Frances Harris into the right perspective.'"
"'07-09-30,'0','“Oswald’s Ghost,” a film by the award-winning documentary filmmaker Robert Stone, is one of several having its United States premiere at Rhinebeck’s Upstate Films. Showing the film as part of the Woodstock festival, but outside of town, enables visitors to “enjoy the festival in a wider area than just Woodstock and use that as an excuse to check out the area,” Mr. Stone said.He added that the Woodstock festival is “what film festivals used to be like 15 years ago” and, simultaneously, “like no other in the country.”“You have big-city artistic sophistication combined with an idyllic small-town setting and a relaxed atmosphere,” Mr. Stone said. “Woodstock is also a mecca of artistic types who recently, or long ago, fled the Big Apple.” In fact, Mr. Stone moved his family to the area three years ago.Hugo Perez, a director-producer with a documentary (“Neither Memory nor Magic”) in this year’s sneak previews at Woodstock, also appreciates the democratic approach. “What makes Woodstock special is that it puts an emphasis squarely on celebrating films and filmmakers, as opposed to the velvet-rope attitude that you find at a lot of the larger festivals,” he said. “There’s a great community and audience in Woodstock who are just as interested in progressive and social causes as in the craft of film. You really feel that they are receptive to hearing what your film has to say and finding out how to get involved.”Festivalgoers are as likely to encounter energetic post-showing conversations between filmmakers and audience at Woodstock hangouts (like Joshua’s, Oriole 9 or Landau Grill) as at official panel discussions.“It has a lot to do with the place itself,” said Melissa Leo, a former star of the TV series “Homicide: Life on the Street,” who appears in this year’s festival selection “The Cake Eaters” and who moved to the Hudson Valley some 18 years ago. “It’s small because of the location, and a venue like that is of vital necessity to the film industry.”Godfrey Cheshire, a critic and filmmaker whose “Moving Midway” will be shown during the 2007 festival, put it this way: “I’ve covered and participated in many festivals, and Woodstock is unique in its combination of cinematic sophistication, user-friendly scale and down-home hospitality. It’s inarguably the closest thing the East Coast has to the Telluride Film Festival, the ne plus ultra of North American boutique festivals. Both have super-intelligent programming and draw a ‘who’s who’ of independent filmmaking because of their reputations for collegial conviviality, yet both are small enough to allow filmgoers and filmmakers to intermingle freely throughout the weekend.”Among the highlights of the 2007 festival are “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,” which won the best director award for Julian Schnabel at Cannes, and “I’m Not There,” a biography of Bob Dylan, a onetime Woodstock denizen, directed by Todd Haynes, who wrote and directed the Oscar-nominated “Far From Heaven.” (Christine Vachon, one of the producers of “I’m Not There,” will be receiving the festival’s Honorary Maverick Award.)“The Diving Bell and the Butterfly” is based on the memoir of the French Elle editor Jean-Dominique Bauby, who suffered from post-stroke “locked-in syndrome,” a near-total paralysis that left him living a life of the mind.“I’m Not There” features six actors (including Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger and Richard Gere) portraying Mr. Dylan at different stages of his life. A number of concerts, exhibition openings and receptions, like one celebrating Elliott Landy’s famous Dylan photographs, have been coordinated with the film showings.The documentaries this year include one featuring a Westchester couple, Jaap and Ina Polak. “Steal a Pencil for Me,” directed by Michèle Ohayon, is about a young Dutch Jew (Mr. Polak) who is transported to a Nazi labor camp in 1943 with his wife and, coincidentally, the woman on whom he has a crush. The love letters between Mr. Polak and Ina Soep, who became the second Mrs. Polak, are testimonials to the power of the human spirit.“We are bringing history to the audience in a way that is accessible,” Ms. Ohayon said, “through a very intimate love story that tells what it takes to survive.” As something of a corollary, the film’s producer, Ted Sarandos, chief content officer of Netflix Inc., is to receive the festival’s Honorary Trailblazer Award for “unwavering dedication” to providing wide distribution to alternative and small film projects.The Polaks, who live in Eastchester, plan to attend the festival, where the film will receive its East Coast premiere. Mr. Polak, 94, said the film makes a powerful statement: “It shows the horror of the Holocaust, and the wonderful life that comes after it.”The documentary is very much in line with the festival’s focus, which Ms. Blaustein describes as “cultural icons, the enduring power of art and the triumph of the human spirit.”'"
"'07-09-30,'0','On the Empire State Building the architects exercised absolute discipline over every detail, to assure the quickest, most scientific construction. For instance, to avoid delays and ground-floor delivery snarls, they charted each piece of steel from design to fabrication to shipment to placement, a tight ballet of scheduling.And on 500 Fifth, they closely calculated elevator loading and peak use, to make sure they could empty and fill the building with a minimum of delay. They worked closely with Mr. Salmon and his real estate advisers to produce a most businesslike business building.The central section on the 42nd Street side leaps up the facade along seven dark strips, like racetracks, ending in Art Deco-style scalloping. But the entrance is on Fifth Avenue, under a relief statue of a goddess holding a model of 500 Fifth itself. The outer lobby has been heavily altered, but the inner lobby seems almost intact, with richly veined marble of gold and gray; the Empire State Building lobby also uses highly figured stone.In late 1930 The New York Times praised 500 Fifth as a “thoroughly frank expression of the requirements of an up-to-date office building.” This might not have pleased an artistically inclined architect, but such organization was the watchword of Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. In a 1941 interview, The Architectural Record said of Mr. Shreve that “order, forethought and system are words that might be his middle name.” But Mr. Salmon’s building received little real discussion as a work of architecture, opening as it did in the shadow of its 34th Street sibling.The opening of 500 Fifth took place in March 1931, and that of the Empire State in May, right at the beginning of hard times. In his book “The Empire State Building” (Scribner, 1995) John Tauranac said that by May, Mr. Salmon had rented only a handful of floors in 500 Fifth. In 1945 the B-25 bomber that hit the Empire State Building just missed the top of 500 Fifth.Shreve, Lamb & Harmon continued a successful practice with buildings like the boxy 1938 Hunter College, at 68th Street and Park Avenue, and the streamlined 1950 MONY Building, at Broadway and 55th Street — the one with the weather indicator on top.As with many big buildings, 500 Fifth is as interesting from the back (the north side) as from its street facades — perhaps even more so. Because the architects put the elevators and utilities on the north wall, it presents a large, unbroken surface of tawny, variegated brick, like a Kansas wheat field. Three dramatic black strips of terra cotta thus have a good backdrop against which to rise to the Art Deco top.In the early 1970s — way after the deaths of the founding partners — Shreve, Lamb & Harmon proposed recladding the Empire State Building to increase its height, an idea received with general alarm and soon dropped. Not long afterward, the firm designed the combination office and school building at 34th Street and Park Avenue, a tower set at an angle to the street.The practice changed hands several times until November 1995 — when, according to Donald Grossman, an architect there since 1971 and by then an owner — it shut down.“We were no longer being called in for our expertise,” he said. “It was just, ‘Give us your price.’ It wasn’t fun anymore.”'"
"'07-09-30,'0','The larger question on the senators’ minds was whether private colleges and universities are abusing the public trust. After all, they pay no taxes on tuition revenue or on the income from their endowments, of which Harvard boasts the largest — $35 billion, which has lately been earning around $5 billion a year. In order to keep their tax-exempt status, other nonprofit institutions (charitable foundations, for example) are required to give away a hefty percentage of their money. Hospitals are required to care for indigent patients. But what, exactly, are colleges doing to justify their public subsidies?College presidents, naturally, are armed with answers. They point out that America’s colleges and universities are the best in the world, in large part because of the uniquely American partnership between public financing and private philanthropy. Universities create jobs, develop new therapies and technologies and train America’s young people for the modern knowledge economy. All this is true. But comparable claims could be made for a pharmaceutical company. What makes the modern university different from any other corporation?There is more and more reason to think: less and less. Driven by big science and global competition, our top universities compete for “market share” and “brand-name positioning,” employ teams of consultants and lobbyists and furnish their campuses with luxuries in order to attract paying “customers” — a word increasingly used as a synonym for students. Since 1980, when Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act permitting patents on discoveries made with public funds, universities and faculty members have been raking in royalties from technologies developed with the help of government grants. More recently, universities have been expanding into adjacent neighborhoods (Harvard into Allston, Columbia into Harlem, Penn into an undeveloped tract near its current campus) and establishing satellite campuses abroad. Yale has announced the acquisition of an entirely new research campus outside New Haven —from, as it happens, a pharmaceutical company.How are college students treated in this brave new academic world? Not very well, at least not if this year’s spate of bad news articles is any indication. Last spring, New York’s attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, charged financial-aid counselors at several universities, including my own, with profiting personally from business ties with private lenders to whom they were sending students in need of loans. Since then, Cuomo has begun a new investigation into whether study-abroad programs amount to price-fixing schemes. Meanwhile, to compensate for the loss of state subsidies, public universities appear to be billing students for “energy,” “technology” and “incidental” fees, which can add up to as much as a 40 percent surcharge on tuition. And what are students getting for their money? After years of fanfare, the Harvard faculty concluded its curriculum review, prompting this low assessment from the student newspaper: “Instead of crafting a meaningful statement of what it means to be educated in today’s world, professors only seemed to care [about] their parochial corner of academia . . . leaving Harvard with an uninspired retread of its core curriculum.”To be sure, there is good news too. There is growing recognition that if our colleges are to be engines of social mobility as they claim to be, they must open their doors wider to low-income students. Several generous gifts have lately been earmarked to support financial aid. And a serious debate has begun over the idea of “affirmative action for the poor,” whereby low-income applicants who do well in high school against the odds would get a “thumb on the scale” in the admissions process.Refreshingly enough, the old assumption that college spans the four years between 18 and 22 is no longer broadly true. More than half of American undergraduates are now “nontraditional” adult students attending community colleges or night classes or earning credits, even degrees, from online institutions, some of which operate for profit. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of M.A. programs has allowed undergraduates who can afford them (these programs offer little financial aid) to tack on an extra year of course work to their campus years. At the other end of the age spectrum, the “early college” movement, led by Bard College and based on the model of the German Gymnasium, is experimenting with accelerated schools at which students advance over four years from ninth grade through the first two years of college.So today’s college students are both older and younger than their predecessors. This loosening of the confinement of “college” to the years 18 to 22 is overdue. The human life cycle, after all, has stretched at both ends in modern times — childhood ends sooner; young people reach sexual maturity (or at least sophistication) earlier; people marry and die later — so why, especially in view of the immense explosion of knowledge requisite for a true education, shouldn’t the time allotted for college stretch too?But there is a prior and deeper question: Should the mission of college go beyond imparting skills and handing out a useful credential? In his 2003 book, “Universities in the Marketplace,” Derek Bok, the former Harvard president, made the shocking observation that “faculties currently display scant interest in preparing undergraduates to be democratic citizens, a task once regarded as the principal purpose of a liberal education and one urgently needed at this moment in the United States.” Bok was right on both counts — the neglect and the urgency — but he relegated his statement to a footnote. It should have been a headline.College today is a place in which students from many backgrounds converge, and it is neither feasible nor desirable to prescribe for them some common morality. But college should be a place that fosters open debate of the ethical issues posed by modern life — by genetic screening and engineering; by the blurring of the lines dividing birth, life and death; by the global clash between liberal individualism and fundamentalism. And, to press Moore’s analogy, it should be a place in which students are treated as more than sources of revenue, just as we want doctors to treat patients without keeping one eye on the clock.Some signs suggest that higher education is waking up to its higher obligations. There is more and more interest in teaching great books that provoke students to think about justice and responsibility and how to live a meaningful life. Applications are up at Columbia and the University of Chicago, which have compulsory great-books courses; students at Yale show growing interest in the “Directed Study” program, in which they read the classics; and respected smaller institutions like Ursinus College in Pennsylvania have built their own core curriculums around major works of philosophy and literature. At many colleges, there is also growing emphasis on service-learning, in which students in an earth-science course, for instance, move out of the lab to work with an environmental advocacy group or students in an urban-sociology course work with kids in the local community who are coping with various forms of deprivation. These sorts of engagement do not have to be disconnected from rigorous academic study; they work best when tied to the traditional modes of learning through reading, lecture and discussion. Nor must they be a form of feel-good tokenism whereby the privileged make a few charitable gestures before getting on with their lives. They can be profoundly transformative experiences that bolster the motive — indeed, the need — to live a life of civic engagement.As our children go through the arduous process of choosing a college and trying to persuade that college to choose them, it will be a sign of improved social health if we can get to the point of asking not about the school’s ranking but whether it’s a place that helps students confront hard questions in an informed way. If and when the answer is yes, that’s a college worthy of support, and all the alumni gifts and tax breaks can never be enough.'"
"'07-09-30,'0','For example, children with the disease suffered pneumonia repeatedly, which led doctors to assume lung disease was part of the disorder. But by talking with parents, Dr. Axelrod came to see that the primary problem wasn’t the lungs; it was faulty swallowing that sent liquid into the lungs instead of the stomach, causing pneumonia. So today, most children with the disorder take liquids through a tube surgically implanted in the stomach. Rebecca has a stomach valve, “like a beach ball,” her mom, Lisa, said, and every waking hour she takes five ounces of fluid through it. In her first year of life, before the tube, Rebecca was hospitalized a dozen times for pneumonia; in the nine years since, once.At age 1, to learn to eat solid food, she began chewing therapy, which continues to this day. She takes blood-pressure medicines daily, along with Valium for stress, has eight sessions a week of speech, physical and occupational therapy and has been accompanied by a nurse every school day since kindergarten.The result? Rebecca is in regular classes at Ridge Street School, where she gets average grades — mainly 3’s (satisfactory), 4’s (good) and a few 5’s (excellent). She goes horseback riding weekly, skis, attends Hebrew school and has close friendships with healthy classmates like Sarah Haber and Rachel Harmon.Indeed, Rebecca has done so well, most everyone is fooled. A teacher once briefed on all Rebecca’s medicines and therapies commented that it was like being able to peek behind the curtain at a Broadway show and see all that goes into giving Rebecca her public persona.Producing Rebecca the Broadway show seven days a week takes a tremendous effort by Jeff and Lisa Newman. After Ms. Newman had her first child, Julia, now 12, she continued working four days a week for a Manhattan advertising agency, making $100,000 a year. After having Rebecca, she quit working for several years, then went back to school nights to get a master’s degree in special education and now works part time as a teacher of preschoolers with disabilities. She earns a third of her old salary, she says, but it helps pay the bills and makes her a better advocate for Rebecca.Mr. Newman, a vice president for GE Money, has turned down promotions that would have meant moving away from the network of doctors and therapists it’s taken the family a decade to build.The school system pays for Rebecca’s nurse, Joan Fleming, as mandated by federal law. Having been together every school day for six years, nurse and child move as one. While Rebecca is busy copying science notes from the board, the nurse is busy injecting five ounces of liquid into Rebecca.A medical crisis can come out of the blue, sometimes set off by stress. Last year, Rebecca got a 40 on a vocabulary quiz. “She turned red,” Ms. Fleming said. “She couldn’t speak, words wouldn’t come out, she was shaking. I took her out of the room. I said, ‘You didn’t lose your voice, calm down, let’s go for a walk.’ She came out of it and stayed in school.”Nothing is routine. At age 6, when Rebecca wanted to go to day camp like her older sister, they searched for one that was not too sports-oriented (she tires easily) and had access to an air-conditioned building (she can’t get too hot). Then they sent her with a college student whom they’d trained to give the liquids and spot a crisis.The Newmans fret over how much to protect her. She is slow to sense cold, so skiing can be dangerous, but she loves it. “When she went to school with a lift ticket on her zipper, she was so proud,” Mr. Newman said.Money for research, as with most rare diseases, is raised mainly by the affected parents. To do their part, the Newmans will run their fourth annual charity bike tour, which will be Oct. 7 at Pace University in Pleasantville. Most participants are family friends.Each September since her daughter started school, Ms. Newman visited her class to explain Rebecca’s valve and Rebecca’s disease to the other children. This year, she did not go. “Rebecca told me she didn’t need me,” Ms. Newman said. “She said: ‘I know myself very well. I can tell them.’ ”They tell enough to satisfy curious classmates, but not most of it. They don’t mention that every night, the mother or father gets out of bed to make sure the daughter is still breathing.A few days after Rebecca came bounding in from school, she woke at 4 a.m. coughing, retching, a fever spiking to 102. Ms. Newman gave her three medications, slept with her, then the next day took her to the doctor, who said it was a mild case of bronchitis and prescribed an antibiotic.Rebecca was absent Monday, and her mom stayed home to care for her. But Tuesday the daughter was back at school, the mother at work. Rebecca has learned early what Ethel Merman and Carol Channing and all the great Broadway troupers knew: The show must go on.'"
"'07-09-30,'0','My wife, Cathy, keeps a cooler at her feet with juices and snacks to make long voyages even more comfortable. In the front seat of the Rambler, at my mother’s feet, was a plastic milk container filled with water — for the radiator after it overheated, which happened on almost every trip. You see, it was never a matter of if the Rambler would break down, but when and where. The Triborough Bridge? Been there, done that. The middle of the Cross Bronx Expressway? Been there. A shoulder along the Garden State Parkway? There, too. If we could have afforded a second family car, it would have been a tow truck.Stranded time and time again in an era that now seems closer to the stagecoach than to the cellphone, my father was not without remedies to cure a few of the Rambler’s many ills. In the glove compartment he kept a generous supply of something called Marvel Mystery Oil, and in the cargo area, a set of jumper cables to give the Rambler an often-needed boost. On many a journey, a kind stranger would roll up alongside us and volunteer to be the voltage donor in a battery transfusion that sometimes ended with the unexpected death of the Good Samaritan’s engine. Oops.But my father kept turning the key and putting his right foot down on a gas pedal that had a string tied around it — don’t ask, we never did — and the Rambler kept rolling.On a recent trip from our New Jersey home to Niagara Falls in Canada, I thought about those rambling days as Michael watched a SpongeBob video on a screen built into the headrest of the seat in front of him, and Christopher rose to the challenge of his Game Boy.I remembered how my siblings and I kept busy by playing board games like Trouble or Mystery Date, or pencil and paper games like hangman and tic-tac-toe, and how members of the cargo crew — steeling themselves as the Rambler bounced over potholes — had their own form of entertainment, which was kept secret from our parents. Under their feet was a hole in the floorboard the size of a pancake, and whenever my father stopped to pay a toll, a a tiny hand shot through the hole to scoop up loose change. I once collected 85 cents on a trip to Aunt Lena’s, and when we finally made it home, after a series of stops and starts, the Pixy Stix were on me.Nowadays, I realized as we drove to Canada, very few people sit behind the wheels of older cars. Affordable leasing has changed a landscape once littered with motorists on the side of the road waving away plumes of dark smoke rising from beneath the hoods of their overheated cars, jugs of water at the ready. People who are as poor today as we were then can afford to lease a new car, or a used one in decent shape.About 450 miles from our front door, something a lot closer to home crossed my mind. Sure, my boys — pretty content for most of the trip to Canada — are riding in a lap of luxury beyond my wildest childhood dreams. But how far apart are they really sitting? The temperature is just right, but the atmosphere isn’t quite the same. Somehow, the Rambler, for all its mechanical faults, brought us closer together as a family.Christopher and Michael have their DVD’s. My siblings and I had one another. Road trips are not what they used to be.'"
"'07-09-30,'0','Many of the amenities are seasonal, including public facilities on the city’s three beaches, boat rentals, outdoor food vendors and tour boats, which open in the spring and close in mid-October. But it is year-round shops, residences and businesses that will keep the waterfront alive, said Ms. Moulton. In April, the Marriott Courtyard Burlington Harbor became the first new hotel to open in downtown Burlington in 30 years; it overlooks the lake from Battery Street, which runs parallel to the shoreline. Next door, a former Wyndham Hotel underwent $16 million worth of renovations and opened its doors last month as a Hilton. Just down the street, a former casual dining spot reopened in June with a Frenchified menu (escargots, coq au vin). As Quatorze Bistro, it rejoins the small number of established restaurants, delis and markets around Battery Street.In 2005, Ms. Moulton and her business partner, Lisa Steele, opened the Lake & College Building, a 119,000-square-foot brick and stone structure that earned a silver LEED certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design); it offers 30,000 square feet of public space. In addition to the Skinny Pancake and offices, the building houses a movie theater and a performing arts theater. All are open year round, as are Echo and the nearby Taste of Burlington restaurant.Rick Benson, the chef who opened Taste nearly three years ago in an 1850s-era, brick-and-timber mill building on a street paralleling the bike path, said that business doubled from the first to the second year of operation. Customers may come for a soup made with local beets and white truffle oil or a plate of duck with sour cherry sauce.The city’s future revitalization plans may include an outdoor skating rink, a public market and public transit by rail and water. Currently, public transportation to the waterfront is limited but handy: a free bus with a route that shuttles from the lake to the Church Street Marketplace and on to the University of Vermont.With all of the biking and jogging and dining going on, it is sometimes easy to forget that there is an entire lake out there — 120 miles long and 12 miles wide — waiting to be explored.Those who don’t own boats can, in season, rent them; aside from the small sailboats and kayaks rented at the Community Sailing Center (www.communitysailingcenter.org), several small-boat rental locations dot the lake shore. The 400-passenger Spirit of Ethan Allen III (www.soea.com) offers daily cruises and, in spring of 2008, a newcomer, the Moonlight Lady (www.vermontmoonlightlady.com), will offer two-to-seven-day cruises, the first ship to do so since 1952, according to its owner Mike Shea.The Lake Champlain Transportation Company (www.ferries.com) operates ferries to the New York side of the lake and back year-round, but the boat running between Burlington and Port Kent, N.Y., stops running in October.Scuba divers can, in season, explore shipwrecks, marked with buoys that are part of the Lake Champlain Underwater Historic Preserve. The maritime museum has teamed with a local operator to offer shipwreck tours via a remotely operated vehicle (R.O.V.) from a boat on the lake’s surface, one of only three commercially operated R.O.V. tours in the world, according to Rachael Miller, co-owner of Lake Champlain Shipwrecks (www.shipwrecktour.com).Visitors can expect waterfront activity to increase dramatically by 2009, when Vermont — along with the state of New York and the province of Quebec — commemorate the 400th anniversary of Samuel de Champlain’s first visit to the region.Mr. Cohn says the city’s “waterfront renaissance” enriches both citizens and visitors. “When you discover your waterfront, you discover more than views. You discover your history,” he said.ON THE WATER'S EDGE AND BEYONDThe Courtyard Burlington Harbor (25 Cherry Street, 802-864-4700, 800-321-2211; www.marriott.com).
