Regulators interviewed more than 80 people, including newspaper advertisers, subscribers, labor leaders and industry experts, during the review.McClatchy had no immediate comment.A separate inquiry into the deal by Bill Lockyer, the California attorney general, remains open, according to his spokesman, Tom Dresslar.Clinton Reilly, a San Francisco businessman, has also sued to block the deal, but a federal judge last week refused to issue a temporary restraining order to prevent McClatchy from turning over the papers to MediaNews.'"

The Council issued a statement on Qana late Sunday noting its “extreme shock and distress” but avoiding, at American insistence, any cease-fire recommendation.“We owe our people an honorable way out of this war,” Mr. Mitri told the Security Council. “In the name of Lebanon, I appeal to you all to put an end to this human tragedy.”He said Lebanon’s cabinet had approved a seven-point plan to end the conflict, which would require an immediate cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, a release of Lebanese and Israeli prisoners taken during the conflict, and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force in the southern part of the country.He also appealed to the Security Council to place the disputed Shebaa Farms border area under United Nations jurisdiction until claims of Lebanese sovereignty were resolved.

"'06-08-01,'0','Tyson Foods, the world’s biggest meat processor, reported a second consecutive quarterly loss yesterday and projected its first yearly loss since 1994 because of gluts in both chicken and beef.The loss was $52 million, or 15 cents a share, down from income of $131 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said.Sales in the period, which ended July 1 and was the third quarter of Tyson’s fiscal year, fell 4.8 percent, to $6.38 billion, from $6.71 billion as avian flu concerns and mad cow bans hurt exports of beef and poultry.The chief executive, Richard L. Bond, predicted “positive results” from the poultry unit in the current quarter after Tyson reduced chicken inventories.The results “reflected the challenging protein environment,” said Farha Aslam, an analyst with Stephens Inc. “We are optimistic about the chicken business as production cuts should support pricing and profitability and beef should benefit from company efforts to improve plant efficiencies,” she said.'"
"'06-08-01,'0','SEATTLE, July 31 — The parents of a Muslim man accused of shooting to death a woman and injuring five other people at a Jewish nonprofit organization last week wrote letters to Jewish groups on Monday saying “they don’t want this to be seen as anything but the act of an ill person,” a lawyer for the family said.“It’s basically telling the people that they’re very sorry for the tragedy that happened, that they’re praying for them,” said the lawyer, Larry C. Stephenson. “They don’t want this to be seen as creating any hatred between Jewish and Muslim people. The Haqs are very religious people.”The Seattle police say the Haqs’ son, Naveed Afzal Haq, 30, opened fire Friday afternoon in the offices of the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle, north of downtown, after forcing his way inside by holding a young girl at gunpoint. Pamela Waechter, 58, the federation’s director of annual giving, was killed. Three other victims remained in serious condition on Monday.Dan Donohoe , a spokesman for the King County prosecuting attorney’s office, said Mr. Haq would be formally charged this week. Mr. Haq is being held on one count of homicide and five counts of attempted homicide; his bail is $50 million. The F.B.I. is also investigating to determine if he committed a hate crime, said Frederick Gutt, a special agent in the bureau’s Seattle office.Mr. Haq told an emergency dispatcher moments after the shootings that he had attacked the offices because of his anger toward Jews and the United States, according to the police and an arrest affidavit.'"

"'06-08-01,'0','Ginger Cruz, the deputy inspector general at the agency, said in a telephone interview that most of the teams were overwhelmingly composed of military personnel instead of the mix of military and civilian officials that had been originally envisioned. Ms. Cruz said civilian agencies had been unable to recruit officials from their ranks who wanted to work in Iraq’s dusty and often dangerous provincial capitals.“The question is, are the civilian agencies able to find sufficient staff to create a joint civilian-military entity?” said Ms. Cruz, who led the visits. She said that no conclusions had been reached on whether the teams could succeed, but that the visits had turned up enough concerns that her office would conduct a thorough audit of the program.Reconstruction teams are already at work in the northwestern province of Nineveh; the north central province of Tamim; the western desert province of Anbar; Babil Province, whose capital, Hilla, is about 40 miles south of Baghdad, and in Baghdad.A spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Baghdad, Elizabeth O. Colton, said two other teams, in Salahuddin and Diyala Provinces, had reached “initial operating capability.”Despite the problems that the initial survey turned up, there were also bright spots, particularly in Baghdad and Hilla, Ms. Cruz said.Cmdr. Brian Wilson of the Navy, acting deputy director of the Babil reconstruction team, said in an interview here that a suite of new rebuilding projects in the province showed that the concept could work.In the centralized bureaucracy that prevailed under Saddam Hussein, he said, provincial leaders had little say in the way their regions were run and were therefore still learning how to set priorities when given the authority.“This is the first time in their lives that they’ve had a say in what they build and how they build it,” Commander Wilson said.Gradually, though, Iraqis have been more assertive in discussions on potential projects in Babil, he said, and now they are often leading the meetings. As an example, he cited a $4.2 million, 7-mile road project called 80th Street, which will put four lanes of asphalt road through a business district on the western edge of Hilla.The decision to give American financing to the project, which is being overseen by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, emerged when Iraqi leaders came to a consensus that the road was their first priority, Commander Wilson said.The project “gave the Iraqis the opportunity to choose,” he said.But the bureaucracy in Baghdad appears to be reasserting itself, he said, despite new powers granted to the provinces by Iraq’s recently approved Constitution. Doug Meurs, the deputy regional coordinator at Hilla’s regional embassy office, said that a provincial governor recently “complained that in order to change the land lines in his office, he needed permission from three different ministerial offices in Baghdad.”'"
"'06-08-01,'0','“Run the iPod,” said one of them, Darran Samuel, 17, using street slang to signal the start of a robbery, according to prosecutors. When Christopher refused, he was stabbed twice in the chest. He died that afternoon.The robbery was not uncommon, but the object of desire was also one of fascination. IPods, computerized music-players that sell for as much as $400, come equipped with parts that announce their presence on purpose. Their postmodern design has been adopted as fashion by the urban cool.Just a few months before Christopher was killed, the police announced a sharp increase in subway crime, brought about almost entirely by thefts of iPods and similar devices.After that, some people began substituting plain headphones for the obvious white ones, but the warnings from the police did little to diminish the popularity of the machines. Last month, Apple Computer, the company that makes the iPod, announced that it had sold 8.1 million of them in three months, a 32 percent increase from the same period in 2005.After Christopher was killed, Apple’s founder and chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, called the Rose family to offer sympathies. There were calls from around the world and visits from elected officials, said Errol Rose, Christopher’s father.In State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, four young men were eventually charged with crimes connected to the robbery. Daryl Stephen, 18, is scheduled for trial next month on charges of hindering prosecution. Quaison Fraser, 18, pleaded guilty to gang assault and is scheduled for sentencing today.Prosecutors have focused their efforts on two cousins. The elder, Aaron Farrell, 20, the one known as Doom, was accused of stabbing Christopher and charged with second-degree murder. Jurors ended deliberations in his case yesterday without a verdict; they were ordered to return today.The younger cousin, Mr. Samuel, was charged with second-degree murder for instigating the robbery. A prosecutor, Kyle Reeves, said that Mr. Samuel should have known his companions were capable of violence, if only by their gang affiliations and nicknames.In court yesterday, Justice Alan D. Marrus noted Mr. Samuel’s youth, but spared him little of the maximum penalty of 25 years to life in prison, sentencing him to 22 years to life.Mr. Samuel rubbed his face. His grandmother wailed. The spectators filed out, parents mostly, and not yet middle-aged. Joanna Samuel, mother of Darran, said her son was a scapegoat.Mr. Rose, Christopher’s father, spoke of all that time spent riding the bus to Pennsylvania, trying to keep him away from the gamble of the Brooklyn streets.“For me, forget about it, it’s like half of my life is gone,” Mr. Rose said, “because I took Christopher away from all this.”'"
"'06-08-01,'0','The week of July 24, Mr. Nass, who is up for re-election this year, sent a resolution signed by 61 state legislators — all but one of them Republican — to Gov. James E. Doyle, a Democrat, and university officials condemning Mr. Barrett’s “academically dishonest views” and demanding that his one-semester contract to teach the class for a salary of $8,247 be terminated.Mr. Barrett, a co-founder of a group called Muslim-Jewish-Christian Alliance for 9/11 Truth, argued that he had never presented his personal opinions in class and that he was free to offer those opinions on his own time outside the classroom.“Why is liberal Wisconsin going bananas over an $8,000-a-year lecturer who’s not even teaching his own views in the course?” Mr. Barrett asked. “I go out of my way to bring in diverse interpretations for students to look at.”The university’s chancellor, John D. Wiley, said that he was baffled by Mr. Barrett’s beliefs but that they were irrelevant in the classroom, where he must stick to a syllabus that has been approved by the department. That syllabus includes a week devoted to the war on terror.A 10-day university review had determined that Mr. Barrett presented a variety of viewpoints and that he had not discussed his personal opinions in the classroom, Mr. Wiley said.“I think it would be a serious mistake for legislators to try to get in and micromanage curriculum,” said Mr. Wiley, who added that university officials would keep an eye on Mr. Barrett by meeting with him throughout the semester. “We don’t go around and question all our instructors to find out what all their views are.”At the University of Colorado, a committee voted in June to fire Ward L. Churchill, an ethnic studies professor who had compared some victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to a Nazi official. Professor Churchill appealed this month to keep his job.And early this year at Northwestern University, Arthur R. Butz, a tenured professor of engineering, drew strong criticism after saying he agreed with the belief of the president of Iran that the Holocaust was a myth.Patrick V. Farrell, the provost of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, said the university was not focusing on Mr. Barrett’s political views but on the teaching and learning experience in the classroom.“I want to avoid as much as we can creating some kind of a political test for instructors or faculty, to say that only those whose thinking fits within some predetermined mold are well equipped to teach our students,” Mr. Farrell said. “I think that creates a dangerous precedent.”Some Wisconsin students said they thought it was a crucial part of a college education to learn about a variety of theories, including radical ones, before forming opinions on a topic.“It’s a student’s decision in a class whether they believe what a professor is saying,” said Jillian Alpire, 22, who graduated this year. “Just because he said his opinions on a radio station does not mean that’s what the course is going to be about.”Ben Kopish, 20, a junior, said that such a controversial discourse should be welcomed at a public university that is known for fostering outspoken academic debate.“If it doesn’t happen somewhere like the Madison campus,” Mr. Kopish said, “then I don’t know where else it would happen.”But Katherine Brown, 20, who had finished a summer course on Islam, questioned the role of such a political discussion in a religion class.“I just feel like it isn’t relevant because Islam is a religion,” said Ms. Brown, who added that she agreed with her own professor’s decision not to discuss the war on terror. “It’s not about what’s going on currently in politics so much.”Mr. Barrett’s ideas place him squarely within a loose confederation of skeptics who think the American government had a role in the Sept. 11 attacks and whose theories are spread through the Internet and other means.Mr. Barrett and Chancellor Wiley both said the controversy might actually be helping provide Mr. Barrett with a larger platform to voice his ideas. It has sparked curiosity in students like Ms. Brown, who said she was interested in finding out more about why Mr. Barrett believes what he does.Although Ms. Brown said she did not believe that the government could have been involved in the Sept. 11 attacks, she added, “So many very important things that we know now were considered radical when they were first presented as ideas.”A picture caption with an article yesterday about Kevin Barrett, an instructor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who has disputed official findings on the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks, referred imprecisely to his teaching on the attacks. A university review determined that although Mr. Barrett presented a variety of viewpoints, he had not discussed his personal opinions in the classroom.An article on Tuesday about Kevin Barrett, an instructor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who disputes official findings on the Sept. 11 attacks, referred imprecisely to efforts by the University of Colorado to dismiss Ward L. Churchill, an ethnic studies professor who had compared some victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to a Nazi official. While he was criticized for those comments, university officials said the reason they took action against Mr. Churchill was because of misconduct in his research.'"

"'06-08-01,'0','ANKARA, Turkey, July 31 (AP) — Duygu Asena, a best-selling writer and crusader for women’s rights in Turkey, died Sunday in Istanbul. She was 60.She had battled for two years with a brain tumor and died in American Hospital, where she was admitted Thursday with a high temperature and respiratory problems, the hospital said.Ms. Asena, the author of the influential book “Woman Has No Name,” had trained to be a teacher but began writing for what were considered women’s pages in newspapers in the early 1970’s.In 1978 she founded the first women’s magazine in Turkey. Ignoring taboos, Ms. Asena was the first Turkish writer to explore topics like women’s rights, sexuality and wife-beating.“Woman Has No Name” broke sales records when it was printed in 1987, but was later banned by the government, which found it to be lewd and obscene. The ban was lifted after a two-year court battle. A film adaptation of the book broke box office records in Turkey.Ms. Asena wrote eight other feminist novels, including “There Is No Love” — a sequel to “Woman Has No Name” — and weekly newspaper columns.'"
"'06-08-01,'0','MOSCOW, July 31 — Several thousand gallons of crude oil leaked from a Russian pipeline over the weekend, briefly shutting down a major export route and causing prices to spike to about $75 a barrel on world oil markets.The 2,500-mile-long Druzhba pipeline, which moves oil from Siberian fields to consumers in Central and Eastern Europe, ruptured Saturday toward its western end, in the Bryansk region near the border with Belarus.The size of the spill and the damage to the environment remained a matter of dispute on Monday — when authorities made the spill public — though by the end of the day ecologists and government officials agreed it could be characterized as minor. The pipeline resumed pumping oil on Monday afternoon.A relatively small amount of oil — 39 tons, or roughly 11,000 gallons — leaked from the pipe onto flat ground far from any rivers or streams, according to Lyudmila K. Komogortseva, chairwoman of the ecology committee of the regional Parliament. In a telephone interview, she said 32 tons had been recovered by Monday.A spokesman for the Ministry of Natural Resources, Oleg L. Mitvol, said more oil had spilled, but he backpedaled on an earlier ministry statement that called the spill an environmental “catastrophe.”'"
"'06-08-01,'0','The development corporation, the city-state agency formed to direct the rebuilding effort, was always intended to have a limited life. In announcing last week that its work would soon end, Kevin M. Rampe, chairman of the development corporation, said it had accomplished its main goals: choosing a master plan and a memorial design for the World Trade Center site and allocating federal money for cultural programs.But given that no ground has been broken on any cultural projects, their designs remain uncertain and some still could face opposition from relatives of the victims, it remains unclear who will devise or enforce any sort of timetable.At SoHo Repertory Theater, which recently received a $100,000 planning grant from the development corporation, staff members are planning a meeting to discuss the agency’s imminent demise. “We’re trying to figure out what this means in terms of their ongoing support,” said Daniel Aukin, the theater’s artistic director.John Haworth, director of the National Museum of the American Indian’s New York branch at One Bowling Green, known as the George Gustav Heye Center, said of the development corporation, “They played an important role, and I guess my question is, How will that role be fulfilled in the future?”It’s been hard enough to make culture happen at the World Trade Center site. In addition to ousting the Drawing Center from the World Trade Center site proper, family members persuaded Gov. George E. Pataki to shelve a planned International Freedom Center. Both were to occupy a future museum building designed by the Norwegian firm Snohetta that will now serve instead as a visitors center above the World Trade Center Memorial Museum.The development corporation itself was widely criticized for its handling of the cultural organizations: for failing to provide clear information, for moving too slowly, for retreating from plans or delaying them when public criticism of its choices arose. In a recent memo to his colleagues obtained by The New York Times, Adrian Ellis, a consultant who worked on cultural development downtown, wrote of the development corporation: “L.M.D.C. was one of the most unimpressive organizations with which I have worked in 16 years of consulting: the expression ‘sloping shoulders’ could have been invented for it — everyone sitting across the table seemed furtive, cowed, insinuating, hand-wringing and evasive, from the first meeting to the last.”Slow fund-raising for the memorial itself; the recent resignation of the president of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, Gretchen Dykstra; and debates over the memorial’s design have helped keep the focus away from the Performing Arts Center, which is to be designed by Frank Gehry and shared by the Signature Theater Company, an Off-Broadway company, and the Joyce Theater, which presents dance.Reached by phone, Mr. Gehry said he was unaware that the L.M.D.C. was going out of business. “I don’t have a clue,” he said.Linda Shelton, the executive director of the Joyce, said in an interview, “Any change is anxiety-ridden.” She added, “Once it gets sorted out, it will be fine.”Still uncertain is which agency will oversee cultural development downtown after the corporation dissolves. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has enlarged its role recently, taking over construction of the Freedom Tower, formerly overseen by the developer Larry A. Silverstein, and of the memorial. While Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said the city would like to oversee disbursement of the remaining grants, its role is still undetermined.“I believe the city will have the central role,” he said. “Ultimately the governor and the mayor will jointly decide who will be responsible for what elements of the L.M.D.C.’s work.’’“Our commitment to culture and cultural organizations in Lower Manhattan has always been steadfast,” Mr. Doctoroff added. “Given that, I do not believe the wind-down of the L.M.D.C. will have any negative impact on the Performing Arts Center or the disbursement of the remaining funds.”Ms. Shelton said she would be happy to have downtown cultural development in the city’s hands. “Given the mayor’s track record in the arts, it would be a wonderful thing,” she said, alluding to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s private philanthropy and his highly visible Department of Cultural Affairs. James Houghton, the artistic director of the Signature Theater, said he was encouraged that the city sought a larger role.The Port Authority has gained a reputation as a more efficient agency than the development corporation — it broke ground on a PATH station designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, virtually the only uncontroversial piece of architecture on the site so far. But when asked about its potential involvement, the authority said yesterday in a statement, “We do not anticipate a role in the development of cultural facilities on the site."" Tensions have already arisen over its plans to put a temporary PATH terminal on part of the Performing Arts Center site between Vesey and Fulton Streets, which would push the theater project further into the future.“Anything that delays culture on the site at this point creates a very sad situation,” said Madelyn Wils, a director of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. “If you go back five years, it was very important not only to mourn the deaths of all who died on the site but also to go forward by celebrating the life downtown. It was a very important piece of the equation that now is basically on the back burner.”Some have broached the possibility that the Memorial Foundation, created in 2004 to raise money for the memorial and cultural buildings, could take on responsibility for advancing the arts at ground zero. But given the strong presence of 9/11 family members on the foundation board whose overriding priority is the memorial, many involved say the two projects should remain separate.Some worry that the $7 million left over for cultural organizations — of an overall $45 million that the development corporation set aside in May 2005 for downtown arts groups that are not at ground zero — would be diverted to the memorial or other uses. “We’re hard pressed to make sure that $7 million doesn’t disappear,” Mr. Healy said.Some argue that the entire process should be suspended until a new governor takes office in January.Stefan Pryor, the president of the development corporation, said he expected cultural growth downtown to proceed as planned. “We’re working closely with the city and the State of New York to ensure that the cultural grants by L.M.D.C. are disbursed and that the cultural organizations themselves continue to be supported by the downtown network of agencies,” he said.In the meantime, cultural groups hope for the best. “We will continue to work with whoever is in charge,” said Ms. Shelton of the Joyce.'"
"'06-08-01,'0','New research suggests that people ages 30 to 69 who live alone are almost twice as likely as those who live with a partner to suffer angina, heart attacks or sudden cardiac death.Danish researchers studied more than 138,000 subjects in Aarhus, Denmark’s second largest city, over a two-year period ending in March 2002. The report appears in the August issue of The Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.The best predictors of acute cardiac syndrome were age and living alone. Dr. Kirsten Melgaard Nielsen, the lead author of the study and an internist at Aarhus Sygehus University Hospital, said that it was not living alone itself that increased the risk, but the health practices of those who lived without partners. “They’re less likely to exercise, they eat more fat, and they’re more likely to smoke and have high cholesterol,” she said.For women over 60 and men over 50, the risk was even greater. Researchers concluded that they were almost three times as likely to suffer heart problems if they had no partner.The scientists found that sudden cardiac death was even more strongly associated with single living than angina or heart attack, a fact they attribute to a lone person’s decreased ability to call for emergency help.“Doctors should look carefully at social markers in evaluating a patient’s risk for heart disease,” Dr. Nielsen said. “If they do, they are more likely to find risk factors that they can treat.”'"
"'06-08-01,'0','“What do chemists do? They like to make stuff,” Dr. Principe said. “Most chemists are interested not so much in theory as in making substances with particular properties. The emphasis on products was the same with some alchemists in the 17th century.”Pamela H. Smith, a history professor at Columbia, said alchemy “was the matter theory of its day” and was “incredibly multilayered and therefore a powerful way of viewing nature.”Yet on the whole, historians say, the widespread practice of alchemy impeded the rise of modern chemistry. While physics and astronomy marched slowly but inexorably from Galileo to Kepler to Newton and the Scientific Revolution, chemistry slumbered under alchemy’s influence through what historians call its “postponed scientific revolution.”The new research and revised interpretations concerning the role of alchemy in the history of chemistry as well as pharmacology and medicine were discussed at a three-day conference late last month at the Chemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia. The meeting, attended by more than 80 scientists and historians, was organized by Dr. Principe, who said, “Only in the last 15 or 20 years have we learned how crucial alchemy was to the emergence of modern science.”No one at the meeting tried to turn lead into gold. But the historians conjured up quite a lode of pyrite, fool’s gold, in the colorful characters they had found buried in previously neglected archives.A few practicing alchemists, it seems, may have been certifiably mad — probably, like mad hatters, from sniffing the mercury they worked with.One notable alchemist of the 16th century, a Swiss named Paracelsus, was not mad, but cantankerous and iconoclastic. “He was equal parts metallurgist, pharmacist, physician and crackpot,” Dr. Principe said.Historians have found that Paracelsus made some advances in the detection of disorders by analyzing urine and claimed marvelous cures through alchemy.In his chemical cosmology, he saw the world as a great distillation vessel and its changes as parallel to the operations carried out in a laboratory. But he recorded his material and spiritual ideas in the deliberately opaque writing typical of many alchemists, who expressed themselves in codes, symbols and emblems to conceal their findings from the uninitiated.From his study, Dane Thor Daniel of Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, concluded that Paracelsus’s unwavering objective was to find a Christian alternative to pagan natural philosophy — science.Other alchemists were outright charlatans or fools, ridiculed in contemporary art and literature. On display in a gallery at the conference hall were several 17th-century paintings by Flemish and Dutch artists, who depicted alchemists toiling in the disorder of dark workshops and the poverty of futile quests. The paintings were said to be popular among Dutch burghers as a caution to anyone contemplating a life in alchemy instead of steady trade.But many an alchemist drew support from royal courts where visions of newfound wealth and power danced in crowned heads. It was not always a happy alliance.In 1601, Hans Heinrich Nüschler signed a contract with his patron, Duke Friedrich of Württemberg in Stuttgart, to demonstrate his process for extracting a substantial amount of gold from a sample of silver. The duke, keen on mining technology, promised a generous reward. Nüschler agreed to conduct the experiments at his own expense.After several months of failure and mounting debt, the desperate alchemist resorted to fraud. He asked his brother to help by surreptitiously adding gold to the alchemical sample. His ploy exposed, Nüschler was tried, convicted and hanged.“Only a handful of alchemists actually ended their careers on the gallows,” said Tara E. Nummedal, a historian at Brown. “But this underscored that alchemy was very serious business in the Holy Roman Empire.”In her report, Dr. Nummedal concluded that the relationships of patrons and alchemists showed that “alchemy was a direct engagement with the political, economic, religious and intellectual realities of the early modern world.”At the turn of the 17th century, King Henry IV of France surrounded himself with alchemists who sought to resurrect plants from their ashes and experimented with ways to extend the monarch’s life. Even the diplomats had orders to seek out the cryptic methods of alchemists in other countries.An alchemist in the court of a German prince scored a profitable success quite by accident. Looking for materials for creating precious metals, Johann Friedrich Böttger analyzed a “white earth” that duplicated the ingredients for imported Chinese porcelain. The discovery was the beginning of the Dresden china industry.Even geniuses of the first order, like Isaac Newton, found alchemy irresistible. It was an accepted method of seeking knowledge — or confirmation of received truth — in early modern history.Newton, whose laws of gravity and optics ushered in modern physics, also delved into alchemy with relentless energy. His notebooks contain thousands of pages on alchemic thoughts and experiments over 30 years.William R. Newman, a professor of the history and philosophy of science at Indiana University, said many manuscripts had not received the scrutiny they deserved. He reported on a text in the Smithsonian Institution that he called “an overlooked gem.”In these notebook entries, Newton cited the ideas of German alchemists for imitating the processes by which metals were generated in nature, deep inside the earth. These involved the familiar alchemical theory of metallic generation through interactions of sulfur and mercury.But Newton, expanding on the theory, wrote: “These two spirits above all wander over the earth and bestow life on animals and vegetables. And they makes stones, salts and so forth.”As Dr. Newman noted, “Thus we have passed from a theory of mere metallic generation to one that is intended to explain the totality of life on earth, as well as the production of all mineral materials, not just metallic ones.”In this sense, Dr. Newman continued, Newton’s repeated experiments for the rest of his life were aimed at fulfilling the words of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes, considered the founding text of alchemy in ancient Egypt. Newton expected to achieve what the tablet said was the una res, “the one thing” by which “the world was created” and with which one could “perform miracles.”So it seems that Newton was no ordinary alchemist interested in making gold. He apparently aspired to a theory of alchemy more comprehensive than even his laws of gravity. But it could be said, in a paraphrase of Newton’s famous expression of modesty, that the giants on whose shoulders he stood in this endeavor did not measure up to his antecedents in physics and astronomy.Newton’s alchemical bent was not out of character, Dr. Smith of Columbia said. “He was drawn to the occult,” she said. “Gravity for him was an occult force, and so was alchemy as an explanation of how things transform into other things.”The British chemist Robert Boyle, a Newton contemporary, also had a foot on each side of the alchemy-modern science divide. He dabbled for years in an alchemical obsession, the search for the philosopher’s stone — the long-sought agent for transmuting lead to gold and unlocking other material and spiritual secrets. The stone was the unified theory of everything in that time.Boyle wrote enviously in 1680 that “there exists conceal’d in the world” a group of chemists “of a much higher order able to transmute baser Metalls into perfect ones.”At the same time, Boyle hurled harsh criticism at alchemists, particularly Paracelsians and the obscurity of their language and concepts. His purpose, he wrote, was to draw “the Chymists Doctrine out of their Dark and Smoakie Laboratories into open light” and to engage in “better Experiments and Arguments.”Citing Boyle’s “swinging critique” and even earlier attacks on alchemical practices, Stephen Clucas, a University of London historian, raised questions that he said require deeper research by historians: Why did a “scientific revolution” in experimental chemistry not occur earlier in the 17th century? Why was a clear separation of alchemy and exact chemistry delayed until the 18th century?Bruce T. Moran, a historian at the University of Nevada at Reno and the University College London, said it was not all that unreasonable at the time to be attracted to alchemy. “For a variety of practical and intellectual reasons,” Professor Moran said, “the idea of transforming one thing into another was to be expected.”In everyday life, grapes were turned to wine and wheat to bread. A sour green apple grew into a sweet red one. It was in the nature of things to change, even metals. Miners and refiners already knew that lead ore almost always contains some silver, and silver ore almost always contains some gold. This implied that the metals changed one into the other over time.In the booklet “Transmutations: Alchemy in Art,” written with Lloyd DeWitt, an art historian, Dr. Principe noted that in 1600, chemists knew of just seven metals — gold, silver, iron, copper, tin, lead and mercury. (Since then scientists have discovered another 60.) The original seven known metals had properties in common. They were shiny and, except for the liquid mercury, could be hammered, shaped and cast.“The commonality of properties implied to early thinkers a commonality of composition,” Dr. Principe wrote., “And thus it was theorized that all the metals were composed of the same essential ingredients in different proportions and degrees of purity.”“Even if in the modern view alchemy is all nonsense or very spiritual,” Dr. Moran said, “many people drawn to it for whatever reasons were actually creating very useful, practical chemistry and bringing to it an artisan know-how.”The conference on the history of alchemy opened with a program of chamber music called “The Philosophers’ Tone.” The scholars delighted in Handel’s transmutation of Ben Jonson’s “The Alchemist” into pure gold. Over coffee between sessions, they pondered new directions of research and topics for dissertations. They said, for example, that more attention should be paid to alchemy’s role in the history of medicine.They also remarked, somewhat conspiratorially, over parallels between the misguided certainties and self-delusion of alchemy and today’s political and religious attacks on modern science. Of Boyle’s efforts to replicate experiments from alchemical writings, Joseph E. Early, a retired Georgetown University professor who studies the philosophy of chemistry, said, “He couldn’t do it any more than we could find the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.”Then the scholars departed Philadelphia, leaving the city’s lead-to-gold ratio unchanged.'"

Only police and military dogs were spared, The Shanghai Daily reported, citing local news media. Dogs being walked were taken from their owners and beaten on the spot, the paper said. Other teams entered villages at night, creating noise to get dogs barking, and then beating them to death. Owners were offered the equivalent of 63 cents to kill their dogs before the teams were sent in. The paper said 360 of Mouding’s 200,000 residents suffered bites this year. “With the aim to keep this horrible disease from people, we decided to kill the dogs,” Li Haibo, a spokesman for the county, was quoted as saying by the official New China News Agency. China has seen a rise in the number of rabies cases, with 2,651 reported deaths in 2004. Experts have tied the rise in part to an increase in dog ownership, particularly in rural areas.

"'06-08-02,'1','WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 — The chief executive of Boeing, W. James McNerney Jr., went before one of the company’s harshest critics on Tuesday and tried to rebuild its reputation.Mr. McNerney’s appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee came on a day the committee examined Boeing’s $615 million settlement with the government — the largest ever for a military contractor — that ended several ethics investigations into its dealings with the Pentagon.“I hope to discuss why, going forward, the Congress and the taxpayers of this country can place their trust in Boeing,” Mr. McNerney said. “Companies doing business with the U.S. government are expected to adhere to the highest legal and ethical standards. I acknowledge that Boeing did not live up to those expectations.”Since taking over 14 months ago, Mr. McNerney has made ethics and integrity a centerpiece. In questioning by the committee, it appeared that his efforts were beginning to pay off. Even Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has attacked the company for more than three years, praised “the integrity of the new management team and Boeing and all the changes that are attributable to Mr. McNerney’s leadership.”To a large extent, actions taken since Mr. McNerney became chief executive have undercut some of the committee members’ anger. Late last week, Boeing announced that it would not seek a tax deduction for the $615 million it has paid to the government — a decision that Mr. McNerney said after the hearing would cost $200 million.'"
"'06-08-02,'1','The judges dismissed arguments by the Yukos lawyer Drew P. Holiner that the company could recover as the value of its oil fields, refineries and filling stations rose along with high world oil prices. Mr. Holiner said he would appeal, but also called the ruling the “death” of Yukos.“There are a number of decisions that the company feels are a violation of its right to a fair trial,” Mr. Holiner said after the ruling.The company still contends its overseas holdings — a refinery in Lithuania, a pipeline in Slovakia and an oil services company in Switzerland — are exempt from the ruling, based on a separate decision by a United States federal judge in New York last month.As a result of the New York ruling, Yukos will operate its assets outside Russia independently of the court-appointed administrator and the Russian courts, essentially splitting the company in two — one bankrupt, another operating from London and other European offices and controlling assets owned by a Dutch-registered subsidiary, Yukos International.“You might know us as the old Yukos and new Yukos by tomorrow,” a company spokeswoman, Claire Davidson, said in a telephone interview from London.Yukos is in the process of selling the refinery and the pipeline. The overseas branch will press a legal case against the Russian government in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, according to the former chief executive, Steven M. Theede, who made the disclosure in a letter announcing his resignation last month.At the hearing yesterday, the chief judge, Pavel Markov, approved Eduard Rebgun, who had been nominated by creditors, to serve as receiver and temporary manager in Mr. Theede’s place and approved a salary of about $804,000 a year. Mr. Rebgun said Yukos had assets of $17.7 billion and liabilities of $18.3 billion.The decision strips control from shareholders, including Mr. Khodorkovsky and foreign investors who lost millions during the crackdown on Yukos.The court also dismissed arguments that Yukos was unable to pay its debts because assets were frozen by court order.The tax authorities seized the company’s largest pumping asset, the Yugansk unit in Siberia, in 2004, alleging Yukos used transfer payments among subsidiaries to avoid taxes, a common practice in Russia at the time. The Yugansk subsidiary, comprising about two-thirds of the value of Yukos, was sold in an auction to a shell company bought a few days later by Rosneft.Still, Yukos operates two large production subsidiaries, five refineries, 1,300 filling stations and other property. The company pumps about 450,000 barrels a day.During the hearing, a representative of Yukos shareholders read a caustic letter accusing the judges of bias as they looked on impassively.“It is another facade intended to create the appearance of regularity,” the shareholder, Tim Osborne, wrote about the legal process. “Rather it is the next step in the looting of Yukos.”“What in 2003 was the jewel of the Russian energy industry now is poised on the verge of extinction,” he wrote.Yukos, privatized in an auction for $300 million in 1996, has come full circle and is again state property. Energy analysts say the government’s strategy is to leverage the monopoly power of oil and gas exports to reap profits for the state — rather than for tycoons such as Mr. Khodorkovsky — and regain power in foreign policy lost after the breakup of the Soviet Union.“This is the last act of the oligarch drama,” Caius Rapanu, an oil and gas analyst at the brokerage firm UralSib, said of the bankruptcy hearing. “The door has closed on the time when unelected oligarchs have so much sway over Russian economics and politics.”Detractors say that government insiders are skimming off the profits, and that the same will now happen with the Yukos property.In the hearing, which lasted three and a half hours, Yukos lawyers unsuccessfully argued three motions, asking Judge Markov to stay the bankruptcy until other courts, including the European Court of Human Rights, have ruled on related issues.'"
"'06-08-02,'1','“We’re just pleading with you here: don’t go along with this stuff,” said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. “We’re really counting on you, if you’re confirmed, to restore the confidence in this agency.”Senators Patty Murray of Washington and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, both Democrats, have held up the vote on Dr. von Eschenbach’s nomination until the agency issues a decision — pro or con — on the over-the-counter sale of Plan B. They said Tuesday that they would continue that hold; with the Senate unable to vote on the nomination, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which held the hearing, did not vote after the nomination hearing.Mrs. Clinton said that Dr. von Eschenbach, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, was eminently qualified for the job, but that his nomination had to be stalled because of Plan B and the larger debate it had come to represent.“Like so much of this government in the past five and a half years, it has been turned into a political football, and you’re on the field,” Mrs. Clinton said. “This is not just about Plan B. Once we start politicizing the F.D.A. there is no stopping. It is essential that we draw a line, and we are drawing a line right here.”Senators suggested that the timing of the announcement on Plan B was intended to smooth the way for Dr. von Eschenbach’s nomination. “We’ve been down this road before,” Ms. Murray said.Dr. von Eschenbach said that the Plan B developments were “an unfolding,” that he could not have made an announcement before informing the company that produces the drug, Barr Pharmaceuticals, and that he had done that on Monday.“No one told me what I should or could do,” Dr. von Eschenbach said. “No one told me what decision I must or must not make.”Plan B is a high dosage of the hormones used in birth control pills. Doctors have advised women for decades to take several birth control pills within 72 hours of sex to prevent conception, and Plan B, approved as a prescription in 1999, marketed that treatment as a two-pill pack. It is available by prescription for women of all ages and without a prescription but behind pharmacy counters in several states.Barr applied for approval to sell the drug over the counter in 2003. When that application was rejected, it modified it to seek approval to sell the drug to women older than 16. Last summer, Dr. von Eschenbach’s predecessor, Dr. Lester M. Crawford, promised a decision by Sept. 1, 2005. On Monday, Dr. von Eschenbach said he would be open to allowing it for women 18 and older and that approval could happen within several weeks.'"

"'06-08-02,'1','Other legal experts added that there did not appear to be any evidence that pretrial publicity would have affected attempts to find a fair and impartial jury pool in the case.“This is inconsistent with opinions of appellate courts and even the United States Supreme Court that have found that pretrial publicity is not a ground for overturning a conviction in a criminal case, much less a civil case,” said Herschel P. Fink, a lawyer who specializes in First Amendment issues.A lawyer for Ford said she hoped the decision would send a message to future litigants that they must follow the rules or risk losing their day in court.“Plaintiff and her counsel have a First Amendment right to speak out against sexual harassment, but they do not have a right to tamper with the administration of justice by deliberately attempting to taint the jury pool and deprive Ford of its right to a fair trial,” said the lawyer, Elizabeth P. Hardy, in an e-mail message.The harassment suit was filed against Ford and a supervisor, Daniel P. Bennett, six years ago by Ms. Maldonado, an inspector at an assembly plant in Wixom, Mich.Ms. Maldonado was one of four women who sued Ford in cases involving Mr. Bennett. Three suits, including that of Ms. Maldonado, have been dismissed, and the fourth is pending before the Michigan Supreme Court.In her lawsuit, Ms. Maldonado said that Mr. Bennett had exposed himself to her many times and followed her home. During pretrial proceedings, the trial court judge ruled that a 1995 conviction of Mr. Bennett on charges of indecent exposure could not be introduced into evidence.Nevertheless, Ms. Maldonado and her lawyers mentioned Mr. Bennett’s record to news media and in a town hall meeting in 2002.Ford said that its investigations concluded that Ms. Maldonado’s accusations, and those of the three other women, were without merit.

"'06-08-02,'1','For example, consumers who checked yesterday for round-trip flights from La Guardia Airport in New York to Las Vegas, departing Friday, Sept. 29, and returning Monday, Oct. 2, would see on one screen a choice of seven flights at seven prices ranging from $139 to $319. For all seven flights, the two cheapest fares were unavailable.•The value of information in that form is considerable. The $99 fares for all of Tuesday’s flights are sold out? Why not check Monday and Wednesday? The fully refundable fare is $50 more than a restricted ticket and you’re not certain of your return date? Pay a little more.A company that convinces customers that it is being straightforward about its prices earns good will, said Steve Morrison, professor and chairman of the economics department at Northeastern University.“I would think the more transparent airlines are, the higher esteem in which they’re held,” said Mr. Morrison, who has studied airline pricing.Because route systems of each airline are different, the features of a Web site alone will not conquer the competition. But between airlines that fly the same routes, an easier-to-use Web site could be an important tool in taking market share.Mr. Morrison said traditional carriers could be forced over time into matching the features of the matrix. “They’re becoming more like low-cost carriers. These distinctions are going to, by necessity, fade away,” he said.Switching to a matrix last December helped Alaska Airlines, based in Seattle, sell about 40 percent of its tickets via its Web site (www.alaskaair.com) as of April, up from about 32 percent a year earlier, said Steve Jarvis, vice president of sales and customer experience. Airlines prefer selling via their Web sites because it is inexpensive — cheaper than paying travel agents, online bookers or the airlines’ own reservation agents to do the job.Changing to a matrix was not very costly, Mr. Jarvis said, and Alaska Airlines did not suffer a revenue decline even though it was easier for customers to compare fares. In some cases, he said, customers now easily see that a fare with fewer restrictions is not much more costly and they opt for that. “We didn’t expect and aren’t seeing a revenue-negative impact,” he said.Southwest, which has used a matrix for nearly three years, sells about 70 percent of its tickets via its Web site, which it said was the highest level among major airlines. AirTran, using a matrix for one year, sells about 56 percent of tickets via its Web site. Competing against Delta in Atlanta and across the Southeast, “we believe we have to be easy to do business with,” said Bob Fornaro, president and chief operating officer of AirTran.What keeps American from displaying a matrix on its Web site? “Ability, at the moment,” said Billy Sanez, a spokesman, who added that the carrier’s software did not currently allow it to present information in that way.But there is another reason. “I’ll be honest,” Mr. Sanez said. “We do have a different pricing structure than Southwest. We have a lot more fares. We’re a little more complicated.”•He said American planned to upgrade its Web site, but he would not say when or how the site would change. “We have room to improve,” Mr. Sanez said. American would not disclose the percentage of sales via its Web site. Total direct sales — those via www.aa.com and American’s own reservation agents — are 40 percent, Mr. Sanez said.The traditional carriers all have more complex fares. A spokesman for Northwest, Kurt Ebenhoch, said “in some markets we probably have 50. Or 40. The average is probably 20.” Northwest sells about 25 percent of its tickets via its Web site.Mr. Ebenhoch pointed out that Southwest fares were not available on services like Expedia and Orbitz, which are widely used for price comparison. “There are different definitions of transparency,” he said. Those services, along with Kayak and Sidestep, which search other Web sites for air fares, have improved comparison shopping.The Web has amplified the strengths and weaknesses of both traditional and low-cost carriers, said Joe Brancatelli, publisher of a Web site for business travelers, www.JoeSentMe.com. The simpler fare structure of the low cost carriers is, of course, simpler to present on the Internet.“If you’re United and you’ve got a whole range of fares that don’t make any sense, it’s not going to make any sense on a chart,” Mr. Brancatelli said. United would not comment.'"

It must now be reconciled with the broader drilling legislation passed by the House in June. Negotiations are likely to begin in September.“This bill will substantially reduce our reliance on foreign oil and gas,” said Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee and majority leader. “It brings more American energy to American consumers.”Some critics of the legislation said that it would be years before any oil or gas would be taken from the newly available sites and that the legislation fell short of addressing many of the country’s energy problems.'"
"'06-08-02,'1','Rob Carnell, an economist with ING, wrote: “With the Fed likely unsure about what to do given the combination of weak activity data and rising inflation, this decision may come down to the wire.”Stocks fell, a sign that investors are worried the Fed will find the inflation data discouraging and raise interest rates again. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index all fell.The Fed’s main measure of inflation was up 2.4 percent in June from the month a year earlier, the department reported, an increase not seen since September 2002. The central bank has said it would prefer a growth rate of 1 to 2 percent.Personal spending rose 0.4 percent in June after a 0.6 percent rise in May, the smallest increase this year.“It’s clear that the two sectors that have contributed the most to economic growth in the last year and a half — housing and consumer spending — are the two sectors that are showing the greatest weakness,” said Bernard Baumohl, executive director of the Economic Outlook Group.Mr. Baumohl noted that interest payments were taking a much bigger bite out of household income than they were two years ago, and were dragging down consumer spending.“As interest rates go up, that increases the debt service burden on households,” he said. “And I expect we’ll continue to see more of this in the second half of the year.”Nonmortgage interest payments now total $231.4 billion, up 25.7 percent since June 2004.The Commerce Department also reported that the national personal saving average remained negative in June. Saving as a percentage of disposable personal income has not been positive since March 2005.Some economists said the numbers did not bode well for consumer spending. “Wage growth is struggling to keep pace with inflation, which suggests that the growth of real consumer spending will remain tame over the coming quarters,” Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist with PNC Financial, said.If consumer spending slows enough, it would lower inflation and give the Federal Reserve some breathing room.“While inflation pressures still look a bit high, what you’ve got to remember is that when consumer spending and the housing sector weaken, it will have a very depressing effect on inflation,” Mr. Baumohl said. “Prices are going to be coming down; it’s just a matter of whether the Fed and the markets have the patience to see it.”In a separate report, the Commerce Department said yesterday that construction spending hit a record high in June, rising a stronger-than-expected 0.3 percent on increases in public and nonresidential building.

Given that criteria, Goldman’s growth plans make sense: Scorpio Partners estimates that Goldman ranks among the top five managers for individuals with $10 million or more, though the bank has been so quiet about the business that Scorpio says many of the world’s wealthy do not know that Goldman wants to manage their money.Goldman will reach smaller pocketbooks, too, through new joint ventures with dozens of local banks and family-run investment shops that will sell Goldman Sachs investment products under their own brand names. None of these joint ventures have been announced yet, Mr. Grip said, but there are several in negotiations.“The industry is in constant change, and the best way to innovate is to combine great raw materials and superior intellect,” he said.Goldman has expanded its private wealth assets more than 30 percent over the last four years, versus an industry average of growth of about 6.5 to 8 percent in that time, he said.Despite Goldman’s high profile, people in the industry say the real test will be whether the bank can get its hands on new customers’ assets affordably.“They certainly don’t have a bad brand name,” said Ray Soudah, the chairman of Millennium Associates, a consulting firm for private banks. The question is whether Goldman can mobilize its new network of private wealth managers to bring in new customers at a “reasonable cost,” he said. A majority of banks that have tried to build their own private banking networks have not succeeded, he said. “Hiring a few guys here and there will have a marginal effect,” Mr. Soudah noted.To get where it would like to be in private banking, Mr. Grip said Goldman was not ruling out buying a Swiss bank. Goldman opened a Zurich office in 1974 and formed a Swiss private bank in 1992, but has been very quiet about its operations there. Switzerland has more than 300 private banks, and the industry has long been considered ripe for consolidation, but the asking prices are steep.No matter how Goldman tries to increase its private banking business, it will never be a Swiss bank. And that is important to the wealthy of the Middle East, Russian businessmen and others who are drawn to the Swiss tradition of privacy. They may be worried about United States regulatory oversight, although Goldman says its Swiss bank is regulated by banking authorities in Switzerland.Still, the potential for international private banking is huge. People are growing wealthier, faster, in areas outside the United States than within it, according to a Merrill Lynch/Cap Gemini study. There are 8.7 million millionaires worldwide, and about 85,400 individuals with net financial assets worth more than $30 million, the study said. The percentage of millionaires grew by double digits in South Africa, India, South Korea and Russia in 2005, the survey said. In North America it grew by 6.9 percent.Goldman already has some private banking operations, though in its financial results it lumps these assets in with institutional money it manages, so getting a sense of their current size is difficult. In the United States, Goldman operates its private wealth management business through 13 regional offices, which have been undergoing some upheaval of their own, including staffing changes, as the bank revamps the business.To woo private banking clients, one thing Goldman may need to overcome is its own success in aggressively investing money for the firm itself. Mr. Grip acknowledged the firm’s reputation, but said that Goldman was just as capable of building a portfolio for conservative investors, one that would focus on “sleep-well money.”'"
"'06-08-02,'1','Blame a convergence of bad weather, the rising popularity of almonds among the health conscious and a rush among larger food manufacturers to grab a slice of the organic foods market.About 80 percent of the world’s almonds come from the Central Valley in California. The crop, of which organic almonds are just a sliver, has been hit hard by rain the past couple of years. If it rains during the small window when almond trees blossom, bees can’t pollinate the flowers very efficiently and there are fewer nuts.Last year’s crop was off by more than 8 percent, according to Marsha Venable, the communications coordinator for the Almond Board of California.Until the heat wave hit the Central Valley late last month, things were looking up for the almond crop this year. It is not clear what impact the heat will have on the Almond Board’s prediction that the 2006 harvest will be just over a billion pounds, or about 3 percent more than last year, Ms. Venable said.While some walnuts in the Central Valley were reported to have burned in last week’s heat, Ms. Venable said that there is no way to tell if almonds have been damaged until the tree-shaking begins, probably in September.Among American snackers, the almond is an increasingly popular nut. Although almonds can’t touch cashews, which 31 percent of people surveyed by the almond board last year picked as their favorite nut, for the first time they beat out peanuts for the No. 2 slot.Their popularity might be driven by a series of recent studies that suggest, among other things, that almond skins and their vitamin E provide a powerful antioxidant mix, and that almonds can help reduce cholesterol levels.Mix in the pressure from Asia and Western Europe, which buy large quantities of California almonds, and the small coops and food companies that championed the organic movement in the first place are out of luck.“It’s been very difficult,” said Annie Malka, the owner of Delicious Organics in North Miami Beach, where raw almonds now sell for $16 a pound. “Now everyone is into it.”'"

"'06-08-03,'1','So off I went to the Crutchfield Web site. I used pop-up menus to choose the car year, make and model, and presto: I got a list of equipment that’s designed to fit it.It didn’t take me long to find a Pioneer unit that seemed to have it all: GPS voice navigation, a huge 6.5-inch touch screen, CD player, AM-FM radio, and compatibility with satellite radio. Although I don’t drive enough to merit the fees, this unit is also compatible with XM’s new real-time traffic service, where the roads on the GPS navigation system actually change color to show you how congested they are.This device (the Pioneer AVIC-D2) goes for $1250, which ain’t cheap. But it sure looked sweet.Then I called the toll-free number just to be sure.I told the guy what kind of car it was, and within seconds, he was suggesting exactly the same Pioneer unit (and another one). Either this guy had an encyclopedic knowledge of cars, or he was using a really, really good database.In any case, he described this unit in unbelievable detail. He even mentioned that for an added fee, I could get an iPod adapter/charger for it, which I knew would make my wife’s day.He also gave me a little pep talk about considering installing this thing myself, just as my readers had suggested. He said it would probably take two or three hours, but that Crutchfield’s agents would be with me the whole way by phone(!), and that the company would send along its own, custom-written instructions.Sure enough: when the package arrived, there was Crutchfield’s installation manual, with the company’s “we’re here to help you” toll-free number printed in 60-point type on the first page.What are they, nuts!? They are actually *inviting* people to call them for free technical support? Don’t they have any idea how that idea will kill their revenue stream? Haven’t they learned anything from the computer industry?Now, this isn’t really a review of the Pioneer AVIC-D2, although I’m generally happy with it. The GPS navigation is as good as it gets, with spectacularly clear real-time maps and polished, mature software. The audio system is mostly fine—it’s really cool that the entire screen flips down and away from the dashboard to reveal the CD slot when you’re changing discs—but the audio controls are scattered and their operation is not what you’d call self-evident. (The most crushing disappointment is the iPod integration. Although the Pioneer unit can “see” the names of your playlists, albums and so on, it shows you only one name at a time on an otherwise empty screen. To view the name of the fourth album, for example, you have to hit the down arrow three times—why can’t you just see the complete list at once? Worse, the system truncates the names of your songs, albums and playlists, showing only the first few letters. Dumb!)No, this is actually a review of the company and its policies. The fact that 25 readers independently wrote to recommend Crutchfield tells me that this hyper-service-oriented approach has succeeded; the company has essentially cornered its market and generated a massive audience of rabid and repeat customers.Now, I’ll be honest: I didn’t wind up doing the installation myself. Once I saw that the job entailed opening up the dashboard and running wires, I wimped out and asked an experienced friend to help.But I still haven’t gotten over the sales rep’s confidence in me and his exhortation to give it a try. His phone tone essentially said: “Hey, since you’ve called us, you’re automatically one of my car buddies.” And his repeated invitations to call back for further hand-holding were so shocking, I’ll never forget the transaction. (I’ve called back twice, meanwhile, to ask questions about my Pioneer unit, and received expert, immediate answers both times.)Above all, I can’t help wondering why nobody else has questioned the wisdom of the current “go away, customer” attitude that prevails in the penny-pinching computer and software industries.That attitude will never generate repeat customers, will never build a cult of fans and will never turn a company into the Crutchfield of its industry.'"

"'06-08-03,'1','“Sprint’s management is neither executing well nor exhibiting any capital discipline,” Mr. Halpern wrote in a note to investors. Sprint Nextel, he continued, “has become a show-me company.”Sprint’s shares closed at $17.75, a drop of $2.38, or 11.82 percent. The company announced a stock buyback plan of $6 billion over 18 months, a move some analysts said could increase investor confidence.Paul Saleh, the company’s chief financial officer, said the tough quarter could be attributed to several causes, including continued challenges associated with joining the operations of Sprint and Nextel, which merged last August.The company has looked at the merger as an opportunity to streamline the company and focus it on mobility, reducing its emphasis on Sprint’s land-line business.Mr. Saleh said that during the transition, the company, distracted, failed to put as much marketing emphasis as it should have on the Nextel brand. “We put less emphasis on the Nextel brand at a time when we should have been a little more cautious about it,” he said.He said the company made strategic errors with the introduction of low-cost pricing plans aimed at attracting consumers who use fewer minutes and with the introduction of a plan that sold low-cost second phones for use in family plans.In both cases, Mr. Saleh said, the company wound up seeing a considerably higher level than expected of migration of its existing customers to the plans, which led to lower revenue. At the same time, the new plans did not attract as many new subscribers to Sprint Nextel as the company had projected, he said.“We anticipated getting a lift in new subscribers that would offset some of the migration,” he said. “We did not get as much of a lift as we expected.”Mr. Saleh said one way the company might address the issue was to raise some prices selectively, which would force up average subscriber revenue. The company will also consider raising the price of handsets on some lower-price plans to discourage excessive migration.An addition challenge for Sprint Nextel is that its churn rate — the level at which it loses subscribers each month — is 2.1 percent, above the industry average. That problem had plagued Sprint in recent years after it made an effort to attract credit-challenged customers who were more likely to default on payments, but Mr. Saleh said the problem, while still an issue, was being addressed.John Byrne, an analyst with Network Business Quarterly, said Sprint Nextel would continue to struggle until it better focuses on the core business of monthly subscribers. The company, he said, needs “a consistent set of easy to understand rate plans backed by strong customer service.”'"

"'06-08-03,'1','[Separately, the Israeli Army said Thursday morning that the air force launched airstrikes on 70 targets in southern Lebanon and Beirut overnight, Reuters reported.]The past two days had been relatively quiet, apparently in response to the announced pause in Israeli airstrikes. On Sunday, 156 rockets fell, the second-highest number.Helicopter-borne Israeli commandos penetrated some 60 miles into Lebanon in the middle of Tuesday night, striking a hospital financed by Iranian money in the Hezbollah stronghold of Baalbek, near the Syrian border. Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, the Israeli chief of staff, said that the commandos had focused on a “remote logistics base” operated by Hezbollah where “some of their leaders” were meeting and that Israeli troops captured 5 Hezbollah members and killed more than 10.In Lebanon, the speculation was that the raid was aimed at capturing a prominent local Hezbollah leader, Mohammad Yazbek, who is the personal representative of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Locals said his entourage had passed through before the raid. They said at least 15 civilians were killed during Israeli airstrikes providing cover to the commandos, including seven members of one family.Much of southern Lebanon was a landscape of destruction on Wednesday, with smoke rising from shelled villages. Israeli soldiers clawed less than four miles into Lebanon, meeting stiff resistance from guerrillas.[The Israeli military’s inquiry on the bombing of a building in the Lebanese village of Qana on Sunday that killed more than two dozen civilians admits a mistake, but charges that Hezbollah guerrillas had used civilians as human shields for their rocket attacks, The Associated Press reported, citing a statement issued early on Thursday. The statement summarizing the inquiry’s findings said Israel did not know there were civilians in the building. It said more than 150 rockets had been launched from Qana and the area around it since July 12, when the conflict began.]Mr. Olmert said in several interviews that the offensive was severely degrading Hezbollah’s military capacity. But in Lebanon, an expert on the militia said Mr. Olmert’s description of a traditional, formal military structure did not fit with the way Hezbollah was organized.“The command structure of Hezbollah — show me one,” said Timor Goksul, a longtime adviser to the United Nations peacekeepers in south Lebanon and now a university professor here. “They don’t work that way. There are three regional commands that have full autonomy, and under them districts and then cells in villages, with a maximum of 20 men. “They know their job,” he said. “Their uniforms, their weapons are in a cave somewhere. They do their jobs and then they’re home watching television.”Mr. Olmert said the Israeli attacks had isolated Hezbollah from the rest of the Lebanese population by inflicting widespread damage for which its radical tactics would be blamed. There was initial criticism by many Lebanese, but this appears to have subsided because of the havoc caused by the Israeli attacks. In an event that would have been unthinkable a few months ago, in this country where politics is locked into religious lines, the Maronite Catholic patriarch — the spiritual leader of the most pro-Western populace — convened a meeting this week of religious leaders of other communities, Shiite and Sunni Muslims and several varieties of Christians, resulting in a statement of solidarity and photographs in Wednesday’s newspapers. Their joint statement, condemning the Israeli “aggression,” hailed “the resistance, mainly led by Hezbollah, which represents one of the sections of society.”Even the Lebanese Army, which has stood apart from the battles, was taking casualties. An Israeli airstrike at a base near Sidon killed 3 Lebanese soldiers on Wednesday, for a total of 24 during the conflict.The negotiations at the United Nations focused on a proposal originating in Washington, according to a senior American official. France and the United States have been divided over whether a political settlement between Israel and Hezbollah should be set out before or after an international force is sent in. The two-resolution approach seems to offer a way of meeting both countries’ objectives by prescribing separate forces for separate moments.For the second time this week, the United Nations on Wednesday postponed a meeting of countries that might contribute troops to a new stabilization force in southern Lebanon. France had already announced it would not attend the session, scheduled for Thursday, saying it was too early to discuss the force.“It seems clear that it remains premature for such a meeting to be held because of the absence of an agreed political framework for ending the conflict,” said Ahmad Fawzi, a United Nations spokesman. “If you don’t have a mandate, how can you decide what kind of force you need?”The French resolution has until now been the subject of negotiations involving just Britain and the United States. The two other permanent Security Council members, China and Russia, and the 10 other Council members were given briefings on the measure on Tuesday.'"
"'06-08-03,'1','At the same time, his wife, Ann Huntress Lamont, has built a career as a highly regarded venture capitalist specializing in health care and information technology for the financial services industry. She probably earns millions of dollars a year, people familiar with her business said. In the second quarter of 2006, the firm, Oak Investment Partners, raised the largest venture capital fund ever, $2.5 billion, according to the National Venture Capital Association.Together, the Lamonts and their children are worth $90 million to $332 million, according to a 90-page disclosure form he filed with the United States Senate earlier this year. Only a small portion of that fortune includes his stake in Lamont Digital, with most appearing to come from family money and what his wife has brought in.In fact, that report shows that about $49 million to $161 million of those assets were held by his wife while his assets were worth $4 million to about $17 million. Together they held additional assets of about $26 million to $98 million. Assets attributed to their three teenage children were valued at $11 million to $56 million.Mr. Lamont comes from a long line of forebears who were highly gifted in business and used their money to endow professorships and buildings at many colleges and universities. When his great-grandfather, Thomas William Lamont, died in 1948, a New York Times editorial called him “one of the great financiers of his generation.”Mr. Lamont prefers not to talk about his background. “I’ve been blessed,” he will say, but beyond that he can turn testy. When asked about a scholarship he created at Harvard so a Bridgeport student could attend free, he bristled. “I haven’t really talked about that, have I?” he replied.Jonathan R. Zimbalist, a partner with Eureka Growth Capital in Philadelphia, who has a seat on Lamont Digital’s board because of his fund’s investment in the company, said he once worked at J. P. Morgan & Company and knew the Lamont family history.“He certainly doesn’t wear it on his sleeves and is not going around telling people,” he said. “But obviously, it’s nothing he can hide. It’s there.”In recent interviews with dozens of Connecticut voters, many said they knew little about Mr. Lamont except that he was rich. For some, his wealth was not a significant issue, but others said it raised concerns.“All I keep hearing about is how much money this guy has,” said Robert Sherris, 51, an auto mechanic from Bridgeport. “It does make me kind of wonder if I can trust him.”But Michael E. Morrell, assistant professor of political science at the University of Connecticut, questioned the effectiveness of Mr. Lieberman’s attacks, saying voters seemed more concerned about Mr. Lieberman’s support of the war and Bush administration policies.“The question of Lamont’s status as a millionaire, someone who may be out of touch with the average person, doesn’t get at the fundamental force that is behind Lamont’s campaign,” Professor Morrell said.For all of his family’s wealth, Mr. Lamont nonetheless appears to have built a lucrative business on his own.“None of his family members are shareholders, so you have to assume they didn’t put up money,” said Stephen M. Jenks, a managing partner at Capital Resource Partners of Boston, who also sits on Lamont Digital’s board. “He’s self-made.”After finishing prep school at Phillips Exeter Academy in 1972, Mr. Lamont attended Harvard and then ran a newspaper in Ludlow, Vt., for two years. After that, he enrolled in Yale University’s School of Management, where he studied entrepreneurship.Mr. Lamont went on to spend three years working at Cablevision, where he sold the company’s services to municipalities — the “miracle of bringing 30 channels” to their constituents, as he put it.He also met his wife, a graduate of Stanford University who had recently joined Oak Investment Partners, where she is a managing partner today. Soon, he was overseeing the start-up of Cablevision’s business in Connecticut and helped found News12, Cablevision’s local news service. Then, in 1984, he started Lamont Digital Systems.Initially, the company offered customers like apartment buildings an alternative to their local cable service. A few years later, he recalled in an interview, an MTV executive contacted him and asked him whether his company might be able to provide cable services to Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, N.H., which was unhappy with the local cable company.Jumping at the opportunity, Mr. Lamont recalled, he borrowed money from a bank based in Connecticut to pay for the construction of that first system. Using the cash generated from that deal and others, he was able, he said, to repay the loans and swing new deals, a process he called bootstrapping.Of those early touch-and-go days, he said, “Thank goodness my wife works, so she was able to help me out along the way.”To expand his business, he brought in outside institutional investors, like Capital Resource Partners in 1998 and Eureka Growth Capital in 2001.As a result, Mr. Lamont’s stake in the company’s common stock fell below 50 percent, according to people familiar with the company’s finances. The company has repaid all its debt, but those new investors, as preferred shareholders, are guaranteed certain payments before Mr. Lamont can realize much from the company. The arrangement helps to explain why Mr. Lamont valued his stake in the company on his Senate disclosure form conservatively, at $1 million to $5 million.All told, Mr. Lamont, who files his taxes separately from his wife, reported taxable income of $2.9 million last year, which included $1.7 million in capital gains and $546,000 in salary as chairman and chief executive.Through its Campus Televideo subsidiary, Lamont Digital still has the Franklin Pierce account and serves 175,000 subscribers on 135 campuses, including Pennsylvania State, Rutgers and U.C.L.A. More growth is possible, given that there are at least 2,000 residential college and university campuses in the nation, according to Peter F. Daly Jr., a former Lamont Digital executive.Lamont Digital typically threads coaxial cable through dormitories so students can get high-speed data services and cable offerings as seamlessly as they get electricity.Whether the company builds the system or just provides monthly service, the colleges pay the company directly. As a result, Lamont Digital gets thousands of customers without having to approach them or hound them for payment.The company has a second, smaller line of business involving 2,500 homes inside gated communities and master planned developments. But the company is tired of the huge capital investment required, as well as other difficulties, and is getting out of that business, Mr. Lamont said.This change in business strategy led to some layoffs, a touchy topic now that Mr. Lamont has positioned himself as the man who will represent working people in Washington. The number of employees dropped to about 40 today from a high of about 125. All have health care, but the company is not unionized.College students who get cable through his company appear to be getting a good deal. Local cable providers might charge them $30 to $50 a month per room for cable. Lamont Digital typically charges $6 a month per room, which is usually folded into the annual room-and-board fees. Between the gated homes and the college students, the company appears to take in about $20 million in yearly revenues.Company officials say they have not decided what will happen if Mr. Lamont wins the Senate race.The company cannot count Harvard or Yale among its customers, but it recently won a huge contract in the heart of Bush country. On Monday, it began wiring up Texas A&M University in College Station, Tex., just down the road from the presidential library of George Herbert Walker Bush.'"
"'06-08-03,'1','WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 — Border Patrol agents allowed undercover investigators carrying counterfeit documents to enter the United States repeatedly this year and on at least two instances allowed the investigators to enter without providing any documentation at all, a federal auditor said on Wednesday.The findings, from the Government Accountability Office, found that the border agents failed to question the authenticity of fake drivers’ licenses at nine United States border crossings with Mexico and Canada from Feb. 9 through May 24 of this year. In each instance, the undercover investigators claimed to be American citizens.“This vulnerability potentially allows terrorists or others involved in criminal activity to pass freely into the United States from Canada or Mexico with little or no chance of being detected,” said Gregory D. Kutz, a federal auditor for the accountability office, who testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday.The audit comes three years after the office uncovered identical security gaps when undercover investigators entered the United States at least 14 times using counterfeit drivers’ licenses and, in one case, an expired, altered United States diplomatic passport.During that investigation, however, border agents in New York and Florida stopped three undercover officials who were using expired and forged passports, drivers’ licenses or birth certificates. None were stopped this time.“Those G.A.O. investigators could have been known criminals, wanted fugitives, or even terrorists,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the Finance Committee chairman. “But they were just waived into our country. Frankly, it’s hard to believe that there has been so little progress in plugging this gaping security hole.”Jayson P. Ahern, an assistant commissioner at the United States Customs and Border Protection division of the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency would “take action to address the vulnerabilities identified by the recent G.A.O. investigation.”'"
"'06-08-03,'1','A federal agency ruled yesterday that the computer technology developer Rambus unlawfully monopolized markets for four memory chip technologies. The company’s shares declined as much as 30 percent.The ruling from the Federal Trade Commission puts at risk tens of millions of dollars in royalties that Rambus, which has no manufacturing facilities, earns from licensing its technology to other chip makers.“It’s definitely a big setback for the company,” said Daniel Amir, an analyst at W. R. Hambrecht. “It’s all downside in a way. When you’re losing a case against the government, you’re dealing with broad implications.”In a statement, the agency said that Rambus, “through a course of deceptive conduct,” was able to distort industry standards for a type of memory chip known as dynamic random access memory, or DRAM.That allowed the company to “engage in an anti-competitive ‘holdup’ of the computer memory industry,” the agency said.'"
"'06-08-03,'1','ZURICH, Aug. 2 — The Credit Suisse Group, the Swiss banking company, said on Wednesday that its second-quarter profit more than doubled, in part because of an unexpectedly large legal recovery.But the bank said it would cut 300 jobs in the United States in its asset management division and take a 152 million franc ($123 million) charge to realign the business.The chief financial officer, Renato Fassbind, said the job losses would result from an overhaul of the asset management unit and would come in areas where the bank lacked a strong market position.Mr. Fassbind did not disclose which employees faced a layoff, but said during a conference call that the decision was a result of focusing on growth areas.The realignment would save 100 million francs next year, the bank said.Credit Suisse earnings totaled 2.16 billion francs in the quarter, in contrast to 919 million francs a year ago, when unexpected legal provisions weighed on profit.'"
"'06-08-03,'1','“We spend a considerable amount of time addressing our players regarding their personal conduct and the N.C.A.A. rules,” Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops said in a statement. “They know exactly what we expect from them. Ultimately, they have to make right decisions. The same holds true for our boosters. When they do not, the consequences are serious, and we will not tolerate this behavior.”Kenny Mossman, the associate athletic director for communication, said the two players involved would retain their scholarships and not be dismissed from the university.The questionable payments to Bomar and Quinn were for jobs they had at Big Red Sports/Imports, a car dealership in Norman, Okla., ESPN.com reported. Calls to the dealership were referred to an Oklahoma City lawyer, Jeffrey Atkins, who did not return telephone messages left for him.Oklahoma’s national title aspirations were built around Bomar and tailback Adrian Peterson, who is considered a favorite to win the Heisman Trophy. The Sooners open the season on Sept. 2 against the University of Alabama at Birmingham.Bomar, 21, set a freshman single-season record at the school with 2,018 passing yards. His play improved as the season progressed, and he capped Oklahoma’s 8-4 season last year by passing for 229 yards and a touchdown in the Holiday Bowl.Last week at Big 12 media days in Kansas City, Mo., Stoops raved about Bomar’s potential.“He has so much skill and ability,” Stoops said. “I believe he’ll continue to develop that way and do a really good job with it.”Both Bomar and Quinn have brushes with the law. In May, Bomar pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of being a minor in possession of alcohol and was sentenced to six months’ probation. In November, Quinn faced a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of alcohol under the age of 21.Messages left for Bomar on his cellphone and for his father, Jerry Bomar, were not returned yesterday. Messages at the home of Quinn’s parents in Garland, Tex., were also not returned.Bomar took over the starting job last season after Paul Thompson started Oklahoma’s opener, a 17-10 loss to Texas Christian. Thompson was moved to receiver, the same position he was to play this season.Stoops is expected to move Thompson back to quarterback since he is the only player on the roster who has taken a snap in a Division I-A game. The other candidates to replace Bomar are the freshman Sam Bradford, the sophomore walk-on Hays McEachern and the sophomore Joey Halzle, a junior-college transfer who enrolled at Oklahoma in January and participated in spring practice.Halzle came to Oklahoma from California, where he threw for more than 2,000 yards last season at Golden West College. Teresa Halzle, the mother of Joey Halzle, said her son informed her of Bomar’s dismissal.“I feel badly for everybody involved,” she said in a telephone interview. “I don’t know what the kid did, but it’s unfortunate. People will get different opportunities now. It’s unfortunate for the program.”As Oklahoma’s players reported for summer camp yesterday, Bradford’s father, Kent, said his son’s cellphone was inundated with calls about Bomar’s situation. Many of the callers were Oklahoma players. Bradford, a top quarterback recruit out of Oklahoma City, would have been a likely candidate to sit out the season as a redshirt. Now he is a candidate to start.“His phone started going nuts, and everybody started calling him,” Kent Bradford said in a telephone interview. “It was very unexpected news. It’s a heck of way to start off fall practice.”'"
"'06-08-03,'1','“We’re really in a quagmire,” said Andrew M. L. Turay, the principal of Peace and Diversity Academy, one of the two Bronx high schools.Mr. Turay said he feared that hard-earned gains of the school’s first two years — attendance of 91 percent, a promotion rate of 83 percent — would be lost. “If we end up in trailers,” he said, “if and when it rains, if and when it snows, attendance is going to drop.”Peace and Diversity shared space in a wing in Herbert Lehman High School in the Bronx but has to leave and find a new home this year so the other small school can take over the space they had shared.The space squeeze comes at a critical time for the city’s small-schools movement, just after an initial group of schools achieved promising graduation rates better than the city average, and at a time when many small schools will have their first 12th-grade classes this fall. Many of these schools are now in their second locations; some are in a third, still waiting for a permanent home.City education officials say the space shortage is an inevitable result of their huge and hurried push to create more and better choices for students, especially in high school. Demographic shifts are also in play with more students in high school and fewer in middle grades.Officials note that the city has spurned no option in creating new schools — converting old factories and warehouses and even leasing space in office towers. City school buildings, they say, have never been used so efficiently.“We use the existing space better and better, which means there are fewer and fewer alternatives,” said Garth Harries, who leads the department’s Office of New Schools. Still, he said, officials believe they can find space for dozens more schools.Officials maintain that there is space available across the city, in some cases precisely where it is needed most, but that getting the classrooms can be difficult because principals rabidly protect their turf, at times lying about their needs.Since September 2003, the administration has created more than 170 small schools, with 48 scheduled to open this September. The small schools are typically designed to serve 432 students — 108 per grade — in order to build closer relationships between children and educators.In some cases, the shortage of space has prompted officials to order new schools to take fewer freshmen than had been planned. In other cases, principals lacking classrooms have had no choice but to cut back on courses.The city schools have dealt with overcrowding for decades. But the current problem is not about whether every child has a chair or an individual class is too big to manage. Rather, it is about whether entire schools get displaced or principals even have offices.Principals and parents said they did not doubt the city’s commitment to small schools, but complained of poor planning. Peace and Diversity, for example, has known since it opened in 2004 that it would outgrow its space at Herbert Lehman.Mr. Turay, parents, and officials from the Anti-Defamation League, the school’s community partner, had been nudging Chancellor Klein for months. They were repeatedly told not to worry.Eventually they were notified that they would share the old Public School 99 in the Bronx, at 1180 Rev. James A. Polite Avenue, with Metropolitan High, a small school that opened last year. Metropolitan’s students spent last year in trailers outside the building.The building, however, has long been occupied by nonprofit groups. The city has filed a lawsuit to evict them but the building also needs extensive renovations. Mr. Turay said many parents do not know the building will not be ready.Parents had hoped to keep the school at an old wing at Lehman but it was taken over by Renaissance High School of Musical Theater and Technology, another small school. Even there, space was tight and Peace and Diversity has added only 75 students a year instead of 108.Sometimes, parents battle ferociously, as at the New Explorations Into Science Technology and Math school, known as NEST, on the Lower East Side. Parents sued to stop a new charter school from moving into their building.The administration switched course. And the charter school, Ross Global Academy, will instead occupy the basement of the department headquarters, displacing City Hall Academy, a special civics program for children from around the city.But even as he gave up — for now — plans to add more students to the NEST building, Chancellor Klein removed NEST’s principal, accusing her of lying and other misconduct in her efforts to prevent the Ross school from moving in.Before opting for space at NEST, the founder of Ross, Courtney Sales Ross, had been shown space on the top floor of P.S. 147 on Bushwick Avenue in the remote eastern reaches of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, across from a housing project.Ms. Ross rejected that space. But John Elwell, the director of Replications Inc., a nonprofit group that is founding a new specialized high school called Brooklyn Latin, quickly snatched it up, afraid there would be no place else to put the school.Similarly, the instant a space seems available, city officials seize it. One such moment came late last year when the Boys Choir of Harlem, after years of management problems, was evicted from Choir Academy, a public school in East Harlem.Choir Academy quickly became a possible site for Manhattan Theater Lab High School, a small school that opened in 2004, and needed to leave its original building in Harlem to let other schools there grow.But those plans fell through. And in June, school officials decided to put Theater Lab in the Martin Luther King Jr. building, near Lincoln Center. The five small schools already there were not told until mid-July and a small uproar has ensued.“Consultation is supposed to take place before decisions are made,” said Brenda St. Clair, the parent association president at Manhattan Hunter Science High School, one of the five. In the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the King school faces the challenge of housing six small schools. King is one of 22 campuses for which the city has developed master plans to help small schools co-exist. Although no one disputes that there are empty classrooms in the King building, Ms. Clair said other resources were tight. “The gym is too small for the five schools that are there,” she said. “We don’t have a centralized library. We don’t have enough technology.”In rancorous negotiations in June, the five principals worked out plans to share the gym, cafeteria and science labs. The principals have not yet been able to meet about how a sixth school will change those plans.“We understand it’s not a popular decision,” said Mr. Harries of the Education Department. “But we are doing everything we can to engage the principals to make sure it’s an easier situation.”Ms. St. Clair, however, said parents would fight. “We don’t concede the point that it’s a done deal,” she said. Deputy Mayor Dennis M. Walcott said that with space tight, the city would have to work closely with local communities on a case-by-case basis, until new schools are built.If work finished on time, the city would add 2,500 classroom seats in September and 3,200 seats by the 2007-8 academic year. But it is not until 2008-9 that the city’s ambitious capital plan will provide major relief with the expected addition of nearly 14,000 seats.“After ’08-’09 this is not even a discussion,” Mr. Walcott said.'"
"'06-08-03,'1','Pfizer may face generic competition to its top-selling drug Lipitor a year earlier than analysts expected after a federal appeals court invalidated one of the company’s patents.The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington upheld a lower court’s finding that a planned generic copy by Ranbaxy Laboratories would infringe a patent protecting Lipitor through March 2010. The court invalidated a second patent on the drug that expires in June 2011.The Lipitor cholesterol pill had sales of $12.2 billion last year. Analysts had projected that the drug would not have competition from cheaper generic versions until June 2011. Pfizer projected last month that sales of Lipitor would reach $13 billion this year.“If they lose 14 months, that’s 14 months of lost revenue for Lipitor,” Anthony Butler, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York, said. “On that assumption, the value would be about 35 cents a share.”Stock in Pfizer, which is based in New York, fell 38 cents, to $25.61 a share.Peter Richardson, Pfizer’s associate general counsel, said the ruling was based on a “technical defect” in the patent that the company would seek to change. The company might also ask the court to reconsider that aspect of the ruling, he said in a statement.Jay R. Deshmukh, vice president of intellectual property for Ranbaxy, said in a statement that the company was “evaluating our options” on the portion of the ruling that it lost.The company, based in Gurgaon, India, said it would have the only generic competitor to Lipitor for six months as a reward for being the first to challenge the medicine’s patents. The court, applying a standard it set in an unrelated case in February, said the 2011 Lipitor patent was invalid because the wording was inconsistent in what it covered.'"
"'06-08-03,'1','LOS ANGELES, Aug. 2 (AP) — A state court jury here found Merck & Company not liable Wednesday for causing an elderly man’s heart ailments after he took the painkiller Vioxx.After deliberating several hours, the jury of 12 ruled that Merck was not negligent, that it did not conceal information and that the drug did not cause Stewart Grossberg’s health problems.Mr. Grossberg, 71, had sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well $214,000 for medical bills.Merck argued that Vioxx had no role in his heart problems.Afterward, its general counsel, Kenneth C. Frazier, said in a statement: “Merck is pleased with the jury verdict. Today’s outcome demonstrates, again, why we will defend these cases on a case-by-case basis.”The drug maker potentially faces as many as 16,000 lawsuits involving Vioxx, which it withdrew in September 2004 after a study found that it increased the risk of heart attacks among patients taking it for 18 months or more. Merck has now won five Vioxx cases, including one last month in New Jersey, and has lost three. Another trial began this week in federal court in New Orleans.'"
"'06-08-03,'1','Mobile dog grooming units have mushroomed in the past 10 years, with dozens of such businesses in Los Angeles, one of the first cities to offer them as an alternative to traditional pet salons, where a smattering of dogs in recent years have been killed by overly hot hair dryers.Mr. Ogden said he chose the spa theme to differentiate himself from grooming vans, many of them owned by franchises, that offer just cleaning and clipping.Dogs, as it turns out, are more lucrative than cop shows.“Ten years ago, this business wouldn’t have worked because people didn’t care about their dogs the way they do now,” said Mr. Ogden, who used to rescue pigeons in his youth, as he prepared his van, which is fully appointed with a bath, mobile grooming table and plastic containers filled with cotton swabs, shampoos and bows. “Dogs have become like children now. People want the best for them.”The advantages he offers over pet-store grooming, he says, are that animals get individual treatment, rather than sitting in a mass of cages under a giant blow-dryer, and there is no dragging the dog away from home. His van offers a gentle experience for a grooming-averse dog, he said, with extras, like nail polish (“for special occasions”) and hair dye, if an owner craves a dog with a pink tail for Easter.“Some dogs, when they hear my truck, just come running,” said Mr. Ogden, as Buck, a lumbering bull mastiff owned by the music producer whose assistant is romantically involved with the dog walker of the rock star, also a client, hopped in the van.Buck, whose snout alone dwarfs the entire body of Golly Gee, offered up his paw for a gentle clip, and stared expectantly at the tub.As Mr. Ogden rubbed him with soap and the Jacuzzi pump doled out its stuff, Buck licked at the air with pleasure, and sat slack jawed through his paw massage.“Remember, this is a dog that head-butted his way through a plate glass window because he didn’t like the gardener,” Mr. Ogden said proudly.Buck got a kiss on the head, a sniff test of sorts, (“Because that is exactly what is going to happen when they get in the house”) and then it was Moose’s turn.A rescued dog hampered by fear and distrust, Moose needed to be muzzled for his clipping. (Mr. Ogden said he had never been bitten, but he said he refused to groom dogs who snarl at him. He also does not do poodles with a show clip, which requires elaborate styling.)Mr. Ogden’s phone rang. A client going out of town would be leaving a picture with the housekeeper of how she would like her Labradoodle (part Labrador retriever, part poodle) to be trimmed.Next stop: Ms. Bergen’s home in a gated area of Beverly Hills, where the mailbox is in the shape of a dog. Dickles the basset hound was delivered for his weekly bathing, and later Phyllis, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel mix, whose eyes flickered with tension as Mr. Ogden carefully blew out each strand of her hair so as not to spook her.“She really is the princess,” he said of Phyllis, not Ms. Bergen, who, as it turned, out was very nice when she greeted Mr. Ogden and looked swell in a polo shirt.In the dogs-are-like-their-owners category, Mr. Ogden said, people who do not bother to comb their own hair also neglect the grooming of their dogs. Likewise, clients who have problems with respecting personal space have dogs with the same.People whose pets are farmed out to the help, he said, are left with lonely dogs that look forward to his visits.Anyone feeling skeptical about Mr. Ogden’s devotion to animals would be moved by the gentle attention he gave to the ears of Kodiac, an aging golden retriever whose many operations and arthritis have rendered him unable to hop into the van.Mr. Ogden bathed him in the front lawn of his owner’s home in Beverly Park, whispering soft words of comfort.“I have lost a few dogs to old age,” Mr. Ogden said. “It definitely hurts. You wash a dog every week for two years, there definitely is a bond.”'"

"'06-08-03,'1','Rather than close the business that his father had started in 1961, Mr. Ayer turned to an alternative that most small-business owners prefer to avoid: an asset-based loan from a commercial lender.Asset-based lenders use a company’s assets as collateral. The loans to distressed small companies can be $50,000 to $1.5 million, and because the lenders are willing to bet on a company’s assets as collateral, they embrace the very risk that banks avoid.After providing the loan, the asset-based lender typically takes control of a company’s accounts receivable (money owed by its customers) and all invoices are paid to the lender rather than the company. As the payments come in, the lender holds back part of the money in escrow — 20 percent is a typical amount — to pay down the loan. The lender gives the remainder to the company. If customers are late with payments, the company pays a fee to the lender.Asset-based lending is not a new option for small businesses. The Commercial Finance Association, a trade association of such lenders, has 256 members and has been around since 1944. But while these lenders have saved thousands of companies with few financing alternatives, salvation comes at a steep price.Mr. Ayer, who received asset-based financing from Systran Financial, a division of Textron, is paying 1.25 percent over the prime rate for the loan and that, along with the various nonnegotiable fees, are costing the company about $200,000 a year. “It is much more expensive than a standard bank relationship,” he said.But while the costs are high, small-business owners strapped for financing are grateful for alternatives other than borrowing from relatives, using numerous credit cards with far higher interest charges, or simply shutting the business.For most entrepreneurs and business owners, the demand for capital comes quickly and leaves little time for the lengthy process of a bank loan. Most small companies do not have the means to hire accountants who can create slick financial presentations and business plans. Start-ups, for example, often find themselves in dire need of capital with few options. Venture capital firms are an option but often demand large equity stakes that dilute the entrepreneur’s ownership of the business.“You can put more money in yourself, but if your business is on the rocks, it is hard to raise money at a decent valuation,” said Thomas C. Tremblay, president of Guardair, a small industrial tool manufacturer in Chicopee, Mass. “If you go to the venture guys, you might have to give away the company and you don’t want to do that.”Alternative financing companies have grown in popularity and the industry’s rise has attracted a raft of entrants. The Commercial Finance Association counts among its members not just asset-based lenders but also inventory-based lenders, large and small independent finance companies, corporate subsidiaries like GMAC and GE Credit, and even business credit units of domestic and foreign banks. Bruce H. Jones, the executive director of the association, estimates that its members have more than $400 billion in loans outstanding this year, up from around $250 billion five years ago.Mark Belzowski, chief financial officer of VitalStream Holdings Inc., a streaming media technology company in Irvine, Calif., said: “They are an important part of the financing chain. When you really need the money, you do what you can.”Several years ago, VitalStream was a struggling start-up and found itself in need of cash. It turned to the Boston Financial and Equity Corporation, which provides asset-based lending and equipment financing. VitalStream arranged for several million dollars’ worth of equipment lease lines with Boston Financial.“At the time, we weren’t in a position to go to a bank and say, ‘Here’s what we want,’ ” Mr. Belzowski said. “Boston Financial was expensive but we were a struggling company and we survived a difficult funding period because of them.”Deborah Monosson, chief executive of Boston Financial, a commercial lender founded by her father in 1968, said: “None of my clients are profitable when they come to me. I like seeing them succeed. VitalStream won’t come back to us. They are bankable at this point.”Alternative financing allowed John Ovens to make a winning bid for Air Courier, a specialty courier service based in Atlanta, when the company went on the market in 2001. As the only bidder for the company, Mr. Ovens was pursuing equity financing, but the process became bogged down and allowed several other bidders to emerge. Faced with an anxious seller who was about to drop his bid, Mr. Ovens turned to the Presidential Financial Corporation, an asset-based lender in Atlanta. As he began to work with Presidential, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 brought Air Courier’s business as well as the deal to a halt.“Presidential didn’t back out of the deal, even with 9/11,” Mr. Ovens said. He was able to close the deal, though he acknowledges that the costs are high. Air Courier pays 2.5 percent above the prime rate for its loan, plus a management fee.“It costs us about $150,000 a year more than going through traditional financing,” Mr. Ovens said. “In 2005, we paid Presidential $365,000 in interest and fees. But we own the company outright and we manage it how we want to. There are no equity partners telling us what to do.”Mr. Ovens says that this independence is the reason Air Courier has more than doubled in size, to $38 million in revenue, since 2001.“We could move in another direction now,” Mr. Ovens says, referring to his financing relationship with Presidential. “But I haven’t seen a traditional bank that would give us the flexibility to run with the business.”Ayer Sales is thriving again and Mr. Ayer expects to secure a new round of bank financing by the fourth quarter. He says his experience with Systran has been positive, even with the steep cost of the loan. “It certainly instills a level of fiscal discipline,” he explains. “And it was a small price to pay to keep the business going.”'"
"'06-08-03,'1','Northwest Airlines has asked the court overseeing its bankruptcy reorganization to block a possible strike by its flight attendants, an airline spokesman said yesterday.In a court filing late Tuesday, Northwest asked the federal bankruptcy judge, Allan L. Gropper, to prevent any strike or job action against it by the Association of Flight Attendants. The union threatened Monday to strike as early as Aug. 15 after the airline terminated its contract and imposed new terms.In the filing, the carrier said, “A strike by the A.F.A. would threaten the continued viability of Northwest’s reorganization, cause severe disruption to Northwest’s customers and interfere with interstate commerce.”Northwest filed the request against the union and 16 of its leaders. The flight attendants gave notice on Monday that they were prepared to act through a variety of means, including a strike, which Northwest argues would be illegal. A hearing on the matter is scheduled next Wednesday. Specialists disagree on the legality of a strike against the bankrupt airline.The union’s general counsel, David Borer, said, “We will see them in court and we will aggressively defend our members’ right to strike.”Northwest scrapped the previous contract and imposed terms that provided $195 million in labor savings. The contract’s termination, which had bankruptcy court approval, came after union members rejected a tentative labor agreement.Northwest filed for bankruptcy protection last September, saying it needed $1.4 billion in total labor savings.'"
"'06-08-03,'1','CINCINNATI, Aug. 2 (AP) — The Procter & Gamble Company, the household products giant, said on Wednesday that its fourth-quarter profit increased 36 percent, as higher prices helped bolster revenue.The results beat analysts’ expectations and the company’s shares rose 4.2 percent.Quarterly profit was $1.9 billion, or 55 cents a share, compared with $1.39 billion, or 52 cents a share, in the period a year ago. The latest results include a dilution of 6 to 8 cents because of the acquisition of the Gillette Company.Revenue climbed 25 percent, to $17.84 billion, from $14.26 billion in the period a year ago.Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 8 percent.Analysts, on average, predicted a profit of 54 cents on sales of $17.5 billion, according to Thomson Financial.“In general, the core business is doing quite well,” said an analyst with Edward Jones & Company, Patrick Schumann. “Some of the concerns on Gillette, we believe, have been overdone. We continue to think the combination of the two is good long-term.”Sales results were helped by price increases across several segments and the addition of the Gillette business acquired late last year.'"
"'06-08-03,'1','THE HAGUE, the Netherlands, Aug. 2 (AP) — Cardinal Johannes Willebrands, a major figure in the Roman Catholic Church’s efforts to improve relations with other Christians and with Jews, died Tuesday in Denekamp, in the eastern Netherlands. He was 96.Cardinal Willebrands was known at the Vatican as The Flying Dutchman for his travels to promote Christian unity. As president of the Vatican’s Commission for Religious Relations With the Jews, he long sought to improve troubled relations between the faiths. He was mentioned as a possible candidate for the papacy at the two conclaves of 1978.In the 1980’s, he called for more Jewish teachers at Catholic theological institutes to expand the study of Judaism.Cardinal Willebrands was named president of the Vatican’s Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity in 1969 and held the post for 20 years. It was renamed the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity by Pope John Paul II in 1988.“I especially value him as a bishop who before, during and after the Second Vatican Council worked energetically and expertly for the restoration of Christian unity,” said Cardinal Adrianus Simonis, who succeeded Cardinal Willebrands as archbishop of Utrecht and chairman of the Dutch Bishops Conference.One of nine children of a Dutch auctioneer, Cardinal Willebrands became a priest in 1934. Considered a gifted student, he was sent to Rome to study at the Angelicum Pontifical University. He was named a bishop in 1964 by Pope Paul VI.'"
"'06-08-03,'1','Network Live, a venture started after Live 8 by America Online and other partners, has recorded 55 shows by acts like the Foo Fighters and KT Tunstall for distribution online and through other channels. AT&T, working with a Los Angeles marketing company, has set up a Web site — the Blue Room — and purchased exclusive rights to Webcast music festivals like this weekend’s Lollapalooza in Chicago.In Hollywood 40-minute sets by unsigned bands are Webcast virtually every night from a club called the Gig. A few miles away in Burbank, Center Staging — which operates a complex of practice stages — is trying a new twist, Webcasting video clips of big-name acts still rehearsing.Their plans are taking shape amid a slew of efforts by individual bands to post live film on YouTube — which also has become a popular forum for fans posting music videos and live performances recorded from television, alongside other copyrighted material. In some cases major record labels are posting clips directly: Atlantic Records has been developing a series of new clips, including live material, that it intends to post there.The Internet’s reach and instant distribution, coupled with the declining cost of producing video content, mean that fans and live performers have more access to each other than ever.“There’s an opportunity to say: ‘Didn’t make it to the show? That’s O.K.,’ ” said Michael Rapino, chief executive of Live Nation, the world’s biggest concert promoter, which is wiring 120 of its performance sites to record concerts for the Internet and other outlets. “That’s something we haven’t been able to say for the last 20 years.”Mr. Rapino said Webcasts figured prominently in his plan to expand into online commerce, bundling tickets and T-shirts with video content and other material and selling it to bands’ most avid fans.Within the music industry, however, there is still widespread debate about whether a thicket of copyright and contractual issues will slow or prevent some of the new enterprises from taking off. Most record deals provide a label exclusive rights to any recordings made by an artist under contract, including live performances. In addition to negotiations with labels, producers of Web concerts must contend with demands of performers who may fret over the quality of productions recorded on the fly, among other concerns.That means the roster of acts that will appear on Webcasts remains spotty. Fans who could not attend the freewheeling Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, held in Manchester, Tenn., in June, can still see Tom Petty’s appearance online, but not the one by Radiohead.In some cases bands are toying with ideas like selling subscriptions of their Webcasts to their die-hard fans. But others say that turning such access into a premium service would waste the opportunities of Internet distribution.Kevin Wall, chief executive of Network Live, said bands should make it easy for casual fans to discover them. “Give them a taste of what you’re doing,” he said. “They’ll then come and buy tickets.” Network Live’s bigger shows are viewed as many as 350,000 times in their first 24 hours online and up to 10 times that during the following two weeks.Plans to wring cash from live-music Webcasts have suffered setbacks before. In the late 90’s House of Blues Entertainment, owner of the name-brand music club chain, gambled on selling Webcasts from its clubs, as did a handful of rivals. But in addition to the scarcity of broadband-connected computers at the time, the chain was unable to find many fans willing to pay the asking price — $4.99 per show — at a time when consumers had little experience with online video.These days, however, the popularity of live-music online — licensed and otherwise — has prompted more players to stake their claims. In April the world’s biggest music company, Universal Music Group, reached a deal with Center Staging and its rehearsals.com Web site to allow Webcasts of Universal artists from its rehearsal stages.Other music companies are taking their own steps to seize on fans’ interest in Web concerts and video. Sony BMG Music Entertainment said in June it had hired a new company, Brightcove, to sell advertising to run on the music company’s online music players, which show music videos and live performances on Web sites under the label’s control.One big question as Webcasts gain traction: What role, if any, will be carved out for fans who take their own pictures and “bootleg” video at concerts?Erik Flannigan, general manager of America Online’s music, film and television content, said that at a big arena performance these days “20,000 people walk through the door.” He added: “How many people who went to that show walked out with some kind of media captured? They called someone, they took a photo. Why not harness that and turn it into something?”One idea being bounced around is the creation of online fan forums, where music lovers could post pictures and interact with one another after a show, said Jim Cannella, national director of corporate partnerships for House of Blues. “People want to be heard and they want to develop a community of people that have similar interests,” he said. (House of Blues is being acquired by Live Nation.)But the rights issues surrounding fans’ use of an artists’ likeness or image could still prove daunting. The thicket of rights involved in Webcasts is one reason why some believe there are more opportunities with underground talent. Peter O’Fallon, a film and television director and a co-owner of the Gig, said he was planning a series of new offerings from its Web site, livefromthegig.com.The club already Webcasts most of its concerts. Performers agree to give the club ownership of the video recordings in perpetuity in exchange for the chance to be promoted on the site. Mr. O’Fallon said the viewership runs around 1,000 people per night. Bands can also sell their merchandise on the Web site, and the Gig now plans to add features like a service selling digital downloads of bands’ songs.Mr. O’Fallon added that he tells the fledgling acts who play the club to “come prepared — people are watching.”'"
"'06-08-03,'1','Yesterday’s hearing, like much of the swirl of events surrounding Mrs. Astor, played out largely behind closed doors.The private conference, in which the lawyers discussed financial and medical documents in the case, was held in the judge’s chambers, with no notification to reporters, who were waiting in court with their lawyers to ask the judge to make the file about Mrs. Astor’s condition open to the public and the press.As the news media waited, however, court officers quietly steered Anthony Marshall, his wife, Charlene, and various lawyers in the case to the judge’s chambers through a hallway and a back door, where they were joined by a court reporter who transcribed the proceedings. Anthony and Charlene Marshall later left the judge’s chambers through a back door once again.In a subsequent public part of the hearing, the judge, Justice John E. H. Stackhouse, refused a request by lawyers for The New York Times, The New York Post, The Associated Press and The Daily News to unseal Mrs. Astor’s file.Instead, he granted a request by lawyers for Mrs. Astor’s grandson for more time to respond to the request by news organizations, and he set a hearing date of Aug. 28.Mr. Ely, a butler and estate manager at Mrs. Astor’s Westchester home for eight years, was fired in January 2005. But he was rehired last week under the direction of Annette de la Renta, Mrs. Astor’s longtime friend, who had submitted an affidavit supporting Philip Marshall’s lawsuit.

"'06-08-03,'1','A French court agreed to grant bankruptcy protection to Eurotunnel after creditors failed to reach an 11th-hour agreement on restructuring nearly $12 billion in Eurotunnel’s debt. The ruling caps nearly two decades of financial woes for the company, which has been unable to lure the volume of passenger and freight traffic envisioned when digging began in 1987. The Paris Commercial Court granted Eurotunnel a six-month reprieve from interest and principal payments on the debt, allowing management a last chance to negotiate a deal with bondholders and avert liquidation. Traffic will continue to pass through the 30-mile tunnel, which connects the coastal towns of Folkestone, England, and Calais, France. “The safeguard procedure decided upon today is the final stage of a consensual negotiation,” Jacques Gounon, Eurotunnel’s chairman, said. “I am convinced that we now have the conditions necessary to achieve a financial restructuring for Eurotunnel within the time allowed.”'"

"'06-08-03,'1','Yesterday’s hearing, like much of the swirl of events surrounding Mrs. Astor, played out largely behind closed doors.The private conference, in which the lawyers discussed financial and medical documents in the case, was held in the judge’s chambers, with no notification to reporters, who were waiting in court with their lawyers to ask the judge to make the file about Mrs. Astor’s condition open to the public and the press.As the news media waited, however, court officers quietly steered Anthony Marshall, his wife, Charlene, and various lawyers in the case to the judge’s chambers through a hallway and a back door, where they were joined by a court reporter who transcribed the proceedings. Anthony and Charlene Marshall later left the judge’s chambers through a back door once again.In a subsequent public part of the hearing, the judge, Justice John E. H. Stackhouse, refused a request by lawyers for The New York Times, The New York Post, The Associated Press and The Daily News to unseal Mrs. Astor’s file.Instead, he granted a request by lawyers for Mrs. Astor’s grandson for more time to respond to the request by news organizations, and he set a hearing date of Aug. 28.Mr. Ely, a butler and estate manager at Mrs. Astor’s Westchester home for eight years, was fired in January 2005. But he was rehired last week under the direction of Annette de la Renta, Mrs. Astor’s longtime friend, who had submitted an affidavit supporting Philip Marshall’s lawsuit.

"'06-08-04,'0','On Monday, Apple’s Steve Jobs will take the stage at the company’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). And he’ll have a lot to show and tell about.Apple has already said that he’ll take the wraps off of Mac OS X 10.5 (“Leopard”), an operating-system upgrade whose significance seems greater because of its proximity to the release of Microsoft’s Windows Vista.Apart from that announcement, nobody knows what Apple will be showing at WWDC. But Apple’s innovation engine never sleeps, and it’s been at least a couple of months since anything new emerged, making me suspect that there will be lots of pent-up products on display next week.Further evidence comes in the form of two leaks. First, somebody snapped a photo of a banner at Apple’s booth, chock-a-block with photos of new Apple products. The most intriguing one is a 64-bit Power Mac.Second, somebody either leaked or “leaked” this list of new Mac OS X 10.5 features. I use the quotes in case the list is fake — this is the same rumors Web site that “leaked” Apple’s “plasma TV” last January—but the list feels genuine to me.

"'06-08-04,'0','You could say that the new 3-D animated film “Barnyard” is utterly strange, though if you were wearing a bushy mustache and a polka-dot bow tie, you might feel compelled to say that it’s udderly strange. Aimed at wee ones who like their colors bright and their stories elemental, this feature animation from the writer and director Steve Oedekerk centers on a community of barnyard animals who, under the distracted care of a vegan farmer, walk, talk and party down like human beings. On occasion a few of the male “cows,” as the film insists on calling them, hotwire the neighbor’s car, cranking the tunes with their mittenlike hooves.The biggest party animal is Otis (voiced by Kevin James), the youngster who shirks the responsibility shouldered by his dad, Ben (Sam Elliott), the barnyard’s protector. Like most of the farm’s denizens, Otis walks on his back legs when the humans aren’t looking, which affords a fine view of his large pink udder with its four restless teats. The udder looks a lot like the base of a plumber’s plunger and the teats look exceptionally friendly, like chubby little fingers waving toodle-oo. They’re so friendly that it’s hard not to stare at them and wonder what would happen if you milked Otis, which proves both distracting and something of a relief, since there isn’t all that much else in this film to think about.Well, there is one thing: like too many animated films aimed at children, “Barnyard” embraces stereotypes that generally no longer cut it in adult films, and for good reason. There’s the noisy hag of a female neighbor (Maria Bamford), a type that should have died with “Bewitched,” though more discomforting are the ethnically and racially coded voices, like that of Pip (Jeff Garcia), the funny sidekick mouse with the Mexican accent. There is also the voice of wisdom that often belongs to Morgan Freeman and here is expressed by Danny Glover as, sigh, Miles the Mule; the abrasively sassy cow Bessy, voiced by the abrasively screechy Wanda Sykes; and the fat rat festooned with gold that raps like Shaggy.Don’t the filmmakers know there are children watching — and listening?“Barnyard” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There are scenes of cow- and people-tipping, along with some mean coyotes.Written and directed by Steve Oedekerk; animation production by Omation Animation Studios; edited by Billy Weber and Paul D. Calder; music by John Debney; produced by Mr. Oedekerk and Paul Marshal; released by Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies. Running time: 88 minutes.WITH THE VOICES OF: Kevin James (Otis), Courteney Cox (Daisy), Sam Elliott (Ben), Danny Glover (Miles), Wanda Sykes (Bessy), Andie MacDowell (Etta) and Jeff Garcia (Pip).'"

"'06-08-04,'0','For those still clinging to the notion that the United States is divided into Red and Blue, Nascar and Hollywood would seem to dwell on opposite sides of the cultural divide. “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby” is hardly the first movie to challenge this simple-minded view of American popular culture — see also “Herbie: Fully Loaded,” “The Dukes of Hazzard” and of course “Cars” — but it does an admirably thorough job of debunking it.After all, movies (and movie fans) have always had a soft spot for whining engines and screeching tires. But these days the deeper bond between auto racing and popular moviemaking lies in a shared passion for corporate sponsorship. The vehicles in “Talladega Nights” — which was made with the cooperation of Nascar — are covered with logos and brand names, and the movie itself may break new records for product placements per frame.It’s all in fun of course. As a good-hearted spoof of the folkways of stock-car racing, the movie is happy to mock the sport’s eagerness to sell prime uniform and chassis space to sponsors like Perrier, Wonder Bread and Old Spice. It also is tickled at the eating habits of its fast-driving characters, who wash down Domino’s Pizza and Kentucky Fried Chicken with Coca-Cola and Budweiser and, when they want a high-end night out, head for the nearest Applebee’s. You can be sure that all these companies paid handsomely for the privilege of such lampooning, which even extends to the movie’s single funniest joke, a suppertime blessing brought to you by PowerAde.Really, though, the brand that powers this ragged, intermittently uproarious fusion of sketch-comedy goofing and driving around in circles is Will Ferrell, who wrote the screenplay (with Adam McKay, the director) and served as an executive producer, in addition to running around on a race track in his underpants. He does a lot more than that, needless to say, but Mr. Ferrell’s willingness to strip down to his skivvies is one of his trademarks.It is also a rare movie-star display of solidarity with those American men who, whether out of laziness or principle, disdain sunlight, proper nutrition, body-hair maintenance and abdominal exercise. Part of Mr. Ferrell’s appeal is surely that he is one of them. O.K., one of us.'"
"'06-08-04,'0','But the key issue, analysts said, is whether the investigation taints Apple’s visionary leader and chief executive, Steven P. Jobs.“The No. 1 question we get from investors is, Is Steve Jobs in trouble?” said Shaw Wu, an analyst for American Technology Research. “Our best assessment is, ‘No.’ ”Since he returned to Apple in 1997, Mr. Jobs has never been a member of the board’s compensation committee, Mr. Wu noted. And Mr. Jobs does not seem to have benefited from stock-options irregularities, Mr. Wu concluded. Based in his review of eight years of Apple’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Wu said, “We feel pretty strongly that Steve Jobs is not liable.”Investors’ initial concerns about the Apple disclosure seemed to abate in the course of the day. After falling as much as 9 percent before noon, Apple shares rebounded in the afternoon, closing off less than 2 percent, down $1.29 a share, to $68.30.In its S.E.C. filing today, Apple gave no hint about the “additional evidence of irregularities.” In June, the company did say that one of the stock-option grants being scrutinized was to Mr. Jobs. The company did not specify the grant, but the big one to Mr. Jobs during the period under inquiry was for 10 million shares, effective Jan. 12, 2000.The company announced the option grant to Mr. Jobs on Jan. 19, and the options were priced at $87.19 a share, the lowest closing price in the two months up to Jan. 12. By Jan. 19, Apple’s stock price had risen to $106.56.In those days, it was not uncommon for companies to report stock-option grants several days or weeks after a grant was made. Since 2002, companies have been required by law to report stock-option grants within two days.Compensation experts say the lag in reporting Mr. Jobs’s grant raised questions about Apple’s disclosure practices and left open the door for backdating the price to a lower level, which makes the option much more valuable if a company’s share price rises.More than 80 companies have disclosed that their options practices are under review by federal investigators. Those inquiries mainly center on the backdating of the price at which options could be exercised. That practice appears to have been fairly common among technology companies during the stock-market boom years of the late 1990’s.But Apple has said that the options grant to Mr. Jobs was later canceled and that he received no financial gain.For years, Apple has had an inconsistent approach to compensation, at least at the top, analysts say. When Mr. Jobs first came back to Apple in 1997, he was interim chief executive and received a salary of $1 a year.In 2000, Mr. Jobs took on the title of chief executive, and the board rewarded him with the stock-option grant and a Gulfstream V jet. In 2003, the option grant was swept aside, but Mr. Jobs was awarded five million restricted shares of Apple stock vesting in three years.“Apple has had an irregular approach to compensation, which has meant that things have changed every year,” said Paul Hodgson, senior research associate for the Corporate Library, a firm that advises institutional investors.Just how the Apple inquiry will conclude is uncertain. It will involve an examination of e-mail exchanges, notes of meetings and other internal communications.But from Wall Street’s perspective, the focus will be on Apple’s leader. “Steve Jobs is the key to this,” said Benjamin Reitzes, an analyst at UBS Securities. “As long as he can keep leading the innovation and product development at the company, Apple should be fine.”'"
"'06-08-04,'0','SEOUL, Aug. 4 — South Korea appeared to back down today from its earlier assessment that North Korea may have a second Taepodong-2 ballistic missile ready for launching, after a test early last month alarmed its neighbors and prompted United Nations sanctions.Defense Minister Yoon Kwang Ung of South Korea had told the National Assembly last month that Pyongyang might have moved two long-range Taepodong-2 missiles to a launching pad at Musudan-ri, North Korea.Officials suspect one of the missiles was test-fired July 5.But South Korean officials said Friday that North Korea may have removed the second missile — if it was ever there — lowering the likelihood of further tests.“We have never confirmed whether there was a second missile at the launch site,” said an official at the South Korean Defense Ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity.American and South Korean officials considered the July 5 launching a failure because the missile disintegrated soon after it was launched. Officials and experts have since speculated that North Korea may fire a second missile after fixing technical glitches.Experts say that the Taepodong-2 missile is designed with a range long enough to strike Alaska.Washington and Tokyo, seeking to put international pressure on the Pyongyang regime, seized on the July 5 test to get a United Nations Security Council resolution passed that banned U.N. members from any dealings with Pyongyang that could help it build or deliver weapons of mass destruction.North Korea has vowed to test more missiles.A South Korean government-run research institute issued a report on Thursday saying North Korea and Iran have cooperated on the development of their respective Taepodong-2 and Shehab-5 missiles, possibly employing technology from China.'"
"'06-08-04,'0','“I might have been famous forever,” Dyson said.Instead, he was released by the Seahawks and was signed by the Jets. He is competing for a spot alongside the 11-year veteran Ray Mickens, Derrick Strait, Justin Miller and David Barrett.“I hold no grudges against the Seahawks,” said Dyson, who started his N.F.L. career with the Tennessee Titans. He played four years there with his older brother Kevin, a receiver, before moving to Seattle last season.“The first impression is a lasting impression and, unfortunately, I missed so many games last year because of injuries.”Dyson, 27, missed six regular season games in 2005. After sitting out all but one practice during Super Bowl week, he suited up against the Steelers, his right leg wrapped in tape. The first half he ran on adrenaline and was fine. But during the extended halftime show, his right leg tightened up.He had to leave the game in the third quarter of the Seahawks’ 21-10 loss. “It’s a horrible feeling to get out there and know that you are nowhere near your best,” Dyson said.In the off-season, the time Dyson needed to heal cut into his conditioning time. He was still limited in what he could do during the Jets’ veterans’ minicamp in June. The last thing Dyson wanted was for the coaching staff’s first impression of him to be of his frailty.“I’ve played enough to know you’ve got to find ways to fight through it,” Dyson said.Dyson has been fighting since he drew his first breath. He was born premature, weighing under two pounds. He was so scrawny he was given the nickname Bird. Kevin Dyson, who is four years older than his brother, said Thursday that he felt protective of Andre when they were growing up.“I just remember him always being so small,” Kevin, who has retired from the N.F.L., said in a telephone interview. “I was more like his dad. Now when I see him on the field, I’m like the proud parent more than the big brother.”Kevin played in the 2000 Super Bowl with Tennessee against St. Louis. He is best remembered for a catch he made with time running out that would have gone for the winning touchdown had he not been brought down a yard short of the goal line.Andre said: “That catch was all I got asked about during Super Bowl week. That kind of took the heat off me having to talk about my injury.”When Kevin was in college and Andre was in high school, they would pair off in neighborhood games, the elder Dyson challenging his younger brother by saying, “If you can guard me, you’ll be successful.”Kevin was drafted by Tennessee out of Utah in 1998, ahead of another receiver, Randy Moss. He approached his entire career as if he had to prove that the Titans had not erred in picking him. Andre has used his size as motivation.“ ’Dre’s thing has been people thinking he’s too small,” Kevin said. “He’s like me. We both feed off adversity.”Andre has done nothing in training camp to hurt his chances.“I like where Andre is,” said Eric Mangini, the Jets’ first-year coach, adding, “I think he has made strides from when he first arrived here to now, and that’s positive. That’s really positive.”In the morning, during 11-on-11 drills under a blazing sun, music blared from speakers set up along the sideline, making communication difficult between players on both sides of the ball. At one point, quarterback Patrick Ramsey had to call a timeout to get the offense organized. When Brooks Bollinger did the same thing shortly afterward, Coach Eric Mangini ordered every player on offense to run a lap. “Those timeouts are too valuable,” Mangini said. When the heat of competition gets intense, “the answer can’t always be a timeout,” he said.'"
"'06-08-04,'0','Comparing intelligence tests with academic achievement, known as the discrepancy model, came under intense criticism in the debates over the law and over special education.Federal officials and advocates for children with disabilities contended that the practice of waiting for children to fall behind on tests in third or fourth grade before getting them extra help consigned them to failure, and opened the way for the disproportionate numbers of poor and minority children to be labeled as needing special education.The 2004 law abandoned reliance on that approach. And the new regulations favor alternative methods of identifying children who need services, like evaluating the response of struggling children to extra help before the third grade.The 2004 law also streamlined procedures and reduced the paperwork involved in providing children special education services, and relaxed burdens on schools when children with disabilities had behavioral problems.A draft of the regulations published in June 2005 prompted an outpouring of 5,500 letters and comments to the Education Department from advocates for children with disabilities, as well as parents, teachers’ unions, and state, district and local education officials.The department posted the final regulations on its Web site today, along with answers to each of the comments it received. The final regulations will be published in the Federal Register on Aug. 14, and will take effect 60 days later.In unveiling the new rules, Education Secretary Margaret Spellings said her priority was “that we not lose our vigilance for educational attainment for every child.”Advocates for children with disabilities said they were disappointed that the regulations did not address some problems they saw in the 2004 federal law.For example, the law says that instead of reviewing each disabled child’s educational plan every year automatically, schools could review them only once every three years, provided parents agree to the change. The regulations do not help ensure parents are properly notified, advocates said.“But who is going to make sure that parents now know what they’re giving up if they agree to that?” said Ricki Sabia, associate director of the National Down Syndrome Society Policy Center. “The department could have made clear what constitutes that agreement.”'"

"'06-08-04,'0','LONDON, Aug. 3 — For these teddy bears, it was no picnic.On Tuesday night, at a tourist attraction called Wookey Hole Caves in western England, Barney, a Doberman pinscher guard dog, briefly went berserk, running amok among a collection of teddy bears, including a 1909 German Steiff bear called Mabel reputed to have belonged, once upon a time, to Elvis Presley.“It could have been the scent of Elvis” that prompted the attack, said Daniel Medley, a spokesman for the 70-acre site near Wells, in Somerset. Or maybe Barney was nothing but a hound dog.But whatever it was, Barney chewed, tore, ripped and otherwise savaged about 100 teddy bears before his handler, Greg West, was able to restrain him.“I still can’t believe what happened,” Mr. West said. Either it was a “rogue scent,” he said, that “switched on Barney’s deepest instincts, or it could have been jealousy. I was just stroking Mabel and saying what a nice little bear she was.”Photographs of Barney in British newspapers on Thursday showed the Doberman with what might or might not be an expression of canine contrition, sitting on his haunches amid detritus of glass eyes, amber fur, stuffing and other ursine innards. On the other hand, the expression may just have been saying, “Oops!”“It’s a bit ironic, really,” Mr. Medley, the spokesman said. “A German dog destroying a German bear.” Among aficionados — or, indeed, among cash-poor parents — Steiff bears are seen as top end, but there has been no demand for Barney to pay the ultimate price.'"

"'06-08-04,'0','But U.S.O.C. leaders and the Berlin meet director were not waiting for findings to make their decisions. The U.S.O.C. said it had sent Graham a letter denying him access to any of its three training centers — in Colorado Springs; Chula Vista, Calif.; and Lake Placid, N.Y. — and its 12 official training sites around the country. It called the ban permanent unless circumstances prompted a re-evaluation.“Access to our facilities is a privilege extended by the good will of our board of directors,” said Jim Scherr, chief executive of the U.S.O.C. “They can give permission to restrict that, and they have.”Graham, who has disavowed knowledge of drug use by any of his athletes, did not respond to requests for comment.“Mr. Graham and I will be issuing a full statement over the weekend addressing all of these issues,” Graham’s lawyer, Joseph Zeszotarski, said in an e-mail message. “There is no basis for any ban of Trevor, and he will be pursuing all legal avenues available to him.”U.S.O.C. leaders also issued what they named a “national call to action” on the drug issue, urging the federal government and all other sports organizations and leagues to participate in a new initiative to fight doping that would include increased research, education and enforcement.“This is a national issue,” said Peter Ueberroth, the chairman of the U.S.O.C. “Nothing less than this kind of effort will be needed. We run the risk of losing an entire generation of sports participants and sports fans.”For now, a broadened effort has taken the form of action against Graham, who has drawn increased scrutiny since Gatlin’s positive test was announced. Graham initially cracked open the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative scandal by sending a sample of a previously undetectable steroid, THG, to antidoping officials. But he has also coached at least six runners who have been barred from the sport for drug use and is under investigation by the Balco grand jury, according to people familiar with the proceedings.Jones, who no longer trains with Graham, has been implicated in the Balco case but has denied using performance-enhancing drugs. Crawford and Thomas still work with Graham, but they have not been accused of doping.Gerhard Janetzky, the organizer of the Berlin Golden League event, said at a news conference yesterday that none of Graham’s athletes would be invited to his meet. He also urged other meet directors to follow suit.Sven Arne Hansen, the president of an association of European meet directors, said in a telephone interview from Norway that he considered it a “wise move, because somebody has to start doing something.”Such actions have drawn approval from Dick Pound, the chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency. He said his agency followed a suggestion made by the International Olympic Committee’s athletes’ commission that the form that athletes complete with every drug test should have a space to identify the athlete’s coach and doctor. They could be questioned if a sample came up positive.“I’ve always thought that in many cases, the athletes are probably the least guilty, but it seems harder to get evidence against coaches,” Pound said. “I think the standard of culpability and responsibility is much higher for the coach. That is an abuse of a position of trust. Coaches are supposed to develop you in all respects, not just speed.”Korchemny, who pleaded guilty to charges of distributing steroids in the Balco investigation, faces up to a lifetime ban from the sport in a case being pursued by the United States Anti-Doping Agency.Gatlin could also be barred for life because this would be his second doping violation. The first, for an amphetamine he said was present in a drug he took for attention deficit disorder, came in 2001 and resulted in a one-year ban. Track’s international federation said it would pursue a lifetime ban if this violation were proven.Precedent exists for reducing a penalty for cooperating with an investigation. White tested positive for the banned stimulant modafinil at the 2003 world championships and initially denied wrongdoing. After being implicated in the Balco scandal, she admitted her drug use and testified against the fellow runners Tim Montgomery, Michelle Collins and Chryste Gaines, who received bans. White received a two-year ban but declined an opportunity to appeal for a lower sentence.Antidoping rules say that an athlete must provide “substantial assistance” in discovering or establishing violations by coaches and others if they are to receive a reduction of their own punishment by up to half.In the case of a lifetime ban, the suspension could be reduced to no less than eight years, the rules say, but there have been occasions where that rule did not apply. The Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced the tennis player Mariano Puerto’s suspension to two years, after finding he had no significant fault or negligence.A reduction to a two-year ban would allow Gatlin to participate in the 2008 Olympic trials.'"
"'06-08-04,'0','Since then, Merck has insisted that it behaved legally and that it will contest every suit brought by people who claim that they were injured after taking Vioxx.“The plaintiffs are failing in the effort to extort money from Merck,” said Michael Krensavage, a drug industry analyst at Raymond James. “The plaintiffs are just trying to get a quick buck out of Merck, and I think they’ll go chase another ambulance once they figure out that Merck’s not paying.”Plaintiffs’ lawyers sharply dispute that view. But they acknowledge that Merck’s insistence on trying rather than settling cases has raised the stakes in the litigation, and that marginal suits have so far proven difficult to win.The risks of Merck’s aggressive stance were evident in the first suit to reach trial. In August 2005, a Texas jury awarded $253.5 million to Carol Ernst, the widow of a man who died after taking Vioxx for seven months. Texas law will automatically reduce the Ernst verdict to about $26 million, and Merck has said it will appeal.But of the seven cases that have reached juries since then, Merck has won five. The only exceptions are a New Jersey trial won by W. Mark Lanier, the Houston lawyer who also won the Ernst case, and a case in a south Texas jurisdiction that is widely considered friendly to plaintiffs.Merck’s tough stance, and its recent triumphs, have forced plaintiffs’ lawyers to accept that Vioxx suits will be riskier and more difficult than cases over the diet drug combination phen-fen, Mr. Lanier said. Diet drug plaintiffs were often young and healthy women who suffered heart problems that could be easily connected to the combination, while plaintiffs in Vioxx cases are usually older and have other risk factors for heart disease.Further, many Vioxx plaintiffs have been unable to produce prescription records that prove they took the drug for as long as they claim. Those cases are proving difficult for plaintiffs to win, said Christopher Seeger, a plaintiffs’ lawyer in New York.“You’re going to have to have more than just samples,” Mr. Seeger said, referring to the free trial packages of drugs that doctors sometimes give to patients instead of prescriptions.As a result, by Sept. 30, when the two-year statute of limitations for filing suits will expire in many states, Merck will probably face about 40,000 plaintiffs, fewer than the 100,000 that some analysts and lawyers initially expected.Only about 8,000 to 10,000 of those cases will have plaintiffs who can prove they took Vioxx for more than a year, while an additional 15,000 will have plaintiffs who can prove they took the drug continuously for less than a year but more than six weeks, Mr. Lanier and Mr. Seeger said.Meanwhile, plaintiffs in both state and federal courts are already withdrawing some cases, said Theodore V. Maier, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed, the law firm coordinating Merck’s defense.“As we work cases up for trial, and we’ve found this in other jurisdictions, a lot of cases drop by the wayside,” Mr. Maier said. “The plaintiffs move them, or find ways to postpone them.”Still, both sides say it is far too early to declare a winner in the litigation. Even with the postponements and dismissals, Merck faces another eight trials scheduled before year-end. And in January 2007, Mr. Lanier is scheduled to bring a case in New Jersey state court, where he has already won one trial, that could cover as many as 10 plaintiffs.“We’re still very much in the middle — we have a busy schedule ahead of us,” he said. “You really have to look at these cases individually.”Merck also faces a class-action lawsuit brought by a national group of health insurers and health maintenance organizations who assert that Merck defrauded them and should refund the $8 billion they paid to fill Vioxx prescriptions between 1999 and 2004. Judge Carol Higbee, who is overseeing the New Jersey lawsuits against Merck, has scheduled that case for trial in the spring of 2007, but Merck argues that the insurers should be forced to bring their suits separately, not as part of a class action.Last week the New Jersey Supreme Court agreed to hear Merck’s appeal, another victory for the company.'"
"'06-08-04,'0','“What were the odds of me ending with the franchise that Steve took to a Super Bowl?” Young said. “You figure it’s the plan.”If Young and McNair had their way, McNair would still be in Tennessee, grooming Young to become the starting quarterback. But after an off-season contract dispute, McNair was traded to the Baltimore Ravens in June, starting a new chapter in his career.McNair is still keeping a watchful eye on Young, but he is doing it from afar, confident that his young friend will do fine without his guidance.“That would’ve been the perfect scenario, if the Titans had kept both of us,” McNair said last week in an interview at the Ravens’ training camp in Westminster, Md. “I was part of the process in helping Vince get to this point. I think I could have helped him get to the next level.“But this is a business. They couldn’t afford to keep both of us. I’m happy to be a Raven, with a team that has a chance to be special. I know the Titans are glad to have Vince. It should be a good fit.”As the No. 3 pick in the draft, and the first quarterback selected, Young will draw wide attention as he develops. At 6 feet 5 and 228 pounds, with running back speed and elusiveness, Young dominated in his final college season, a threat to score on every play, either by lofting a feathering pass to a receiver or zigzagging his way to the end zone.But not everyone believes that Young will be an N.F.L. star. His unorthodox throwing motion and reliance on the shotgun formation at Texas has raised questions about his effectiveness as a pro quarterback, particularly if he tries to run as much as he did in college.But Young has already shown the toughness to endure growing pains. When he struggled early in his sophomore season, some fans lobbied for Young to be switched to wide receiver. But Young became a star once he found his comfort zone, and he hopes for a similar scenario with the Titans.“The media and critics can say whatever they want to, and they’ve said a lot,” Young said. “They said maybe I wouldn’t be able to read defenses well enough, but you watch me make the throws and read defenses, obviously, I’m pretty smart. They talk about my throwing motion, but you see me in the games making all the throws.“The Titans drafted me because they saw what matters — the games, and the film from the games. Film doesn’t lie. It’s up to me how quickly I grasp things, how much work I put into it. If you don’t get it right, you’re going to get hit in the mouth. If you don’t know where a blitz is coming from, you’re going to get hit in the mouth. If you don’t know where the open receivers are, you’re going to get hit in the mouth. I don’t like to get hit in the mouth. I’m going to use my legs to cut down on the times I get hit in the mouth.”Young feels vindicated to be the first quarterback selected in the draft, ahead of Matt Leinart of Southern California, who went to the Arizona Cardinals at No. 10.Most of the predraft speculation had Leinart headed for Tennessee, because of the Southern California connection within the Titans’ coaching staff. Jeff Fisher, the head coach, played at Southern California. Norm Chow, the Titans’ offensive coordinator, was the offensive coordinator during Leinart’s first three college seasons.Chow admitted that he wanted Leinart, but the Titans’ owner, Bud Adams, who signs the checks, wanted Young.It has not, however, taken long for Young to impress Chow.“He’s not an athlete playing quarterback, he’s a quarterback who’s a great athlete,” Chow said. “Will he be able to run around like he did at Texas? I don’t know. Everybody at this level is fast. But he’s a player.“I told Vince that I wanted Matt because I knew Matt, not because I didn’t like Vince. His throwing motion won’t be a problem because he’s 6 foot 5 and he’s accurate. This guy brings a lot to the table. Our job is to magnify that.”Billy Volek will be the Titans’ starter this season, and the team insists that Young’s development will not be rushed. But the N.F.L. is a now business, and Fisher has already fallen in love with Young’s competitiveness. On his second day of practice, Young had one of his passes intercepted by Randy Starks, a defensive tackle listed at 6-3, 312 pounds. As Starks began to run with the ball, Young lowered his shoulder into Starks and knocked him flat to the ground.Fisher was not thrilled with the interception, but he loved the hit.“Laid him out, without pads,” Fisher said, smiling at the memory.Young was not drafted to be a long-term backup, and whether it begins this season or next, the Young Era in Tennessee is drawing closer. He made some errant throws during Monday night’s practice, but he also had shining moments. He drew the biggest roar from the crowd when he escaped two rushers and scampered 20 yards downfield, passing several defenders as if they were running in mud.Whenever Young gets his opportunity, expect some highlights and some lowlights. The key will be how quickly he learns, how quickly he can minimize mistakes.Fisher expects Young’s potential to test the patience of the Titans, who are coming off a 4-12 season.“Steve wanted to play much sooner than he did, but we drafted him in ’95 and he led us to a Super Bowl in ’99,” Fisher said. “So we feel like that course was good. Everybody’s different. We’ll give the keys to Vince when we feel Vince is ready. When that is, I can’t tell you, but he’s way ahead of what we thought.“One can only imagine what he’s going to do in the second half of preseason games, running around making plays. We have to be realistic about the temptation to want to play him sooner than we should. Billy is our starter, but Billy understands the circumstances that he’s in. Eventually, Vince is going to play.”While McNair will be watching Young’s progress with interest, his first priority will be helping the Ravens, who are coming off a disappointing 6-10 season, reach the playoffs. Ozzie Newsome, Baltimore’s general manager, believes a change in scenery will benefit McNair.“If we become a real good football team, Steve’s going to be a major reason why,” Newsome said. “If we fail, he’s probably going to get the brunt of the blame. Great athletes thrive on that, and I think Steve wants that. Steve thinks he’s good, and he’ll bring that swagger to our offense, something we’ve always had on defense.”McNair plans to keep in touch with Young this season, offering advice, but only up to a point. When Baltimore visits Tennessee on Nov. 12, McNair says Young will be on his own.“Vince and I will always be close, but I’ll never give him tips on how to beat me,” McNair said, smiling.McNair will never drift far from Young’s thoughts this season. In the Titans’ locker room, Young has taken over the locker once used by McNair.“Can’t think of a better one to have,” Young said.'"
"'06-08-04,'0','While the stars seem to have no problems raking in billions, starting small is increasingly difficult, say people involved in fund-raising whose banks forbid them from speaking on the record.“Raising $15 million to $50 million is much harder than it used to be,” said one fund-raiser.Pedigree helps. Mr. Wood made roughly $500 million for UBS every year for at least half a dozen years, said one person who worked with him. Marketing materials indicate he never had a down month.UBS, known for its conservatism, invested $500 million in his hedge fund. Management fees range from 1 to 1.5 percent, based on a three- to five-year lockup, and Mr. Wood and his team take 25 percent of the profits.Some investors worry that traders like Mr. Wood, who come from a bank’s trading floor, will not be able to achieve the same high returns after leaving the mother ship. Banks are a treasure trove of people, ideas and capital flows, giving traders inside those organizations a clear edge.But Mr. Wood has not worked on the physical main trading floors of UBS for years. He has operated from the Bahamas, Gstaad, Switzerland, and now Monaco. He told investors he did not need a large team because he has not operated with a large team for years.Even losing a high-profile court case in London last year didn’t seem to dent Mr. Wood’s ability to attract billions. Mr. Wood and another minority shareholder in a retail chain brought a claim against Tom Hunter, a Scottish entrepreneur, over the acquisition of another retailer. The judge in the case called Mr. Wood an “evasive” witness who was a “very hard and calculating man.” UBS lost Sir Tom as a client of the private bank.Mr. Wood will face many challenges, including investing $3 billion (and later $5 billion) successfully while running a business. His team includes four people. By comparison, Mr. Mindich began his fund with 50 people.Obstacles aside, Mr. Wood is certain to be deluged by money coming from pension funds and endowments looking to get in hedge funds, and looking for a big name in particular. In the second quarter, investors gave hedge funds more than $42.1 billion, according to Hedge Fund Research, the highest level of inflows since the organization has been tracking flows, according to Joshua Rosenberg, president of Hedge Fund Research.Returns, which soared in the first half of the year, have recently been rocky: down 1.54 percent in May and 0.15 percent in June. But for the year through July, the average fund is up 6.2 percent, compared with 2.7 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.The case for hedge funds may get harder. Recently, noncorrelated asset classes have become correlated, like gold and stocks. Many hedge funds sank with the equity markets they invested in. Interest rates are headed north, which should make cash look more attractive since hedge fund performance has averaged 9 percent over the last two years.And yet, the money keeps coming in, inundating the established managers. To investors, these are hedge fund heroes, sent from Monaco, to return them to the days of over-the-moon returns. If they are not enough, there will be more: Ralph Rosenberg, a former Goldman trader, is expected to start a fund, R6, this fall with at least $1 billion and two former Goldman traders are planning to begin Montrica in Britain.Expected size? More than $1 billion. Not so jaw-dropping anymore.'"
"'06-08-04,'0','For example, the company has 50 people who look after the creation and distribution of the software CD’s that it mails to prospects and displays in public locations like post offices. When it became clear that the company would no longer be trying to attract new subscribers, most of those employees were put on paid leave pending the formal layoff program announced yesterday. (That decision left several hundred thousand disks stranded in China where they had been manufactured and were awaiting shipment to the United States.)AOL said it would take charges of $250 million to $350 million this year and next for severance pay, facilities reductions and other costs of its cutbacks.Layoffs have become a way of life for AOL in recent years. Since 2000, it has announced five waves of job cuts that eliminated a total of 4,700 positions. In that time, however, its total employment base has remained roughly constant at about 19,000. As customer service jobs were eliminated in the United States, others were created in India, and many engineering jobs were transferred to Ireland.The jobs eliminated by the current cutbacks will largely not be replaced. An AOL spokesman said that the company had not ruled out further layoffs but that none were in current plans. AOL has said it expects to lose at least six million of its 17.7 million subscribers in the next year and more than nine million in total over three years.In Europe, AOL is trying to find buyers for its Internet access businesses in Britain, France and Germany that will agree to continue to display AOL’s Web page as their home page. The company said it was negotiating with Neuf Cegetel to buy its French operations and hoped to have buyers in Germany and Britain within six months.AOL is also preparing to reorganize its internal structure and top management to accommodate its scaled-down ambitions. Yesterday, John McKinley, president of AOL’s digital services division, which sells products like voice mail, said he would resign. He will form a company to sell educational services, one of the areas that he had developed at AOL.AOL will continue to offer some premium services. But many more will be offered free with advertising. And some will be used to enhance AOL’s $25.90-a-month service.For example, AOL said yesterday that it would offer five gigabytes of online space to any user to store photographs, music and other files. Its paying customers will get 50 gigabytes of storage, more than many low-end computers. Google, Yahoo and others have increased the storage they offer in their e-mail and photo services, but they do not yet offer such large general-purpose file storage.Meanwhile, competitors in the online access business were gleeful at the news that AOL, the nation’s largest Internet service provider, would stop marketing and would allow customers to keep their AOL.com e-mail addresses even if they moved to another provider.Mark R. Goldston, the chief executive of United Online, which sells dial-up Internet access under the NetZero and Juno brands, said the biggest obstacle to luring customers from AOL was that they did not want to change e-mail addresses.He said United was preparing a new marketing campaign to lure AOL customers.“If I wake up and find that the big dog is not going to spend $1 billion that he was going to spend and will let people take their e-mail addresses with them, I am going to have a good day,” Mr. Goldston said.“Whatever the dial-up market was going to be, I’m going to get more of it today than I was before.”'"
"'06-08-04,'0','The article in the July 24 issue of New York magazine invited readers to “Meet Tom Suozzi, the perfect candidate for governor of New York in any other year than this one.”It seemed to be a discouraging assessment of Mr. Suozzi’s chances against Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary. Yet that quotation, accompanied by an outdated logo for the magazine and the date the article was published, soon appeared in Suozzi campaign literature mailed to voters. Or, at least some of the quotation did.“The perfect candidate for governor ...” is all of it that is included in the mailing, which also had photographs of Mr. Suozzi and his family. The partial quotation fairly screams out in large headline type.Serena Torrey, a spokeswoman for the magazine, was not amused by the Suozzi campaign’s editing.“We’re particularly upset by the way this quote was deliberately taken out of context,” she said.The article, written by Stephen Rodrick, a contributing editor, was headed “Tom Quixote,” and asked in large type, “Is Suozzi’s campaign against Spitzer a profile in courage or self-destruction?”'"

"'06-08-04,'0','SAN JOSE, Calif., Aug. 3 (AP) — Apple Computer said on Thursday that it was teaming with General Motors, Ford and Mazda to integrate the iPod into car audio systems.The alliances mean that the iPod will be compatible with more than 70 percent of the new 2007 model vehicles sold in the United States, Apple said.G.M. and Mazda will offer iPod integration on all new models, Apple said, and Ford will offer it on many of its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury models later this year.Carmakers say they are responding to a booming trend in which sales of iPods and other MP3 players are predicted to more than double from 58 million units in 2005 to 132 million in 2009.The iPod holds about a 75 percent share of the portable player market in the United States.Two years ago, BMW incorporated iPods directly into its car audio systems, allowing users to plug the music player into an adapter that goes into the glove compartment and have access to the iPod’s music library through the car’s standard controls.By last fall, as sales of the iPod continued to surge, Apple had signed similar deals with about a dozen more carmakers, including Acura, Audi, Ferrari, Honda, Nissan and Volkswagen.Ford said it would offer iPod integration as a dealer-installed option at a suggested price of about $200, plus installation. In addition, Ford plans to add auxiliary audio input jacks on nearly half of its lineup, starting this fall.'"
"'06-08-04,'0','Sprint’s shares closed at $17.75, a drop of $2.38, or 11.82 percent. The company announced a stock buyback plan of $6 billion over 18 months — more than 10 percent of its shares at their current valuation — a move some analysts said could increase investor confidence.Paul Saleh, the company’s chief financial officer, said the tough quarter could be blamed on several causes, including continued challenges associated with joining the operations of Sprint and Nextel, which merged last August.The company has looked at the merger as an opportunity to streamline the company and focus it on mobility, reducing its emphasis on Sprint’s landline business.Mr. Saleh said that during the transition, the company failed to put as much marketing emphasis as it should have on the Nextel brand. “We put less emphasis on the Nextel brand at a time when we should have been a little more cautious about it,” he said.The average revenue per subscriber, considered a critical measure of health in the industry, fell to $62, down 9 percent from the year earlier. The overall revenue increase for the combined companies from the period a year ago was 10 percent.Mr. Saleh said the company made strategic errors with the introduction of low-cost pricing plans aimed at attracting consumers who use fewer minutes and with the introduction of a plan that sold low-cost second phones for use in family plans.In both cases, he said, considerably more of its existing customers migrated to the plans than the company had expected, which led to lower revenue. At the same time, the new plans did not attract as many new subscribers to Sprint Nextel as the company had projected, he said.Mr. Saleh said one way the company might address the issue was to raise some prices selectively, which would force up average subscriber revenue. The company will also consider raising the price of handsets on some lower-price plans to discourage excessive migration.An additional challenge for Sprint Nextel is that its churn rate — the level at which it loses subscribers each month — is 2.1 percent, above the industry average. That problem has plagued Sprint in recent years since it made an effort to attract credit-challenged customers who are more likely to default on payments, but Mr. Saleh said the problem, while still an issue, was being addressed.John Byrne, an analyst with Network Business Quarterly, said Sprint Nextel would continue to struggle until it focused on the core business of monthly subscribers.The company, he said, needs “a consistent set of easy-to-understand rate plans backed by strong customer service.”'"
"'06-08-04,'0','The story of how her pictures were spotted among jam jars in a country store window by a New York collector is familiar. He came; he saw; he bought 10 paintings. When he first showed the work to people in the city, they shrugged. “Primitive.” “Hmm. I don’t know.” But one dealer, Otto Kallir, director of the Galerie St. Etienne in Manhattan, liked what he saw. So did Sidney Janis. Soon Grandma Moses was huge, an American idol.The 38 paintings in the Cooperstown show suggest why. They’re delightful: graphically vivid, with floating, semi-abstract shapes — mountains, houses, meadows — firmly pinned down by figures and trees. She’s wonderful with winter. Painting snow was clearly fun, and a challenge. Autumn foliage gave her some trouble. In her spring and summer scenes the color green becomes a rich chorus of tones, subtly varied but harmonious. No matter what the season, the total is at once concrete and lyrical, a kind of pragmatic poetry.The way Moses painted was certainly pragmatic. In landscapes — most of her pictures are landscapes — she went from the top of a picture down, doing the sky first, then hills, then fields, then streams, buildings and so on. Using this well-practiced routine, she repeated certain popular motifs many times, though she insisted that she never did any scene exactly the same way twice, and she was right.She was also smart to sustain an impression of first-time-out freshness. Although she had a reputation for painting the past as she remembered it, she by no means worked entirely from memory. Her nostalgic art was largely assembled from found and borrowed parts, images clipped from newspapers, magazines, calendars and holiday cards that she traced onto gessoed boards. Sometimes she adapted whole images. One of her most frequently commissioned themes, “Sugaring Off,” was based on a Currier & Ives print, and her repetitions of it rarely stray far from the model.Predictability was part of the Grandma Moses appeal. She came to public attention when the country was emerging from the Depression, and her art was the answer to an escapist prayer. It gave a badly shaken and politically volatile nation a conservative, stabilizing self-image to build on.Thereafter Americans made from her whatever they needed to make. During World War II she became a patriotic darling. Bing Crosby sang “White Christmas”; she painted “White Christmas.” During the cold war the United States government sent 50 of her paintings, as advertisements for American individualism and contentment, on a tour of Europe. The artist herself stayed home to play out her role as patron saint of small-town life, and by extension of a new, prosperous suburbia.The country was crazy for quaint. And she was big business. She struck a lucrative deal with the Hallmark corporation to have her paintings reproduced on Christmas cards, which sold in the millions. Her scenes of country life appeared on textiles, dishes and lampshades. Her name was used — for a price — to push everything from Wheaties to Old Golds.The contractual details behind all of this was handled by Otto Kallir under the umbrella of Grandma Moses Properties. The artist herself, meanwhile, became something of a photo-op queen. Dressed in conspicuously antique styles, she posed with movie stars and politicians. On a television show with Edward R. Murrow she gave a painting demo.Norman Rockwell, a younger example of walking, talking Americana, became a friend, and this was an apt pairing. To most Americans their art was real art, the genuine, accessible thing, as opposed to the Abstract Expressionist painting being promoted in certain quarters as the internationalist face of American culture in the 1950’s.It’s a little startling to revisit the art wars waged in the popular press of that era, as one can do in the book titled “Designs on the Heart: The Homemade Art of Grandma Moses” (Harvard University Press, 2006) by Karal Ann Marling, one of the two curators of the Cooperstown show. (The other is Lee Kogan of the American Folk Art Museum.) Public battles over “highbrow” versus “lowbrow” had a heated, personal urgency rarely inspired by art today.But then, much has changed since that time, not least the status of art itself. When Moses died in 1961, at 101, contemporary art still had some presence in mainstream American culture; it no longer does. Pop Art, with its mix of celebration and sabotage, was a turning point.The term populist art, often applied to Moses’ work, carries value judgments. It defines an art of the people versus an art of the elite. It implies approval or disdain. Pop Art, by contrast, was neutral in concept. Ostensibly Pop Art offered the same aesthetic experience to all viewers. It combined high and low, and by doing so complicated conventional definitions of art.But Pop’s democratic embrace actually turned out to be subversive. It effectively disavowed art’s old role as a conveyer of agreed-upon public virtues, as a source of edification, and distanced art from a popular audience. It gave art a new and different power, as a critical alternative, even an agent of resistance to a prevailing ideological and aesthetic status quo.Almost no art had been more assiduously enlisted to reinforce that status quo than Grandma Moses’. Even a cursory scan of 20th-century American life makes this clear. For that reason alone, any serious approach to this artist must begin in a spirit of critical inquiry.The Cooperstown show makes some moves in this direction. It includes a sampling of Moses-endorsed products — dishes, fabrics, cards — along with personal relics like her paintbrushes and favorite rocker, to suggest how an art legend was mined for commercial gold. Wall texts allude to the ways that legend and that art were used by various parties to promote and consolidate political agendas.But every time the show raises these points, it follows them up with Hallmark-worthy gush about a “timeless American icon” and her “universal themes.” Despite dutiful nods to criticality, the exhibition comes down firmly on the side of the new conservative political correctness of family, country and tradition.All art is ideology. That’s not news. The job of an exhibition is to be forthright in exploring that ideology. When it succeeds, we can go back to the art with fresh eyes. If the art is strong enough, we will want to keep looking.Moses’ art is strong enough. Its limitations, once acknowledged, become as intriguing as its beauties, which are many: from the grand vegetative panorama that is “My Hills of Home,” to the stream running like a slice of blue-white sky through “The Old Oaken Bucket,” to the shrewdly goofy, witty human gatherings in “A Tramp on Christmas Day” and “A Country Wedding.”This last painting, of neatly dressed guests raising summertime toasts on a well-clipped lawn, reminds me a lot of Cooperstown and its manicured version of the Good Life. Sure, there are strip malls, failed farms and abandoned trailers littering the countryside beyond, but you’ll only see them if you take the wrong way out of town. If you stay inside the tourist zone, you get nostalgia, that mournful version of optimism. That’s what Grandma Moses did; her art stayed inside the zone. It’s the American way, or one of them.'"

"'06-08-05,'0','So off I went to the Crutchfield Web site. I used pop-up menus to choose the car year, make and model, and presto: I got a list of equipment that's designed to fit it.It didn't take me long to find a Pioneer unit that seemed to have it all: GPS voice navigation, a huge 6.5-inch touch screen, CD player, AM-FM radio, and compatibility with satellite radio. Although I don't drive enough to merit the fees, this unit is also compatible with XM's new real-time traffic service, where the roads on the GPS navigation system actually change color to show you how congested they are.This device (the Pioneer AVIC-D2) goes for $1250, which ain't cheap. But it sure looked sweet.Then I called the toll-free number just to be sure.I told the guy what kind of car it was, and within seconds, he was suggesting exactly the same Pioneer unit (and another one). Either this guy had an encyclopedic knowledge of cars, or he was using a really, really good database.In any case, he described this unit in unbelievable detail. He even mentioned that for an added fee, I could get an iPod adapter/charger for it, which I knew would make my wife's day.He also gave me a little pep talk about considering installing this thing myself, just as my readers had suggested. He said it would probably take two or three hours, but that Crutchfield's agents would be with me the whole way by phone (!), and that the company would send along its own, custom-written instructions.Sure enough: when the package arrived, there was Crutchfield's installation manual, with the company's ""we're here to help you"" toll-free number printed in 60-point type on the first page.What are they, nuts!? They are actually *inviting* people to call them for free technical support? Don't they have any idea how that idea will kill their revenue stream? Haven't they learned anything from the computer industry?Now, this isn't really a review of the Pioneer AVIC-D2, although I'm generally happy with it. The GPS navigation is as good as it gets, with spectacularly clear real-time maps and polished, mature software. The audio system is mostly fine—it's really cool that the entire screen flips down and away from the dashboard to reveal the CD slot when you're changing discs—but the audio controls are scattered and their operation is not what you'd call self-evident. (The most crushing disappointment is the iPod integration. Although the Pioneer unit can ""see"" the names of your playlists, albums and so on, it shows you only one name at a time on an otherwise empty screen. To view the name of the fourth album, for example, you have to hit the down arrow three times—why can't you just see the complete list at once? Worse, the system truncates the names of your songs, albums and playlists, showing only the first few letters. Dumb!)No, this is actually a review of the company and its policies. The fact that 25 readers independently wrote to recommend Crutchfield tells me that this hyper-service-oriented approach has succeeded; the company has essentially cornered its market and generated a massive audience of rabid and repeat customers.Now, I'll be honest: I didn't wind up doing the installation myself. Once I saw that the job entailed opening up the dashboard and running wires, I wimped out and asked an experienced friend to help.But I still haven't gotten over the sales rep's confidence in me and his exhortation to give it a try. His phone tone essentially said: ""Hey, since you've called us, you're automatically one of my car buddies."" And his repeated invitations to call back for further hand-holding were so shocking, I'll never forget the transaction. (I've called back twice, meanwhile, to ask questions about my Pioneer unit, and received expert, immediate answers both times.)Above all, I can't help wondering why nobody else has questioned the wisdom of the current ""go away, customer"" attitude that prevails in the penny-pinching computer and software industries.That attitude will never generate repeat customers, will never build a cult of fans and will never turn a company into the Crutchfield of its industry.'"
"'06-08-05,'0','Even if you were not a small child or living with one over the last decade, you may have been at least vaguely aware of Nickelodeon’s “Blue’s Clues.”This enormously successful Peabody Award-winning series is about a powder blue dog, appropriately named Blue, who leaves paw-print clues to help her live-action human master — and, more important, her millions of preschool viewers — solve a mystery. The mysteries tend to involve colors, shapes, numbers and the alphabet.On Sunday night “Blue’s Clues” celebrates its 10th anniversary with a prime-time (8 p.m.) special, “Meet Blue’s Baby Brother,” which has childlike charm to spare.As the title indicates, Blue has a brand-new sibling. The mystery in this hourlong show is just who that lucky puppy is. Blue and her master, Joe (Donovan Patton, who replaced the original host, Steven Burns, in 2002), set off on an adventure, following special gold paw-print clues.From the outset, viewers susceptible to the cuteness of puppies are in trouble. Blue, Joe and a little white puppy named Sprinkles (who is on a quest to earn some spots, so his name will make sense) travel together on a train made of a green crayon. Sprinkles is almost unbearably adorable, a younger, smaller, higher-voiced companion to Blue (as Robin the frog is to Kermit).Blue, Joe and Sprinkles head for Puppyville and Alphabet City, where the dogs learn the alphabet while taking a cab; Color Town, where they fill in the colors of the rainbow; Numbers Kingdom, where they practice counting; and finally Shapes Forest, where they find a crescent, a rectangle and a triangle to make a sailboat to sail over to the last clue.'"
"'06-08-05,'0','The Israeli forces are now positioned in or around more than a dozen villages and towns in Lebanon and are up to four miles inside Lebanon in some regions, according to the Israeli news media.The ground operation poses acute dangers for Israel and will severely complicate international efforts to end the fighting.For one thing, Hezbollah is fighting on terrain that it knows best.During Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon from 1982 to 2000, its long-term presence and the allied — largely Christian — militia, the South Lebanon Army, gave Israel an extensive intelligence network that is no longer present. And in the six years since Israel left, Hezbollah has built military posts, bunkers and tunnels that have strengthened its ability to resist an invader.As the ground offensive picked up pace, Israel has encountered stiff resistance in several towns and villages. Four soldiers were killed Thursday and three more on Friday, all by antitank missiles, one of Hezbollah’s most potent weapons.Over all, more than 40 Israeli military personnel have been killed since July 12, most of them on the ground in Lebanon.A large presence of Israeli troops in southern Lebanon could also make a cease-fire more difficult to achieve. Israel insists it does not want to stay in southern Lebanon for long, but it also says it does not want to withdraw until an international force can take its place.However, Hezbollah has said it will not agree to a cease-fire until Israeli troops have left Lebanon.Israel is operating on the premise that a large, muscular international force will come soon to take control of southern Lebanon. But it is not clear when that force will materialize, and what its mandate will be.And Israel faces the prospect that it will again be viewed as an occupier in Lebanon if its ground forces stay for an extended period. Whether they stay for long, their plans have expanded quickly and substantially over the past few weeks.In the first few days after Hezbollah’s July 12 raid, Israel said it intended to send only a limited number of troops into Lebanon on brief, specific missions against Hezbollah strongholds.A few days later, Israel said it intended to create a small buffer zone along the border perhaps a mile or two wide where no Hezbollah forces would be allowed. Israeli officials said they hoped to patrol this zone from the air and with artillery fire from Israel’s side of the border.Now Israeli military commanders are talking about a zone similar in scale to the one that existed in the 1980’s and 1990’s: thousands of troops stretched nine miles deep across southern Lebanon.Maj. Zvika Golan, a spokesman for Israel’s northern command, said Thursday that the zone could cover nine miles of southern Lebanon in the next few days.The defense minister, Amir Peretz, told the army to begin preparing to push to the Litani River, about 15 miles north of the border, according to the newspaper Haaretz. It is not clear whether Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is said to be wary of such an extension, will approve such plans. The security cabinet has so far approved plans for only a five-mile zone, the newspaper reported.The point of such a border zone, of course, is to significantly reduce Hezbollah’s ability to attack northern Israel.Hezbollah has powerful, long-range rockets that can be fired from well behind the zone. But because those rockets are large and cumbersome, the launchers are relatively easy to spot and destroy, military officials say.The short-range Katyusha rockets and launchers are small and nimble, and Israeli aircraft and artillery have had difficulty in finding them, even though they are close to the border, the military officials said. A large ground presence is seen as the best way to limit that kind of fire.Michael Oren, a senior fellow at the conservative Shalem Center in Jerusalem, said Israel’s ground campaign had been slow to develop for three reasons.“There is the historical, psychological level,” he said. “No one wants to go back. We spent 18 years there.”The second is the diplomatic, strategic layer. “We could go in and wait for an international force,” he said. “But what if the international force doesn’t come?”And there are also military limitations, he said. The army had to call up reserves, who have not seen this kind of combat in years, and they needed at least a few days of training before they could be sent into Lebanon, Mr. Oren added.The army has focused its training on the kind of urban combat it has waged with the Palestinians in recent years, and not the tank warfare of earlier conflicts.Mr. Oren, 51, who served as a paratrooper in the Israeli military, said his training was very different from that of his son, who recently finished his army service.“I was trained to take out Syrian tanks,” Mr. Oren said. “My son was trained to go into a house in Hebron at 2 in the morning and grab a terrorist.”'"
"'06-08-05,'0','For now, Deegan is the healthier of the two, with no serious recent injuries. Metzger had sustained four concussions during the past two months. He said that “riding bikes is living with pain.”In 2004, Metzger lost a testicle after crashing during a jump, and during his career, he has also broken his back three times.Metzger said there was entertainment value in watching someone get hurt. “People love to see people crash,” he said.Deegan has even had a brush with death. Last year, while performing a back flip, he crashed and ended up losing four pints of blood and a kidney.In the ambulance on the way to the hospital, he was asked if he had any last words he wanted to relay to his wife. He said he told himself: I’m not going to die. I’ve got my chick at home, two kids.But crash landings are not what Deegan and Metzger usually do.Metzger pulled the sport’s first back-to-back back flips in 2002. He has won five X Games medals. And in May, he did Evel Knievel one better, launching a 125-foot back flip over the fountains at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.Deegan pioneered a 360 back flip in competition and has won 10 X Games medals.Neither Metzger nor Deegan would have dreamed of such achievements 10 years ago. At the time, they were struggling supercross racers who enjoyed free-riding in their spare time in the deserts and hills around Los Angeles.To help pay the bills, they would appear in videos, jumping and pulling tricks off natural terrain. The footage proved popular, and freestyle exhibitions were soon organized.A touring show grew out of these events, and in 1999, freestyle motocross debuted at the 1999 X Games in San Francisco. The sport has rapidly grown in popularity, with Deegan and Metzger, arms covered in tattoos, becoming icons.Their toughest trick has been remaining in the top ranks of what is by far the most dangerous action sport. Competitors are often just one bad crash away from retirement.Fear of injury is enough to make some competitors quit. When the back flip was pioneered, Deegan said it “retired about 80 percent of the riders.”As a result of their longevity, Deegan and Metzger are considered legends, graybeard veterans in a much younger man’s game.But with age has come maturity. Metzger said he viewed freestyle motocross strictly as a business. He calculates the risks in terms of how it will help him support his family.Despite all the injuries and pain over the years, Deegan said he would have not lived his life differently.“I learn all my lessons the hard way,” he said.'"
"'06-08-05,'0','ATLANTA, Aug. 4 — A federal judge has ruled that law enforcement agents did not single out South Asian convenience store owners during a sting operation, which began in 2003, designed to catch clerks who were illegally selling the household ingredients used to make methamphetamine.In a 38-page opinion issued this week, the judge, Harold L. Murphy of the Northern District of Georgia, said that even though most of the defendants in the case belonged to the same race, that did not in itself prove discrimination. The defendants had to show that the prosecution had a “discriminatory purpose,” Judge Murphy said, and failed to do so.Twenty-three of the 24 stores named in the sting indictment were run by South Asians, and 44 of the 49 people charged are Indian.To date, 30 of the 49 individuals and 14 of the 16 corporate defendants have pleaded guilty. Charges against 11 individuals and one business were dismissed.A lawyer who defended one store operator said he was disappointed by Judge Murphy’s ruling but not surprised because selective prosecution cases had such a high burden of proof.'"
"'06-08-05,'0','ATLANTA, Aug. 4 — Delta Air Lines filed a formal request with the bankruptcy court late Friday to terminate its pilots’ pension plan, as President Bush prepared to sign a bill aimed in part at helping airlines protect employee pensions.If the bankruptcy court in Manhattan approves Delta’s request to cancel its pilots’ pensions on Sept. 2, the government’s pension insurer would take over the plan and pay pilots a reduced benefit based on when they retire and other factors.Delta’s effort to terminate the pension plan, which is significantly underfunded, had been expected. The airline notified the federal agency that backstops private pensions, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, in June of its intent to terminate the plan, which covers 13,000 active and retired pilots and some spouses.In April, the pilots’ union, as part of a $280 million concessions deal, agreed not to oppose the pension termination. Delta’s request comes a day after the Senate approved a pension bill that provides special relief for Delta and Northwest Airlines, allowing them to have 17 years to fully fund their pension plans.Delta has promised its pilots a $650 million note in the event the pension is terminated. Delta also has promised the pilots a $2.1 billion unsecured claim. The agency that oversees pension has argued that it should receive the money.Once the plan is terminated, Delta pilots will not be entitled to the hefty lump sum payments under the existing pension plan, which allows pilots to retire at 50 and receive half their benefits in a one-time payout and the rest in an annuity later.The lure of that lump sum prompted many pilots to put in for retirement before Delta filed for bankruptcy protection last September. But a shortfall in the pension fund has prevented pilots from cashing in their lump sums since Oct. 1.'"
"'06-08-05,'0','Isabella Miller-Jenkins has two mothers, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled yesterday.The court rejected a host of arguments from Isabella’s biological mother, Lisa Miller, that her former lesbian partner, Janet Jenkins, should be denied parental rights.The decision conflicts with one from a court in Virginia, where Ms. Miller and her daughter, who is 4, now live. A lawyer for Ms. Miller predicted that the United States Supreme Court would eventually hear the case to resolve the dispute.After living together for several years in Virginia, Ms. Miller and Ms. Jenkins traveled to Vermont to enter into a civil union in 2000. Isabella was born in Virginia in 2002, after Ms. Miller was impregnated with sperm from an anonymous donor whom Ms. Jenkins helped select. Ms. Jenkins was present in the delivery room.When Isabella was 4 months old, the women moved to Vermont, where they lived for about a year before separating. Ms. Miller and Isabella moved back to Virginia.In an interview last year, Ms. Miller said she no longer considered herself a lesbian.“When I left Janet,” Ms. Miller said, “I left the homosexual lifestyle and drew closer to God.” Ms. Miller said that she was Isabella’s only mother and that she did not want Ms. Jenkins to have visitation rights.'"

"'06-08-05,'0','Six candidates are under consideration to head the diocese; one of them, the Rev. Canon Michael Barlowe, is gay. If a majority of delegates, who are selected by each parish, choose Mr. Barlowe on Sept. 23, and if he is approved by the Episcopal Church, based in the United States, the ideological division between the church and the worldwide Anglican Communion, to which it belongs, may split wide open.Relations between the two bodies became strained in 2003 when the Rev. Canon V. Gene Robinson, who is gay, was elected bishop of New Hampshire. That choice offended many of the faster-growing and more traditional dioceses in Africa and South America.More recently, six dioceses and some individual parishes in the United States announced plans to break from the Episcopal Church because they reject a church that permits an openly gay bishop and ceremonies for same-sex unions.At the end of June, the Diocese of Newark named the openly gay priest as one of its candidates for bishop, defying a plea for restraint by a vote of the bishops and delegates at the Episcopal Church’s triennial General Convention. The selection came only a day after the archbishop of Canterbury, the nominal leader of the world’s 77 million Anglicans, proposed a plan that could force the Episcopal Church to renounce gay bishops and the blessings of same-sex unions or lose full membership in the communion.So the selection of a gay bishop in Newark could pose a test of the policy adopted at the convention.“We would discover rather quickly what in the world that means,” said the Rev. Robert W. Prichard, a professor at Virginia Theological Seminary who wrote “A History of the Episcopal Church.”After the current bishop, the Right Rev. John P. Croneberger, announced in April 2005 that he planned to retire, the Newark diocese did some collective soul-searching and produced a profile of itself in the form of a worship service.What emerged from that process, and from interviews with priests and parishioners in northern New Jersey, was a picture of a diocese where local concerns about attendance and mission, rather than sexual orientation, dominate discussions.Concern about dwindling membership is well founded. Reflecting trends in the national church, the diocese’s membership fell to 29,000 in 1990 from 52,000 in 1970, according to the diocesan profile, and it has remained relatively stable since. While average Sunday attendance has decreased 11.8 percent since 2000, donations from parishioners increased 11.5 percent from 2000 to 2004.As of 2000, the diocese included a larger percentage of minorities than the general population of New Jersey: 18 percent of its members are Hispanic, 16 percent are black and 7 percent are Asian. New Jersey was 13.3 percent Hispanic, 13.6 percent black, and 5.7 percent Asian in 2000.The diocese covers Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic, Sussex and Warren Counties, along with Calvary Church, one of its largest parishes, in Summit, Union County.All Saints in Hoboken, which was formed by the consolidation of three parishes in 1983, is an example of how the diocese has grappled with the need to close and merge congregations. In the last 33 years, the number of congregations has shrunk 16 percent.“The people who are left are the most committed disciples,” said Louie Crew, a co-chairman of the diocese’s committee that nominated the candidates for bishop.The Diocese of Newark, like the Episcopal Church itself, is proud of its activist history. In 1976, it chose the first African-American dean of any Episcopal cathedral in the United States, and in 1977 it was one of the first dioceses to ordain women. Then in 1989, an assistant bishop, Walter S. Righter, ordained a gay man as a deacon. At that time, Mr. Righter was an assistant to Bishop John S. Spong, himself a maverick. Bishop Righter was accused of heresy for ordaining the deacon but was absolved by an ecclesiastical court in 1996.Yet even as the controversy over the election of gay bishops heated up, the profile written by the diocese indicated that more than half of its clergy and almost 40 percent of its lay members said that their greatest need was for a leader who could help congregations grow.“The controversial issues facing the communion at the moment are quite distant for us when compared with our immediate mission, to help people to become followers of Christ through Bible study and spiritual development programs for adults, outreach to those in need, and creative sharing of Bible stories with children,” said the Rev. Gray Lesesne. His church in Glen Rock, N.J., also called All Saints, has doubled its average Sunday attendance in the past three years.After a bishop is elected by a majority of both clergy and lay delegates on Sept. 23, the diocese’s choice must be approved by a majority of the Episcopal Church’s bishops and diocesan governing boards. If the elected bishop is not approved, another election will have to be held.The other nominees include four with a history of working in the diocese: the Rev. Mark Beckwith, a former associate rector of St. Peter’s Episcopal Church in Morristown, N.J.; the Right Rev. Dr. Carol Gallagher, assistant bishop in Newark and the first Native American female bishop in the Episcopal Church; the Rev. William A. Potter, the rector of St. Luke’s Church in Hope, N.J.; and the Very Rev. Petero Sabune, a former dean of the diocese’s cathedral, Trinity and St. Philip’s, in Newark.Mr. Barlowe is in charge of congregational development for the Diocese of California and previously led churches in Westfield and Plainfield, N.J. The Rev. William Stokes is rector of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Delray Beach, Fla.Some priests say they worry that no matter who the next bishop is, the world will interpret the choice as politically motivated, either shrinking from or courting controversy.Yet in the face of a potential schism, Ms. Wurm said, “As terrifying as this time is, I’m so thrilled to be alive in the history of church when they’re actually talking about the world and what really matters to people.”'"

"'06-08-05,'0','SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 4 (AP) — The chemist who created the clear, one of the previously undetectable steroids at the center of the Balco drug scandal, was sentenced Friday to three months in prison and three months of home confinement.The chemist, Patrick Arnold, was the last of five defendants connected to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, a nutritional supplement company, who were convicted of dealing in illegal performance-enhancing drugs. He pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy to distribute steroids.“The behavior reflected here is destructive and damaging to Arnold, damaging to the community and damaging to the nation as a whole,” United States District Court Judge Susan Illston said.After his sentencing, Arnold said, “I’m very regretful for what I’ve done and especially since what it has precipitated in sports and society.”Arnold and his Balco co-conspirators were tripped up when the track coach Trevor Graham anonymously mailed a syringe containing the clear to the United States Anti-Doping Agency in June 2003. With the drug in hand, scientists were able to create a test to detect it.Federal agents raided Arnold’s lab in Champaign, Ill., last year. He was indicted in November on a charge of conspiring with Victor Conte Jr., Balco’s founder, to distribute the clear, which is also known as tetrahydragestrinone.'"
"'06-08-05,'0','The luxury-home builder Hovnanian Enterprises said yesterday that its third-quarter and full-year earnings would fall short of its previous forecasts as a result of slower sales, high cancellation rates and the cost of sales incentives.Hovnanian, based in Red Bank, N.J., said it expected earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 a share for the quarter that ended July 31, down from its previous forecast of $1.40 to $1.50. Analysts on average had forecast $1.41 a share in the period, the third quarter of Hovnanian’s fiscal year.For the year, Hovnanian now expects earnings of $5 to $5.75 a share, down from its previous forecast of $7.20 to $7.40 a share. The reduction in its full-year outlook was the second in recent months by Hovnanian. On May 1, the company cut the outlook from its original forecast for earnings of $8.05 to $8.40 a share.Hovnanian’s profit warning followed similar moves by most other major homebuilders.“Our anticipated financial results for the remainder of 2006 continue to be negatively impacted by a slower sales pace, high cancellation rates on contracts in backlog that were projected to close this year, and more pronounced use of concessions and incentives, particularly on the resale of those homes which have experienced contract cancellations,” Hovnanian’s chief executive, Ara K. Hovnanian, said in a statement.Higher prices and mortgage rates have reduced demand for new homes this year, while investors who bought properties in hopes for a quick gain have flooded the market with properties they are trying to unload.Hovnanian, which expects to release third-quarter results early next month, also said it was renegotiating a “significant number” of land option contracts and was likely to incur costs related to walking away from those options. It said it was not able to estimate the costs and had not set aside reserves to cover them.'"
"'06-08-05,'0','But the key issue, analysts said, is whether the investigation taints Apple’s visionary leader and chief executive, Steven P. Jobs.“The No. 1 question we get from investors is, ‘Is Steve Jobs in trouble?’ ” said Shaw Wu, an analyst for American Technology Research. “Our best assessment is no.”Since he returned to Apple in 1997, Mr. Jobs has never been a member of the board’s compensation committee, Mr. Wu noted. And Mr. Jobs does not seem to have benefited from stock options irregularities, Mr. Wu concluded. Based on his review of eight years of Apple’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Wu said, “We feel pretty strongly that Steve Jobs is not liable.”Investors’ initial concerns about the Apple disclosure seemed to abate in the course of the day. After falling as much as 9 percent before noon, Apple shares rebounded in the afternoon, closing off less than 2 percent, down $1.29 a share, to $68.30.In its S.E.C. filing yesterday, Apple gave no hint about the “additional evidence of irregularities.” In June, the company did say that one of the stock option grants being scrutinized was to Mr. Jobs. The company did not specify the grant, but the big one to Mr. Jobs during the period under inquiry was for 10 million shares, effective Jan. 12, 2000.The company announced the option grant to Mr. Jobs on Jan. 19. But options were priced at $87.19 a share, the lowest closing price in the two months up to Jan. 12. By Jan. 19, Apple’s stock price had risen to $106.56.In those days, it was not uncommon for companies to report stock option grants several days or weeks after a grant was made. Since 2002, companies have been required by law to report stock option grants within two days.Compensation experts say the lag in reporting Mr. Jobs’s grant raised questions about Apple’s disclosure practices, and left open the door for backdating the price to a lower level, which makes the option much more valuable if a company’s share price rises.More than 80 companies have disclosed that their options practices are under review by federal investigators. Those inquiries mainly center on the backdating of the price at which options could be exercised.But Apple has said that the options grant to Mr. Jobs was later canceled and that he received no financial gain.For years, Apple has had an inconsistent approach to compensation, at least at the top, analysts say. When Mr. Jobs first came back to Apple in 1997, he was interim chief executive and received a salary of $1 a year.In 2000, Mr. Jobs took on the title of chief executive, and the board awarded him the stock option grant and a Gulfstream V jet. In 2003, the option grant was swept aside, but Mr. Jobs was awarded five million restricted shares of Apple stock, vesting in three years.“Apple has had an irregular approach to compensation, which has meant that things have changed every year,” said Paul Hodgson, senior research associate for the Corporate Library, a firm that advises institutional investors.Just how the Apple inquiry will conclude is uncertain. It will involve an examination of e-mail exchanges, notes of meetings and other internal communications.But on Wall Street, the focus will be on Apple’s leader. “Steve Jobs is the key to this,” said Benjamin Reitzes, an analyst at UBS Securities. “As long as he can keep leading the innovation and product development at the company, Apple should be fine.”'"
"'06-08-05,'0','MOSCOW, Aug. 4 — Ukraine’s Parliament approved Viktor F. Yanukovich as the new prime minister on Friday evening, creating an awkward balance of power between him and President Viktor A. Yushchenko, the man who defeated him in 2004 during what became known as the Orange Revolution.Mr. Yanukovich’s election ended more than four months of uncertainty and political turmoil following an indecisive parliamentary election in March. And though both Mr. Yanukovich and Mr. Yushchenko appealed for national unity, the new arrangement is almost certain to provoke tensions between the legislative and executive branches in a country that marked its independence and democracy only 15 years ago.Mr. Yanukovich received the votes of 273 of 296 deputies who were present, a comfortable majority of the 450-member Parliament. Only 9 deputies voted against, while the rest abstained or did not vote. It was a measure of the lingering political divisions that 154 deputies boycotted Friday’s meeting.They included supporters of the former prime minister and erstwhile presidential ally, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, as well as many members of Mr. Yushchenko’s own party, Our Ukraine, though an exact breakdown was not immediately available. Only 30 of 86 members of the president’s party voted for Mr. Yanukovich, a sign of the profound internal dissension over Mr. Yushchenko’s agreement on Thursday to ally himself with a new Yanukovich government.For Mr. Yanukovich, 56, Friday’s vote culminated an extraordinary comeback. As the chosen successor of the former president, Leonid D. Kuchma, he and his government were implicated in the electoral fraud in 2004 that prompted tens of thousands to pour into the streets of Kiev, where he was ridiculed as a criminal. The protests, along with international diplomatic pressure, forced a revote and left Mr. Yanukovich discredited and abandoned.'"
"'06-08-05,'0','One concern is the National Association of Home Builders Confidence survey. The last time the mood of builders sank as low as it is now, Mr. Stack wrote, “the economy was just three months away from entering the 1990 recession.”David A. Rosenberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, puts the chance of a recession at up to 40 percent, twice his estimate at the start of the year. He, too, mentioned the housing market — toward the end of a long list.“We have an inverted yield curve, a negative savings rate, six-year-high industry operating rate, multiyear-high commodity prices, cycle-high profit margins, uncomfortably high unsold inventories of both homes and autos, and a peaking-out in housing starts — all classic late-cycle developments,” he said in a note to investors.John K. Lynch, chief market analyst at Evergreen Investments, plays down some of the risk factors. For instance, he finds the inversion of the yield curve less critical than the fact that inflation-adjusted short-term interest rates, close to 3 percent, are roughly two percentage points below the level that often prevails when recessions start.He is banking on the Fed’s ability to hit the brakes gently enough to keep the economy moving ahead, but Mr. Rosenberg is skeptical.“Be wary of the pundits telling you how great soft landings are,” he wrote. “They hardly ever happen. The odds of a soft landing after a Fed tightening cycle inverted the entire yield curve are slim.”Mr. Rosenberg’s advice is to seek refuge in health care and consumer staples, industries known for producing stable earnings streams in challenging economic conditions and areas of the stock market that have produced high returns in past recessions. Since 1973, the two groups have risen at annualized rates of more than 28 percent when the economy is in recession, he pointed out.Mr. Stack recommends a 47 percent investment in stocks and 23 percent in cash, and the stocks he favors are concentrated in the same sectors Mr. Rosenberg mentioned. His choices include Dentsply International, a maker of dental products; Biomet, a manufacturer of surgical implants; and the beverage companies PepsiCo and Diageo.INSTEAD of positioning a portfolio as if a recession were likely, Mr. Lynch suggests making moves that take into account the concerns about growth that businesses have. The economy is slowing, and executives will try to minimize the impact by spending more on technology and other equipment intended to improve productivity, he predicted.“There will be a transition from a consumer-driven economy into a business-spending economy,” he said. “Technology and industrials will offer really good opportunities over the next six to 12 months.”Among his favorites are Intel, Microsoft, United Technologies and General Electric. These blue chips are in the right sectors, and they are the right size, too, he said.“At this stage of the cycle,” Mr. Lynch said, success will go to companies with “market share, scale and international diversification.”And he conceded that stocks of big names with big businesses were more likely to hold up if the economy turned out to be heading downhill more steeply than he realized.“If we are wrong, those companies are better positioned to withstand a recession,” Mr. Lynch said. “These are household names that people are able to hang their hat on.”'"
"'06-08-05,'0','MARK PACKER, executive director of Appel Farm Arts and Music Center in Elmer, is understandably pleased that his group is getting $75,000 from the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation for the Arts. It’s not just that the organization can use the money; a Dodge grant is a seal of approval that encourages other funders.“If you’re getting money from Dodge,” he said, “it means you’re doing pretty well.”That imprimatur is particularly important after 11th-hour cuts by state lawmakers to this year’s budget, which reduced funding for the New Jersey State Council on the Arts by 15 percent instead of the 10 percent that was proposed by Gov. Jon S. Corzine.Ninety-five arts groups across the state were chosen last month from among 141 applicants to receive Dodge grants ranging from $5,000 to $175,000. Four winners received $175,000: the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick; the Newark Museum; the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra in Newark; and the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey in Madison.The foundation, established with a $66 million bequest from Geraldine Dodge, supports New Jersey arts, education, the environment and the welfare of animals, as well as Morris County initiatives. Its founder was born Geraldine Rockefeller in 1882, a daughter of William Rockefeller of Standard Oil. After marrying Marcellus Hartley Dodge, president of the Remington Arms Company, she moved with him in 1916 to Madison, where she lived until her death in 1973.The Dodge grant “makes a massive difference,” said Bonnie J. Monte, artistic director of the Shakespeare Theater, which has a $4 million operating budget. It more than pays for a year’s worth of hard production costs — which include raw materials but not salaries — for the company, as well as the expenses for 12 education programs, she said. The company’s $175,000 grant this year follows a Strategic Partnership Grant from the Dodge Foundation in 2002, which gave it $250,000 a year over four years.All but two of this year’s winners have received grants before. “We try to honor our commitments to organizations who continue to do superior work,” said Laura Aden, the Dodge Foundation’s program director for the arts, who conducts telephone interviews or makes site visits for each applicant as part of the process.'"
"'06-08-05,'0','But by the time Mr. LeoGrande spotted the Mustang, he had reached a stage where he had not only the desire but also the means to chase down that feeling again of being 17 and immortal and at the wheel of a fast car. He owned a company that manufactured steel doors and frames, and he didn’t balk at either the $500 for the car, or the many thousands more he knew it would take to make it ready for weekend drag races at tracks in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.He and his son Anthony worked on his Mustang for two years in the garage at his house in East Brunswick until almost nothing was left of the original except that flawless body. It now had a 307-cubic-inch small-block Ford engine with a Scat crankshaft, a Holley 750-cfm carburetor and BBK race headers, and when he raced it for the first time, at Raceway Park in nearby Old Bridge, it covered the quarter-mile in 12.7 seconds — about 113 miles per hour.“When I hit the finish line, I was covered with leaves,” he said. He had never blown out the Mustang’s air vents, and everything that had drifted into them during the car’s time in the woods came blasting out at him. “Everywhere, leaves.”He and Anthony spent most weekends racing, in Old Bridge, or at Atco Raceway in South Jersey, not for the prizes — the most he ever won was $200 — but just for the speed.“I don’t think there’s any bigger adrenaline rush,” said Mr. LeoGrande, who is 55. “You’re sitting there waiting for that last yellow light, you’ve got one foot on the brake, one foot on the gas, you’ve got it up to 3,000 r.p.m., you let your foot off the brake, you slam down on the gas, and you hang on for dear life.”Mr. LeoGrande wanted to go even faster, so he built another engine, a 347, for the Mustang, and it did the quarter-mile in 10.2 seconds — 132 m.p.h. After he had a heart attack in 2003 he closed his business, but he kept racing. His project for the car this past winter was a new brake system. “I got it just where I wanted it,” he said. “You could drive that car with your hands off the wheel.”He kept it on a trailer in the driveway of his home, next to the one that held Anthony’s dragster, an ’86 Mustang, until a couple of months ago, when his wife asked him to move them to the Lube One service station in Sayreville, which is owned by another son. “It didn’t fit into her landscaping,” he said.Then, on the morning of July 11, he arrived at the station to find an empty space, and the chain that had secured the two trailers together had been cut. Anthony’s car was still there, but the bait-shop beauty was gone.“I can’t even tell you what it felt like,” he said. “Talk about dropping to your knees and saying, ‘How could somebody do this?’ ”The Sayreville police are investigating. “We’re still following up a couple of leads, but there’s nothing solid yet,” said Detective Russell Anderson.Mr. LeoGrande is offering a reward — at least $1,000, he said — to get his Mustang back. He can’t bring himself to race another car yet; it just wouldn’t be right. “I lost all interest,” he said.“My wife feels terrible,” he said. “ ‘Bring the other car back home,’ she said,” and they did. There it sits idle while Mr. LeoGrande tries not to look at the empty space beside it.'"
"'06-08-05,'0','ON July 28, Gov. Jon S. Corzine exhorted the Legislature to ignore the state’s “sacred cows, third rails, 800-pound gorillas” and attack the state’s high property taxes. The next working day, last Monday, legislative leaders announced that 16 Democrats and 8 Republicans, or one-fifth of the Legislature’s 120 members, would sit on four committees that are expected to come up with property tax reform bills by mid-November.It all sounds laudable. But does anyone truly expect that these 24 legislators can do in three months what previous generations of legislators have failed to do in decades?That, at least, is what many fiscal experts and other political analysts are asking. And while they certainly do not want to jinx the legislators, or Governor Corzine, the cold reality is that New Jersey’s problems have been intractable for good reason.“When you get to this hot-button issue of property taxes, almost every interest group that you can think of has something to lose and nothing to gain, and that is a political reality,” said William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities.Mr. Dressel’s group, of course, is one of those groups, since local governments are skittish that consolidating government or forcing municipalities to share services will dilute or reduce services. The unions are dubious about any plans to revamp pension benefits. And teachers and school officials are worried about whether the state will change the formula for financing schools in an adverse way.The state also has less financial flexibility than other states, because of court mandates on school financing and because of enormous debt that piled up during previous administrations, Democratic and Republican alike, said Judith C. Cambria, an independent fiscal and education analyst who has worked on state issues since the 1970’s.'"
"'06-08-05,'0','THE most volatile part of the American economy has slowed significantly in the last nine months, providing a warning of both recession and lower stock prices.The measure looks at growth in three broad areas that are the most sensitive to economic changes and to interest rates — consumer purchases of durable goods, residential construction spending and business investment in equipment and computer software. They can be called the sensitive sector.In the fourth quarter of 2005, and again in the second quarter of this year, that part of the economy actually shrank, although a strong first-quarter performance meant that even that sector was up a little for the nine months.As the accompanying charts show, the sensitive sector is more than three times as volatile as the rest of the economy. But it has usually been a better performer. Since the end of 1954, a period of more than half a century, the sensitive sector has grown at an average rate of 4.6 percent a year, compared with 3 percent for the rest of the economy.Over time, a good indicator of both the economy and the stock market has been the relative performance of the two parts of the economy over nine-month periods. Most of the time, the sensitive sector does better. But when that sector turns in poorer performance after a sustained period of outperformance, it is a warning. And that is what has happened. Over the nine months through June, the sensitive sector grew at an annual rate of 2.1 percent, while the rest grew at a rate of 3.7 percent.'"

"'06-08-06,'0','The independent federal commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks did not pursue a tough enough line of questioning with former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani during a hearing two years ago because its members feared public anger if they challenged him, according to a new book written by the panel’s leaders.“It proved difficult, if not impossible, to raise hard questions about 9/11 in New York without it being perceived as criticism of the individual police and firefighters or of Mayor Giuliani,” wrote the chairman and vice chairman, Thomas H. Kean, a Republican, and Lee H. Hamilton, a Democrat, in their book, “Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission.”“We did not ask tough questions, nor did we get all of the information we needed to put on the public record,” they wrote.The commission’s gentle questioning of Mr. Giuliani during his May 19, 2004, testimony at the New School University in Greenwich Village was “a low point” in its handling of witnesses at its public hearings, they wrote.The 10-member commission was established by Congress in 2002 to investigate the government response to events leading up to and including the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.'"

"'06-08-06,'0','Almost all of the nine animals had foot ailments, two were emaciated, several had skin infections, three were lame and many suffered from parasitic infections, the deputies said. One sheep was found sprawled in a pool of waste, according to the deputies.Since then, the case has become the talk of the town in this wooded oasis in Putnam County overlooking the Hudson, where people live tucked away in the hills and the population barely tops 3,000. Mr. Saunders, whom people call Sandy, says he is innocent, but he has been added to a database of notorious animal abusers that is maintained by a group called Pet-Abuse.com. A trial is scheduled for September.“This has been a nightmare,” Mr. Saunders said in a recent interview. “I did not see this coming at all.”Some local residents have wondered aloud whether the case was politically motivated, as Mr. Saunders contends.“It’s a small county, and Sandy certainly does keep his head in the air,” said Christie Kroll, a paramedic who has lived and worked in Putnam County for 20 years. “I would not be the least bit surprised if something he did ruffled some feathers.”A member of an old Hudson Valley farming family, Mr. Saunders has heavy eyebrows and unruly hair and appears young for his age. He admits to being slightly absentminded. He has an address book filled with the names of prominent friends. And he plays host to a constant stream of visitors, which his supporters say makes the charges against him seem all the more bizarre.In the five weeks before the raid, for example, the barn, described as squalid and unlivable in police reports, was the scene of two social events — a fund-raising concert and an annual square dance — that were attended by hundreds of people. The concert was a $250-a-ticket affair to raise money for a local Congressional candidate, John Hall, and the performers that night included Mr. Seeger and Jackson Browne. Several of the roughly 125 people who were there said that they could not square the near-spotless condition of the barn they had visited with the cesspool described in police reports.“It just isn’t true,” said Nance Shatzkin, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Hall. “I think that if the animals had appeared ill-treated or malnourished or if the barn had been outrageously stinky, I think someone would have noticed that. There was a tremendous number of guests standing in that barn, and there just wasn’t anything like that.”Also questioning the charges are members of a film crew that spent two weeks shooting a short film in the barn and in a small cottage nearby beginning on June 16. D. Christian Hagerman, an art and film student at Cooper Union who was part of that crew, said the barn looked normal and the animals seemed happy.“The charges seem so absurd,” he said. “The barn had the usual level of manure on the lower level, but it was very thin, and it was scraped out regularly, so most of it was outside the barn. And the animals were always coming up to the crew members and nudging visitors, interacting with us, and eating carrots. I didn’t see anything unusual at all.”Mr. Saunders says he believes that his years of run-ins with neighbors and local officials, over matters like his efforts to keep certain roads unpaved and his attempts to install a cellphone tower on his property, made him a target for the authorities. Holding an extravagant fund-raising event for Mr. Hall, a Democrat in a Republican stronghold, may have been the last straw, he said.“It could be political, or it could be some other fight,” Mr. Saunders said. “But the sheriffs just dreamed this up, because no one has ever, ever heard that there was a distressed animal on this farm.”The case against Mr. Saunders was largely set in motion by a complaint from a woman who visited the farm on June 25 to discuss boarding arrangements for her animals: two sheep and a donkey. In a statement she gave to deputies on July 10, the woman, Kathleen Helen Heaney, said she was shocked by the condition of the barn.“As I approached the barn, I could see to my horror that it was a cesspool of manure and flies,” she said in the statement. “I was appalled, disgusted and horrified by the unsanitary conditions that these animals were subjected to — but also flabbergasted by Sandy Saunders apparent obliviousness to this situation.”Ms. Heaney said she spent a week making phone calls to various authorities before finally speaking with the Putnam County sheriff’s office, which conducted a raid of the farm on July 17. Mr. Saunders was out of town at the time. The raid was carried out by a deputy sheriff, Barbara Dunn, who is also president of the Putnam County Humane Society — dual roles that some people in Garrison complain are in conflict.In a telephone interview, Deputy Dunn defended the raid, dismissed suggestions that she had a conflict of interest and said that photographic documentation and veterinarian’s reports would counter the claims of some people that the barn was clean and the animals were healthy.“I think those people will be embarrassed with some of the information that’s going to come through in the trial,” she said. “When this information comes out, I think that these people would not just eat their words, but will be embarrassed or ashamed of what they’re coming forward with.”Mr. Saunders said he wants nothing more than the return of his animals and a chance to clear his name. On a recent sun-drenched afternoon at his farm, he ambled through the five acres of green pasture where his horses once roamed, lamenting that piles of hay were going to waste and that lawyer’s fees were costing him a small fortune.“It’s terrible, but I try to be calm,” he said, standing outside his empty barn, his face grim. “Nobody could possibly prove that any of this is true.”Essentially, Mr. Saunders said, he has already “been fined thousands of dollars for something I didn’t do.”'"
"'06-08-06,'0','This way of communicating is suddenly essential for Americans to understand. Increasingly, it appears that the road to peace, and war, runs through Tehran. And so hearing what Iranians are really saying, not what Americans think they are saying, has become a priority. Iran has outsized influence with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. It has profound influence with the newly empowered Shiites of Iraq. And it is locked in its own fight with the United Nations Security Council over its ambition to develop nuclear technology.And yet, understanding each other — forget about agreeing — is complicated from the start.“Speech has a different function than it does in the West,” said Kian Tajbakhsh, a social scientist who lived for many years in England and the United States before returning to Iran a decade ago. “In the West, 80 percent of language is denotative. In Iran 80 percent is connotative.”Translation: In the West, “yes” generally means yes. In Iran, “yes” can mean yes, but it often means maybe or no. In Iran, Dr. Tajbakhsh said, listeners are expected to understand that words don’t necessarily mean exactly what they mean.“This creates a rich, poetic linguistic culture,” he said. “It creates a multidimensional culture where people are adept at picking up on nuances. On the other hand, it makes for bad political discourse. In political discourse people don’t know what to trust.”It is not a crude ethnic joke or slur to talk about taarof, but a cultural reality that Iranians say stems from centuries under foreign occupation. Whether it was the Arabs, the Mongols or the French and the British, foreign hegemony taught Iranians the value of hiding their true face. The principle is also enshrined in the majority religion here, Shiite Islam, which in other lands is a minority religion, often at odds with the majority. There is a concept known as takiya in which Shiites are permitted, even encouraged, to hide their belief or faith to protect their life, honor or property.“When you tell lies, it can save your life,” said Muhammad Sanati, a social psychologist who lived for years in England before returning to Iran in 1982. “Then you can see the problem of language in this country.”Diplomacy everywhere is the art of not showing your hand, and if Iranians have shown skill at forcing negotiations over negotiations, or winning by stalling, it would be an overstatement to say that it can be explained solely by a culture of taarof. But Western diplomats based in Iran say that Iran’s cultural foundation gives it a leg up when dealing with the more studied negotiating skills of the Americans.Perhaps more important, such diplomats and Iranians themselves said, Americans need to understand Iran’s approach to interpersonal communications in order to understand the complexities Iranians face in dealing with each other. Analyst after analyst said that after centuries of cloaking their true feelings, Iranians are often unsure whom they can trust when dealing with each other, let alone foreigners.One Western diplomat, who insisted on anonymity because that is standard diplomatic protocol, said it was possible that when Iran said it could not respond before the end of August to the West’s offer on its nuclear program, that it was not only a diplomatic maneuver, but may also have been a nod to the reality of internal Iranian politics. Major decisions on the nuclear issue involve consensus at the highest levels of the political elite. But consensus can be hard to achieve when interpersonal communications, at least initially, are defined by taarof, mistrust and different political agendas, the diplomat said.At the same time, understanding the cultural/moral foundation of a community can also help Americans understand whether or not an agreement was actually reached, even when the Iranians seem to say that a deal is done. “You can translate words, but can you translate feelings?” asked Saeed Leylaz, a political analyst and former government official in Tehran. “British diplomats are more successful with us. They understand our ways and our culture.”Indeed, Americans and Iranians speak two different languages. Americans are pragmatists and word choice is often based on the shortest route from here to there. Iranians are poets and tend to use language as though it were paint, to be spread out, blended, swirled. Words can be presented as pieces in a puzzle, pieces that may or may not fit together neatly.“In Iran, you praise people but you don’t mean it,” Dr. Sanati said. “You invite people for all sorts of things, and you don’t mean it. You promise things, and you don’t mean it. People who live here understand that.”Today, Iranians are expecting the United States to take the time to understand its culture. It has seen America fail the test of cultural translation in Iraq.“It is up to America to understand us, because it is stronger,” said Mr. Leylaz, the political analyst. There are differences of opinion about how much taarof, or indirection, or as some people call it, expediency, actually affects public discourse. People in Iran assume that when a politician offers something he knows he can’t deliver, it is taarof. They don’t call it a lie.But what about when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sends a letter to President Bush. Is it sincere, or taarof? The letter has been interpreted by some Iranians as the president trying to follow the path of the Prophet Muhammad, who sent letters to his enemies, or of copying Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who sent a letter in 1989 to Mikhail Gorbachev. Some have called it naïve, or just bad politics. Certainly its import is unclear, but to all of these people, it seemed intended as a serious overture. Washington, in contrast, dismissed the letter as irrelevant because it did not address any of the substantial issues on the table. It wanted Tehran to be more direct.Dr. Hadian, who was a childhood friend of the president, suggested a different approach: “If you talk to Ahmadinejad you have to consider taarof.”“Taarof is a sign of respect, even if we don’t mean it.”Muhammad Atrianfar, publisher of the reform-minded daily newspaper Shargh, said Iranians find Americans easy to deal with because they are straightforward. That, he implied, could give Iranians an advantage in any negotiations. But for Americans to understand Iranians, he said, they must recognize that with Iranians, “the mind thinks something, the heart feels something else, the tongue says something else, and manners do something else.“It doesn’t mean people are lying,” he said. “They are just dealing with you with a different character.”'"
"'06-08-06,'0','Once they leave the comfort of pool walls and roped lanes, swimmers face choppy or cold water, flotsam or flailing competitors.“Even me, with over 20 years of experience, I still sometimes get a little bit panicky,” said the 42-year-old Cleveland, who swam the English Channel in 1994 and California’s Catalina Channel last year.Cleveland said the ranks of open-water swimmers have been growing for a decade. The committee holds five annual national open-water championship races. Its 2.5-kilometer race on Lake Michigan last year had 288 finishers.The Outdoor Industry Association’s 2005 survey found that almost 12 million Americans took adventure or outdoor vacations last year where swimming was their focus, 20 percent of the 59.5 million total, up from 15 percent of the total in 2003.Visibility on Schroon Lake on a hot July afternoon was no more than 4 or 5 feet into the green and black depths. About 1.5 miles at its widest, 9 miles long and up to 152 feet deep, the lake was sun-warmed in the shallows but cooler toward the middle, with patches of cold.A few power boats added their wakes to the light swells. Bosman got a mouthful of water once and paused once or twice to look around when motors sounded close. He felt tense and tried to hurry across. The bright yellow kayak stayed alongside.His previous open-water experience was a 15-minute swim along the Cape Cod shore, where he wondered if his splashing beyond the breakers would attract sharks.Bosman, a Boston Marathon veteran, was training for New Hampshire’s Aug. 20 Timberman triathlon: A 1.2-mile swim, 56-mile bike ride and 13.1-mile run. He was not worried about running or riding.“Usually for triathletes, I hate to say it, that’s the toughest part of their agenda — open-water swimming,” said Mary Field, the chairwoman of the Adirondack District Masters Swimming. “It requires a lot of technique to use the least amount of energy to go your distance and to have a strong stroke the whole way through.”Unlike other sports, oxygen is not always simply there for the taking, the swimmer and coach Terry Laughlin said. He advised rolling the entire trunk, not only the head, to get a good breath and a comfortable rhythm.After a few intensive pool workouts, Bosman went back to Schroon Lake and swam another one and a half miles without touching the kayak. He concentrated on breathing, he said, and felt better.“It’s really based on balance and using your core body strength as opposed to muscling with your arms and kick,” said the 51-year-old Field, who began swimming open-water events six years ago, including a five-mile swim on Saratoga Lake.The long-distance committee’s Adirondack affiliate has about 200 members, both fitness swimmers and racers, and 15 percent to 20 percent swim in open water, Field said. The two-mile championship race on Mirror Lake in Lake Placid drew about 100 entrants last year.The Lake Placid triathlon — at the full Ironman distances of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and 26.2-mile run — puts scuba divers in Mirror Lake to rescue any of the more than 2,000 athletes who get pushed under as they swarm into the water.The committee’s national administrator, Tracy Grilli of Londonderry, N.H., who swims triathlon legs, said she has been yanked by a frustrated competitor, had her goggles knocked off, been kicked, cut her feet on mussel beds, faced oncoming swimmers who circled a buoy the wrong way and developed open wounds from wetsuit chafing in saltwater. She said the races are exhilarating.“You need to train in a lake or a pond,” Grilli said. “You can’t swim in a pool and transfer that to a lake swim.”'"
"'06-08-06,'0','In late June, Hilton bought a premium site in Midtown Manhattan, a former restaurant and an adjacent small apartment building on West 57th Street and Avenue of the Americas, for $63 million, according to Massey Knakal Realty Services and city records. While Hilton would not comment on the purchase, industry analysts say the property could become part of the Hilton Grand Vacations time-share chain.Nolan Hecht, director of the hospitality group at Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate brokerage firm, said that over the last six months companies in the time-share business have been looking at New York. “The vacation-ownership companies are among the most active groups currently bidding on New York City buildings and land,” he said. “I think this is a continuing trend.”Edward F. Kinney, vice president of corporate affairs and brand awareness at Marriott Vacation Club International, which has 315,000 time-share owners worldwide, said urban properties were “great to have as an added dimension to what you offer.”“But they are a little challenging in that cost of construction and redevelopment is higher than a traditional resort property,” he said. “You can’t always have the same amenities you would in a resort environment, and you have to charge more for the product.”Perhaps that is why the time-share brands being developed in cities like New York and San Francisco, often called “fractionals,” are more upscale, with prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars a week.Marriott International, which has the Ritz-Carlton line in Miami and San Francisco, expanded into time shares in the 1980’s, the first of the major hotels. It opened the Marriott’s Custom House, an 84-unit time-share building in Boston, in 1996. The development has been sold out for years, but in general, Marriott Vacation Club units, with their many amenities, can cost as much as $117,000 a week.It was in Boston that Marriott discovered that urban time shares might better lend themselves to shorter stays.“The usage pattern of people enjoying these types of properties is a bit different,” Mr. Kinney said. “For our Custom House property, we got customer feedback. If you own a week, you don’t have to stay the entire week. You can break it into seven individual stays if you want.”At Marriott’s Custom House more owners are corporations, Mr. Kinney said.Two time-share properties in New York City have been built by independent developers: the Manhattan Club at 200 West 56th Street at Seventh Avenue and the Phillips Club at 155 West 66th Street, near Broadway. But hotel analysts say it is the strength of the marketing networks of the major hotel groups that will make time shares work in urban areas.“All the international hotel companies are able to reduce their sales and marketing costs to sell the time-share product because of their in-place marketing infrastructure,” said Mark Gordon, principal and managing director of the lodging group at the investment banking firm Sonnenblick-Goldman. (The company in recent months assisted a time-share company that bid unsuccessfully on a Manhattan hotel.)That marketing strength is especially important in overcoming the hurdle of exorbitant construction costs, a fact of life in a big city. A time-share property can always rent out its vacant units before they are sold off.“The beauty of the model is that they’re able to sell their unsold inventory as transient guestrooms while they’re going through their marketing process,” Mr. Gordon said.THE ability to rent out unoccupied rooms is not limited to the early phases of the enterprise. Time-share companies will also allow guests to stay at a hotel in a network of resorts or convert their time to points to be used later on.“If somebody elects to use their weeks to exchange for Marriott Rewards points, they give us their week back for that year,” Mr. Kinney said. “We rent it to offset the costs, and they get the points to redeem through the Marriott Rewards system.”For some potential investors, this may seem too complicated, while another issue has been resale value. Time shares don’t always appreciate like other real estate, especially if newer or more upscale inventory is created.“You don’t buy them because you’re looking for real estate appreciation,” said Howard C. Nusbaum, president and chief executive of the American Resort Development Association, which represents the time-share industry. “The value proposition is in the use.”The popularity of urban time shares may also depend in large part on how successfully the industry has shaken off its somewhat dubious reputation. “At one time, there were a lot of shady deals,” said John A. Fox, senior vice president at PKF Consulting, which specializes in hotels. “There were a lot of less-than-well-thought-out projects.

Your July 30 article “Super-Duper Markets” raves about great food markets in towns in New York and Connecticut, but only two (Wegmans and Whole Foods) in New Jersey — far from where I live.As a Jersey City resident, I find the lack of any decent markets, super or otherwise, a serious problem. Your article only intensifies the frustration! I am not the only one who gets off at the Grove Street PATH station with bags of food from Manhattan.I was sad to read “A Staple of New Jersey Shore Could Be Heading Toward Oblivion” (July 30), about the boardwalk amusement park in Seaside Park. This scenario is too reminiscent of the demise of other parks, such as the Palisades Amusement Park in Cliffside Park and Fort Lee. Ah, sweet memories of days gone by! Arnold Korotkin“Flood Insurance Often Insufficient” (July 30) illustrates misconceptions that fueled the passage of National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004 sections mandating education for insurance agents.The Panicci family, who live near Lake Ronkonkoma on Long Island, were initially told they could not purchase flood insurance, but later could because “their house was in fact in a flood zone.” However, it is not whether or not a structure is in a particular flood zone that allows people to buy federal flood insurance, but the municipality’s participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.Buildings in low-risk zones can also be insured, at reduced premiums, against flood damages. Given current climate and meteorological conditions, we should consider that nearly any site can flood, and it is sometimes wise to insure structures presumably in “lower risk” areas.'"

And that helps us determine where there is insufficient insulation.”To confirm how much insulation is inside the wall, the auditor will use a borescope, a flexible optical scope that can be inserted into the wall cavity through a small hole.After identifying how heat is being lost, Mr. Rogers said, the auditor will check the heating system itself.“We measure how the furnace and hot water heater are burning and drafting,” he said. “In as many as 25 percent of homes, we find some sort of pre-existing combustion or venting problem.”At the end, the auditor will recommend repairs. The audit takes about 90 minutes and costs about $250.Do-it-yourselfers can find tips at energystar.gov/homesealing. New York residents looking for an energy auditor can consult GetEnergySmart.org, the State Energy Research and Development Authority’s Web site, or they can call (877) 697-6278.Bill Hoffner, the owner of Hoffner Conservation, an energy auditor in Norwich, Conn., said that once an audit identifies where a house is losing heat, those areas should be caulked, insulated or sealed.“Air sealing is something that homeowners can do themselves with some weatherstripping, sealant and a caulking gun,” he said. “You can easily save $50 to $100 a year by spending $50 on materials.”But he added that homeowners who seal their houses themselves should still have a professional check the heating system and water heater for proper venting and combustion.Another way homeowners can save money is to replace incandescent bulbs. “Every incandescent light you replace with a fluorescent can save you money,” Mr. Hoffner said. “A fluorescent bulb uses less electricity and lasts 10 to 15 times longer than a normal bulb.”And while installing high-efficiency windows can save money, that may not provide the biggest savings. “You might be better off installing an $80 storm window than a $400 replacement window,” Mr. Hoffner said.'"

"'06-08-06,'0','From 1872 to 1874, Hunt executed several commissions for the Crimmins family, among them the little apartment house at 201 East 61st, originally part of an entire row stretching along Third Avenue to 62nd Street. The surviving building carries its precise incised carving in the neo-Grec style, which Hunt was influential in introducing.Another job for the Crimminses, the row houses at 219-225 East 62nd, are unusual for their low stoops, nearly at ground level.It was while these houses were being built that Hunt was called for jury duty in the 1873 trial of Boss Tweed. The defense used one of its peremptory challenges, and Hunt did not serve.Also in 1873, he designed a scrumptious little warehouse that still survives at the corner of Water Street and Peck Slip, apparently built as an income-producing property for Roosevelt Hospital. “Six wonderful stories of polychromed brick with carefully modulated windows,” say Norval White and Elliot Willensky, in the 2000 edition of their A.I.A. Guide to New York City, published by Crown.In 1887, Hunt built two tenements on 10th Avenue near 19th Street for Frederic Bronson, a lawyer, but these, too, have vanished without good photographic documentation. Other Hunt buildings in the same category include two tenements at 226 and 228 East 36th Street.Residents of these small apartment buildings were no Vanderbilts. City directories list their occupations as clerk, bartender, police officer, carpenter and the like.In the late 1880’s, even the minor commissions tapered off. When Hunt died in 1895, the architectural press was filled with memorials listing the great achievements of his career. But his little buildings remain unrecognized.Q Do 231 and 233 West 74th Street have any history of interest? ... Joan Franklin, ManhattanA These two small houses are the oldest fragments of the unusual real estate career of William E. D. Stokes, who in 1903 completed the Ansonia apartments directly across the street. In the white-water rapids of Upper West Side real estate, this forlorn pair is a cool, shady little eddy, a shipwreck of time — and time is marching on.According to Lori Zabar, who wrote “The Influence of W. E. D. Stokes’s Real Estate Career on West Side Development” as her master’s thesis in 1977, these two houses are Mr. Stokes’s earliest surviving works. He and a partner, Jacob Lawson, built them and 17 other contiguous houses in 1885 and ’86.The row extended down 74th Street and around the corner on West End Avenue. The architect, William C. Merritt, was working in the rough-and-tumble world of commercial architecture, without highbrow pretensions, and his row was wildly disparate in design.The two survivors present a much-tamed appearance, although the wonderful, inexplicable inset porches on 231 are aesthetically alarming. Note the lovely terra-cotta squares at the second floor of 233, with scallop shells, whirlpools, bull’s-eyes and other charming details. Inside, the vestibules’ crumbling tiled floors still provide an illusionistic treat worthy of Piero della Francesca.In 1929, the two houses were scheduled for demolition, to make way for a 35-story hotel on the Broadway corner. But it was never built, and by the 1930’s furnished rooms were offered for rent in both buildings, a practice that has continued ever since.They now look almost empty, with torn shades in the windows. Inside the doors on a recent afternoon, a few coats and shirts hung on pegs in the hallways were the only signs of life.The Beekman Estate owns the buildings, as well as the adjacent parcel at the northwest corner of 74th and Broadway. A Beekman representative who gave his name only as Mr. Palmer said that the owner was waiting for the last of the tenants to leave, “and then we’ll figure it out.”'"
"'06-08-06,'0','This last is certainly the case with “Infamous,” in which the director Douglas McGrath relies on Toby Jones, a British actor best known to American audiences as the voice of Dobby the House Elf in “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,” as his Capote. “Infamous,” which is set for release on Oct. 13, was in preproduction at about the same time as last year’s “Capote,” and Mr. McGrath acknowledges that the rival film began with a certain advantage. “They always had Philip right from the beginning,” he said, “so they had what you would call a big head start.”Unlike Mr. Hoffman, however, Mr. Jones is a near-perfect ringer for Capote, which was brought to Mr. McGrath’s attention by friends who had seen Mr. Jones starring in the Broadway run of the hit British comedy “The Play What I Wrote,” and more viscerally, when the two met in the lobby of a London hotel. “I saw him and thought, ‘Oh my God,’ ’’ Mr. McGrath recalled. “I had to be very strict with myself and not get too excited about the physical similarities, because that works for two minutes all by itself. If there’s nothing behind it, it’s like a mime show, or a stunt and a trick.”Mr. Jones, the director said, turned out to have the acting chops necessary to capture the comedy and tragedy of Capote’s life. In a telephone interview from his London apartment, Mr. Jones explained that for most of his life he has inspired double-takes of a different sort. “People would tell me, ‘You bear an uncanny resemblance to these 19th-century photographs of Debussy,’ ” he said.Despite sharing Capote’s pug nose, round ruddy cheeks and receding sandy hair, Mr. Jones didn’t entirely know what to make of the dropped jaws he saw among the crew. “It’s odd,” he said, “because in a way the thing I found most interesting is Capote’s remoteness from myself. Obviously there was this voice that people laughed at all through his life. His voice was such a journey, and it was such a piece of work in a way.”Mr. Jones said he spent an hour and a half each day positioning his teeth and tongue to turn his own relaxed Londoner lilt into Capote’s whining siren. That, and a good hair combing, helped him become Capote incarnate.Yet Mr. McGrath and his studio, Warner Independent Pictures, took a somewhat different tack in casting dashing, blond-haired British actor Daniel Craig, the latest inheritor of the James Bond mantle, as the murderer Perry Smith. Mr. Craig’s fair skin, liquid blue eyes and six-foot frame were liabilities, as he attempted to portray a squat, dark-haired killer bearing much closer resemblance to the actor Robert Blake, who played him in the 1967 film version of “In Cold Blood.”“The first thing we had to do was change his eyes,” Mr. McGrath said. With dark contact lenses, hair dye and a pronounced limp, Mr. Craig submerged his good looks almost as completely as Ms. Kidman’s Virginia Woolf.For the novelist Harper Lee — a role for which Catherine Keener received a best supporting actress nomination opposite Mr. Hoffman — Mr. McGrath chose Sandra Bullock. Her director said Ms. Bullock faced a considerable challenge, for instance, in capturing the gentle Alabama conversational style of a subject whom she little resembles.“Sandy’s own speech is very rapid,” Mr. McGrath said. “It’s like a human Blackberry — it’s like dit dit dit dit, right out — and I felt that was not quite right for Harper Lee, and she agreed. So she has a beautiful voice, not that Southern thing, ‘Drag a stick across the picket fence, la-dee-da, slow-down-the-lane’ thing, but just slower.” Her voice in the film, he said, comes off “a little more musical, if you know what I mean.”To play the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in “The Last King of Scotland,” which opens on Sept. 27, Forest Whitaker underwent a vocal transformation far more dramatic than those of Ms. Bullock or Mr. Jones, but his usual mania for preparation served him in good stead. For his breakthrough role as the jazz legend Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood’s “Bird,’’ Mr. Whitaker lived for many weeks in a loft in a near-abandoned stretch of downtown Los Angeles, wandering the streets at night, immersing himself in the saxophone and trying to grasp Parker’s psyche by disconnecting himself from the larger world.For this film he began his work months before cast and crew were due to arrive in Africa. “I started working to learn Kiswahili,” Mr. Whitaker said in a telephone interview. “For me it was important that I could torque it in my head so that English was my second language.”Mr. Whitaker said he watched Barbet Schroeder’s 1974 documentary on Amin, “General Idi Amin Dada,” possibly more than 100 times. During a sojourn in Uganda before filming began, he paid visits to Amin’s brother and sister, his political allies and his mistresses, and learned the warrior dances of the tribe to which Amin belonged. He also made a pilgrimage to Amin’s boyhood plantation, where a tribe of elders recalled his character as a child.“There was so much information,” Mr. Whitaker said, “but I think a lot of the soul of the man comes not from the information but from being in certain places and feeling certain things — to be possessed by that energy and spirit, so that the real person is there.”Yet it was only when Mr. Whitaker first walked on to the set in his Amin regalia, his hairline altered and skin tone darkened to match the dictator’s, that he began to gauge the effectiveness of his research. “It was very palpable for the Ugandans there,” he says. “Because Amin was such a recent part of their history, you could physically see their bodies reacting to this representation of this man that they knew.”Such precision obviously wasn’t possible in researching Sofia Coppola’s film “Marie Antoinette,” which will be released Oct. 20. “Because it’s the 18th century, we don’t know the exact mannerisms,” Ms. Coppola said. “It’s all from research and letters and writing, so no one knows.”There are abundant paintings, though, and even the most flattering ones reveal a Marie Antoinette who looks more like an attractive young Betty White than Kirsten Dunst, who is Ms. Coppola’s lead actress. Nevertheless the director sees some similarities between her star and the last of the French Bourbon queens, who was born the youngest daughter of the Austrian emperor. “She was graceful, and she was famous for her pale complexion,” Ms. Coppola said.“Kirsten’s father is German, and she has that Austrian look.”As Louis XVI Ms. Coppola cast her cousin and the “I Heart Huckabees” star Jason Schwartzman, whose Jewish-Italian heritage somehow gave him the aspect of French royalty. “Jason looks like he could be a Bourbon,” she said. “They look a bit more ethnic and dark, and have the nose. He’s much more handsome than the real Louis XVI, but he looks like he could be related.”To plump himself up for the role, he “gained like 40 pounds,” Ms. Coppola said. “I think he ate a lot of pancakes.”More than a few viewers of “Marie Antoinette’’ at Cannes last May thought perhaps Mr. Schwartzman should have eaten a few extra short stacks. “Some French journalists were complaining that he was too thin,” Ms. Coppola said, “because Louis XVI was known for being so fat.”There is no script available yet for what promises to be among the most intriguingly cast biopics in development. Absent major personnel changes, “Dirty Tricks,” an adaptation of John Jeter’s play about the women of Watergate, will star Jill Clayburgh as Pat Nixon, Gwyneth Paltrow as Maureen Dean, Meryl Streep as Martha Mitchell and — could it be? — Annette Bening as the White House reporter Helen Thomas.Both the film’s producer, Dede Gardner, and Ms. Bening, through her press agent, declined to comment on specifics about the project at such an early stage. So one can only speculate whether Ms. Bening will wear radical prosthetics to achieve Ms. Thomas’s profile, whether she’ll work with a movement coach to somehow bring her five-foot, nine-and-a-half inch frame down to Ms. Thomas’s five-foot-three-and-a-half inch stature, or whether she will rely on minimal makeup and acting alone.Reached in Washington, Ms. Thomas said she had no specific information to report either but added that she regards Bening as “a great actress” who is more than up to the role. Even so, she’s more than open to granting the filmmakers poetic license in the looks department. “If they glamorize me,” Ms. Thomas said, “I’d be happy.”'"
"'06-08-06,'0','Q: I see that your magazine, a feminist quarterly based in Oakland, Calif., and devoted to critiquing the sexist slant of pop culture, is celebrating its 10th anniversary with the publication this week of a thick anthology called “BitchFest.” Why would you choose to glamorize the unappealing female stereotype of the bitch?When we chose the name, we were thinking, well, it would be great to reclaim the word “bitch” for strong, outspoken women, much the same way that “queer” has been reclaimed by the gay community. That was very much on our minds, the positive power of language reclamation.But is the goal to rouse an entire generation of women to become bitches?We have always sort of concentrated more on the active verb form of “bitch.” As in, to bitch. And, actually, as grammar nerds, that was one of the big factors in choosing “bitch.” Hey, it’s a noun and a verb.But so is the word “kvetch.”Well, “kvetch” has a very specific cultural connotation.What, besides your screaming title, do you think the magazine has contributed to feminist discourse?We’ve tried to get people to see that pop culture is a critical locus of feminism. Most young girls are not reading Ms. They’re watching “The OC” or “Veronica Mars.” It makes sense for us to talk about those pop-culture products, because those are the conversations that girls are having among themselves. They’re not talking about how many seats women have in Congress. They’re not talking about public policy.'"
"'06-08-06,'0','IN the cramped back room of a dive in Brooklyn, a crowd of sweaty patrons are drinking and listening to live music. At the end of each song they explode in rowdy applause. Aside from the lack of cigarette smoke, which still seems odd even three years after the citywide ban in bars, it’s an average evening for a music fan. Except that tonight is opera night.Once a month at Freddy’s in Park Slope opera singers and classical musicians perform where rockers and troubadours usually roam. The set list has included a steady flow of solos and duets from “Norma,” “Otello” and “La Bohème” as well as instrumental selections from “Carmen” and “Porgy and Bess.”Opera on Tap, as the event is called, is a casual, freewheeling affair: the singers, usually in jeans and T-shirts, are known to hit wrong notes and maybe curse, laugh at themselves, apologize and start over. On some nights three women in Viking helmets and aviator sunglasses run around the room as they entertain the crowd with a severely truncated version of Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries.”Despite the antics Opera on Tap has serious underpinnings. The performers are trained and experienced — some have appeared with the New York City Opera or the Deutsche Oper Berlin — but their careers are young, and most have nonsinging day jobs. For many of them the opportunities to perform arise mainly in pressure-filled environments — rehearsals, lessons and auditions — where fun isn’t a priority. And no one gets up at karaoke to sing from “Don Giovanni.” As David Gordon, a frequent participant in Opera on Tap, put it, “So rarely are we ever in control of the performance.”Anne Ricci, a lyric soprano and voice teacher, started the program a year ago while waiting at Freddy’s one night to see a friend’s band. When she lamented the lack of relaxed settings for opera singers, the bartender and entertainment booker, Donald O’Finn, suggested they try an opera night right there on the premises. She immediately pulled in Jessica Miller, a fellow alumna of the Manhattan School of Music, and Carla Roberts, a singer Ms. Ricci met while performing in an opera festival in Rome, and Opera on Tap was born in June 2005.'"

"'06-08-06,'0','More about the reality of “ands” (games already behind, simple probability) than “buts” (recent trade acquisitions and fantastical hot streaks), the Playoff Odds Report does not speak reassuringly to teams like the Blue Jays. It found Toronto winning the division 1 percent of the time and getting the wild card just 2 percent.“We have all these stats that say how good teams are and how often one team beats another,” said Clay Davenport, the system’s designer and a meteorologist from suburban Washington. “So wouldn’t it be neat to play out the season from there? You go back to the old Strat-O-Matic days when you’d play out seasons. But here we don’t use dice.”The computer does not simply take into account each team’s current record, but also how good the team’s offense (runs scored) and pitching/defense (runs allowed) have been relative to their strength of schedule, in addition to other more reliable indicators of future performance.Then, to determine the chances of, say, the Cardinals taking two of three from the Reds in their series starting tomorrow, it uses what Bill James called his log5 method, which uses a simple equation to predict (quite accurately) that a .600 team beats a .400 team 69.2 percent of the time, for example. Other adjustments are made for home-field advantage and the like.Bizarre things can happen even in the roughly 50 games remaining per team — the Mets could squander their commanding lead in the National League East, not unlike how the Red Sox lost their 14-game lead in 1978 to the Yankees — so running the simulation one million times helps give a much fairer view of what to expect.The Playoff Odds Report demonstrates what a scrum the two wild-card races look to be. The Reds are the N.L. favorite among nondivision leaders, reaching as the wild card a mere 15.3 percent of the time, followed by four other clubs (Diamondbacks, Dodgers, Phillies, Braves) with rates between 8 and 11 percent apiece. And the loser between the Red Sox and the Yankees for the American League East still has only about a 50-50 shot at reaching October as the wild card, as the White Sox (26.1 percent) and the Twins (17.7 percent) still have significant hope.Minnesota Manager Ron Gardenhire does not exactly consult the Playoff Odds Report, but he did consult with his general manager, Terry Ryan, on how realistic his team’s chances truly were as trades were discussed before last Monday’s nonwaiver deadline.“That’s the biggest decision a general manager has to make,” Gardenhire said. “Whether you think you can get there, if you want to sell the farm out and give away your future, for something that may not help you or may not work. Those are all the biggest decisions in the game.”History shows that comebacks are harder to come by than the combatants usually realize. Since divisional play began in 1969, and ignoring the 1981 and 1994 strike-shortened seasons, teams that began August four or five and a half games back in the division race — often considered contenders — overcame their deficits only 11 percent of the time, about 1 in 9 times. Those six to seven and a half games back ended in first only 4 percent of the time, about 1 in 25.Despite the Jays’ standing eight and a half games back, Glaus naturally remained upbeat — even after seeing the odds report.“The computer doesn’t play the game,” he said. “Cy Young lost games. Babe Ruth made outs. We’re a good 10-, 11-, 12-game run away from being right there, depending on who we’re playing as we’re going through this stretch.”At a nearby locker, Vernon Wells, the Toronto center fielder, said his team’s chances were smaller than most teammates preferred to admit. And then, like most players, his heart trumped his head.“You keep an open mind,” he said. “You never know when that streak’s going to hit.”But you do know, with greater confidence, when it probably won’t.'"

A double starts at 1,350 kronor a night.If the scene doesn’t matter to you, check out the Hotel Hellsten (Luntmakargatan 68, 46-8-661-86-00, www.hellsten.se), which opened last year in the residential district of Vasastaden, just north of central Stockholm. Housed in a 1898 row house, the 80-room boutique hotel mixes modern amenities like flat-screen televisions with homey antiques like Swedish porcelain fireplaces. Nightly rates start at 990 kronor.Those on a tight budget can find intriguing options. There is a hostel inside a boat (AF Chapman) that is permanently moored off Skeppsholmen as well as a prison converted into a hotel (Langholmen Hotel).WHERE TO EAT Swedes stick to a mob mentality dictated by fashion, and few places are hotter right now than Restaurang Kungsholmen (Norr Malarstrand, Kajplats 464, 46-8-505-244-50; www.kungsholmen.com), the latest creation from the celebrity chef Melker Andersson.

And should you get hungry after a long night of partying, stop by one of the many hot dog kiosks around town. Order a classic tunnbrodsrulle (flat bread stuffed with mashed potatoes, hot dogs and so-called shrimp salad) for about 60 kronor and kiss your hangover goodbye.WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY With 16 hours of daylight at this time of year, there’s plenty to do. The best way to explore this compact city is by bicycle. Stockholm has an extensive network of bike-only paths carved into sidewalks, busy arteries and waterfront esplanades. The Gamla Stans Cykel (Stora Nygatan 20, 46-8-411-16-70; www.gamlastanscykel.se) rents one-speeds starting at 190 kronor a day.Everything is closer than you think, whether it’s the medieval alleyways of Gamla Stan (Old Town) or the urban parks of Djurgarden (pick up the free Stockholm Green Map). But don’t miss the trail that loops around Sodermalm. Ride past wooden boats bobbing in the harbor. Grab a refreshment at the waterside cafes. Take a dip in one of the many swimming spots. It’s a bewitching blend of cosmopolitan buzz and maritime calm.WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT Pack your designer sunglasses; night life in Stockholm begins early and ends late. You have two main options: head north to Stureplan, the glamorous hub of Stockholm’s velvet ropes and V.I.P. rooms, or south to the dive bars and beer halls of Sodermalm.During the summer, the terrace at F12 (Fredsgatan 12, 46-8-24-80-52; www.f12.se), a fancy restaurant, becomes a starry dance floor packed with the city’s young beauties. Admission is 80 kronor, assuming you make it past the tall blond bouncer who looks like a son of Thor. Afterward, the in-crowd heads over to Solidaritet (Lastmakargatan 3, 46-8-678-1050), where they jostle on the sidewalk while the sun comes up. StureCompagniet, Spy Bar and the newcomer Natkubblen Plaza are other clubs in Stureplan that draw the beautiful people.The bohemian bars of Sodermalm are concentrated around Medborgarplatsen, a large square buzzing with cafes, cinemas and a skateboard park. The crowd tends to be more laid back and egalitarian. One place to avoid is Kvarnen (Tjarhovsgatan 4, 46-8-64-03-80; www.kvarnen.com), a wood-paneled beer hall that charges a ridiculous coat check fee (15 kronor), even during the summer.Several gay bars are clustered in Gamla Stan. Sunday nights still belong to Patricia (Stadsgardskajen 152, 46-8-743-05-70; www.ladypatricia.st), an old lightship that draws a lively crowd of men, women and people in drag to its party decks.WHERE TO SHOP Forget about H&M and Ikea. Go instead to the underground boutiques and clever design stores in Sodermalm, a former working-class island where an influx of art-minded people has given rise to several fashionable shopping centers.The north end of Gotgatan, the island’s main spine, may have gone mainstream, but there are still some worthy spots. Weekday (Gotgatan 21, 46-8-642-17-72; www.weekday.se) is the hottest retail chain to emerge in Stockholm since, well, H&M. It sells its own jeans label, as well as chic Swedish brands like Acne jeans (about 1,000 kronor). Designtorget (Gotgatan 31, 46-8-462-35-20; www.designtorget.se) is a miniemporium that promotes unknown designers.For up-to-the-second street wear, go to SoFo — South of Folkungagatan (www.sofo.se) — Stockholm’s contrived answer to SoHo. Sneakersnstuff (Asogatan 124, 46-8-743-03-22; www.sneakersnstuff.com) is a temple dedicated to special-edition Pumas and Nikes, some designed by the store’s young owners. Boutique Sportif (Renstiernas Gata 26, 46-8-411-12-13; www.sportif.se) is known for its witty T-shirts (starting at 300 kronor).The newest shopping district is Hornstull, along Sodermalm’s west bank. New galleries, cafes and bars seem to be sprouting every week. On weekends, an artsy street fair is held along the water (www.streetinstockholm.se).YES, FREE With more than 70 museums devoted to everything from arts to aquatics, Stockholm has one of the highest concentrations of museums in the world. Luckily, some of the best are now free, thanks to a 2005 tourism initiative. Among them is the modern art museum, Moderna Museet (Skeppsholmen, 46-8-519-552-00; www.modernamuseet.se), which reopened two years ago after a mold infestation. On view are the politically charged works of Paul McCarthy, an American multimedia artist.YOUR FIRST TIME OR YOUR 10TH Bring a blanket to the leafy island of Langholmen, which is ringed by small beaches, jutting cliffs and dirt paths. During the summer, hordes of sun-deprived Swedes in bikinis and boarder shorts idle by the water like so many swans, soaking up rays for the long winter ahead. A cafe and small museum offer a break from the sun and the flirting.HOW TO STAY WIRED Your in-box is only as far away as a 7-Eleven or Pressbyran newsstand, which is to say almost everywhere. A company called Sidewalk Express (www.sidewalkexpress.se) has installed hundreds of high-speed terminals at these stores throughout the city. A 90-minute card costs 29 kronor.HOW TO GET HERE Continental Airlines and SAS fly to Arlanda Airport in Stockholm from Newark, starting at about $900 round trip. The most efficient way to the city center is the Arlanda Express train (www.arlandaexpress.com), located under the airport. The 20-minute ride leaves for the T-Centralen station several times every hour. Tickets are 200 kronor each way.HOW TO GET AROUND Stockholm is compact and well suited for walking or bicycling. To hop between islands, the extensive Tunnelbana subway and bus system (www.sl.se) is a model of urban mass transit. A single fare is 20 kronor (unlimited passes start at 60 kronor for one day). Taxis are plentiful but expensive; a short trip is about 70 kronor.'"
"'06-08-06,'0','Six decades ago, the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, was filled with officials of the Dalai Lama’s government. Now it is packed with tourists. The Chinese government recently raised the entry quota on the Potala Palace, once the seat of Dalai Lamas and the political center of Tibet, from 1,500 to 2,300 people a day.Dating back to the seventh century, the 13-story mud and wood palace — famous for its chapels, gold-embossed tombs of past Dalai Lamas and countless artifacts — was given a $6.8 million facelift by the Chinese government in hope of preserving the ancient architecture. A second phase of repairs, with a cost estimated at $22.5 million, is now under way.But all this activity, not to mention the recent completion by the Chinese government of the $4.2 billion Qinghai-Tibet Railway, described as the world’s highest, has caused some concerns among Tibetans. Critics worry that the railway, which connects China to Tibet through an area of dangerous terrain that includes the Kunlun Mountains — an earthquake zone — could threaten the local culture.“Our main concern is that this railway will swamp Tibet with Chinese migrants,” Tsering Tashi, a press officer at the Dalai Lama’s office in London, said in a recent phone interview. “The Tibetans and their supporters across the world will therefore continue to monitor closely how the Golmud-Lhasa rail line impacts the physical and the cultural landscape of Tibet.”'"
"'06-08-06,'0','Just as in New London, however, Derby has holdouts, and as the asbestos was coming out in late July, about 50 people (including a number visiting from New London) met to express angry opposition to the town’s plans.Still, they seem to be in the minority. For residents like Jose Izquierdo, the redevelopment holds promise.It is also confirmation that in buying his first home this summer in Derby, he made the right choice. The house is a 1,080-square-foot two-story Cape Cod built in 1943, with three bedrooms, one bath and attached two-car garage. He paid $212,500 and has a $3,500-a-year tax bill.Mr. Izquierdo, a maintenance worker at a convalescent home, said he used to live in Fairfield County but could no longer afford it.True, the new home’s plumbing and wiring need an upgrade, but Mr. Izquierdo will do the work himself. And, he added, if he and his wife, Nancy, can persuade their neighbors to put up white picket fences like theirs, property values just might increase.With an area of just 5.4 square miles, Derby is Connecticut’s smallest town, according to the Connecticut State Library. Long ago, its location between the Housatonic and Naugatuck made it ideal for industry. It depended on water power to run its mills, which in turn created heavy pollution, though that now seems to be a thing of the past.Another sign of change is the renewed interest in the area. New arrivals used to pass Derby by. Today, buyers who start out looking in Fairfield or Trumbull, or in lower New Haven County, in Milford and Orange, are finding similar homes in Derby for a lot less money.Dawning awareness of the town’s assets seems to be affecting population numbers. In the 1990 census, Derby had 12,199 residents; last year, according to tax records supplied by the state, it had 12,620. From 1990 to 2000, the state over all was losing residents.Area brokers say about 75 percent of Derby’s housing stock was built before World War II. Towering Greek Revivals and Queen Annes where factory owners used to live can be found along Caroline, Minerva and Elizabeth Streets. But many of the more impressive ones were carved up to accommodate multiple families long ago. Others are in desperate need of renovation.Other than the apartments and condos planned for downtown, Derby has not had much new home construction in recent years, though there are a few two- and three-home developments on the hilly former farmland toward the Seymour border. Many are on larger lots and have sweeping valley views.Although prices are lower than in Fairfield County, they have jumped about 20 percent a year for the last three years, said Mark Fagan, a sales associate with Stauffer Real Estate, based next door in Ansonia.A glance at the Consolidated Multiple Listings Service reveals that no single-family home in Derby in the last two weeks was priced higher than $630,000, and that the average price for a single-family home was about $300,000. That would get a buyer a 1,600-square-foot raised ranch built in the 1950’s, with four bedrooms and two baths, on a quarter of an acre.Homes are now staying on the market longer, said Jon Davis, an agent with Hodson Realty, based in Trumbull. Two years ago, most sold within a month of listing, he said; they now tend to linger at least three months and close below asking price.“It’s becoming a buyer’s market,” Mr. Davis said, “though this isn’t just a regional trend.”What to DoDerby’s nightlife is somewhat scattered, found at restaurants like Twisted Vine, which offers jazz on weekends in a former bank built in 1893. There is also Archie Moore’s, part of a popular local burger-and-beer chain, which opened this summer in a former department store.This summer, a Tuesday night concert series held on the town green, with polka, big band and 1950’s rock, has kept people downtown after sunset.Opposite the green stands the Sterling Opera House, the first Connecticut building on the National Register of Historic Places. An 1889 Italianate edifice, the opera house once showcased the likes of John Philip Sousa, Amelia Earhart and Harry Houdini. It is under renovation.Many residents frequent Osbornedale State Park, which accounts for about 10 percent of Derby’s land. It has a fishing pond, hiking trails and picnic areas, as well as a museum and environmental center.For water sports, there is also Lake Housatonic — technically, a stretch of river bracketed between dams. It is home to the Yale crew team; in the summer, the university offers crew lessons for children.In recent weeks the big draw has been the Naugatuck River Greenway, a new 1.7-mile path that winds along the tops of dikes and under working railroad bridges, past fishermen casting their lines.“The rivers have meant so much to Derby, first for fishing and transportation, then as a seaport and for shipbuilding, and then for industry,” said John Walsh, who heads Derby’s Greenway Committee. “We’re glad that recreation is helping people rediscover them.”There are two public elementary schools, a junior high and a high school, serving a total of about 1,600 students.Money has been lacking in recent years, but the town is rebounding. The superintendent, Janet M. Robinson, has hired 14 new teachers for the fall.Ms. Robinson, who has been on the job just a year and a half, says she is glad the high school now offers “distance learning,” where kids can take highly specialized classes through the Internet in dedicated rooms.The high school, which has about 470 students, offers Spanish and Italian, as well as three advanced placement classes.About 88 percent of this year’s senior class went on to college, many opting for New England state institutions. Average SAT scores for the 2004-2005 school year, the most recent available, were 463 for the math section and 451 for the verbal, compared with 512 for math and 510 for verbal statewide.There is also a popular Catholic school in Derby, St. Mary-St. Michael, which offers prekindergarten through Grade 8. There are also magnet schools in New Haven, in marine sciences or fine arts.In the 19th century, the town was only a neighborhood of a much larger Derby. It was called Birmingham, in honor of the then-industrial powerhouse in the British Midlands, and was meant to attract new mills and young workers, according to Robert Novak, executive director of the Derby Historical Society.“The kids came from the farms,” he said, “because instead of being a farmhand you could get a job in factories; instead of outhouses they had sewers.”Over the years, the mills cranked out, among other things, copper wire and pins, which predated glue, staples and zippers as the only way to hold clothes together.Many of those factories are gone, victim to floods or disuse. One site, the former Alling Mill, which used to manufacture underwear, will be claimed by the redevelopment. In the 1890’s, Mr. Novak said, it was the site of violent clashes between female workers and their male bosses, over issues of pay and working conditions.Derby lies on a branch line of the Metro-North Railroad. Trains to Grand Central Terminal run infrequently. The trip takes around two hours, with a transfer in Bridgeport. A one-way fare is $16.50.Drivers appreciate Derby’s proximity to Route 8, which connects with the Merritt Parkway and Interstate 95. Some residents commute to New Haven, nine miles southeast on Route 34.What We LikeDerby’s compactness makes it easy to get around on foot or by bike. For its size, it has a remarkable number of historic buildings: a dozen are either landmarks or in landmark districts. If the town pursues its plans to extend the Greenway along both rivers, that will open up even more recreational opportunities.There is a reason that urban renewal of the 1960’s and 1970’s has left such a bad impression: some bleak, unimaginative buildings that rarely fit into their surroundings, like the former Derby Savings Bank, which is now serving as city hall. Residents will probably be paying closer attention to the architecture this time around.'"

"'06-08-06,'0','The once-stodgy Scandic Anglais (Humlegardsgatan 23; 46-8-517-340-00; www.scandic-hotels.com/anglais) reopened last month after a year-and-a-half renovation. The 233-room hotel, built in 1966, was gutted and brought back to its original, United Nations-style splendor. A double starts at 1,350 kronor a night.If the scene doesn’t matter to you, check out the Hotel Hellsten (Luntmakargatan 68, 46-8-661-86-00, www.hellsten.se), which opened last year in the residential district of Vasastaden, just north of central Stockholm. Housed in a 1898 row house, the 80-room boutique hotel mixes modern amenities like flat-screen televisions with homey antiques like Swedish porcelain fireplaces. Nightly rates start at 990 kronor.Those on a tight budget can find intriguing options. There is a hostel inside a boat (AF Chapman) that is permanently moored off Skeppsholmen as well as a prison converted into a hotel (Langholmen Hotel).WHERE TO EAT Swedes stick to a mob mentality dictated by fashion, and few places are hotter right now than Restaurang Kungsholmen (Norr Malarstrand, Kajplats 464, 46-8-505-244-50; www.kungsholmen.com), the latest creation from the celebrity chef Melker Andersson. Sitting waterside on the cooler-by-the-moment island of Kungsholmen, the young restaurant looks like a swank cafeteria designed by D.J.’s. Put on your game face as you wait in line with Stockholm’s elite. The food may be secondary, but the menu tries hard to be global. Favorites include sashimi and osso buco. Like most things in this city, dinner is not cheap: about 750 kronor for two, wine excluded.For a hot spot in the heart of Stockholm, go to Nox (Grev Turegatan 30, 46-8-545-82-400; www.nox.se). Don’t let the disco-ball motif fool you. The Swedish-French fare at this year-old restaurant is top-notch. Seasonal favorites include toast skagen (shrimp on toast) for 105 kronor and broiled pikeperch for 210 kronor.Restaurants with aerial views don’t usually inspire culinary confidence, but Eriks Gondolen (Stadsgarden 6, 46-8-641-70-90; www.eriks.se) is an exception. Suspended 11 stories high, it offers one of the best views of the city’s brick-and-spire skyline. Swedish favorites like herring (125 kronor) and veal with mustard sauce (285 kronor) compete for attention. And should you get hungry after a long night of partying, stop by one of the many hot dog kiosks around town. Order a classic tunnbrodsrulle (flat bread stuffed with mashed potatoes, hot dogs and so-called shrimp salad) for about 60 kronor and kiss your hangover goodbye.WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY With 16 hours of daylight at this time of year, there’s plenty to do.

"'06-08-07,'0','NAIROBI, KENYA, Aug. 7 — As the river waters began to recede, the death toll continued to rise from a flash flood that killed up to 500 people in Ethiopia, according to Ethiopian officials today.The flood hit early Sunday morning in Dire Dawa, in eastern Ethiopia, when many people were still sleeping. Dozens living in riverside shacks were instantly swept away when the Dechatu River, which bisects the town, burst its banks, authorities said. As the riverbanks collapsed, dozens more were buried alive in an avalanche of sand.Today, rescue workers dug with bulldozers, military trucks, shovels and their bare hands, trying to locate survivors. Already 191 bodies have been found and authorities said more than 300 people were still missing. Many of the casualties were children.“Whole families were lost, factories were lost, so many people died while they were sleeping,” said Jemal Ali, a member of the Dire Dawa local government. “We’ve had floods before, but nothing like this.”Dire Dawa lies on a dry, crumbly desert shelf about 300 miles east of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital. Each summer, during the rainy season, the Dechatu and Dire Dawa rivers swell with runoff from Ethiopia’s highlands. Last year, the waters topped their banks and more than 20 people drowned.On Sunday, the rainfall was so heavy that the water instantly surged over the riverbanks, knocking down houses and telephone poles.'"
"'06-08-07,'0','Word of the shutdown rattled global commodities and equities markets. In the United States, oil prices rose more than two dollars a barrel. The benchmark contract for light, sweet crude to be delivered next month rose as high as $77.30 a barrel before settling at $76.98 a barrel in New York trading. Prices rose even higher in London, where Brent crude for September delivery closed at a record $78.30 a barrel.“You are taking what is already a tight market and tightening even further,” said Craig Pennington, the director of the global energy group at Schroders in London.Stocks, meanwhile, fell in American trading and slid across Europe. Major indexes in Britain, Germany and France all posted substantial declines for the day.Craig Stevens, a spokesman for the Energy Department, said this morning that oil could be released from the reserve if refiners request it, but that none had done so yet. According to Mr. Stevens, Samuel W. Bodman, the Secretary of Energy, has instructed his staff to reach out to BP and to be prepared if the company or any other refiners ask the department to tap the reserves. If such a request is approved, stored oil can be flowing within 24 to 48 hours, Mr. Stevens said.BP said that inspections of its facilities at Prudhoe Bay over the weekend had found pipeline walls in more than one location that had been made too thin by corrosion to meet the company’s safety standards. In one area, it said, the equivalent of four to five barrels of oil had already leaked out of the pipeline and spilled on the tundra.BP said that spill had been contained, and that workers were in the process of cleaning it up.The company is still inspecting other pipelines and production facilities at the field. So far, BP said this morning, 40 percent of the company’s 22 miles of pipeline in Prudhoe Bay had been completely inspected.In March, pipeline corrosion caused a leak of more than 200,000 gallons of oil, the worst spill since production began on Alaska’s North Slope. The incident raised questions about whether BP, based in Britain, had been properly maintaining its aging oil production network there, which it acquired when it merged with Amoco in 1998.“Given the history here, BP is going to want to do everything by the book,” said Mike Wittner, global head of energy research at Calyon in London. “This looks and feels like something that will be with us for weeks, if not longer.”The latest corrosion problem was detected during an inspection that the government required BP to perform after the March oil spill. A “smart pig” examination, using a machine that travels through the inside of a pipeline to measure wall thickness, revealed that the steel had corroded in 16 places to thicknesses less than BP considers safe.Daren Beaudo, a BP spokesman, said that for the pipeline in question, safety standards require that at least 70 percent of the steel in a 3/8-inch-thick wall must be intact.The problems at Prudhoe Bay are also likely to add to the debate about whether to expand oil drilling on the North Slope. In May the House voted to approve drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But in the Senate, where support for drilling in the reserve is not as strong, efforts to pass similar legislation have failed.Last year, an explosion at a BP refinery in Texas killed 15 workers, raising questions about the company’s compliance with government regulations. The company is also under investigation over suspicions that it manipulated propane prices.'"
"'06-08-07,'0','ANCHORAGE, Aug. 6 (AP) — Production at the Prudhoe Bay oil field, half that on the North Slope of Alaska, was being shut down on Sunday after BP Exploration Alaska discovered severe corrosion in a oil transit line.Officials at BP said they did not know how long the field would be off line. “I don’t even know how long it’s going to take to shut it down,” said Tom Williams, BP’s senior tax and royalty counsel. The company said the process could take days.Once the field is shut down oil production will be reduced by 400,000 barrels a day. That is close to 8 percent of American oil production as of May 2006, or about 2.6 percent of the daily American supply, which includes imports, according to data from the United States Energy Information Administration.Such a reduction would have a major impact on oil prices, said Tetsu Emori, chief commodities strategist at Mitsui Bussan Futures in Tokyo. But Mr. Emori said it was uncertain how much prices could change until details about production loss were known. Victor Shum, an energy analyst with Purvin and Gertz in Singapore, said, however, that he expected the impact to be minimal.“The U.S. market is actually well-supplied; crude inventories are very high,” he said. “So while this won’t have any immediate impact on U.S. supplies, the market is in very high anxiety.”'"

"'06-08-07,'0','“In 1997, my taxes were $2,600; now they’re $8,000,” said Dan Mackey, 42, a credit manager who lives in Somerset, N.J. “My salary certainly hasn’t tripled in the last nine years, and I don’t know anyone’s that has.”In the suburbs of New York City, as in many other places across the country, property taxes are the main revenue source for municipal and county governments and, most expensively, their schools. But while property taxes are principally a local issue, they have major political ramifications in state capitols.And so this sharp reversal in income and property tax growth helps to explain the building murmurs of a tax revolt not only in the New York region but around the country.“People’s wealth may be growing if they own a house, but the census data show that their income isn’t keeping up with their tax bills,” said Gerald Prante, an economist with the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based group that favors lower taxes.Consider the flurry of activity in the last year alone. New Jersey recently opened a special legislative session with the mandate of finding ways to reduce property taxes, a clear barometer of the pressure homeowners have begun to exert on the state’s leaders.“It is all too clear to everyone: The property tax burden is simply overwhelming our citizens and their economic well-being,” Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey said to the State Legislature on July 28 as it gathered for the special session. “Our citizens pay through the roof for a tax that is imposed without any regard to income or ability to pay.”Earlier this year, legislators in South Carolina and Texas — two states in which the rise in property taxes has outstripped that of income by a wide margin — approved measures to relieve the burden with rebates or caps. And in Idaho, the governor has called a special session of the Legislature to address the issue.In the session that recently ended, the Assembly in New York State — where income growth from 2000 to 2004 was among the lowest in the country — increased school aid and approved property tax rebates that mainly benefit suburban homeowners.“Politicians are feeling tense about this property tax situation,” said E. J. McMahon, the director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative fiscal policy research group. “Both the leading candidates for governor are raising the issue. Everyone feels they need a strong appeal to property taxpayers.”New York City property taxes are rising rapidly as well, up 47 percent since 2000, compared with just 5 percent from 1995 to 2000. But city property taxes are lower than those in the suburbs because most of the city’s revenue comes from income and sales taxes.In each area the numbers represent total property tax collections, including both commercial and residential, and total personal income. Changes in the figures can reflect growth in the number of properties or population.Ten years ago, homeowners could more easily afford the taxes. In the 1990’s, income growth in the United States easily outpaced the rise in property tax collections, and nowhere more comfortably than in the suburbs of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.Ray Kulberda, 67, an accountant in Somerset, said he was not too alarmed as he watched the taxes on his four-bedroom Cape Cod home rise from $3,400 in 1996 to $4,500 in 2001. Mr. Kulberda had a good job in the late 90’s, as financial director for an insurance company, and the tax increase amounted to about 5 percent a year, a rate he called “not too bad.”Those were good years across the region. While the economy thrived, local governments kept property tax increases low, sometimes with the help of state tax rebates. From 1995 to 2000, personal income in the three states rose 33 percent, far outstripping the 14 percent increase in property taxes.“In the 1990’s, we had this tremendous bubble in the stock market that boosted incomes everywhere, but more so in New York and New Jersey,” said Irwin Kellner, professor of economics at Hofstra University and the chief economist for North Fork Bank.Most places around the country shared in the boom. California’s personal income rose 40 percent from 1995 to 2000, Michigan’s went up 29 percent, and Pennsylvania’s 27 percent. Even West Virginia, which was worse than all but Alaska and Hawaii in personal income growth, experienced a 21 percent increase.With rising incomes came a flood of revenue from income and sales taxes. In New York and New Jersey, some of the states’ bounty was funneled to local governments in the form of increased aid and property tax rebates. In New York, for instance, the state enacted the School Tax Relief program, or STAR, which saved homeowners billions of dollars and provided billions to school districts starting in 1997.In New Jersey, the state improved its fiscal health by slowing the growth of local government in the 1990’s, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, partly as a result of restrictions imposed after a recession in the early 1990’s.“New Jersey had tremendous discipline in government employment expansion compared to the nation during the 1990’s, which led to slower property tax growth,” Dr. Hughes said.Throughout the region, the result was a period of remarkable stability in property taxes.In New York, counties and municipalities alike kept property tax increases under the annual inflation rate of 2.5 percent from 1995 to 2000, according to an analysis by the state’s comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, that was released in April.But since the stock market cooled in 2000, there has been a sharp reversal: Income growth slowed, stopped or in some counties actually declined for a year or two before recovering in 2004. Worse yet, property taxes began to soar. From 2000 to 2004, property taxes in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut rose twice as fast as income.In Somerset, Mr. Kulberda said that his taxes started to rise steeply in 2001, and that now they had reached $6,600 a year, a jump of 50 percent in five years. Mr. Kulberda, who was laid off in 2003, is having a hard time finding work now, but he can’t afford to retire. “I have to keep working in order to cover the property taxes,” he said.Of course, the tapering of income growth had a trickle-down effect: slower growth in state revenue and a corresponding downturn in state aid to local governments.“State governments increase their aid during economic booms that generate surges in income and sales taxes,” said Mr. McMahon, the Empire Center director. “But when the boom wears off, the first spigot they turn off is school aid. And the schools shift to the property taxpayer to make up the difference.”In addition, the government discipline of the 1990’s in New Jersey gave way to bloat in 2001, Dr. Hughes said. “Post-2000, New Jersey’s government employment grew twice as fast as the nation,” he said. “Local government employment, including education, has been a key driver of higher property taxes.”Some form of this boom-bust mathematics has been going on throughout much of the country: Census figures show that 32 of the 50 states experienced more robust growth in income than in taxes in the 90’s, only to see the tables turn since 2000.Bob Vena, 63, a plumbing contractor in Hazlet, N.J., has been a beneficiary of the real estate boom. He bought his home from his parents 25 years ago, and he also owns a bungalow in Matawan. Today the houses are worth many times what he paid for them.But the taxes on his homes have been rising steeply, he said, and now total $13,500. Business is good enough that he can afford them, Mr. Vena said, though it is becoming a strain. He said there was little he could do to increase the income from his plumbing business to keep pace.“Eventually,” he said, “I hope to sell everything and just get out of New Jersey.”'"
"'06-08-07,'0','By The Associated PressSherri Steinhauer shot a par 72 yesterday to win the Women’s British Open for the third time, and the first since it became an L.P.G.A. major in 2001.“That is the biggest thrill for me, that I’ve done it now as a major,” Steinhauer said after finishing three strokes ahead of Cristie Kerr (71) and the 2000 champion, Sophie Gustafson (72), at Royal Lytham. Steinhauer won the tournament in 1998 at Royal Lytham and at Woburn a year later.Steinhauer finished at seven-under 281 to win her second major title. She played risk-free golf, consistently hitting fairways and greens on a course that is familiar to her. She came to the 18th having gone 48 holes without a bogey. She promptly hit into a greenside bunker and capped her day with a bogey 5.“It just felt like it was my turn to win out there,” Steinhauer said.Michelle Wie and Annika Sorenstam, two of the leading contenders coming into the tournament, finished back in the pack. The 16-year-old Wie shot her third consecutive 74 to finish at 294. She has failed to break par at a major in seven consecutive rounds. Sorenstam, who won last month’s United States Open for her 10th major, finished with a 79 and shot 295 over all.The second-round leader, Juli Inkster (73), and Lorena Ochoa (74) finished at 285.EDWARDS WINS FIRST TITLE David Edwards won the 3M Championship for his first Champions Tour title, making five birdies in a six-hole stretch for a two-stroke victory over Craig Stadler and Brad Bryant in Blaine, Minn.

"'06-08-07,'0','The selection committee, which includes a mix of owners from high- and low-revenue teams, was designed to give at least the appearance that all owners’ input would be considered and that the committee would not present just one favorite. Before Tagliabue was selected, the committee assembled by Pete Rozelle, the retiring commissioner at the time, endorsed one candidate, Jim Finks, and a group of new owners balked.In the end, this committee gave no public endorsement to any of the five finalists: Goodell, Levy and three outsiders: Frederick Nance, a Cleveland lawyer; Robert L. Reynolds, chief operating officer of Fidelity Investments; and Mayo A. Shattuck III, chairman and chief executive of Constellation Energy. But an explicit endorsement was not necessary.“I don’t think it will be as contentious as last time, but it’s hard to get a handle on it,” said one owner, who was granted anonymity because the owners are not authorized to speak about the candidates. “At the end of the day, Roger will get it.”Nance, Reynolds and Shattuck are not well known beyond their reputations to many owners, and there has been little or no politicking among owners since the finalists were announced, the owner said.The choice of Levy as a finalist instead of Jeff Pash, the N.F.L.’s in-house lawyer, or Eric Grubman, the league’s executive vice president for finance, indicates that owners did not want to risk a split of votes between two strong internal candidates.Some owners are expected to support the outsiders. Reynolds, for instance, was proposed by the New England Patriots’ owner, Robert K. Kraft; he will presumably support him, at least in the early voting. But the process favors familiarity.Each candidate will make an opening statement, then will be questioned by the owners for a specified period of time. Owners will have the same amount of time to question each candidate, whether it is someone they have never spoken to or someone they have worked with for decades.“It’s pretty obvious that if somebody is an insider and he has the same time as an outsider, it’s pretty tough,” Davis said.Maverick owners, like Davis, will be wild cards in the voting. The Buffalo Bills’ owner, Ralph Wilson, has recently become a leading contrarian, especially because he was displeased with the collective-bargaining negotiations. He told The Associated Press recently that he thought the entire process was rigged to ensure that Goodell would be selected for the job. The Cincinnati Bengals’ owner, Mike Brown, also rarely goes along with the group.Brown and Wilson voted against the new collective-bargaining agreement that Goodell helped negotiate. Several owners of high-revenue teams would also like to see less control by the league office and could resist Goodell.In past few weeks, however, many owners and team executives have said that it is highly unlikely that the owners will turn to someone who is a relative unknown.The question remains: How long will it take? To earn the position, a candidate needs to receive votes from 22 of the 32 owners. Goodell is the only candidate who has any chance of being close to 22 votes on the first ballot. But an ownership group this disparate will probably take its time, even if there is little suspense about its choice.“I don’t think there are very many people that are anti-Roger,” the owner said. “I don’t sense there are. That leads me to believe he is very much the front-runner.”'"
"'06-08-07,'0','Congressional Quarterly, which had listed the race as leaning Republican, recently changed its assessment to “no clear favorite,” partly because of a gaffe by Mr. Burns about, of all things, firefighters.Mr. Burns, who is 71 and seeking his fourth term, lambasted a group of firefighters after running into them at a Montana airport in late July, telling them in front of witnesses that they had done a lousy job on a wildfire.Firefighters are pop heroes in this state of big timber, and even though Mr. Burns quickly issued a written apology — saying he was frustrated by a bad fire season in the state’s forests — the damage was apparently done. Mr. Tester immediately issued a statement supporting firefighters.Mr. Tester, a third-generation farmer, very much looks the part of old Montana agriculture, right down to his flattop haircut that looks like nothing so much as a field of hard northern wheat. And he proudly declares his love for the land at every opportunity. Energy independence, he says in most of his speeches, must be a priority. And that independence, he adds, will depend on renewable sources like wind power and on farmers in places like Montana, where he believes wind farms and ethanol-production agriculture could boom.“My wife and I farm; you get up in the morning and you work your tail off,” Mr. Tester said in an interview. “My goal is to stay grounded in Montana.”He is also an accomplished musician with an undergraduate degree in music — he plays the trumpet — and is a friend of a member of the rock band Pearl Jam who grew up in Montana near the Tester place.Critics say he is just a liberal in hayseed trappings.“He’s the darling of the liberal left, from Pearl Jam to as many liberal groups you can bring in,” said Jason A. Klindt, a spokesman for the Burns campaign. “They all seem high on Jon Tester. That says a lot about him.”Mr. Burns was not available for an interview despite repeated requests.Several people who were interviewed on the streets of Missoula on a recent morning said they supported Mr. Tester mainly because they were tired of Mr. Burns or angry at him.Jamie Lawrence, a candle shop owner in Missoula who said her family had been in Montana for five generations, said she would vote for Mr. Tester because it was time for a change.“The reason why Tester probably will be elected is that Montanans have gotten so sick of the Republicans we had,” Ms. Lawrence said.Others said they were unhappy with Mr. Burns, but would vote for him anyway.“Yeah, I think Conrad ought to be hurt over some of that stuff that went on, but for me it’s basically the lesser of two evils,” said Jim Edison, a small-business owner from Superior, about 70 miles from here. “I believe if the Democrats gain power, there will be more and more social programs that we can’t afford. But I’m mad at the Republicans, too.”The backdrop for both candidates is a state in the middle of an identity crisis. The energy economy is booming from gas and oil exploration, but agriculture is struggling and the percentage of people without health insurance is among the highest in the nation — a point that Mr. Tester constantly cites in his speeches.The western half of the state, which includes the Democrat-laden university towns of Missoula and Bozeman, is growing rapidly from an influx of retirees and tourism. The eastern half, Mr. Burns’s historic base, has been losing population.Democrats, who gained control of the Legislature and the governor’s office in 2004 with the election of Gov. Brian Schweitzer, say they have found the new political recipe for Montana — mixing support for the right to bear arms, environmental protection and American Indians, who make up about 6 percent of the population. Others say that Mr. Burns’s seniority and clout in the Senate and his ability to get federal dollars to Montana will carry the day, no matter what.“This isn’t Conrad’s first rodeo,” said Mr. Klindt, the spokesman for Mr. Burns. “He’s always had tough, close races. We don’t expect this to be any different.”What may partly box in the Tester campaign in the months ahead is the need to set him apart from traditional politicians and Mr. Burns in particular, and the need that may yet emerge to remind voters of Mr. Abramoff.Mr. Abramoff pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion charges. He and his associates gave more political contributions to Mr. Burns than any other member of Congress — $150,000 — in what prosecutors describe as an influence peddling scheme that also defrauded many of those seeking influence, including several Indian tribes. No charges have been brought against Mr. Burns or any member of his staff.It seems that the Tester campaign is still trying to figure how — or whether — to make Mr. Burns’s ties to Mr. Abramoff part of the election debate.Ethel MacDonald, a Missoula resident who described herself as a “peace activist,” confronted Mr. Tester at the Uptown diner here in Missoula on exactly that point.“Do not waste any dollar I give you on negative advertising — please,” Ms. MacDonald said with a long, drawn-out emphasis on “please.” “I don’t think he needs to remind people of Abramoff,” she added in an interview. “We all know.”'"
"'06-08-07,'0','“I don’t think she ever thought of herself as a pioneer.”Born and reared in Cambridge, Mass., before studying at Colorado State University and moving to Alaska, Butcher finished in the top five in 12 of her 17 attempts at the Iditarod from 1978 to 1994. Her success brought unprecedented attention to the race.“If you knew Susan, you knew that she was a tremendous competitor, but she had this ability to connect with people that helped this race and this sport rise to a level it had never been at before,” Chas St. George, spokesman for the Iditarod, said in a telephone interview.Butcher’s careful training and treatment of her dogs revolutionized the sport. She went on to raise and train dogs with her husband at Trail Breakers Kennel near Fairbanks, Alaska.“In a lot of respects, her greatest contribution to the sport itself was how she made year-round care and training really the standard rather than the exception,” Monson said.Butcher had been treated for polycythemia vera, a blood-system disorder. She was found to have acute leukemia in December 2005, and was treated with chemotherapy. With the cancer in remission, she had a stem-cell transplant on May 16 and chose an experimental approach to maximize her chance for a cure.“There’s no question she was a fighter, and she always chose to take risks for the hope she could be cured,” Dr. Abkowitz, of the University of Washington Medical Center and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, said in a telephone interview.Butcher was hospitalized again June 28 with graft-versus-host disease, a complication of the transplant as the injected cells attacked her digestive tract.On July 25, the leukemia recurred and was especially aggressive, and Butcher received additional chemotherapy.The news of her death sent more shock waves through the tight community of mushers.“We knew the odds were not in her favor,” Martin Buser, a four-time Iditarod champion, said in a telephone interview. “You keep thinking an ultracompetitor like that will pull through. You also realize the numbers might be stacked against her.”Monson said his wife had her last extended talk with their two daughters, 11-year-old Tekla and 6-year-old Chisana, shortly before having another round of chemotherapy in hopes of beating the illness.“She knew that her kids, her girls were going to be powerful, confident young women someday,” Monson said. “She lived more in 51 years than some people do in 100.”'"

Yribe, is accused of dereliction of duty for not reporting the crimes, but he is not thought to have been at the house where the crimes are said to have taken place.Mr. Green faces rape and murder charges in a federal court in Kentucky. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.In his testimony, Colonel Kunk said the soldiers’ company — Company B of the First Battalion, 502nd Infantry, with the 101st Airborne Division — had a particularly dangerous assignment to patrol a stronghold of the Sunni Arab insurgency south of Baghdad. The job took a high toll, with eight of the company’s soldiers killed from September through June.Mr. Green and two of the accused soldiers, Private Spielman and Sergeant Cortez, were “wallowing in self-pity” early in the year amid the violence and the death of fellow soldiers, Colonel Kunk said. They were among several soldiers who sought help for combat stress, he said.Colonel Kunk said at the hearing that others had told him about Mr. Green’s comment, “all Iraqis are bad people.” He was so concerned about it that he personally discussed it with Mr. Green, he said, asking him whether he intended to kill Iraqis.But during the hearing, the line of questioning turned and Colonel Kunk never testified about Mr. Green’s response.Earlier in the day, an Iraqi Army medic described a gruesome tableau of violence he encountered when he walked into the house where, according to investigators, the rape and killings took place.The medic, who testified anonymously for security reasons, said he found the naked and burned body of the girl with a bullet hole in her face and saw the bullet-ridden bodies of her sister and parents — a scene that left him “sick for almost two weeks,” he said.Two Iraqi witnesses also took the stand, but reporters were barred from hearing them, and officials did not disclose details of their testimony. A trial lawyer had requested the restriction out of concern that public exposure might endanger them.The hearing took place on another day of scattered violence around Iraq.Three American soldiers were killed Sunday by an improvised bomb planted along a road southwest of Baghdad, the American military said in a statement early Monday.A suicide bomber wrapped in explosives detonated himself in the middle of a crowd of mourners attending the funeral of a member of the Tikrit city council, an Interior Ministry official said. Five people were killed and 15 wounded, the official said.At least 15 bodies, all with their hands tied behind their backs and gunshots to the head, were found in different Baghdad neighborhoods, according to the ministry official.'"

"'06-08-07,'0','Several weeks ago, in the June issue of The New York Times’s Play Magazine, an article appeared under the title, “Baseball for Life,” chronicling the state of American youth baseball at its qualitative best and contrived worst. The article portrayed elite travel baseball — a recent phenomenon and the competitively bloated version of the Williamsport, Pa.-based Little League — as a virtual laboratory for the purpose of creating slugging and hurling Frankenstein monsters.Focusing on a team in Central Florida, it described an adult-driven culture in which preadolescents live and breathe baseball 12 months a year, competing on regional all-star teams that include some players who actually commute by plane.Depressing as it was to read about an unusually large and powerful boy from Las Vegas who has been recruited by numerous teams nationwide to serve as a roving ringer, the article’s saddest passage was a family scene outside the lines, a 12-year-old playfully letting his dog gnaw on his fingers until his mother called out: “Pitching hand! Pitching hand!”What can happen when child’s fancy becomes family fervor, when substantial sums of money and years are spent chasing the pot of gold at the end of the big-league rainbow?Daniel Gould, who directs the Institute for the Study of Youth Sports at Michigan State, was quoted in the article: “Kids realize the sacrifices their parents are making, and if they don’t play well, they feel like they’re letting them down. It can be very subtle. They realize, ‘Boy, I get the bigger hug when I hit the home run than when I strike out.’ ”•Is that what this whole performance-enhancement scourge is coming to? Do future dopers need to be embraced right now, made to understand by their mommies that defeat is gallant compared to the shame of suspension?After reading the article in Play, I called Gary I. Wadler, an associate professor of medicine at New York University and a steroid expert, and asked if it is a mistake to always focus on the clinical aspects of steroids, and never on the motivational.Wadler, no psychologist, reminded me that he had spent a dozen years as the official physician at the United States Open tennis tournament, in the stronghold of the controlling sports parent. He agreed that the oppressive values that shaped individual pursuits had invaded baseball and other team sports and created the belief that prodigies could be made if they were nurtured soon after they learned to walk.It doesn’t take Freud to hypothesize that athletes who have a deep-seated fear of failure that is parent-instilled will be more likely to risk an organ or two and try to defy the odds of producing a positive drug test in the ongoing quest for that defining bigger hug.“We’ve created a dangerous culture,” Wadler said. “These kids are growing up feeling the burden of so much being invested in them.”We lurch from one outrage to another, the answers begetting more questions.If, for instance, Landis’s formerly inspirational 17th stage must now be attributed to the juice, if cycling is to be dismissed as the dirtiest sport we know, doesn’t it stretch credulity to think that Lance Armstrong, the man who managed to win the Tour seven consecutive years, was clean, especially in light of accusations that cycling people everywhere but France prefer to dismiss?• Armstrong never officially failed a test? Neither did Marion Jones — or Barry Bonds, for that matter — but both have been convicted in the world court of public opinion.Unless Landis and Gatlin can prove themselves not guilty, there will be little doubt about them, among the unlucky to be snared by a testing net that will always have holes. They will be sent away in disgrace, but the temptation will remain for obsessive young athletes we are nurturing with more single-minded intensity than ever.Deterrence can be only a treatment, not a cure, when the sickness is in the system.'"
"'06-08-07,'0','Even optimists generally concede that the housing boom must eventually end, and that consumers will eventually have to start saving again. But the conventional wisdom was that housing would have a “soft landing” — that the boom would taper off gradually, and that other sources of growth would take its place. You might say that the theory was that business investment and exports would stand up as housing stood down.The latest numbers suggest, however, that this theory isn’t working much better on the economic front than it is in Baghdad.Signs of a deflating housing bubble began appearing a year ago, but for a while it was possible to argue that eliminating a bit of “froth” in the housing market wouldn’t do the overall economy much harm. Now, for the first time, problems in the housing market are starting to seriously reduce economic growth: the latest G.D.P. data show real residential investment falling at an accelerating pace. The latest job numbers show falling employment in home construction, and retail employment has fallen over the past year, suggesting that consumer spending is running out of steam. (Gas at $3 a gallon doesn’t help, either.)Meanwhile, neither business investment nor exports seem to be growing fast enough to make up for the housing slump.Now maybe we’ll still manage that soft landing despite a rapidly rising number of unsold houses; or maybe there’s a boom in business investment and/or exports just over the horizon. But based on what we know now, there’s an economic slowdown coming.This slowdown might not be sharp enough to be formally declared a recession. But weak growth feels like a recession to most people; remember the long “jobless recovery” that followed the official end of the 2001 recession?And what will policy makers do about a slump, if it happens? A snarky but accurate description of monetary policy over the past five years is that the Federal Reserve successfully replaced the technology bubble with a housing bubble. But where will the Fed find another bubble?And with the budget still deep in deficit and the costs of the Iraq war still spiraling upward, it’s hard to see Congress agreeing on any significant fiscal stimulus package — especially because history suggests that the Bush administration and Congressional leaders will turn any debate about how to help the economy into yet another attempt to smuggle in tax cuts for the wealthy.One last thing: the real wages of most workers fell during the “Bush boom” of the last three years. If that boom, such as it was, is already over, workers have every right to ask, “Is that it?”'"

"'06-08-08,'0','The swift selection of Goodell, 47, indicated that owners did not want to tinker substantially with a $6 billion-a-year business that ranks as the most profitable league in American sports.In March, the league completed a new collective bargaining agreement with its players union that ensures continued labor peace and its 32 franchises are enjoying the windfall of revenues generated from television contracts worth about $4 billion a year. With encouragement and, in many cases, financial help from the league, more than two-thirds of the N.F.L.’s teams are playing in new stadiums or are in the process of building stadiums. Money generated from naming rights and luxury suites has also helped the league’s expansion.Goodell and the other candidates each made presentations to the owners on Monday and then sat for interviews today. During his presentation, Goodell emphasized where he sees the N.F.L. continuing to grow in coming years, according to several people familiar with the presentation.Observers have recently described Goodell as intimately familiar with the league and its key issues. “He’s a big-picture guy, but he’s been in a lot of those hard meetings,” said Bob Bowland, a professor of sports management at the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University.Goodell also faces significant challenges. including replacing Tagliabue, whose tenure was considered a resounding success by owners.Goodell was involved in collective bargaining negotiations that led to the new deal but either side could opt out of the agreement in November 2008 or November 2009. Such a move would force additional negotiations to avoid a season without a salary cap and a potential work stoppage.There is also a growing divide between teams with high revenues and those with low revenues, and the owners are still working to implement revenue-sharing rules.Among the longer term issues faced by Goodell is the league’s desire to return a team to the Los Angeles, the nation’s second-biggest media market. Goodell has assumed a leadership role on the issue as the N.F.L. tries to increase its appeal to Hispanics and Asian-Americans.Goodell, who is married and has twin daughters, is relatively unknown to most fans. His father, however, was well known to many New Yorkers. Charles E. Goodell was appointed by then-Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to fill the Senate seat left vacant by the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Charles Goodell, a Republican congressman at the time, later infuriated his party by sponsoring legislation to cut off funding for the Vietnam War. He died in 1987.Roger Goodell “has his father’s intelligence and a lot of his father’s temperament,” George Mitrovich, the former press secretary for Charles Goodell, said recently of the son.'"
"'06-08-08,'0','Slightly more than half of all Americans say they are driving less this summer because of higher gasoline prices at the pump, although people with lower incomes are cutting back more than those with higher paychecks.Higher gas prices are forcing about the same proportion of people to cut back on their driving as in 1981, the last time gasoline prices rose as sharply as they have today, according to the Pew Research Center, which has conducted surveys on driving and gas prices for several years.In its latest survey, 55 percent of 1,182 people interviewed — 1,048 of them drivers — said they had cut back on their driving because of the rise in gas prices. The nationwide survey was conducted from June 20 through July 16, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.In 1981, a reduction in oil supply from the Middle East drove prices to their historic high in the United States — to about $3.12 a gallon for unleaded regular in today’s dollars. At that time, drivers also said they made a decision to drive less, the Pew Center said.This latest survey was taken before BP began shutting down the nation’s largest oil field on Monday because of a leak in a critical pipeline in Alaska, driving up the already-high world crude oil prices. The rise in gasoline prices will probably force more people to rethink their driving habits, if history is any guide, the researchers said.'"
"'06-08-08,'0','If more crude is needed to make up a production shortfall, he said, Ecuador, Colombia and Mexico could help, or oil could be released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if necessary. Later in the day, Mexico and Saudi Arabia issued statements saying they were prepared to step up shipments to the United States.“We believe we know how to handle this type of situation,” Mr. Bodman said at the news conference.The giant oil company that operates the Prudhoe Bay field, BP, said late Sunday night that it had found unexpectedly severe corrosion in pipelines serving the field and would have to shut the field down while repairs are made.BP officials in London said the conditions in Alaska are highly unusual, with the pipes elevated over the permanently frozen soil and exposed to weather conditions that are not endured by most pipelines, which are underground.“The circumstances related to this pipeline are unique,” said Wendy Silcock, a BP spokeswoman, at the company’s headquarters in London. “There aren’t any lessons or issues that can be applied to other lines.”As a result, she said, the company is not making any special new efforts to inspect the hundreds of miles of pipelines it operates around the world.Although it may take months to replace the 16 miles of Prudhoe Bay feeder pipes that have been found to be corroded and, in one location, leaking small amounts of oil, the main Trans Alaska Pipeline remains in service. It may be possible to use other feeder pipes to transport crude oil from parts of the Prudhoe Bay field to the main line for shipment to the lower 48 states.Repairs may be delayed by difficulty in obtaining suitable pipe. Industry reports indicate that manufacturers of the type of steel pipe used in oil and gas pipelines are sold out through the third quarter of 2007. And even if a steel mill were willing to disrupt its production schedule to accommodate a big customer like BP, it could still take months to deliver the pipe to northern Alaska.Bob Malone, the chairman of BP America, said the company would work to develop a parallel feeder network to keep the Prudhoe Bay field at least partly in production as the repairs are made.Speaking at a press conference on Monday, he said the company was looking at “opportunities that we feel technically competent that we can run certain portions of the field and continue production safely.”Other BP officials said alternate pipelines were identified and used after an earlier oil spill. The inspections that found the corrosion problem were undertaken after a major spill in March.Nevertheless, the Energy Information Administration, a part of the Energy Department, said the supply interruption from Alaska and the summer heat wave would drive up the price of oil up in August by $3 a barrel on average, to $76.50.The benchmark near-month contract for light, low-sulfur crude oil closed at $76.34 a barrel at the end of daytime trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, off 64 cents from Monday’s close.'"
"'06-08-08,'0','“I gave an order that, if within the coming days the diplomatic process does not reach a conclusion, Israeli forces will carry out the operations necessary to take control of Katyusha rocket launching sites in every location,” Mr. Peretz told a parliamentary committee in a statement broadcast on Israeli news media.He called this one of the most decisive stages of the war.As the diplomatic jockeying continued on Monday, Israeli airstrikes killed more than 50 people, making it one of deadliest days for Lebanon yet, Reuters reported.Foreign ministers of 20 Arab countries attended an emergency Arab League session in Beirut on Monday to register their disapproval of the resolution proposed by France and the United States. Lebanon’s prime minister, Fouad Siniora, in an emotional speech, dismissed the resolution as insufficient, insisting that it would allow Israeli troops to remain in southern Lebanon until an international force is deployed and would give Israel leeway to continue attacks in self-defense.“It barely leads to a cease-fire,” Mr. Siniora said. “We want a permanent and full cease-fire.”Mr. Siniora has lobbied for a plan calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and the return of displaced civilians, followed by the deployment of the Lebanese Army along the southern border, among other steps.The American-French proposal, worked out after a week of intensive talks between Paris and Washington, calls for a truce, asks the current United Nations peacekeeping force to monitor the border area and lays out a plan for a permanent cease-fire and political settlement. In the second phase of a two-step solution, the United Nations Security Council would follow up with a second resolution setting up an international force and addressing the conflict’s broader dimensions.Speaking to reporters from his ranch in Crawford, Tex., President Bush called for the resolution’s speedy adoption, but made clear that the main sticking point — Lebanon’s insistence that the draft be altered to require Israel to withdraw troops immediately — was nonnegotiable.“I understand both parties aren’t going to agree with all aspects of the resolution,” Mr. Bush said. He also conceded that diplomacy was taking longer than he would like.“I wish things happened quicker in the diplomatic realm,” he said.The foreign ministers, in a closing communiqué read by Mr. Siniora after the other officials rushed out of the country, warned the Security Council against adopting resolutions that do not serve Lebanon’s interests. The group dispatched a high-level delegation to New York to press Lebanon’s case.A Council meeting was set for Tuesday afternoon to hear the group, which includes the foreign ministers of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates and the league’s secretary general, Amr Moussa of Egypt.Jean-Marc de la Sablière, the French ambassador to the United Nations, said he would consider making changes in the text of the measure to meet Lebanon’s objections, saying, “We have to take into account the concerns of all.”John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, said, “We have to be thinking of ways to take their views into account but to continue to move to a vote as soon as other members of the Council want.”Members of the Council, criticized widely for not having taken action to stop the fighting, had hoped to vote Monday on the resolution, which was introduced by France and the United States on Saturday. The new delay meant that Wednesday was now the earliest a vote could be scheduled.Beirut offered an amendment on Sunday which would make Israel leave the country immediately, with the United Nations taking over for 72 hours before transferring control to the Lebanese military.In resisting Lebanon’s demand for a speedy pullout, Mr. Bush said such a withdrawal could create the “unacceptable” situation of allowing Hezbollah to flourish at the border. “Whatever happens at the U.N.,” he said, “we must not create a vacuum into which Hezbollah and its sponsors are able to move more weapons.”The president’s remarks, in a rare full-scale news conference at his Crawford ranch, were his first on the resolution since it was drafted over the weekend.He was joined by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who said there is “more agreement than you might think” about how to prevent another attack across the border by Hezbollah.In response to the Lebanese proposal to put its troops on the border, Dan Gillerman, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations said, “I’m very skeptical about the possibility of the Lebanese Army being able to do it.” He added, “They had their chance to do it for years when they had the power and the authority. To expect them to be able to do it now against the wishes of Hezbollah seems to me to be terribly naïve.”Mr. Bolton said the United States would listen to the dissident views, but he pointed out that the resolution had been worked out in close consultation with Lebanon and that Ms. Rice had spoken with Mr. Siniora, “I don’t know how many times over the past eight or nine days.”“It’s not as though we drafted this resolution in a closet somewhere and suddenly sprang the text on any member government,” he said.The violence escalated as the diplomatic efforts continued, as Israeli warplanes pounded the country while Hezbollah fired 111 rockets into Israel by early evening.Israeli bombs struck in and around Beirut’s southern suburbs as well as other areas of Lebanon.In southern Lebanon, two Israeli soldiers were killed by an antitank missile, The Associated Press reported, and a third was killed in an exchange of fire with Hezbollah guerrillas. In northern Israel, scores of Hezbollah rockets wounded five people, rescue workers said.In Tyre, bombs smashed four large apartment buildings, one of which was raided by Israeli commandos on Saturday. The buildings were largely empty and by early Monday evening, it was still not clear if there had been any casualties. Rescue workers said no one had been evacuated.Mr. Siniora, in his opening speech, announced tearfully that 40 civilians had died in an Israeli airstrike in the border village of Hula, in what he called “a horrible massacre, a deliberate massacre.”Later, however, he said that only one person had been found dead and that more than 50 people had been pulled from rubble in the village.“It turns out there was one person killed,” he said. “Thank God, they have been saved. But those who shoot to kill innocent people proved they have the intention to kill.”The Israeli Army issued a statement describing Hula as a “Hezbollah stronghold,” and saying that civilians had been warned away repeatedly. “Responsibility for any harm to Lebanese civilians lies with the Hezbollah terrorist organization which operates from within the civilian population,” it said.The Israeli Army said it killed 13 Hezbollah gunmen on Monday in fighting across southern Lebanon.Most of the Hezbollah rockets hit the northern towns of Kiryat Shmona, Safed and Nahariya, according to an Israeli Army spokesman.The air force attacked more than 150 targets in Lebanon within 24 hours, including rocket launchers in Tyre and Qana that Israel said were used for strikes on Haifa on Sunday.After the deaths of 15 Israelis on Sunday from rocket attacks, the Israeli government is under pressure to try to stop the rain of rockets on northern Israel, and the army says it can do that only if it can push Hezbollah rocket-launching teams beyond the Litani River, some 15 miles north of the border.A cease-fire that holds would make such a push unnecessary. The Israelis say that a push to the Litani would take time and would be costly in terms of casualties on both sides. But without a diplomatic solution, they say, the military advance must continue.The A.P. reported Monday that the Israeli Army had warned Lebanese south of the Litani not to go outdoors after 10 p.m.Israeli aircraft shot down a pilotless Hezbollah plane as it entered Israeli territory, Reuters reported.'"
"'06-08-08,'0','“They didn’t think he was going to hit for power, and he didn’t have the same command of the strike zone he has now, either,” said Jim Duquette, the Baltimore Orioles vice president who was Houston’s farm director for most of 1997.“They were also concerned about some of the same things you heard out of Philadelphia, that he didn’t have that fire or energy. But, really, you’d die for guys who have that even keel and the ability he has.”The Tampa Bay Devil Rays drafted Abreu, then flipped him to the Phillies in a prearranged deal for shortstop Kevin Stocker. The trade was a coup, but as well as Abreu played, he never took the Phillies to the playoffs. His restrained approach did not endear him to some fans.“They didn’t like it when he didn’t have dirt on his uniform,” said Larry Bowa, the Yankees’ third-base coach, who managed Abreu in Philadelphia. “If you don’t have dirt on your uniform, that doesn’t mean you’re not giving 100 percent. It just means you don’t have to dive.”The Yankees consulted with Bowa before trading for Abreu and absorbing the more than $21 million remaining on his contract. Bowa said he thought Abreu would be an ideal fit, and he raved about his makeup.“If he misplays a ball, he’ll come in and say: ‘That’s my fault. I should have caught it,’ ” Bowa said. “He doesn’t offer excuses.“He’s quiet, but you see him talking to guys in the locker room. He puts his uniform on and gets ready to play. He’s programmed to play 162 games every year.”That may be why Abreu, 32, does not crash into walls for fly balls. Bubba Crosby, a reserve outfielder who was designated for assignment last week, could play that way. Abreu, who has not been on the disabled list in nine years, seems to realize he must stay healthy.In the ninth inning Friday in Baltimore, with the Yankees leading by a run, Abreu let up at the wall on a slicing drive by Kevin Millar that landed just foul. The Yankees won anyway, and the non-play was a non-issue.Abreu had already flashed his defensive skill that game, throwing out a runner at second to cut down a rally. On Sunday, he went 3 for 4 and credited the hitting coach, Don Mattingly, for keeping him from pulling every pitch.Abreu is showing even more plate discipline than he did in Philadelphia. At the time of the trade, he had seen more pitches per plate appearance, 4.47, than any hitter in the National League. In six American League games, his average is 4.86.The Yankees’ Jaret Wright has faced Abreu 20 times in his career. Ten times, Abreu has reached base. Facing Abreu can be taxing, Wright said.“He fouls off a lot of pitches you’re supposed to make outs on,” Wright said. “He recognizes really early what each pitch is and where it’s going to end up.”Abreu has not homered since May 30, a drought he cannot explain, other than to say he is a line-drive hitter. But his many tools appealed to the Yankees.“If you put all the players we talked about on a sheet of paper,” Manager Joe Torre said, “he had the most check marks next to him as far as the type of player you wanted.”Comments like that must satisfy Abreu. When he came to the United States from Venezuela in 1991, his favorite players were not sluggers. He named the versatile Roberto Alomar as an early role model.“He’s not like one of those hitters who just gets the homers and that’s it,” Abreu said. “No — he does everything.”So can Abreu. Last season, he was the only player in the majors to win a Gold Glove while finishing in the top 10 in his league in runs scored, runs batted in, stolen bases and walks. Alomar also did it, in 1999.If those qualities have not made Abreu stand out yet, they probably never will, especially not in the Yankees’ deep lineup.Is he underappreciated? Abreu said he was not sure. Typically, it does not matter much to him.“To me, what really matters is just to play the game and try to contribute to win the games,” Abreu said. “Just go out there and do my job. I’ve been doing my job pretty much nine straight years. You can see consistency there. Sometimes you cannot control those things.”Abreu has learned that lesson already. What can he do?'"

The Interior Ministry said the group, the Center for Protecting Human Rights, had failed to obtain a valid operating permit. “Its activities are illegal and the violators of this decision will be prosecuted,’’ the ministry said. The group has defended dissidents and journalists and has repeatedly criticized Iran’s hard-line judiciary. Ms. Ebadi, who won the Nobel in 2003 and headed the Tehran City Court from 1975 until the revolution in 1979, after which women were banned from such posts, said her center needed no special permit under the Constitution.

"'06-08-08,'0','In a written ruling issued yesterday, Judge Scheindlin said that the money laundering charge — essentially, that Mr. Gotti received income from properties bought with money derived from crime — was stale.She wrote that the same charges were lodged against him in a case from 1999 and were dropped, by the government, when Mr. Gotti accepted a plea agreement and a prison sentence of more than six years.“The plea agreement cannot be both a sword and a shield,” the judge wrote, suggesting that the government was attempting to convict Mr. Gotti of a charge it had already withdrawn as part of a plea agreement.The racketeering charges were accusations that Mr. Gotti had used profits from loan-sharking and extortion to operate two holding companies. The judge wrote that they were “based on nothing but surmise, speculation and conjecture.”Judge Scheindlin did let stand one of the government’s new charges filed in May: an allegation that Mr. Gotti had conspired to “influence testimony” in the Brooklyn trial of Vincent Basciano, a Bonanno family boss. Mr. Basciano was convicted in May of racketeering.Charles Carnesi, Mr. Gotti’s lawyer, said yesterday that he was pleased with the ruling, but he refused to go into detail, citing an order not to comment on the case. Lauren McDonough, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, said she had no comment on the case.Judge Scheindlin’s ruling suggests that much of the evidence that the jury in the third trial is likely to hear was presented to two previous juries.In that regard, Mr. Gotti is two-thirds of the way toward matching a legal feat achieved by his father, who eluded conviction in three cases from 1986 to 1990, before ultimately being found guilty and receiving a life sentence in another case. He died in a prison hospital in 2002.The current case began only two months before the younger Mr. Gotti was to be released from prison on the 77-month term to which he agreed in his 1999 plea deal. As he sat in prison, a grand jury indicted him on charges of having Mr. Sliwa, who was the founder of the Guardian Angels, abducted from a taxicab near Avenue A in the East Village and shot at point-blank range — charges that have twice failed to land Mr. Gotti back in prison.'"

According to several people familiar with the presentations, Roger Goodell, the league’s chief operating officer and the front-runner to get the job, made an impressive appearance.It may take more than one ballot for Goodell to win the job, but there is a sense among the owners that Goodell could be within 2 or 3 votes of the 22 needed to win the job on the first ballot.“We had five good presentations,” said John Mara, co-owner of the Giants. “Hopefully, by the end of the day tomorrow, we’ll have a new commissioner.”The owners will resume interviews early Tuesday morning, and each candidate will meet with four groups of eight owners for about an hour of interviews. Monday’s presentations included each candidate giving a 30-minute statement, then answering two general questions from the selection committee chairmen, Dan Rooney and Jerry Richardson. But Tuesday’s interviews are intended to glean more detailed answers to how the candidates would approach the job.When the interviews are over, the owners will vote. The first ballot will be secret, and the results will be announced to the owners.The five candidates — Goodell, Gregg H. Levy, Frederick R. Nance, Robert L. Reynolds and Mayo A. Shattuck III — will remain on the ballot for the first three rounds of voting, and if a commissioner is not chosen, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will consult with members of the committee before determining whether to drop the lowest vote getter from successive ballots.'"
"'06-08-08,'0','In the latest stinging audit of a Long Island school district, State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi has accused the superintendent of the William Floyd School District of dispensing raises to himself and other administrators, awarding no-bid contracts, and overseeing millions of dollars in “inappropriate” expenditures while the school board, essentially, slept.The superintendent, Richard Hawkins, is a fixture in the school district who has retained the support of the school board and civic groups despite being at the helm last year when five officials, including the district treasurer and his assistant superintendent for business, were accused of stealing about $1.5 million in school funds.Mr. Hawkins could not be reached for comment on the audit. But in its official response, the school board called Mr. Hevesi’s charges “outlandish.” In a letter to Mr. Hevesi, the board members accused him of becoming overzealous in an atmosphere of suspicion created by the 2004 scandal at the Roslyn School District, in which administrators and employees were found to have stolen more than $11 million.But Mr. Hevesi remained adamant. “William Floyd school officials just don’t get it,” he said. “While at least five school officials have been arrested and four have pleaded guilty to theft or official misconduct, other officials were taking money in ways that were clearly inappropriate, and millions were spent without proper controls.”The audit covered the period between July 2003 and the end of June 2005.The William Floyd audit was one of 170 statewide school audits the comptroller’s office undertook after the Roslyn scandal, for which a lack of regular state audits were seen as a contributing factor. In the administration of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, state budget cuts eliminated financing for a system of audits that examined every school district in the state once every five years. On Long Island, besides Roslyn and William Floyd, the Hempstead School District has gotten sharp criticism from the comptroller’s office.'"
"'06-08-08,'0','“This brings closure to a personal matter and my personal nightmare has come to an end,” Ms. Stewart said yesterday in a statement.The case of Peter E. Bacanovic, Ms. Stewart’s former broker at Merrill Lynch, was included in the settlement. He will pay $75,645, including $510 in commissions he was paid for the ImClone sale and penalties. He has already been barred from working in the securities industry as a broker dealer.The sanctions take into account not only the suspected insider-trading activity but also the charges that Ms. Stewart and Mr. Bacanovic impeded the S.E.C.’s investigation.As part of the settlement, they neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.“At the end of the day, the S.E.C. got what it wanted by being able to restrict her activities,” said Marc D. Powers, a former S.E.C. lawyer who represented Douglas Faneuil, Mr. Bacanovic’s assistant at Merrill Lynch.“It’s fair from her perspective, too,” Mr. Powers said. “What is unfortunate is that this case could have been settled four years ago.”Shares of Martha Stewart Living edged up 7 cents yesterday, to $16.95.Negotiations between Ms. Stewart’s lawyers and the Securities and Exchange Commission began in April after the stay on the commission’s insider-trading case, filed in June 2003, was lifted.In that claim, regulators contended that Ms. Stewart received nonpublic information from Mr. Bacanovic that one of his clients, Samuel D. Waksal, then chief executive of ImClone, was selling his shares, prompting Ms. Stewart to sell her own stake and avoid a loss of $45,673.During a subsequent criminal trial, both Ms. Stewart and Mr. Bacanovic were convicted on charges of obstructing the investigation into the trade.According to lawyers involved in the talks, Ms. Stewart’s lawyers made the case in negotiations that Ms. Stewart should receive credit for having resigned as chairwoman and chief executive of Martha Stewart Living in June 2003 and thus should be allowed to recover her former titles sooner rather than later.But S.E.C. lawyers held firm, making the point that the commission does not factor in time served when imposing punishments, and they pushed for a sanction that would have some bite.“We thought that someone that engaged in her activity should not be on the board of a public company and should not be engaged in the compilation of financial statements of a public company,” said Helene T. Glotzer, a senior S.E.C. lawyer involved in the case.As a result, Ms. Stewart is prevented from fulfilling any executive responsibility that involves Martha Stewart Living’s finances, including auditing and compliance.This would include briefing financial analysts about the company’s profit outlook, a job usually carried out by a chief financial officer and one that Ms. Stewart has not done for years.What is likely to hurt Ms. Stewart a bit more is the prohibition from commenting publicly about Martha Stewart Living’s financial prospects in the presence of shareholders — an important symbolic function for someone like Ms. Stewart, who is both the company’s largest shareholder and its public voice.And while she is not allowed to fulfill directorial duties like voting or attending executive sessions, her large shareholding stake and her control of 92 percent of the company’s voting shares will make it difficult for the board to ignore her.'"

"'06-08-08,'0','Mr. Jobs said that in the last quarter, Apple shipped 1.33 million Macs, its best showing ever, and that three-quarters of the computers sold were Intel-based.Analysts agreed that Apple’s shift to Intel, in a quest to improve upon the performance of the Power PC chips developed by I.B.M. and Motorola, had been a success.“Apple’s product plan is in place and is coming together nicely,” said David C. Bailey, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, adding that the transition to Intel chips is an integral part of the plan.“We see the next version of the Macs very tightly intertwined with the Intel transition in that together they can drive an accelerated upgrade cycle within Apple’s installed base as well as attract new users.”Still, the company’s stock turned downward after the Apple event and closed at $67.21, off 1.6 percent. Analysts attributed the drop to disappointment that there was no announcement of a major consumer item, like a new iPod.“The expectations had run out of control about what new products Apple was going to come out with,” said Gene Munster, a research analyst at Piper Jaffray, which has a buy recommendation on the stock. “So when the reality was just the new Mac Pro, investors were disappointed.”Mr. Bailey, whose firm also has a buy recommendation on Apple stock, agreed.“People misunderstood that the audience today were Apple developers, interested in the operating system and development tools,” Mr. Bailey said.Indeed, the parts of Mr. Jobs’s keynote address that drew the most cheers and applause were those that only a roomful of geeks could love: a “shared L2 cache,” “667-megahertz DDR2 fully buffered memory,” and “independent 1.33-gigahertz front-side buses” for the new Mac Pro.“For people expecting an iPod announcement, it just wasn’t the right audience for that,” said Mr. Bailey.In his address, Mr. Jobs detailed features that would be included in the next version of the Macintosh operating system, known as Leopard: a new data and file recovery feature called Time Machine; upgrades to the Apple Mail program; new animation and conferencing software; and Spaces, a new way to group and view applications.Mr. Jobs also took occasional swipes at Microsoft — “our friends up north” — which has yet to release its successor to Windows XP, known as Vista.Apple has introduced four versions of its operating system since Microsoft brought out Windows XP in 2001. The current version of OS X is known as Tiger.“My guess is that Vista is going to pale beside Tiger, much less Leopard,” Mr. Jobs said in the interview. He said Leopard would be released next spring.Mr. Jobs also said that Leopard would include Boot Camp, a program that allows users to run the Windows operating system on a Macintosh, but not simultaneously with the Macintosh operating system.At the same time, VMware, a company in Palo Alto, Calif., announced a product that allows users to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on an Intel-based Macintosh computer.Parallels, a company in Herndon, Va., also sells a virtualization product called Parallels Desktop for Mac, which allows the two operating systems to run simultaneously.Although Apple’s share of the personal computer market remains low, at less than 5 percent in the United States, according to the market research firm IDC, Mr. Jobs pointed out that 50 percent of customers who buy a Macintosh in an Apple retail store are first-time Mac buyers.Mr. Jobs declined to comment at length on the company’s internal investigation of irregularities in the granting of Apple stock options since 1997.He did say that there is no investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.'"

"'06-08-08,'0','NEW DELHI, Aug. 7 — The Bush administration is organizing a business delegation to India this fall, potentially the largest such mission ever to a single country, an administration official said Monday, and one that underscores the economic potential of a nation of 1.1 billion, with an annual growth rate of 8 percent.“That’s a reflection of interest in India,” the official, Assistant Secretary of State Richard A.

"'06-08-08,'0','LOCARNO, Switzerland, Aug. 7 (AP) — Daniel Schmid, one of Switzerland’s best-known film and opera directors, died on Saturday in his hometown, Flims, in eastern Switzerland. He was 64.His death followed a battle with cancer, said Marcel Hoehn, a producer of Mr. Schmid’s best-known film, “Il Bacio di Tosca” (1984), or “Tosca’s Kiss.”Mr. Schmid studied filmmaking at the German Film and Television Academy in Berlin, and began directing TV films in 1970.The first theatrical film he directed was the experimental “Heute Nacht Oder Nie” (1972), also known as “Tonight or Never,” about servants and masters in an old castle who switch roles for one night every year.He also appeared in front of the camera in a number of films, including playing alongside Dennis Hopper and Bruno Ganz in Wim Wenders’s 1977 “Der Amerikanische Freund” (“The American Friend”).'"
"'06-08-08,'0','WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 — The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday that it would not challenge a federal appeals court ruling that overturned its new rules for the oversight of hedge funds.Because the appellate court’s decision was based on several grounds and was unanimous, “further appeal would be futile and would simply delay and distract from our goal of advancing investor protection,” the S.E.C.’s chairman, Christopher Cox, said in a statement.But as early as this week, the S.E.C. will introduce an antifraud rule under the Investment Advisers Act that would require more information on hedge fund investors. “At my direction,” Mr. Cox said, “commission staff are also considering whether we should increase the minimum asset and income requirements for individuals who invest in hedge funds.”Mr. Cox has pushed for emergency regulations on hedge funds, which are high-risk investment pools that have catered to institutions and very wealthy individuals but are increasingly attracting investors with less ability to tolerate risk.The S.E.C. regulations overturned by the court had required most hedge fund managers to register with the agency, thereby opening the funds’ books to S.E.C. examiners.In its decision on June 23, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sent the oversight program, which sharply divided the five commissioners when it was adopted in October 2004, back to the agency to be reviewed.'"
"'06-08-08,'0','Captain Brian Chontosh is the kind of soldier who, in years past, would have received a ticker-tape parade down Fifth Avenue.As a young lieutenant in 2003, he and his platoon were ambushed near Baghdad. Machine gun fire, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades spewed from every direction. Lieutenant Chontosh ordered his Humvee directly into an enemy machine-gun position, where his gunner destroyed the nest. He then advanced on a trench, where he exited his vehicle and scattered enemy fighters. After his ammunition was depleted, he twice picked up an enemy’s rifle and continued.By the time the smoke cleared, Lieutenant Chontosh had killed more than 20 insurgents and saved the lives of dozens in his platoon. For his incredible courage, he was awarded the Navy Cross, the second-highest award given to Marines.For reasons I can’t fathom, the Pentagon top brass don’t feel that our heroes in Iraq and Afghanistan are especially meritorious. President Bush has yet to award a single Medal of Honor to a living veteran of combat in either place. (Only one has been given posthumously.)During the Vietnam War, 245 Medals of Honor were awarded. If President Bush awarded the medals at roughly the same rate for service in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than two dozen would have been bestowed by now.When I called the Department of Defense to inquire, a public affairs officer said he wondered whether our fighting style might be less risky today than it was in Vietnam. How lame. Fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan has been brutal, and many of our troops have performed with incredible valor. Anyone remember Falluja?This is more than an issue of justice denied. Tales of courage inspire present and future warriors. They certainly motivated my service in the Marine Corps in Vietnam. Today, two of my four sons are good bets to join the Marines or Special Forces. I don’t want them to look to my generation for heroes, but to their contemporaries.'"
"'06-08-08,'0','Five participants recovered from depression in the first day and were still significantly improved a week later. Most patients also received a placebo treatment during the study, an injection of saline solution, and showed no improvement.Dr. Zarate said experimenting with novel approaches was crucial because the current crop of antidepressant drugs worked slowly and weakly, if at all, for millions of patients.Ketamine affects the brain in a way entirely different from drugs like Prozac, and it has shown some antidepressant effects in animal studies. It had not been tried for depression in humans.“What the study tells us is that we can break this sound barrier, in effect, and get an almost immediate response that we cannot get with other drugs,” Dr. Zarate said.Ketamine is not approved for depression, and it has a checkered past in psychiatric research. The drug often induces hallucinations, like whispering voices and light trails, and researchers used it in the 1990’s to induce psychotic reactions in people with schizophrenia — an experiment widely criticized as unethical.Dr. Zarate said that neither doctors nor patients should use it for depression outside of carefully controlled research settings and that the results of the current trial should be considered suggestive. “This drug should be seen as a tool for understanding what mechanisms might be involved in rapid relief,” and not as a treatment, Dr. Zarate said.The study of suicide risk, led by Dr. Mark Olfson of Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, was based on an analysis of Medicaid records of more than 4,400 people who were hospitalized for depression in 1999 and 2000.The researchers found no link between the antidepressant drugs and suicidal behavior in depressed patients 19 or older. But children and adolescents in the study who were taking antidepressants were about 50 percent more likely than those not on the drugs to try to kill themselves. And they were about 15 times as likely as those not on the medications to complete the act, although the number of suicides was too small to draw definitive conclusions, the authors cautioned.In addition, there could be differences between the two groups that the Medicaid records didn’t reveal: the children who received the drugs may have been more severely ill, skewing the results, they said.In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration required strong warnings on the labels of antidepressant drugs alerting parents and doctors of a possible suicide risk in some children. Since then many psychiatrists have been skeptical of the suicide link.“I was surprised by what we found,” Dr. Olfson said. “I set out thinking we’d find that the drugs” significantly reduced suicide risk.The findings may prompt researchers to look at which children are most at risk, rather than continuing to debate whether the risk exists, he said.'"
"'06-08-08,'0','Am I one of them? Do I want to find out? There is no way to do that yet, but Decode Genetics, the Icelandic company whose researchers found the gene variant, is planning to market a test, possibly by 2007 or 2008. It will probably cost hundreds of dollars, and be available only through doctors.At first glance, testing doesn’t seem to offer much to people like me. We already figure the deck is stacked against us. Even if the test came out negative, I would still suspect I was at risk, but from some other gene that hasn’t been discovered yet.Then again, if I tested positive, the threat would seem more real. Maybe I would eat less, exercise more, check my blood sugar more often, keep better track of risk factors for heart disease like cholesterol and blood pressure. I would also have to decide whether to inflict the information on my sons.I’m not sure I want that straight-up shot of reality. Even with my family history, I figure there’s a chance I got lucky and didn’t inherit whatever my mother had. A test could erode that bit of optimism.Dr. David Altshuler, a diabetes expert at Harvard who has studied the gene variants, said he thought offering a routine genetic test now would be premature.He said the test would not help people who already know they are at risk because of their family histories or because they have impaired glucose tolerance, a condition that often leads to diabetes. They should already be trying to exercise and lose weight, or taking a medication to treat the glucose problem, he said.“There may be people who would say, ‘If I knew my risk was 50 percent instead of 30 percent, I would like to know that to make me try harder,’ ” Dr. Altshuler said. “You could argue that either of those is really high, and you should be trying hard already.”He also cautioned that people who do get tested must keep in mind that a positive result does not seal their fate: their risk is higher, but not absolute. Similarly, those who test negative are not in the clear. If they have other risk factors they still have to be careful, because other genes are almost certainly involved in diabetes as well.Dr. Richard Kahn, chief scientific and medical officer for the American Diabetes Association, had similar concerns and said the research was important, but, “translating it into some practical action is a long ways away.”Dr. Altshuler said another reason for his wariness is that “there is another gold rush in this, in diagnostics.”He praised Decode as first-rate in terms of science and ethics, but he said he worried about other companies looking to cash in on legitimate research by marketing questionable genetic tests directly to consumers.“A lot of companies will push the idea of doing genetic testing — ‘You can have this done, we’ll give you advice,’ ’’ he said. “I’m deeply concerned. Companies are pushing things that aren’t valid, saying send us your DNA and we’ll give you advice about lifestyle or diet based on your genetic profile. Very little is known, let alone anything with implications.” But, he noted wryly, despite all his reservations he has not been able to talk his own mother out of wanting the genetic test for Type 2 diabetes.The Federal Trade Commission is also concerned. Last month, its Web site carried a warning that there were no valid studies to support many genetic tests being marketed to consumers to gauge their disease risks or suggest they need dietary supplements or special diets.Dr. Kari Stefansson, Decode’s chief executive, said genetic tests that measure the probability of developing a disease “are a new sort of information that our society is growing rapidly more accustomed to, but it is still not absolutely clear how we are going to use it.”The first use of a Type 2 diabetes test, he said, would probably be in people with impaired glucose tolerance. Those who came out positive could be treated aggressively, perhaps with drugs. Those who tested negative could be offered a more conservative approach.For people with a family history and normal glucose tolerance, Dr. Stefansson said, the best use of the test would be to test both the relative with diabetes and the concerned family member. If both tested positive, then the family member was at high risk and could try to do something about it.What about people like me, whose diabetic relatives are long gone? I could be tested, he said, and if I had the risky variant it might be a warning sign. But if I didn’t have it, I still wouldn’t be out of the woods.So what do I want to do? Right now, I’m leaning toward having the test if it becomes available. I’m not sure what I’d do with the results or whether they would mean anything for my future. But I’d like the information, and the right to decide for myself whether to act on it.'"

"'06-08-09,'0','Glass, Lewis & Company recommended yesterday that shareholders of the H.J. Heinz Company approve Nelson Peltz, a dissident investor, for its board at its upcoming annual shareholders meeting, the third major proxy advisory firm to back his efforts.“Heinz is a company with great brands, good products, fine people and a disappointing stock price,” Glass Lewis said. “Try as it might, the current board has failed to produce satisfactory returns for shareholders for a long stretch of time. We believe change at Heinz is necessary.”The endorsements make it likely that Mr. Peltz and his dissident group will win at least one board seat and maybe more at Heinz, experts said. Mr. Peltz and his Trian Group are running five candidates for the board at the company’s Aug. 16 meeting. Heinz has vociferously opposed the dissident candidates, contending they could divide the board if elected.“These things are never over until they are over, but there is a good likelihood that Peltz will win some representation on the Heinz board,” said Bruce Goldfarb, senior managing director of Georgeson Shareholder, a proxy solicitation firm that is not involved in the Heinz fight.The Glass, Lewis recommendation comes days after the dominant proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, backed three of the five Trian nominees. Another service, Proxy Governance Inc., has said Heinz holders should back Peltz, but not the four other Trian nominees.In a statement, Heinz said it “strongly disagreed” with Glass Lewis that shareholders should withhold votes for any of its nominees and urged its shareholders to “make the right choice and re-elect all 12 Heinz directors.”'"
"'06-08-09,'0','“I spent a lot of time this summer talking to different people about chemistry,” Thomas said, “because one of the things that was written and said and that’s true about us is the chemistry wasn’t right. And what Jared brings to us, more so than talent, he brings chemistry. I think he balances your locker room. He balances the plane ride. Relationshipwise, in a group setting, he’s the chemical piece that makes everything kind of work, in a strange kind of way.”Those are heavy responsibilities for a player who has logged just four seasons in the N.B.A. and who is not expected to lead the Knicks in any statistical category. Jeffries, who signed a five-year, $30 million contract, has career averages of 6.1 points and 4.8 rebounds a game. He has never scored more than 20 points or converted more than seven field goals in a game.But the Knicks are rich in scoring and poor in just about everything else. And Jeffries is a known quantity to Thomas. They learned their greatest hoop lessons from Bob Knight, the legendary college coach who spent most of his career at Indiana. Jeffries grew up in Bloomington, Ind., and was 12 when he first met Thomas.It was that relationship, and the chance for a new start, that drew Jeffries to the Knicks. He turned down a comparable offer from the Wizards last month and declined similar offers from several other teams, including Philadelphia.Jeffries laughed when he was asked why he would leave the Wizards, who have made the playoffs the last two seasons, for the Knicks, who last season posted their worst record in two decades.It seems that Jeffries is comfortable with chaos, and with being a part of the solution.“When I was at Indiana, I was there two weeks and they fired Coach Knight,” he said. “Two years later I’m in a national title game. I’m in D.C., Michael Jordan drafts me, they fire him that year. Two years later we’re in the playoffs, we get to the second round. I enjoy being part of something special.”Thomas spoke excitedly about the prospect of a frontcourt of 6-11 players — Jeffries, Channing Frye and Eddy Curry — all of them 23 or 24 years old. The addition of Jeffries, however, will only exacerbate the Knicks’ glut of players at shooting guard and small forward.Jeffries will most likely start ahead of the 33-year-old Jalen Rose, and his arrival pushes Quentin Richardson back to a crowded backcourt. Thomas intends to start Stephon Marbury and Steve Francis at the guard spots and must find minutes for Richardson, Jamal Crawford and Nate Robinson.Frye and David Lee will probably receive most of the minutes at power forward. Frye and Jerome James will back up Curry at center.That means five players with guaranteed contracts could be out of the rotation, including the veterans Malik Rose and Maurice Taylor, the rookies Renaldo Balkman and Mardy Collins and either Jalen Rose or Richardson.Thomas has said he will keep a shorter rotation and a more consistent lineup than Brown did, so there are bound to be bruised egos next season if he leaves the roster as is.“I can deal with it being a little uncomfortable,” he said. “I’m not necessarily looking as a head coach to make a nice, comfortable bed.”That seemed an appropriate outlook, given that Thomas himself is on shaky employment ground. James L. Dolan, the Garden chairman, has given Thomas a one-year ultimatum to make significant progress, or lose his job. Thomas also has a sexual-harassment lawsuit from a former Knicks employee hanging over him, as well as the hangover from one stressful season working with Brown.Thomas was in an unusually philosophical mood yesterday, noting that he had discovered the practice of yoga.“It’s definitely made a difference in my thought process and definitely has helped me through some pretty challenging times this year,” he said. “I definitely feel more at a peaceful place, even though I’m in a stressful, pressure situation.”'"
"'06-08-09,'0','There are often regional disparities, too; the West Coast, for example, is likely to be hit hardest by the closing of Prudhoe Bay, experts said, because the Alaskan oil mostly feeds refineries in the West.Even ethanol, the alcohol additive that is being used more frequently as a component in the nation’s fuel supply, can be a point of division. Environmentalists like the additive because it pollutes less, but some energy experts say that ethanol-gas mixtures are less efficient as a fuel and may be leading to more gas consumption. Some ethanol is in about a third of the nation’s gasoline supply, up sharply from last year.In the Pew Research survey of 1,182 Americans — 1,048 of them drivers — 55 percent said they were driving less because of the recent increases in gasoline prices. The poll, taken from June 20 to July 16, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.Yet Americans’ overall gasoline appetite has barely budged. Total use this year is up about one-half percent to 1 percent compared with 2005, according to federal figures — a slower rate of growth than in the past, but hardly the mark of a nation with its foot fully on the brake.There are anecdotal glimpses of a drop in driving. The number of passengers taking rail service in Los Angeles County in June was up 11 percent from last year. And the number of cars passing through the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 in the Colorado Rockies, which has been rising slightly since 2002, fell slightly in July compared with the same time last year. The decrease is the first since 2001, according to the State Department of Transportation.Anna Samson, 24, a psychology major at the University of Southern Maine in Portland, said that for her the issue of gasoline supplies came down to milk — at least this week.“Last night I realized I didn’t have milk for breakfast, and that I wasn’t going to eat breakfast in the morning,” Ms. Samson said Tuesday in an interview. “I wasn’t going to go out to get milk because I have to take my car to work, and I didn’t want to use the gas.”Experts say the apparent paradox of public reaction to price increases — a majority of people saying they are driving less, but more gas is still being sold year after year — could be explained by several factors, not the least of which is that people sometimes give pollsters and reporters answers they think are more socially acceptable or expected.“We don’t really know the impacts of all these things,” said John C. Duff, manager of the weekly petroleum status report surveys for the Federal Energy Information Administration.Mr. Duff said that demand for gasoline this year had definitely flattened, compared with previous years’ increases, suggesting that some people were using less. But those cutbacks may be overwhelmed by other forces, including bigger cars and more miles being driven by a growing population, and perhaps, he said, reduced mileage from cars burning more ethanol.Researchers at Pew say the pattern of consumers using less when high prices linger has been seen before, in the gasoline price spikes of the 1970’s and early 1980’s. Per capita consumption of gasoline has fairly consistently mirrored the average price per gallon since at least 1977, falling when prices increased, rising when prices fell, according to the Pew study, which is scheduled to be released Wednesday.Other experts say the nation’s shifting economic, demographic and urban terrain in recent years — greater disparity of rich and poor than in the 1970’s, and more transportation options than a generation ago, including mass transit rail lines in more cities and hybrid cars — is making this spike different.Jose Vargas said he thought the changes he had made to conserve gasoline were probably permanent, for better or worse.Mr. Vargas, 45, said he used to hop into his gas-guzzling GMC Jimmy, a sport utility vehicle, and drive to work in downtown Manhattan from his home in West New York, N.J. Now he rides the bus. He used to drive to the beach at Sandy Hook, N.J., about 30 miles away, three or four times a month. Now he mostly stays home.Mr. Vargas predicted that gasoline would reach $3.50 a gallon before the end of the month, and he shook his head in disbelief.“It’s only going to get more expensive, and once it goes up, it will never come down,” he said.'"
"'06-08-09,'0','First, pro-Lamont bloggers speculated that the Lieberman campaign had not paid its bills. The Lieberman campaign denied that, and said its site had been attacked. Some Lamont supporters contended that the Lieberman campaign had become the victim of its own cheap Web site, which they said was easily overwhelmed, while others suggested that the whole thing was a dirty trick to distract attention from a potential Lieberman loss. Others asked why another Lieberman campaign Web site that criticizes Mr. Lamont, MeetNed.com, was working.The Lieberman campaign acknowledged that it had no evidence that its opponents were behind the crash. Connecticut officials said that they were investigating, and that they had contacted the F.B.I.“At this point, I really can’t comment on what kind of evidence we have, if any, of purposeful interference or hacking,” Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, said in an interview. He said that there were “potentially a variety of explanations.’’The Web site consultant employed by the Lieberman campaign said yesterday afternoon that the network went down after being deluged by server queries.“It’s like trying to drink from a fire hose,’’ said the consultant, Dan Geary, whose one-person company, Geary Internet Services, is based in Las Vegas. He acknowledged that he was not an Internet security expert.Mr. Geary disputed claims made by Lamont supporters that the Lieberman site was running on a cheap Internet service that did not have enough bandwidth. He said that shortly after the campaign began, a video of a bear cub had overloaded the site, and as a result he put the campaign on a custom plan that could handle increased traffic.The Lieberman campaign had access to 200 gigabytes of data capacity a month, he said, a figure that is significantly higher than the capacity of 10 gigabytes a month, which had been cited by Lamont supporters.Mr. Geary said that claims by Lamont supporters that the site was being run by a single, inexpensive computer were also inaccurate. He said that he had contracted with a Dallas-based Web company, Server Matrix, as the host of Joe2006.com. Executives at Server Matrix did not return phone calls seeking comment.It was only fitting that a primary effort by both Mr. Lamont and Mr. Lieberman that practically began on the Web should end there, too.Bloggers provided forums for criticism of Senator Lieberman’s pronouncements on Iraq. They posted links to a video of President Bush planting what looked like a kiss on Mr. Lieberman’s cheek after the 2005 State of the Union address.Thrown in the mix were name-calling, thought-provoking analyses of the senator’s stances on issues from Social Security to the Terri Schiavo right-to-die case, and reporting on campaign donations.It all paved the way for Mr. Lamont, a virtually unknown cable executive, to enter the race and be taken seriously. Bloggers watched as the points they made began to catch on, and then as the mainstream news media that they distrust alternately caricatured them as angry liberal lunatics or tried to anoint them the new Democratic kingmakers.'"

"'06-08-09,'0','Fitzgerald has handled the death of Walker, who was 52, in a manner that those close to him have come to expect. He grieves in private, yet he is a cornerstone for support in public.Steve Schnur, a quarterback who played with Fitzgerald at Northwestern from 1993 to 1996, said Fitzgerald’s composure during a speech at Walker’s funeral was impressive.“Somebody like Pat is a rock, one of the core guys that brings people together,” Schnur said in a telephone interview. “I think people look to people like Pat to see how they respond. If they’re composed and stoic, it rubs off and filters throughout the rest of the team.”Fitzgerald is by no means immune to the pain an unexpected death can bring, though he has learned to deal with it.He played linebacker for the Wildcats and was a teammate of defensive back Marcel Price, who died in 1995. He was also teammates with fullback Matt Hartl and defensive tackle Bobby Russ, both of whom died in 1999, while Fitzgerald was an assistant at Colorado. Fitzgerald returned to Northwestern to be an assistant coach in 2001, the year that safety Rashidi Wheeler died.Price was accidentally shot and killed by a friend who was playing with a handgun. Russ was shot and killed by a Chicago police officer after a traffic stop led to a short highway pursuit. Russ’s family was awarded $9.6 million in a civil suit in 2003.Hartl was a folk hero of sorts at Northwestern, overcoming Hodgkin’s disease in 1996 to return to the field in 1997. But he had a relapse and died two years later.Fitzgerald’s perspective has also been shaped by deaths in his own family. He has lost all four of his grandparents and two uncles. Death, he said, was “probably the toughest life lesson that you’re going to learn.”He added, “There is a lesson to learn from it, and it is that if you take the special qualities that that person gave to you and taught you, then their legacy and who they are will never leave you.”Rick Taylor, who was the athletic director at Northwestern from 1994 to 2003, said he would never be used to dealing with death.“Each one chips away and takes a part of you,” he said in a telephone interview. “The kids are in the prime of their lives. Young people aren’t supposed to die.”Fitzgerald’s faith-based upbringing has helped him come to terms with the deaths. He is an Irish Catholic from Chicago’s South Side. He cries behind closed doors but is typically able to move forward quickly, as was the case with the deaths of family members, said his father, Pat Fitzgerald Sr.“Usually, the things that have happened personally within the family, he’s been that rock that has helped me through those instances,” Fitzgerald Sr. said.Gary Barnett, who coached Fitzgerald at Northwestern, said Fitzgerald could always make people believe in something bigger. That disposition helped make him a two-time all-American and a two-time national defensive player of the year.“Pat always had a sense about him that things were going to be good, that things were going to go in the right direction,” Barnett said by telephone.Fitzgerald will try to convey such a message to his players. He said communicating with his players and monitoring their emotions would be important in helping them move past Walker’s death.In 1995, the Northwestern team honored Price with the motto “Big Six,” a reference to his jersey number. He was considered the inspiration behind their Rose Bowl run.Fitzgerald said he would try to draw motivation through Walker this season. Players will wear a patch on their uniforms that says, “Walk.” The word will also be painted on Ryan Field, the team’s home stadium.“Through the darkest hours, you’re able to find some things that maybe motivate your players and take them to a place where they can’t take themselves,” Fitzgerald said.That belief will guide him through his first season as the Wildcats’ head coach. He said he planned to implement the same system, philosophy and methods as Walker — in football and in life.“We’re going to obviously try to memorialize Coach Walker in a lot of different ways,” Fitzgerald said. “I think, more importantly, the legacy is the morals and the values that we hold true to our program.”For Fitzgerald, the transition period has meant lots of work and little time to do it.Over the past month, his days started between 5 and 5:30 a.m. with a warm shower. He then headed to the football offices next to Ryan Field. There, he prepared practice schedules, held meetings nonstop and dealt with hiring someone to take his former job as linebackers coach.At lunchtime, Fitzgerald would run along Lake Michigan. He has been doing that for years, using the time to think.Fitzgerald said he made sure to be home by 8 p.m. to have dinner with his wife, Stacy, and chase around their 20-month-old son, Jack, before tucking him into bed.During his recent runs, Fitzgerald said, he has thought about his family and what he will name his second child, who is due next month. If it is a boy, he will pick the name. If it is a girl, his wife will choose. He also has thought about his players. And his thoughts often return to Walker and his family.Fitzgerald said he missed driving through Evanston and seeing a bare-chested Walker mowing his front lawn. But he has come to accept the loss.“If you decide to start asking yourself why, you’ll never sleep and you’ll never be able to use the positives you learned from that experience with that person,” he said. “All that does is lead you into places that really are not helping you move through the tough times.”'"
"'06-08-09,'0','Jennifer Allen, executive director of the Border Action Network in Tucson, an advocacy group, said escalating deaths and the spate of crashes showed that the crackdown on the border had deadly consequences that policy makers in Washington often ignored. Ms. Allen questioned the use of the spike strip, which Border Patrol officials said appeared to have been properly deployed and generally causes vehicles to slow to a stop.“The practices are lethal,” Ms. Allen said. “It should not be a death sentence to flee the Border Patrol.”The Border Patrol said it began seeing a surge in vehicle deaths in 2003, the start of a major push in border enforcement. Deaths in motor vehicle accidents jumped to 40 that year from 22 the previous year.Since October, the start of the government’s fiscal year, there have been 42 deaths in accidents during illegal crossings at the Mexican border, already more than the 36 recorded all of last year.“You are seeing smuggling organizations and the people who put their hands in smuggling organizations with a total disregard for human life,” said Mario Martinez, a spokesman for the Border Patrol in Washington.The vehicles either crossed the border in rough terrain or picked up people who had already crossed at arranged places in the field or in safe houses, Mr. Martinez said.Local police said the crashes often involved increasingly risky smugglers desperate not to get caught and not to lose their payment, generally around $3,000 a person, for delivering immigrants to their destinations.Major Wilmot said the smugglers “even ram into patrol cars trying to get away.”Figures were not immediately available for the number of injuries in such crashes, Mr. Martinez said, but they are believed to be high. In February, a van carrying 28 people crashed near the Mexican border in San Diego, injuring 20 people.In April, near Sonoita, Ariz., 4 illegal immigrants died and 21 were injured when their truck overturned.Often, officials said, the vehicles are in disrepair, making the trip ever more perilous.In general, as enforcement tightens across the 2,000-mile border, smuggling by car seems to be increasing. Arrests of illegal immigrants in the San Ysidro section of San Diego and the Otay Mesa section of Chula Vista, together the biggest ports of entry, have increased in recent years.Arrests of people being smuggled in cars tripled to just under 50,000 last year from 19,000 in 2001. This year, however, such captures have decreased to about 14,000 since October, with customs and Border Patrol officials theorizing that smugglers have been deterred by additional screening of vehicles put in place in January, more officers and dogs searching cars, and other efforts.Advocates for immigrants said the deaths Monday and an overall increase in recent years arise from immigrants making ever more desperate efforts to cross the border.Last year, a record 473 died along the Southwest border, most of them succumbing to desert heat that regularly exceeds 100 degrees or drowning in rivers. This year, 353 people have died, a 6 percent drop from the same period last year.'"
"'06-08-09,'0','“This is definitely a big victory for Intel and all the others on the WiMax side,” said Charles Golvin, a wireless analyst at Forrester Research. “To get Sprint to commit gives tremendous credibility to WiMax.”Intel wants to use WiMax to build on the success of its Centrino chip, which is included in many laptop computers to allow users to log on to the Internet at Wi-Fi hot spots.More broadly, Intel has long wanted to create a global wireless network that mirrors today’s land-based Internet, in which dozens of competitors build equipment to support a single open standard. Cellular networks have traditionally been less open than the Internet — that is, they have operated on several incompatible systems — though cellular carriers like Sprint are starting to move toward the more open Internet standard.As a result, Mr. Forsee said, prices for WiMax equipment will fall more quickly, since manufacturers will be able to get access to the technology more cheaply. That, in turn, will help Sprint cut prices quickly to spur demand. Sprint says it expects to reach a third of the country’s population with its new network by the end of 2008.Companies including Motorola and Samsung will manufacture the network infrastructure equipment that Sprint will purchase, and Intel will sell wireless chips for handsets and other devices that will support the WiMax standard.Sprint’s WiMax gambit could put pressure on competitors like Cingular and Verizon Wireless, and on equipment makers, to move toward more open standards and what the industry refers to as “network neutrality,” a network design in which all types of data traffic are treated equally by the network operators.“It does have the prospect of being an alternative route into the home,” said Jonathan Atkin, a telecommunications analyst at RBC Capital Markets.In many ways, Sprint has positioned itself as a substitute to the Bell companies, which own Cingular and Verizon Wireless and have alarmed technology companies and consumer advocates who say they control too many of the nation’s networks.Sprint provides Internet phone services to cable companies, who are now competing head to head with the regional Bells. It is also working with Comcast, Time Warner and other cable providers to develop wireless devices that dovetail with their video and phone services. Mr. Forsee said those cable companies would be able to gain access to Sprint’s WiMax network.Intel executives have long backed WiMax as an alternative to wired cable modem and D.S.L. broadband networks. Until now, the technology has been used mostly in underserved rural markets and by companies that can afford high-capacity data connections. Intel has also made progress in South Korea, which is using a version of WiMax called WiBro, and in developing countries like Brazil and Pakistan.Intel’s No. 2 executive, Sean Maloney, who until recently ran the company’s wireless businesses, said in an interview last month that WiMax had important performance advantages over Qualcomm’s EV-DO wireless data technology, now used by Sprint and Verizon Wireless.Yesterday, a Qualcomm executive acknowledged that in theory WiMax has had an advantage in one aspect of wireless network performance, known as latency, which determines the actual speed at which data flows over a network.But he said that that advantage would disappear in a future version of EV-DO technology.“We always support innovation and competition,” said the executive, Jeffrey K. Belk, senior vice president for marketing. “This announcement raised more questions about mobile WiMax than it answered.”He said Qualcomm thought that the current generation of mobile broadband wireless technology had an element of ubiquity and that remained a significant advantage.'"

"'06-08-09,'0','The skullcap can stay on the Coast Guard auxiliarist’s head after all.Jack Rosenberg, a 35-year-old Hasidic Jew from Rockland County, signed up for the Coast Guard Auxiliary last year and passed his training, only to be informed that regulations forbade him to wear his skullcap during some duties.Much as he loves his country, Mr. Rosenberg was not about to doff his skullcap, which a Hasid normally sheds only to shower or to swim, so his uniform stayed in the closet.Now he does not have to. The Coast Guard is issuing new regulations allowing members to wear religious headgear, a spokesman for the guard, Chief Petty Officer Daniel Tremper, said yesterday. This brings the guard, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, into line with the armed forces under the Defense Department, which have permitted religious garb since 1987.Coast Guard auxiliary members’ duties include flying on domestic search-and-rescue missions. Mr. Rosenberg, a tire technician in Spring Valley and a certified pilot, had been sworn in when the skullcap issue arose. “I never considered it a problem,” he said yesterday, “only a bump in the road.”The old rules said religious clothing could not be visible. Mr. Rosenberg’s Coast Guard cap is big enough to conceal his six-inch black velvet skullcap, but there are times when auxiliarists may not wear their guard caps, such as when they are indoors, and then Mr. Rosenberg’s skullcap would show.In March, Assemblyman Dov Hikind of Brooklyn, who has a large Orthodox Jewish constituency, urged the Coast Guard to change its rules, arguing that it was hardly in the guard’s interest to turn away able-bodied volunteers. Other elected officials followed suit.'"
"'06-08-09,'0','Earlier this year, senior Quellos executives and Quellos-affiliated firms received subpoenas from a federal grand jury in Manhattan, which has been investigating the roles played in abusive tax shelters by individuals and companies including Deutsche Bank, Ernst & Young and former employees of the accounting firm KPMG, 16 of whom are under criminal indictment stemming from their tax shelter work. Quellos and its current and former employees are not targets in the investigation, according to people close to the inquiry.The Internal Revenue Service, meanwhile, has been conducting a tax shelter promoter audit of the firm, which can in theory lead to civil penalties or a criminal referral to the Justice Department for further investigation. Quellos has told investors that it is cooperating with federal prosecutors and the I.R.S.Michael Gross, a spokesman for Quellos, said that “long ago we ceased involvement in the area of tax-advantaged strategies, which was never our core business, and we are deeply disturbed by the recent unfair and inaccurate portrayal of our firm and its activities.’’Quellos was founded in 1994 as Quadra Capital Management by Jeffrey I. Greenstein, then a little-known money manager. For two years starting in mid-1997, Quadra Capital ran its New York operations out of the Midtown Manhattan foundation office of James D. Wolfensohn, the investment banker who was then serving as president of the World Bank. Mr. Wolfensohn was Quadra’s first New York client, brought in by Larry B. Scheinfeld, a former KPMG partner who later became a Quadra executive. Other early hedge fund clients included Robert Wood Johnson IV, the owner of the New York Jets and scion of the Johnson baby shampoo fortune, and several West Coast dot-com executives.In the late 1990’s, some clients — although never Mr. Wolfensohn, according to one of his spokesmen — were seeking not just to get into hedge funds, but also to shelter their wealth from taxes.“A lot of these prospective investors would say when you call, ‘I can do business with any of the hedge funds, so what are you going to do for me?’ ” said one former Quadra employee who worked there from the late 1990’s through recent years. “People start asking you for favors, and as a result of the favors, they choose to put money into your hedge fund.” He spoke on condition of anonymity, saying that he did not want to become part of the investigation.Quadra, which changed its name to Quellos in 2000, was a high-end provider of aggressive shelters thanks to the alliances it had with accounting firms, law firms and banks, many caught up in the widening investigation. Its accounting firm was KPMG, and Jeffrey Eischeid, one of the former KPMG employees now under indictment, was its auditor.Quadra’s largest tax shelter client, according to a person close to the firm, was Haim Saban, producer of the “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers’’ television show. In 1999, Mr. Saban paid Quellos and lawyers $54 million in fees to shelter $300 million in taxes owed from his sale of his $1.5 billion interest in the Family Channel and other assets, according to the Senate subcommittee. Mr. Saban, through an affiliate, had also invested in some of its funds.By 1999, according to two former employees, tax shelters accounted for about 40 percent to 50 percent of Quadra’s annual earnings, and reached at least into the high tens of millions of dollars.With shelters as the lure, investors poured into Quadra’s hedge funds, swelling its assets under management from $100 million in 1995 to $2.3 billion just five years later. Buoyed by strong returns, the firm expanded into investment banking, private equity, brokerage services and venture capital, according to a former senior Quadra employee.Last week’s findings by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations focused on just one Quellos tax shelter, called Point, which was sold to investors like Mr. Johnson and the wealthy Wyly brothers of Texas. The findings were the second by the subcommittee to point a finger at Quellos. The first, in 2003, used internal documents to show that Quellos and its predecessor, Quadra, had formal arrangements with KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers, among others, to make and sell two abusive shelters known as Flip and Opis.In both hearings, Mr. Greenstein, now 44, said that his firm did nothing wrong. He called last week’s report “unfair, inaccurate and one-sided.”Jeffrey H. Brotman, the chairman and founder of Costco, which has been a Quellos client for six years, said that he was aware of Quellos’s involvement in aggressive shelters, but he defended the firm. “I know the principals well, to be honest, straightforward people, and their performance has been stellar,” Mr. Brotman said. “They’re not like they were portrayed during the hearings.”The focus on Quellos also shows how close the ties were among the accounting firms, law firms, banks and investment firms caught up in the tax shelter investigation.Those ties are seen in internal documents that have emerged in civil lawsuits. One such memo was written in July 1997 by Robert Pfaff, then a KPMG employee in Denver, to two KPMG executives, John Lanning and Jeffrey Stein. (All three men are now under indictment.)“My initial reaction would be to sever the Quadra relationship, in light of their open and notorious relationship’’ with a rival, Coopers & Lybrand, Mr. Pfaff wrote. He continued, “on reflection, this would probably be ill-advised because we need to live with Quadra, particularly on I.R.S. exams and on completed transactions.”'"

"'06-08-09,'0','ROCHESTER, Aug. 8 (AP) — The contact lens maker Bausch & Lomb said Tuesday that it would delay filing its second-quarter financial report and warned that 2006 pretax earnings could be nearly 80 percent lower than it had once projected, partly because of the recall of a lens solution.In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Bausch & Lomb forecast 2006 earnings before taxes in the range of $70 million to $80 million on sales of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. In October 2005, before a worldwide recall of its ReNu With MoistureLoc solution, the company had projected pretax earnings of $325 million to $335 million.Because of recall-related expenses, the company’s operations in the United States will be unprofitable in 2006, the filing said.The eye-care company permanently pulled its ReNu With MoistureLoc solution from markets worldwide in mid-May as health officials investigated its links to an outbreak of infections dating to June 2005.The company was supposed to file its second-quarter report with the S.E.C. this Thursday. It said the delay was being caused by a continuing assessment of its financial reporting and control deficiencies, and an audit committee investigation into reserve entries.According to the filing, Bausch & Lomb expects second-quarter sales of $575.4 million, 5 percent lower than the year-earlier period. The results were hurt by the creation of a $19.3 million reserve for the lens solution recall, but benefited from sales from a Chinese pharmaceutical acquisition.'"
"'06-08-09,'0','“He would have been better off taking it another 20 degrees,” said Harvey Levin, founder of the celebrity muckraking Web site www.TMZ.com, which published the sheriff’s report of Mr. Gibson’s arrest.Mr. Rubenstein and Mr. Levine said the case of the actor Hugh Grant was the standard for successful damage control. In 1995 Mr. Grant was charged with performing lewd acts with a prostitute in Los Angeles. He quickly agreed to appear on the “Tonight” show on NBC and answered Jay Leno’s question: “What were you thinking?” His nationally televised demonstration of bashful British contrition transformed the sheepish Mr. Grant from naughty to nice.Although Mr. Gibson’s rant might not lend itself to a “Tonight” show appearance, the principle remains the same: address the situation as quickly as possible, public relations advisers say.Mr. Levin of TMZ.com, a lawyer as well as a veteran broadcast journalist, said he gave Mr. Gibson’s publicist Alan Nierob, of the venerable Hollywood firm Rogers & Cowan, high marks for his efforts to get the actor to stand up and take responsibility. “The days when publicists could simply will something away are gone forever,” Mr. Levin said. “This stuff doesn’t disappear. It must be managed.”The cost of a good publicist is comparable to that of a lawyer — a retainer followed by billable hours, said Michael Sitrick, whose 50-person Los Angeles firm manages up to 250 clients and their crises annually. His client list has included the talk-show host Rush Limbaugh, the rock performer Tommy Lee, and the actress Kim Basinger.“It’s very much like hiring a lawyer,” he said. “You’ve got degrees of crisis and degrees of expertise, and unfortunately most people can’t tell the difference.”Situations like the release of the sex tape featuring Paris Hilton, or the disclosure of the social indiscretions of the actress Lindsay Lohan, are not major crises, public relations experts said.Mr. Levine, who also lectures and writes books on public relations, said most misbehaving celebrities were their own worst enemies because, he said “they’re full of themselves.” In addition to their own hubris, they frequently surround themselves with sycophants, he added.“Celebrities like Michael Jackson and Elvis retreat into their psychological houses and purposely turn off their personal alarms — their friends and family,” he said. “So they’ll say, ‘You know, I think the world rotates on the back of a turtle,’ and all they hear is ‘Right on!’” What friends and family should say, he continued, is more like, ‘What are you, an idiot?!”If the scandal involves any sort of illegality, Mr. Rubenstein said he advised hiring a lawyer who could sit in on meetings, thus giving both star and publicist the benefit of attorney-client confidentiality.“Some sort of privileged communication is a very important element, because it starts with the truth,” he said. “You don’t try to coat it with public relations varnish. You scrape all of that off.”Once a client levels with him, Mr. Rubenstein said, he adopts almost the role of priest to penitent.“They have to say they’ll never do it again, but they also have to say it to themselves and mean it,” he said.Strictly from a pragmatic standpoint, Mr. Levine said, Mr. Gibson should have sought public pardon the moment he sobered up.The actor Eddie Murphy is cited by public relations professionals as an example of someone who did a poor job of dealing with a scandal. In May 1997 sherriff’s deputies stopped Mr. Murphy with a transvestite prostitute in his car. Publicists said that Mr. Murphy lost precious time by tersely dismissing the transvestite’s story, which was quickly sold to tabloid newspapers.In a media storm like that engendered by Mr. Gibson, Mr. Rubenstein said he recommended a one-on-one interview with a single reporter who would allow the client to make as good a case as possible.“I try to get them to do some public kind of statement and then go radio silent and not keep flogging that wild beast,” he said.Richard Lewis, a veteran of the Hollywood publicity business, said, “Alan Nierob’s doing a great job.” He noted that both the Rev. Jesse Jackson and former California congressman Robert K. Dornan were eventually able to rise above anti-Semitic comments. “The next step in his rehabilitation is to get him in front of Jews,” Mr. Lewis said.Mr. Rubenstein said he could give Mr. Gibson that chance. Within days of the story breaking, Mr. Rubenstein said, he polled the leaders of the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Manhattan in his role as the museum’s vice chairman, and they agreed to invite Mr. Gibson to address the membership.“We sent him a letter but haven’t heard from him yet,” Mr. Rubenstein said.Similarly, the rabbi for the Temple of the Arts synagogue in Los Angeles invited Mr. Gibson to speak to his congregation during Yom Kippur.“If you can turn the corner, you can actually help your career,” Mr. Rubenstein said. “A truly recovered alcoholic gets increased respect.”The essential ingredient in all celebrity rehabilitation is time, he added“The good news is that if it wasn’t something totally immoral, something that society seems to accept after the publicity, they won’t boycott films, they won’t boycott records,” Mr. Rubenstein continued. “After a few months, they seem to remember some kind of scandal, but it fades. I’ve often thought that publicists should sponsor a survey naming the Top 10 scandals hitting Hollywood to see how they could have been avoided and how they hurt the client.”Mr. Rubenstein declined to enumerate those who would be included in a list of scandals, but Mr. Levin cited the examples of Bill Clinton, O. J. Simpson, Michael Jackson, Martha Stewart and Kobe Bryant.“In some ways Bill Clinton was the worst, but he recovered remarkably, to the point that some people now actually believe Al Gore lost in 2000 because Clinton didn’t stump for him,” Mr. Levin said. “Today he’s making a fortune and his wife could be our next president. O. J.’s playing golf and shows up on the Internet. Martha Stewart landed two TV shows right out of prison. And Kobe’s doing Nike commercials, for crying out loud. So, can Mel Gibson recover from this? Absolutely.”Mr. Levine said he had compiled what he calls the four pillars of celebrity crisis management: Speed, humility, contrition and personal responsibility.“Some things are so egregious that you can’t get out of it in a day or two,” said Mr. Levine, who likened Mr. Gibson’s dilemma to “the Charles Colson model,” referring to the Watergate conspirator who founded Prison Fellowship International.“This will take 20 years to fix, not 20 minutes,” he said. “He has a long walk up a steep hill.”'"
"'06-08-09,'0','Theoretically, the crew plans to stop in various river towns to give workshops on everything from silkscreening to power tools and put on a performance — a kind of punk-rock musical variety show — followed by a dance party. They have no money, less expertise and nothing by way of permits. Imagine if Don Quixote, Salvador Dalí and Che Guevara collaborated on a floating medicine show. It is hard to say what the Coast Guard, which governs the river, will say when it first lays eyes on the spectacle.Across the river from the raft-building site was a massive salvage yard with cranes and crushers, a thudding counterpoint to the artists’ bid to conjure discarded piles of junk into a vessel that will sail hundreds of miles to St. Louis over the course of the month. (Those who are willing will remain on the raft or some part of it and continue to New Orleans.)It seems like a perfectly dumb idea, but it’s hard not be charmed by the whole enterprise. Maybe it’s one of the tag-along rafts, the one with dozens of speakers fashioned from truck tires, industrial blowers and dorm fridges, all flanking a bicycle-powered Ferris wheel. Mike Houston was slathering it all with lacquer, because, he said, “Things always look better shiny.”It is a summer caper built on magical realism, with the realism part intruding often enough to put the endeavor behind a schedule no one cared about much in the first place.“This is a logistical nightmare, but it is a set of problems I want,” said Jeff Stark, one of the trip’s organizers. “There is very real value in people having a primary experience, the experience of making something beautiful and improbable.”It began last winter with a notice on the Web site missrockaway.org. “We grew up in small towns,” it read. “We remember the bookmobile and the punk rock band that seeded little pieces of something else. And now, even though we moved to big cities and found people like us, we still live in a country that fights wars so it can consume more. We are taking the urge to flee and heading for the center. We want to meet people who aren’t like us. We want to meet ourselves at age 16.”The invitation nicely mixes a kind of artistic imperialism — “Hey, look, Ma, blue states bringing culture to the red ones” — with a Dadaist emphasis on fun as an artistic objective. It yielded a temporary community in the spirit of — and including people from — the Barnstormers, the Madagascar Institute, the Floating Neutrinos, the Toyshop Collective, the Infernal Noise Brigade and the Amateurs, artist collectives all.Apart from a commitment to recycled materials and group decision-making, there is no organizing principle to the endeavor. A shore dappled with scrawled blueprints on discarded sheetrock, tarps make of orphan Manhattan umbrellas, abandoned toys, moon stencils and bicycle parts suggested disparate takes on what the trip is for.There will be plenty of togetherness on the river, but in case the intimacy overwhelms, there will be a Temple of Solitude, a small orphan raft dragging behind with a hammock with room for just one or two.In late July, after the crew had loaded up a bus and a trailer of scrap materials gathered on the streets of New York to hit the road, they were turned away from the Holland Tunnel. When they retreated back toward the Verrazano Bridge via Brooklyn, an axle broke on the trailer under the Brooklyn Bridge, 20 minutes into the trip.It has been sort of like that since, but there are few hissy fits, and little sign of factionalism. The crews work on schedules and assignments known only to them, with progress coming of its own accord in a temporary village just down from the Camden Bridge in Minneapolis, where John Holmberg, a river rat with a sprawling place on the Mississippi, allowed the crew to set up shop and sleep on his houseboats.Over the course of five days, piles of junk in ad-hoc shops up by his house slowly made their way down to the river and seemed to morph organically into rafts.Zoë Mizuho, a dancer for a punk rock marching band, put up a cross support for the second deck of the performance raft. Harrison, the resident Lost Boy who cracked wise about everything and said he used no last name, grabbed a tool near the house, then bounced on a trampoline on the way to the docks. Near the house, Alexis McDonough Pope and Brandy Gump were putting together a pedal-powered washing machine.“We were at the Hard Times cafe in Minneapolis, and suddenly this tub just manifested itself behind the place, next to a dead squirrel,” Ms. Gump explained as she pushed down on the makeshift gear so Ms. Pope could bolt it together.Philip Harder, a Minneapolis filmmaker who lives a few houses away, had learned about the group on the Web and contacted it to see if he could help it get situated.“What I really liked about what they were doing is that they made it very clear that they had no idea what they were doing,” he said.The crew is not short on credentials, but none have much to do with raft-building or river navigation. Mr. Stark organized the Idiotarod, a much-heralded shopping-cart race in New York City; the artist known as Swoon has several pieces in the “Printmaking Now” show at the Museum of Modern Art.Ledia Carroll, an artist from Texas, has produced some high-profile environmental pieces, but is working on feeding the crew right now. “Would you like a Dumpster-dive bagel?” she asked a visitor sweetly. Her partner, Paul Cesewski, is the builder of the bicycle-powered Ferris wheel and has created improbable fun machines at the Burning Man festival and elsewhere.“Floating Man” would have a nice ring as a title for this expedition if so much of the muscle and enterprise were not coming from women. Navigating several tons of raft down a river full of locks and barges seems dicier than building an ecstatic village in the Nevada desert. They have some aces in the hole: Shawn Kelley has not only sailed a raft down the Mississippi, but she also took it to Cuba for good measure.“My biggest concern is people falling off the raft,” said Ms. Kelley, who has been with the Floating Neutrinos since she was 17. Now in her 20’s, she is one of the few people here who has spent much time off asphalt.And then there’s Chicken John, a longtime adventurer and circus man, a necessary figure. “Chicken John is the king of jakey design,” Mr. Stark explained. “It was his bus that brought us here, and he is the one who is figuring out how to make these motors work.”Mostly, Chicken John plays the heavy who has little taste for the whole collective approach. He and his buddy Nick Bindbeutel were piecing together the engines based on a design Chicken John saw in Thailand. When it became clear that the water pump was misplaced, Mr. Stark mentioned that “we decided it would work here.”Chicken John said, “Why is it always ‘we’ when something goes wrong?”A cynical optimist, he said he would make sure there was power — the converted engines will run on fryer grease, theoretically — to make the trip, but he would not join the voyage. “I’m needed elsewhere.”“This is the best-case scenario,” he said, rising from an engine he had been working on. “Nobody knows what they are doing, they don’t work smart, but none of them have left.”Later he updated a friend on the telephone: “We are ensconced in a small makeshift refugee village on the river, engaged in a form of indentured servitude, and I’m not sure when they are leaving.”Swoon, who played a large role in organizing the group, designed the fabricated elements on top of the raft. She and Mike Ross, who has built large-scale sculptures before, stared at one of the wooden models that made the trip from New York, much worse for the wear. They discussed the load-bearing capabilities of a spar that formed part of a symbolic fish design intended to grace an end of one of the rafts.“You have to design it for an unruly group,’’ Mr. Ross said. “Someone is bound to get drunk and climb up on it at some point,” he said, pausing. “It might be me, actually.”As the rafts took shape, some people on a passing pontoon stared from a distance but did not approach for a closer look. Not so for Ann Nowara, an elderly neighbor who was leaning on a swingset just up the bank. “Wow, they really got something here,” she said. “What is it?”There really was no telling. Between one of the cooks nearly slicing off her finger, waterlogged Styrofoam and toileting logistics that are not quite ironed out, the adventure had begun in earnest well before the craft was even launched.No matter. Hope floats, after all, so no reason to expect a raft built out of garbage and good intentions won’t do the same thing.'"
"'06-08-09,'0','Along with Mr. Freeman, Florence Fabricant and I were joined for the tasting by Sue Torres, the chef and an owner of Sueños, a Mexican restaurant in New York that emphasizes the richness of Mexican cuisine and the role of tequila in its enjoyment.We had two requirements for the tequilas in our tasting. First, they had to be made from 100 percent blue agave. Tequila is made from the distilled sap of the blue agave, which is a succulent (but not a cactus). The best tequilas are 100 percent agave, while lesser mixto tequilas can squeak by with a minimum 51 percent agave. If the label does not say 100 percent agave, it is a mixto.The second requirement was that they be reposados. Tequilas have three levels of aging. The youngest tequilas are called blanco, or sometimes plato or silver. They are essentially bottled without aging. The oldest are the añejos. They must be aged at least a year in oak barrels, though they generally spend three to five years in oak. In the middle are reposados, which rest in oak barrels from two to 12 months.Personally, I have always liked blancos best. They offer an undiluted taste of what tequila is all about, with pronounced citrus, mineral and herbal aromas and flavors in varying proportions depending on whose tequila you’re tasting. I love a good margarita, served straight up with salt, but frankly a great blanco tequila is almost like a margarita without the cocktail additions — the salt and citrus flavors are built in. All it lacks is sweetness. I have nothing against añejo tequilas, but it seems to me that barrel aging diminishes the qualities that make tequila singular. The rough edges are all smoothed out and the tequila sometimes takes on a caramel flavor, more like a Cognac or an aged rum. Yet many fans swear by the sipping virtues of añejos, and I do not doubt them. Añejos are generally not for mixing into cocktails.That leaves reposados, which are... what? Somewhere in between, I guess. Reposados account for more than half of all tequila sales in Mexico, but in the United States they are something of an enigma.For me, the tasting of 21 reposados went a long way toward answering my questions about what to do with them. First of all, reposados come in a range of styles and flavors, as our top three tequilas illustrate. Our No. 1 bottle, the El Tesoro de Don Felipe, seemed to display all of the explosiveness of a blanco tequila. It was full of citrus, herbal and saline flavors, yet it was exceptionally smooth at the same time.The Herradura, our No. 2 bottle, was on the añejo side of the reposado spectrum, mellow and also complex, but with other sorts of flavors like butter and caramel standing out. Positioned in the middle was the Chinaco, our No. 3 bottle, which had the briny, herbal, vegetal characteristics of a blanco but the easygoing balance of an añejo.Such a balancing act is not easy for a distiller, and we were all impressed by the high quality of almost all of the tequilas we tasted. On the blanco side among the top 10 were the Frida Kahlo, named for the great Mexican artist, and, at $65, the most expensive tequila in the tasting, and the Corazón, which at $34, was our best value. On the añejo side were the Gran Centenario, the Don Julio and the Siembra Azul. And somewhere in the middle were the Casa Noble and the Cabo Wabo. Incidentally, the Cabo Wabo brand is owned by the singer Sammy Hagar, who follows in a tradition of entertainers associating themselves with fine tequila. The first were Bing Crosby and Phil Harris, who originally imported Herradura into the United States in the 1950’s.Some bottles that didn’t make our top 10 are still worth noting. I particularly liked the Familia Partida, which I found elegant and seductive, and the Espolon, which had a racy blend of fruit and pepper flavors.The question remains, what do you do with reposados? The intuitive answer is, anything you want. Both Ms. Torres and Mr. Freeman believe they can make fine margaritas, slightly smoother than a blanco margarita, and it’s easy to sense how delicious they can be, though you wouldn’t want to waste anything but a mixto on a frozen margarita. And reposados are fine for sipping.But why not consider a favored Mexican way of drinking tequila? Instead of the salt-and-lime method, try chasing a sip of tequila with a shot of sangrita, a spicy blend of tomato, orange juice, lemon or lime juice and chili? And how about what Ms. Torres called the authentic Mexican margarita? Tequila mixed with Squirt, the Mexican citrus soda.Come to think of it, save that method for the mixto.Tasting Report: Flavors Too Distinct to Waste in MargaritavilleEl Tesoro de Don Felipe  $46 ***Full-bodied and full of flavor, with explosive aromas of citrus, herbs and salt.

"'06-08-09,'0','Mr. Lieberman soon pounced, running an advertisement with the tag line: “Meet Ned Lamont. He’s a Greenwich millionaire.” The line was accurate. Mr. Lamont, his wife, Ann, the managing partner of a venture capital firm, and their three teenage children live in a $30 million home in Greenwich. Their combined assets total in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and until recently, he belonged to the Round Hill Club, an exclusive country club in the town.Yet it did not seem to matter. Mr. Lamont presented himself to voters less as a stiff-jawed patrician than an unpolished and energetic upstart. Many seemed to find his quirks — he closed most speeches with “My name is Ned Lamont and I approve this message,” the legally required language for television and radio campaign advertisements — charming, or at least earnest.“He’s very comfortable in his own skin, and he’s a very modest person,” said George Jepson, a past chairman of the state Democratic Party who first met Mr. Lamont in the late 1970’s. “He’s very down to earth.”Edward M. Lamont Jr. was born in Washington to a privileged family that had its share of mavericks. There were bankers, but also a grandfather who worked on a sailboat and married a Roman Catholic missionary in Puerto Rico. Mr. Lamont’s uncle was Corliss Lamont, an ardent socialist and a longtime member of the board of directors of the American Civil Liberties Union. He grew up in Syosset, N.Y., in a family where animated debate was served regularly at dinner and political apathy was discouraged.“When you have two bankers, one Socialist, and a couple of crazy kids at the table, it tended to be pretty energetic,” Mr. Lamont recalled this year.Mr. Lamont’s wealth was only partly from his trust fund. Much of it was earned by his wife, and some of it came from his own entrepreneurship. In 1984, he started Lamont Digital Systems, a Greenwich company that wired apartments and college campuses for cable, and he used a bank loan a few years later to expand. The company took off and made Mr. Lamont his own fortune.“Both he and his wife have made a lot financially during their lifetimes,” said Robert Johnson, a development executive at a documentary film company who has known Mr. Lamont for 14 years. “But he was very enterprising. He did not rest on his perceived reputation. He went out and made one himself, whether in politics or business.”He also worked with civic and charitable boards and volunteered at a Bridgeport public school, teaching a course on how to start a business. He and his wife later started a foundation that in the past five years has given $850,000 to schools, charities and other groups, according to the campaign. In 1990, Mr. Lamont mounted an unsuccessful run for the State Senate.“He’s lived in Greenwich, this very Republican town, for many years,” Mr. Johnson said. “But he had a greater degree of awareness for what’s happening outside Greenwich.”Those experiences would later become the grist for his United States Senate campaign, as Mr. Lamont traveled around Connecticut to convince Democratic voters that his volunteerism, background as an entrepreneur, and willingness to champion liberal values were credentials enough to replace Mr. Lieberman.But it was Iraq that drove Mr. Lamont into the race and kept him there. Late last year, he grew tired of seeing Mr. Lieberman defend the war in Iraq. He began to plead with local Democratic officials — he would not say whom — to find someone to contest the senator’s re-election. Then after reading an op-ed article Mr. Lieberman wrote in The Wall Street Journal urging the United States to “stay the course” in Iraq, Mr. Lamont decided he would run himself.“Everybody was sympathetic,” he said several months ago. “And the general message was, ‘If you feel so strongly about it, you do it.’”'"

"'06-08-10,'1','See, I'm fairly resigned to Windows's dominance. If Microsoft changed nothing in Vista but the color scheme, Windows would still be the 90 percent market-share gorilla.Why? Because the market-share figures includes sales of computers to corporations, which buy hundreds of PC's at a time. And the corporate world long ago standardized on Windows. It makes no difference how superior Mac OS X or Linux may be; the world's I.T. staffs will switch their entire companies away from Windows the day Rush Limbaugh votes for Hillary Clinton.After all, the I.T. people know where their bread is buttered. If Macs are indeed less trouble-prone and complex than Windows PC's, they're doomed in corporations; the last thing the I.T. guys want to do is obsolete themselves.The only legitimate fight, therefore, is for the souls of individuals and small business owners who actually have a choice of platform--people whose computer choice is dictated by their corporate employers. But these are just market-share scraps.Apple does seem to be winning the scraps, by the way; Macs have actually picked up a couple of points of market share recently.But big companies will always buy Windows. In my view, the die was actually cast the day I.B.M., supplier to corporate America, chose Microsoft decades ago. And when you accept that fact, this business about an Apple-vs.-Microsoft feud for dominance looks purely symbolic.Maybe it would be best to keep this observation secret, though. The fantasy that the marketplace is actually up for grabs does do two good things: It drives Microsoft to improve Windows, and drives Apple to continue dreaming up new directions for the desktop operating system.(For example, I had my doubts that Apple could come up with anything in Mac OS X 10.5 with as great an impact as the Spotlight instant-search feature did in 10.4.But Leopard will include an automatic, invisible, whole-computer backup system called Time Machine. In times of hard-drive failure or human error, it will let you rewind either your operating system or even individual documents and windows to earlier versions. Remember, fewer than five percent of us have automatic backup systems in place, so this is huge. Yes, I know there are certain third-party software programs that do something like this--there always are. But it's quite another matter when it becomes part of the operating system.)Followers of both camps, in other words, can save themselves a lot of ulcers if they just acknowledge a few facts:* Microsoft gets a lot of ideas from Apple; Apple also gets ideas from Microsoft. It doesn't matter; the most expensive lawyers in Silicon Valley have established that it's all perfectly legal.* Microsoft has won the market-share war, because it dominates in corporations.* Both companies are profitable and have very long futures ahead of them.* If market share were measured by individual buying decisions (rather than quantity of computers), Apple's rank would be much higher.* Even if the grand prize for the ""war"" is individuals, families and small businesses, the perception of a much bigger war is useful; Windows Vista and Mac OS X Leopard may in fact be on completely different playing fields, but they're both looking like the best versions ever.'"

"'06-08-10,'1','The corpse flower took another dramatic turn toward blooming on Thursday afternoon, as the large, green leafs began to fold back and fall away, revealing the maroon undersides that are colored to resemble an animal.As of 3:12 p.m., a very faint odor was detected in the room, said Leeann Lavin, a spokeswoman for the garden. ""Right now, there are two flies on it,"" she said.In 1937 and again in 1939, thousands turned out to watch bloomings in the Bronx. According to The New York Times, the odor “almost downed” newspaper reporters, and was described by an assistant curator at the botanical garden there as “a cross between ammonia fumes and hydrogen sulphide, suggestive of spoiled meat or rotting fish.” It became the official flower of the Bronx, until 2000, and it seems the bizarre specimen — why the heck does a flower smell like bad meat? — can still draw a crowd. More than 10,000 people visited a blooming corpse flower at the University of Connecticut in Storrs in 2004.The flower was first discovered in Sumatra, its native terrain, in 1878 by Odoardo Beccari. It was an immediate sensation. An English artist assigned to illustrate the plant is said to have become ill from the odor, and governesses forbade young women from gazing upon its indelicate form. (Its formal name ends in “phallus” for good reason.)It was discovered that the stench is vital to its reproduction, designed to attract tiny sweat bees and carrion beetles that live on carcasses. The insects carry pollen to other corpse flowers. “This is a very specific assignment, essentially,” Mr. Cullina said. “Some flowers are very insect-specific about what they want.”During blooming, the strongest odor lasts about eight hours, but the smell lingers for two or three days.The botanic garden’s plant was donated in 1996 from a collection in North Carolina. Mark Fisher, foreman of conservatories at the garden, took over its care two years later, when it was just a little plant in a box near a fire escape. Once a year, a leaf shot out of it and rose six feet, but no flowers.“We had a cold snap and it turned yellow. I was like, ‘Oh my God.’ I was really worried,” said Mr. Fisher, who, like many at the garden, has taken to calling the plant Baby. He moved it to a warmer spot, and the plant came back, most strikingly, last winter, with a 12-foot leaf that opened like an umbrella. The leaf grew so high it tipped the plant one night, and nearly broke off but for Mr. Fisher’s quick thinking and a hastily built splint. In hindsight, Mr. Fisher said, it’s clear the huge leaf was to absorb massive amounts of nutrients for the big act to follow, the blooming.Employee “babysitters” will watch the plant around the clock, in case the blooming begins in the dead of night. Air masks will be passed out to the security staff.Dr. Randolph Schutz, a psychotherapist and amateur botanist, dropped by for a look yesterday. “I must say, I don’t smell much at the moment,” he said, but he plans to return throughout the weekend. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.”For a less refined sort, the plant may offer another opportunity. Now would be a pretty good time to dump a dead body in the botanic garden.'"
"'06-08-10,'1','The criminal case against the Comverse executives, who all resigned from the company in May, is the second involving the manipulation of stock options. Last month, federal prosecutors in San Francisco charged the former chief executive of Brocade Communications Systems and its former head of human resources with securities fraud.The Comverse case is the first to be brought by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn. The Securities and Exchange Commission also filed a civil complaint against the three men yesterday.“In what can only be called an abuse of corporate power, these executives, through fraud and deceit, rewarded themselves and their friends at the expense of the investing public,” said James W. Burrus Jr., the acting assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at a news conference in Washington yesterday.Mr. Burrus said that the F.B.I. was investigating 45 cases involving the backdating of options. More than 80 companies nationwide are now under investigation over their options practices by the S.E.C. or by federal prosecutors in San Francisco, Brooklyn and Manhattan.Lawyers for Mr. Alexander, of New York, and Mr. Kreinberg, 41, of Teaneck, N.J., declined to comment on the charges. A call to a lawyer for Mr. Sorin, 56, who lives in New York, was not returned.Prosecutors contend that the three men devised a complex scheme to backdate every companywide grant of options between 1998 and 2001 to days when Comverse’s stock was trading at lower prices.Options give an employee the right to buy a stock at some point in the future at the price of the stock on the day it was granted, commonly referred to as the strike price. The lower the strike price, the more an option is worth to the recipient. By dating the options back to a time when the stock was trading at a lower price, the recipient receives even bigger profits.But it was the top executives themselves who profited most from the scheme, prosecutors said.Between 1991 and 2005, Mr. Alexander made profits of $138 million on options he exercised and stock he sold, prosecutors said. About $6.4 million of that profit was a result of backdated options, prosecutors say.Likewise, Mr. Kreinberg exercised options and sold shares for profits of about $13 million and Mr. Sorin for about $14 million, according to court filings. Around $1 million of the profits for each of the men came from backdating, prosecutors said.“Each of the former executives realized substantial personal gains from the exercise of the illegally backdated option grants and the subsequent sell of Comverse common stock,” said Linda Chatman Thomsen, the director of enforcement at the S.E.C. “Collectively, they realized millions.”The criminal charges are a very public fall from grace for Mr. Alexander, who is credited with turning Comverse — once a penny stock on the verge of failure — into a market leader in voice-messaging software with global operations and annual revenues of more than $1 billion. Comverse has said it would have to restate financial results dating back to 2001 and possibly even further.Described by several former employees as a meticulous, intelligent man, Mr. Alexander is portrayed in the criminal complaint as someone who paid attention to the smallest detail at the company. (“How many C.E.O.’s do you know who reads every word of the footnotes?’’ he told an employee, according to the complaint.) Mr. Alexander held a bachelor’s degree in economics from Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a master’s degree in finance from New York University.The other two men had sterling credentials as well. Mr. Kreinberg was previously a senior manager at Deloitte & Touche, the company’s outside auditor, and Mr. Sorin was a Harvard-educated lawyer who, colleagues said, has a fondness for stride, a type of piano jazz that flourished in the 1920’s. Mr. Sorin was general counsel from the company’s inception in the 1980’s through 2003.According to court filings, the backdating of options began when an assistant who is unnamed in the court filings took on the job of compiling lists of employees for whom stock option grants were being proposed, for consideration by the board’s compensation committee. The assistant kept a record of the employee names, option awards and dates in a spreadsheet through a software program called Equity Edge.It was around this time that Shaula Yemini, Mr. Alexander’s sister, joined the board and became a member of the compensation committee. (Mr. Alexander’s father, Zvi Alexander, was a board member for several years but did not sit on the compensation committee.)According to information provided to the government by the assistant, Mr. Alexander or Mr. Kreinberg instructed the assistant at various times to insert earlier dates — when Comverse’s stock was trading a lower price — as the dates the stock options had been granted, although that was not true. Mr. Sorin would then place calls to members of the compensation committee to discuss the number of options that were to be awarded.Two long-serving members of the committee told prosecutors they assumed that the option grants were dated on the date of the telephone calls. In fact, the calls came after the dates of the grants, prosecutors say.Around 1999, Mr. Alexander and Mr. Kreinberg instructed the assistant to create a secret account for options that the two could give to employees at Mr. Alexander’s discretion, as incentives for recruitment and retention.The assistant, who had recently watched “Phantom of the Opera,” named the account “I.M. Fanton,” in an altered rendering of “phantom,” according to court documents. (Later, the assistant renamed the account “Fargo,” apparently after the movie of that name.)Mr. Alexander and Mr. Kreinberg told the assistant to put dozens of fictitious names on the list of employees proposed to receive options grants, awarding the fake employees about 5,000 options each to avoid attracting the compensation committee’s attention, according to the complaint.After the compensation committee approved the list, the assistant aggregated at least 200,000 options into the Fanton/Fargo account.Over time, options from the slush fund account were transferred to real employees. In August 2000, the complaint said, the assistant was told to transfer 48,000 options from the account to a top executive in Israel because the executive was unhappy with the level of compensation.The options, as is typical, had a four-year vesting period, meaning they could be exchanged for stock after four years. But Mr. Alexander told the assistant to make the options exerciseable immediately.The Israeli executive, who is not identified in the court documents, exercised the options the next day when the stock was trading at nearly double the exercise price and immediately sold the stock for an “instant $2 million profit,” the court documents say. The same executive received another $2 million windfall four months later.When questions about the company’s options practices began to arise, the three executives scrambled to hide the account from the board, a special committee formed to investigate the practice and the firm’s outside auditor.“When the story they delivered began to fall apart, they began to make admissions about their conduct, yet tried to justify their unlawful behavior,” the complaint says.Mr. Kreinberg, the former chief financial officer, even tampered with evidence as the special committee was being formed to investigate the options backdating, prosecutors said. Using the assistant’s password, Mr. Kreinberg gained access to the options database and altered dates, the complaint said.In conversations with lawyers for Comverse, Mr. Alexander tried to justify the backdating and the creation of the slush fund account by saying he had to do it to retain people and that everyone in Silicon Valley was doing the same, according to the complaint.'"
"'06-08-10,'1','At one point, Ms. McFarland turned to Mr. Spencer and said, “You taxed and spent like Hillary, and you’ve behaved like Bill.”Mr. Spencer retorted: “That was probably worked on for months by her staff. To say, let’s get the sound bite, you know? Let’s get the sound bite, let’s get the headline. What nonsense.”He bristled at the onslaught, saying that the woman he had gone on to marry had not been a secretary but “a career professional with 22 years working for three former mayors and city managers.” He asked how Ms. McFarland, as a woman, could insult “another woman’s career and her children.”“I say to you, Mrs. McFarland: Shame on you,” he said. “Shame on you as a mother of children and a woman yourself to talk about my wife and my family like that when we have such a serious campaign. I am at peace with my God and my loved ones.”The Democrats exulted. “This was more like a Tom and Jerry cartoon than a Senate debate,” said Blake Zeff, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party.Between the heated exchanges, a few areas of policy disagreement did emerge. Ms. McFarland expressed her support for abortion rights, while Mr. Spencer said he opposed abortion unless the life — and not just the health — of the mother was at stake.Ms. McFarland said she would revive the upstate economy by remaking it as a center of “renewable energy,” while Mr. Spencer said his experience as the mayor of a troubled city would help him assist upstate mayors.In a round of yes-or-no questions, both candidates agreed that Gov. George E. Pataki, a fellow Republican, had not been an excellent governor, and said he would not be re-elected if he were running this year. Mr. Spencer, noting that he is already the Conservative nominee for governor, said he would not support Ms. McFarland if she wins the Sept. 12 Republican primary.Their race pits two wings of the state’s Republican Party, Ms. McFarland representing the more moderate branch and appealing to party elites, and Mr. Spencer running as an unabashed conservative.Ms. McFarland said several times that she had worked in “the administrations of three Republican presidents” while Mr. Spencer said she had been a “Washington bureaucrat 25 years ago.”After she mentioned working with Henry A. Kissinger and near Donald H. Rumsfeld during the Ford administration, and said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was “an old college friend of my husband’s,” Mr. Spencer said there was “more name-dropping going on here than — I don’t know what.”The debate was televised in New York City on NY1 News and on other channels across the state. It was also broadcast on several radio stations.The campaign was bitter long before the debate.“I don’t think that anyone expected this to devolve into a cross between ‘Dr. Phil’ and ‘Days of Our Lives,’ ” said Nelson Warfield, a Republican strategist working for the state’s Conservative Party, which is backing Mr. Spencer.The Spencer family was not the only one drawn into the campaign. Ms. McFarland’s was, too. New York magazine published a letter she wrote to her parents saying why she had cut off contact with her brother Michael, who was gay and died of an AIDS-related illness.“Have you ever wondered why I have never had anything to do with Mike and have never let my daughters see him, although we live only 15 minutes away from each other?” the letter says. “He has been a lifelong homosexual, most of his relationships brief, fleeting one-night stands.”The publication of the letter led Ms. McFarland to announce that she had been physically abused while growing up.But when Ms. McFarland was asked about her family issues at the debate, she declined to respond.Then came the night’s one peaceful moment. Mr. Spencer had nothing to say either, except, “ I wish her well, and guess what, at night I’ll say a prayer for her.”Ms. McFarland said, “And for that I thank you.”'"
"'06-08-10,'1','Jennings did not play college football. He has been cut from N.F.L. Europe twice. He has been cut from N.F.L. teams five times. He has been on the practice squad of three teams, but never on an active roster. He is buried on the Giants’ depth chart and is not afraid of being cut again.“I’m having the time of my life,” he said. “Why should I think about the negative when there’s so much positive going on?”At 5 feet 11 inches and 175 pounds, Jennings is a little man in football, but he has found a way to stand out among 89 other players. While most arrived at training camp in Hummers or Mercedes, Range Rovers or BMW’s, Jennings drove from Jacksonville, Fla., in his tricked-out Caprice, a car with a Corvette engine that he bought during Giants training camp last year.“It’s real hot down in Florida, and we like letting everybody hear what we’re playing inside our cars,” Jennings said, explaining the point of having stereo speakers blaring outside as well. “With the A.C. on and the windows rolled up, they can still hear what’s going on inside.”As usual, his entrance was flashy, one seen and heard, backed by a heavy bass beat, fronted by a sparkling golden smile. Jennings tends to arrive with heads turned toward him and depart with heads shaking behind him.But the attention he attracts — he rolled through the University at Albany campus a few days ago to the throwback strains of Michael Jackson’s “Beat It” — will probably have no bearing on whether he makes the team. Jennings said that his personality was not intended as self-promotion.“I don’t think it’s helping or hurting,” he said. “I just think it’s Mike Jennings, 1-5.”A sprint star on the Florida State track team, Jennings impressed N.F.L. scouts with his speed at an on-campus predraft workout in 2002. He signed with the San Francisco 49ers and was waived during training camp. Since then, he has been alternating between charter-school physical-education teacher and N.F.L. prospect.In 2004, Jennings was cut by the New England Patriots on Sept. 5, signed with their practice squad Sept. 6, was cut Sept. 7, re-signed Sept. 10 and was cut for the last time Sept. 22.The Giants lifted him from the Baltimore Ravens’ scrap heap later that year.He was assigned to N.F.L. Europe’s Berlin Thunder, a team that cut him the year before. Jennings was among the league’s leaders with 33 receptions and 546 yards.The Giants cut Jennings before the 2005 season, but they liked his speed enough to sign him to the practice squad. He spent the season playing with the Giants during the week and watching in street clothes during the games.This is where the 26-year-old Jennings finds hope — in fits and starts, in the dark corners of team rosters, collecting satisfaction in the here-today, gone-tomorrow world of borderline professional athletes.“If you look at it, I’m in the N.F.L, man,” Jennings said. “I didn’t play no college ball, and it’s all positive to me. I’m living my dream, having the time of my life.”His sunshiny perspective is enhanced by a cloudy past. He has spent time in jail for what he called “hard-headed things.”“Little dope charges, driving with suspended license — just being ignorant to the law,” Jennings said. “I think they happened then so I wouldn’t get in trouble now. I learned from those mistakes then, and now I’m ready for life.”Among his best friends from Jacksonville, Jennings said, is Gary McCray, who was accused in 2004 of shooting and killing three men and a woman in a drug house. In January, a judge declared McCray unfit to stand trial and ordered him to a mental hospital.So Jennings has found a world far from trouble but bordering on uncertainty. He will arrive at the Giants’ first preseason game in Baltimore on Friday on a team bus. The gold teeth, a mold that fits over his real white ones, will be stored away. The “15” in the back of his hair will be covered by a Giants helmet.That is what he wants. That is what hope really looks like. An individual, part of a team.Quarterback Eli Manning will be relieved by Tim Hasselbeck, then Jared Lorenzen, in Friday’s game. Rob Johnson is not likely to play until the second game. Coach Tom Coughlin said that the order represented the current depth chart. ...Linebacker LaVar Arrington will not play. He missed practices this week with a sore right knee, which could be a long-term obstacle. “We’re in the process of developing a way in which we can manage this thing with him,” Coughlin said.'"
"'06-08-10,'1','An investigation by the office of the inspector general concluded that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents did not use excessive force in the shooting that killed Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, a fugitive Puerto Rican nationalist leader accused of a $7 million robbery in 1983. Mr. Ojeda Ríos, 72, bled to death last September after an exchange of gunfire with the agents, who claimed he opened fire on them when they came to arrest him at a farmhouse in southwestern Puerto Rico. Director Robert S. Mueller of the F.B.I. requested the investigation after Mr. Ojeda Ríos’s wife said agents shot at him first. While the investigation concluded that agents did not deliberately let Mr. Ojeda Ríos bleed to death, it found that the agents should have first made efforts to capture him.'"
"'06-08-10,'1','In addition to the fighters, bread, canned tuna, sardines and processed cheese — donations from Iran — were being carried across, with help from local Lebanese who support Hezbollah, to cars and trucks waiting on the other side. The Israeli bombing, which had gouged huge craters out of the area around the river, had not yet broken supply lines.Despite Israeli bombardments, Hezbollah continues to operate. In some areas, it does so in open view of Israeli drones that whine overhead in the brilliant afternoon sky.Shortly after 1:30 p.m., in a large, open dirt field, cut with giant craters from Israeli bombs, five ghostly fighters became ordinary wounded men. More than anything, the men did not want their photographs taken, afraid of revealing anything that might help Israel bomb them.One covered his face with his T-shirt, in the style of a movie star avoiding paparazzi. Another, in a neck brace, put on sunglasses. Three emergency workers told journalists not to take pictures.“No pictures,” said a fighter, hobbling on crutches with a white bandage on his left foot.Hezbollah has deep and widespread support among the Shiites of Lebanon’s south — a portrait of Hassan Nasrallah, the group’s leader, is hung in many homes. Evidence of that support was on full display at the river on Wednesday.At least five Lebanese Red Cross workers in orange suits helped the fighters. They carried plastic bags of belongings, offered shoulders to lean on and spoke words of encouragement when the wounded men confronted the tree crossing. They looked for an easier way across, one of them even wading out into the water, but eventually settled on the tree.The man on crutches hopped gracefully on his right leg in a white plastic sandal.“Don’t worry,” one worker said. “No one is going to take pictures.”He felt his way to the end of the tree, after stumbling slightly at the beginning.“You can do it, you’re a tough guy,” said another worker, encouraging him.The ambulance driver, Haidar Azzedine, said that the men had come from Jabal Amel Hospital in Tyre, a town six miles to the south, and that they were being moved to clear out bed space. Sami Yazbek, the head of the Red Cross in Tyre, said the men were fighters.“There’s somebody who will get angry if you take pictures,” Mr. Azzedine said. “No pictures at all.”Everyone, it seems, was pitching in to help. Later in the afternoon, municipal emergency workers from Tyre packed clear plastic bags of flat bread into the back of a van. The code of secrecy still applied.“You take pictures of us and they’ll hit us,” said one worker, who gave only his Lebanese nickname, Abu Ahmed.Then, in English: “I’m very, very sorry. Camera, dangerous.”Despite the danger of the mission, the workers maintained the world-weary Lebanese sense of humor.“You’re staying here?” a worker asked a reporter. “Watch out for the planes.”The loading went on for most of the afternoon, though not always so seamlessly. Shortly before 3 p.m., at a leafy, shaded point in the river less than a mile away, two trucks loaded with bags of food were stuck, one in the water and the other on a crude bridge of wood and metal sunk in the river.A man fastened a wire to a bright red Toyota pickup, submerged up to its doors. Three others grabbed onto it and pulled, like figures from some heroic tableau.“Get back,” one man shouted, as they heaved.“Let’s go boys,” another said.Fifteen to 20 men helped with the loading. No one would give a name. One identified himself as a Palestinian, and said the food was bound for a Palestinian camp nearby. Some of the men spoke with Palestinian accents. The only one who seemed eager to proclaim his affiliation with Hezbollah was immediately dismissed by others.“I’m Hezbollah,” crowed a teenager in a sleeveless shirt and shorts who had been running with large sacks of bread on his back across piles of wood and metal sunk into the river that formed a makeshift bridge.“It’s dangerous but Hezbollah is strong,” he said, flexing a bare arm that poked out of a shirt with the words Sport Evolution, in English, across the front.A large man in a button-down shirt and khaki trousers shooed him away.“Not another word,” he barked. “Don’t say one more word.”Then, turning to face reporters, he added, “He’s crazy.”The men were unloading black plastic bags with stickers labeled in green-and-red Arabic script: “Gift, Red Crescent Society. Islamic Republic of Iran.”One loader listed the contents for reporters: rice, sugar, cans of tuna, hummus, tea and sardines. Beef lunches were also among the items.Some of the men moved and spoke with a smooth confidence. A man in a checked shirt, dark chinos and a green belt sat on a plastic lawn chair, his legs crossed. He was the only man in the group sitting. A man with a hand-held radio, the usual Hezbollah communications device, stood wordlessly behind him.Why was the food from Iran?“This comes from Iran but maybe after a while, the next shipment will come from France,” the man said, a slight but knowing smile spreading.A section of the metal and wood bridge had collapsed, trapping a small flatbed truck with the words “Lebanon, I Love You” painted in Arabic script near the cab door.The men knew that they were being watched by Israeli drones, and that at any moment a missile could blow them apart. They worked fast, darting between the trucks, as the water swirled around the rear of the flatbed.Eventually, they managed to drag the red truck out of the river and began using it to yank the flatbed off the bridge. Twice the wire snapped. Twice they retied it.The man in the checked shirt hung back. The bridge, or what was left of it, was for anyone trying to cross, not just a militia supply location.“It’s not only for the party,” he said. Near him, two men pulled up in a black Mercedes sedan coated in dust. The driver cut the engine and placed a hand-held radio in the glove compartment.Many people were crossing on Wednesday, their sweaty, muddy efforts a testament to human resourcefulness. Men carrying a plastic bag of medicine scrambled up and down the tree trunk at a run. Two men trudged, grunting, with Santa-size sacks of packaged bread on their backs, loading it from one bank to a battered green car on the other.One of the men, George Abdullah, a 45-year-old merchant from Qana, said he was helping support about 1,000 people stranded in the village of Maayake.“They are isolated there,” said Mr. Abdullah, sweating profusely in a green T-shirt. “They have no money to leave. I am paying to feed them.”He asked a reporter to help him hoist the bag onto his damp back and then took off, stooped, at a run.Despite the ruined bridge, the giant craters from Israeli bombs, and the deep booms that echoed in a neighboring valley almost constantly throughout the afternoon, the people were confident. More than anything, the people at the river on Wednesday were sure they were winning.“This is a victory for us,” said Abu Ahmed, the municipal worker.A stocky man in jeans and sandals near the two watery trucks offered a more philosophical take. The planes were dangerous, he agreed, but it would not stop them.“We’re not scared of anything but God,” he said. “God is above the planes.”'"
"'06-08-10,'1','The Securities and Exchange Commission, bowing to complaints that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act puts too big a burden on small companies, said yesterday that the deadline for them to comply with new auditing rules should be put off until the end of next year.The S.E.C. proposed delaying by six months the July 15, 2007, date for small companies to start reporting whether financial controls promote accurate reports and prevent fraud. The companies could also wait until the end of 2008 to have outside auditors test and certify their controls.Executives at small companies have said such audits are so costly they wipe out much or all of their profit, and some have gone private to escape the burden.Foreign companies have also objected to the law.The changes “continue the commission’s efforts to be sensitive and responsive to the particular needs of smaller public companies and foreign private issuers,” said Christopher Cox, chairman of the S.E.C.Foreign privately held companies could delay complying with parts of the law until after July 15, 2007, the S.E.C. said. The previous deadline was a year earlier. The new deadline for foreign companies will take effect as soon as it is published in The Federal Register, while the change for small companies requires a 30-day period for public comment and then a final ruling.Newly public companies would be allowed to put off compliance until they file their second annual report, the S.E.C. proposal said. The agency said the change recognized that the first annual report after an initial public offering already consumes a lot of time and resources.'"

"'06-08-10,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 9 (AP) — A federal magistrate declined Wednesday to dismiss a criminal case against the first two executives charged in connection with the backdating of stock options, ruling that there were enough accusations for the case to continue.Gregory L. Reyes, former chief executive of Brocade Communications Systems, and Stephanie Jensen, former vice president of human resources, were charged July 20 with securities fraud. The Justice Department said the backdating of stock options was, in part, cause for the company to restate financial results for fiscal years 1999 through 2004, cutting 20 cents a share off reported earnings.Brocade, a maker of data storage devices, is based in San Jose, Calif.Lawyers for Mr. Reyes and Ms. Jensen said Magistrate Judge Edward M. Chen of Federal District Court in San Francisco should dismiss the case because any backdating had been intended to attract employees, not to skew financial results. “Nowhere in this affidavit does it allege the defendants intended that consequence,” said Mr. Reyes’s lawyer, Richard Marmaro.Judge Chen replied, “Why isn’t that a fair inference?” He also suggested that “employees could be recruited in other ways.”Ms. Jensen’s lawyer, John Keker, said that half the companies in Silicon Valley could be prosecuted for such conduct and that his client had not known that any wrongdoing had taken place.“She knows nothing from nothing about the accounting function,” Mr. Keker said. “What she did, she thought, was completely proper.”'"
"'06-08-10,'1','Missouri is the latest front in the Republican Party’s campaign to use photo ID requirements to suppress voting. The Republican legislators who pushed through Missouri’s ID law earlier this year said they wanted to deter fraud, but that claim falls apart on close inspection. Missouri’s new ID rules — and similar ones adopted last year in Indiana and Georgia — are intended to deter voting by blacks, poor people and other groups that are less likely to have driver’s licenses. Georgia’s law has been blocked by the courts, and the others should be too.Even before Missouri passed its new law, it had tougher ID requirements than many states. Voters were required, with limited exceptions, to bring ID with them to the polls, but university ID cards, bank statements mailed to a voter’s address, and similar documents were acceptable. The new law requires a government-issued photo ID, which as many as 200,000 Missourians do not have.Missourians who have driver’s licenses will have little trouble voting, but many who do not will have to go to considerable trouble to get special ID’s. The supporting documents needed to get these, like birth certificates, often have fees attached, so some Missourians will have to pay to keep voting. It is likely that many people will not jump all of the bureaucratic hurdles to get the special ID, and will become ineligible to vote.Not coincidentally, groups that are more likely to vote against the Republicans who passed the ID law will be most disadvantaged. Advocates for blacks, the elderly and the disabled say that those groups are less likely than the average Missourian to have driver’s licenses, and most likely to lose their right to vote. In close elections, like the bitterly contested U.S. Senate race now under way in the state, this disenfranchisement could easily make the difference in who wins.The new law’s supporters say its purpose is to deter fraud. But there is little evidence of “imposter voting,” the sort of fraud that ID laws are aimed at, in Missouri or anywhere else. Groups in Missouri that want to suppress voting have a long history of crying fraud, but investigations by the Justice Department and The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, among others, have refuted such claims in the past. If the Legislature really wanted to deter fraud, it would have focused its efforts on absentee ballots, which are a notorious source of election fraud — and are not covered by Missouri’s new ID requirements.Because of the important constitutional issues these laws raise, courts will have the final say. Federal and state judges have already blocked Georgia’s ID law from taking effect, and although Indiana’s law was upheld earlier this year, that ruling is on appeal. Missouri voting-rights advocates recently filed suit against their state’s law.'"
"'06-08-10,'1','Asked for an example of a project that could benefit, she named the community center being built at Warren and West Streets as part of a residential project called 200 Chambers Street. The center is to be run by Manhattan Youth, which offers sports and cultural programs to children, mainly from TriBeCa, Battery Park City, the South Street Seaport and the financial district, where the residential population is growing.As a matter of fact, Manhattan Youth has already received a $400,000 grant from the development corporation for its cultural programs.But Bob Townley, the executive director, did not deny that the community center, scheduled to open next spring, could use a lot more money: $1.85 million, to be precise. Manhattan Youth will receive the raw space as a gift from New York City, he said, but is responsible for building out the interior. It has raised $6.85 million so far.“Lower Manhattan is the only community without a community center,” Mr. Townley said.Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff and Kevin M. Rampe, the chairman of the corporation, said the city would assume responsibility for administering the community enhancement program. And they both said the pot of money would almost surely be safe from other demands.“We obviously have a shared interest in preserving those funds,” Mr. Doctoroff said. “We thought it prudent — in the context of the memorial agreement — to make sure we had enough funds to get the memorial built. Our assumption is that we won’t have to use the $45 million for that.”To deal with unfinished business, Mr. Doctoroff said the city might create a new local development corporation for Lower Manhattan, under municipal control, or a new subsidiary of the city’s Economic Development Corporation. Or it might simply handle matters through existing agencies, he said.THE Regional Plan Association is frustrated that the community grants seem to be falling through the cracks. “It’s upsetting that the L.M.D.C. wasn’t able to distribute the funding while it had the staff, resources and capacity to do so,” said Petra Todorovich, a senior planner at the association. “The funding is so core to their mission and the need for funding is so great.”On the planning front, Amanda M. Burden, the chairwoman of the City Planning Commission and a director of the development corporation, said the design of the new trade center was moving ahead promisingly and collaboratively, even without formal guidelines, which are still being refined.One draft of the guidelines laid out a range of heights for the buildings, from a maximum of 900 feet for the shortest and southernmost tower, where the former Deutsche Bank building stands, to 1,776 feet for the Freedom Tower (Tower 1).Silverstein Properties, the developer of the three office buildings along Greenwich Street, has commissioned Foster & Partners of London to design Tower 2, the Richard Rogers Partnership of London to design Tower 3 and Maki & Associates of Tokyo to design Tower 4. Teams from all three firms are working together at 7 World Trade Center.“We’re incredibly fortunate that Towers 2, 3 and 4 have three of the greatest architects in the world,” Ms. Burden said. “It appears that the principles of the guidelines are being embraced by the architects and overseen very diligently by Silverstein.”That includes the notion, central to the original master plan by Studio Daniel Libeskind, that the towers be arranged in an ascending spiral, each taller than the one immediately to its south, as they wrap around the memorial plaza.Although the draft called for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the development corporation to administer the guidelines, Ms. Burden said, “The city believes strongly that it must be involved in the site’s design moving forward.”After all, she added: “The site is located within the five boroughs. And Lower Manhattan is a priority for this administration.”'"
"'06-08-10,'1','At the same performance, Mayor John V. Lindsay presented her with New York City’s Handel Medallion, which praised her as an “extraordinary ballerina who has filled the hearts of her audiences with joy.”On the same theme and in his own tribute, Kirstein wrote: “Melissa has been the nearest thing to a ‘star’ in our starless company. We have never encouraged stardom on programs, posters or publicity; managers can’t make stars. The public does.”In the last 25 years, Ms. Hayden also established herself as an influential teacher. After retiring from performing, Ms. Hayden headed the ballet department at Skidmore College and the School of Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, where she was briefly artistic director. She also opened her own school in Manhattan. Since 1983, she had taught at the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem. Among her 6,000 students was Gillian Murphy, now a principal at Ballet Theater.John Mauceri, the school’s chancellor, said yesterday that Ms. Hayden had taught until a month ago. Her “astonishing 23 years” as a mentor at the school “speaks to her genius, commitment and passion for the dance,” he said.Passion was certainly a synonym for Ms. Hayden’s dancing. Although her early triumphs in City Ballet were in works with a narrative tinge (William Dollar’s “Duel” and Frederick Ashton’s “Illuminations”), she did not need a dance drama to excel. By the end of her career, she had danced some 60 ballets in the repertory, mainly Balanchine’s plotless works.Anyone who saw her in Balanchine’s step-packed Tchaikovsky ballet “Allegro Brillante” could be stunned by her outpouring of energetic classical style. At the close, Ms. Hayden seemed as emotionally spent as her audience.After she returned from Ballet Theater in 1955, Balanchine began to create new works for her, clearly valuing her temperament as he might not have before. A popular favorite is the 1958 “Stars and Stripes,” to music by Sousa. Its pas de deux was created for Ms. Hayden and Mr. d’Amboise, who both embodied its marching-band spirit and good humor.“The company called us Ike and Mamie,” Mr. d’Amboise said, referring to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife.Ms. Hayden was born on April 25, 1923, in Toronto, where she began ballet lessons at 12 with the Moscow-trained teacher Boris Volkoff. Seeking further training, she went to New York, where for six months she danced in the ballet corps of Radio City Music Hall. (The troupe was later disbanded.) In one pageant she appeared as a star in a flag representing Oklahoma. When onstage, she said, she would tell herself: “I am Oklahoma. I was admitted to the union on Nov. 16, 1907. I’m a great producer of oil.”When she joined Ballet Theater in 1945, the choreographer Antony Tudor suggested that she change her name from Mildred Herman to Melissa Hayden.After Ballet Theater disbanded temporarily, she danced on Broadway and joined other dancers from the company in 1948 for a nine-month tour of Cuba and Latin America by the newly organized Ballet Alicia Alonso. Nicholas Magallanes, who had been in Balanchine’s previous troupes, recommended her to Balanchine for his new company. In Argentina, Ms. Hayden received a telegram from Balanchine telling her to pick up a plane ticket to New York.Although Balanchine had gone out of his way to recruit her, Ms. Hayden found her path anything but smooth in the first few years. In “Melissa Hayden: Off Stage and On,” the first of her three books, she spoke frankly of the problems a dancer can face.In her own case, she said, she was torn originally between her love for Balanchine’s works and the greater applause and cheers she received when dancing as a guest with other companies. In “Melissa Hayden,” she wrote: “To dance Balanchine’s ballets successfully, we must subordinate our personalities and blend with all the other dancers onstage. To do this means that the audience will not see us as individuals. In ballets of other choreographers and especially story ballets, the opposite is true.”Upset that Balanchine did not create new roles for her and would not let her dance in his “Swan Lake” in her early years with the company, Ms. Hayden returned to Ballet Theater. When she came back to City Ballet because she missed the high quality of Balanchine ballets, she and the choreographer reconciled.As always, Ms. Hayden remained herself. Although Balanchine frowned on his ballerinas’ having children, Ms. Hayden had two with her husband, Donald Coleman, who survives her. Besides her son, of Scarsdale, N.Y., she is also survived by a daughter, Jennifer C. Damsky, of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.During her career, Ms. Hayden reached a mass audience with frequent appearances on television, especially “The Kate Smith Show.” In 1952 she was the dancing double for Claire Bloom in Charlie Chaplin’s film “Limelight.”But essentially, she was a versatile dancer at a time when City Ballet was more eclectic in its programs than in later years. New works by choreographers other than Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were the norm. In “The Duel,” Ms. Hayden was the female warrior in a plumed helmet who died a melodramatic death at the hands of her Crusader lover. “The audience screamed after the performance in London.” Mr. d’Amboise said.“When we all went to London, she was the big star,” he added. “She won the audience.”Those who saw her in “Illuminations,” Ashton’s meditation on the poet Arthur Rimbaud, will hardly forget her as Profane Love, one foot bare and one in a toeshoe as a turbulent allegorical figure.At the same time, she was prominent in a host of Balanchine ballets. She was the first and vibrant Titania in his “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” the mesmerizing passionate Eurydice in his “Orpheus,” an especially vivacious Sugarplum Fairy in “The Nutcracker” and the virtuosic ballerina in the “Spanish” solo of “Agon.” Finally, she was the womanly and emotional Odette in her coveted role in “Swan Lake.”'"
"'06-08-10,'1','MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 9 — Three Egyptian students who failed to appear for their exchange program in Montana were in custody on Wednesday, the authorities said. The whereabouts of eight other Egyptian students were unknown.One student, Eslam Ibrahim Mohamed el-Dessouki, 21, was arrested here on an administrative immigration violation, federal officials said. Two others, whose names were not released, surrendered at police headquarters in Manville, N.J.“In response to hearing in the media that they should turn themselves in to the nearest police station, they did just that,” Steven Siegel, a spokesman for the F.B.I. in Newark, said.The bureau said the missing students posed no terrorism threat.The men were in a group of 17 students destined for Montana State University who arrived from Cairo on July 29 at Kennedy International Airport in New York, federal and university officials said. The other six arrived at the campus in Bozeman.A university official said this week that when repeated efforts to contact the missing students failed, the university notified the Homeland Security Department and registered the Egyptians as “no-shows” in a system developed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to track foreign students.The students are in an exchange program with Mansoura University in Mansoura, Egypt.The vice provost for international education at Montana State, Norman Peterson, said the other six were “doing fine under the circumstances.”“But it is really a challenging situation for them to suddenly have so much press attention,” Mr. Peterson said.'"
"'06-08-10,'1','There are half a million dogs in the city of Jining, which encompasses the 16 villages, the official New China News Agency says. Officials there said their extermination plan was scheduled to begin later this month. There have also been reports of smaller extermination schemes in other parts of the country, notably in Sichuan Province.As remarkable as the killings themselves, however, has been the response. With its rising prosperity, China is developing a pet-owning culture, with dogs standing out as a particular favorite. As word of the killings has spread here, pet owners have begun to mobilize — speaking out online and circulating petitions — to try to stop the killings.In fact, discussion of the issue has surpassed the bounds of a simple conversation about pets’ rights, with many commentators sharply questioning a system that could order the mass extermination of dogs, whether or not they are licensed and vaccinated. The reaction of groups and individuals, often through the Internet, also provides a striking illustration of the emergence of true public opinion in China, unmediated by the official press or censors.“This is just another stupid decision by several foolish officials taken in a small room, totally unreflective of the people’s will,” said a comment on Mop, a current affairs forum.Some drew comparisons with China’s human rights situation. “We don’t have human rights, let alone dog rights,” wrote a commentator going by the name of Kui Kui Xiang Ri, on the Tianya forum. “I’ve seen too much live abuse, let alone abuse of dogs. Anyway, it’s the local emperors who have their say, and we ordinary folks are not much different from dogs in their eyes.”Chinese humane societies have announced plans to file lawsuits against local governments that mount extermination campaigns. “This kind of thing is just too terrible, too inhumane,” said Huang Juan, a leader of the Abandoned Pets Assistance Center, in Wuhan. “They did it without any real reason, since many of these dogs are vaccinated and cannot spread rabies. But how can you speak reason with these people?”Another group, the China Small Animal Protection Association, said it would sue. “We are meeting with lawyers the day after tomorrow, and will go to court and bring charges against two local governments,” said Lu Di, the group’s director. “I will not just try to persuade, warn or criticize them — it’s too late for that. We will sue them to make them understand that this is not merely a moral issue, but a crime.”On Wednesday, the Humane Society of the United States offered $100,000 to China to establish a program to control rabies in Jining, The Associated Press reported.More broadly, others pointed out that the extermination campaigns contradict the guiding ideology of China’s current leaders, who constantly invoke the need to build a “harmonious society.”Although the extermination programs are being widely denounced here, there is no doubting that rabies remains a severe problem in China. Nationwide, 961 people died of the disease in the first six months of the year, and last year, 2,545 people died. By contrast, rabies deaths in most Western countries are extremely rare.Experts say the persistence of the disease reflects the breakdown of the rural health care system, once one of the proudest achievements of Chinese Communism. Many poor rural provinces view canine rabies vaccinations as a costly burden. Meanwhile, an oral vaccine, which is far easier to administer, is not imported, partly because of its cost.“Many farmers are reluctant to get shots for their dogs, because it’s not always free, whereas the veterinary system at the township level has become very inadequate,” said Luo Tingrong, a rabies expert at Guangxi University. “There isn’t much investment into the system.”BEIJING, Aug. 9 (Reuters) — China plans to auction licenses to foreigners to hunt wild animals, including rare species, a newspaper said on Wednesday.The government will auction the licenses based on the numbers in each category of animal, ranging from a starting price of $200 for a wolf, the only predator on the list, to as much as $40,000 for a yak, The Beijing Youth Daily said. There are believed to be fewer than 10,000 mature wild yak in the world.The newspaper said the auction, on Sunday in Chengdu, capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan, would be a first for China.'"

"'06-08-11,'0','MOSCOW, Aug. 11 — The Boeing Company agreed today to a joint venture with a Russian supplier of titanium parts for its 787 Dreamliner airplane, though the Ural Mountain factory will likely fall under United States sanctions against companies that have exported military technology to Iran.The partnership is with VSMPO-Avisma, a company Boeing has been dealing with for nine years and has turned to as a key supplier for its popular new midsize, fuel-efficient airplane.The 787 Dreamliner’s gas-sipping qualities, likely to be popular with airlines as energy costs soar, stem partly from Russian-supplied titanium for a lightweight airframe. First deliveries are expected in 2008, but the orders have been so strong that the plane is sold out to airlines in advance through 2011.Avisma, now controlled by VSMPO management, is in the process of being sold to Russia’s state weapons trading company, Rosoboronexport, which was among seven companies in Russia, Cuba, North Korea and India sanctioned last week by the United States State Department for providing military technology to Iran.Boeing is also advising the other sanctioned Russian company, Sukhoi, best known as a fighter jet manufacturer, on a new regional passenger jet to be called the Superjet 100.'"
"'06-08-11,'0','The resolution also urges countries to contribute troops to the beefed up Unifil, and diplomats said that France, Australia, Italy and Turkey were among those expected to help fill the international complement. President Bush has said that the United States would offer no troops but could contribute logistical assistance.The zone the new joint force will be responsible for extends from the Blue Line border of Israel and Lebanon to the Litani River, roughly 15 miles to the north. That zone would be declared free of all ""armed personnel, assts and weapons other than those of the government of Lebanon and Unifil.""Israel and the United States had been insisting on the most robust possible international force out of concern that Hezbollah would take advantage of any truce to move back into southern Lebanon, the area it has controlled for years and used to send rockets into Israel.Earlier drafts of the French-American resolution had specified that the force be created under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which calls for enforcement by military means.Lebanon protested that decision, and Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, the ambassador of France, and John R. Bolton, the ambassador of the United States, redrafted the resolution Thursday night to eliminate references to Chapter VII and replace them with the language of the less coercive Chapter VI.The phased withdrawal and deployment approach was also a compromise to meet earlier Lebanese complaints that would have permitted the Israeli military to remain in South Lebanon.The text calls for an immediate cessation of ""all attacks"" by Hezbollah but only of ""all offensive military operations"" by Israel. Since Israel has classed its war effort as one taken in self-defense, Lebanon said this amounted to a ceasefire against only one side, Hezbollah, and demanded that Israel be ordered to withdraw immediately behind the Blue Line.Both American and Israeli officials said they interpret the reference to offensive military operations to mean that Israel can still address threats to its citizens in Israel, its armed forces in Lebanon and can respond to attacks from Hezbollah. If faced with an imminent threat, a senior U.S. official said, ""Then yes, Israel can respond."" Nonetheless, she said, ""we expect a large-scale reduction in violence, and we'd expect the large-scale bombing to stop.""Another senior State Department official speaking under background briefing rules said the revised text had ""all the characteristics of a Chapter VII resolution. It walks like, talks like and acts like a Chapter VII resolution.""The language change will not be popular with Israel and its supporters, but the American official said the force ""will be able to defend itself and has a very strong mandate which you would see in a Chapter VII resolution.""Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was at the United Nations Friday, received assurances from Tzipi Livni, Israel's foreign minister, that Israel will support the accord, according to the senior State Department official. She spoke to Ms. Livni three times Friday and once to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, he said.The Americans had resisted earlier calls for ceasefires, arguing that one without political guarantees would simply return Lebanon to the situation it was in where Hezbollah could resume attacks on Israel.A senior administration official in Crawford, Tex. where President Bush is on vacation said Friday that it increasingly seemed that Israel would not be able to achieve a military victory, a realization, he said, speaking not for attribution, that led the Americans to get behind a ceasefire.The Lebanese are also likely to be unhappy with the resolution's failure to order Israel to relinquish control of Shebaa Farms, an area of the border that it seized in 1967 and remains in dispute between Lebanon and Syria.The resolution simply asks Mr. Annan to develop ideas on how to solve the dispute and report back on his findings in 30 days.The resolution does not order the return of abducted Israeli soldiers, an original reason Israel cited for going to war, nor does it meet Hezbollah requests for release of prisoners held by Israel. The measure simply says it is ""mindful of the sensitivity of the issue of prisoners and encouraging of the efforts aimed at urgently settling the issue of the Lebanese prisoners detained in Israel.""The original French -American draft, introduced last Saturday left the creation of the international stabilization force to a second resolution, which would have also been responsible for establishing a permanent ceasefire, setting up the disarmament of Hezbollah, demarcating the borders of Lebanon, establishing an arms embargo to prevent the entry of unauthorized weapons and empowering the Lebanese army to control all its territory.The new text calls for all those objectives to be addressed now and says another resolution will be proposed sometime in the future to enhance the role of Unifil as needed.The agreement brings to an end a four-week period in which the Security Council has been excoriated, particularly throughout the Middle East, for having taken no significant action to stop the fighting.Mr. Annan said he welcomed the resolution but regretted how long it had taken to be adopted.""I am profoundly disappointed that the Council did not reach this point much, much earlier,"" he said. ""I am convinced that my disappointment and sense of frustration are shared by hundreds of millions of people around the world.""'"

"'06-08-11,'0','Republicans, facing tough midterm elections — and with a history, as Democrats noted, of spotlighting terrorist threats in election seasons — used the news from England to try to pound home their message that they were doing everything possible to keep the nation safe. Mr. Bush strode off Air Force One to television cameras to declare that the United States was safer from terrorist attacks than it was before Sept. 11, 2001, but remained in danger.On Capitol Hill and in states where Republicans are facing tough re-election battles, party officials applauded the arrests by the British authorities as evidence of the administration’s policies in fighting terrorism, and suggested that Americans might take a cue from the tougher antiterrorism statutes Britain has enacted. In line with their efforts to keep the election from being a referendum on Mr. Bush and instead make it a choice between two distinct approaches to national security and other issues, they used the arrests to portray Democrats as weak.“Defeatocrats!” declared a statement issued by office of the House majority leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, capturing the tone of Republican rhetoric as the news unfolded.The Ohio Republican chairman, Bill Bennett, attacked Representative Sherrod Brown, the Democratic challenger to Senator Mike DeWine, for voting against some intelligence bills, “the very types of programs that helped the British thwart these vicious attacks.”In a sign of how the terrorism issue was roiling American politics, Mr. Lieberman echoed Mr. Cheney as he attacked his primary opponent, Ned Lamont, for his opposition to the war. He said Mr. Lamont’s desire to withdraw troops from Iraq would result in victory for Islamic extremists.At the very least, the arrests in Britain were viewed by both parties as something of an August surprise, the kind of event that can change the story line of a campaign. The critical question now is the extent to which the fall campaign will be fought over the war in Iraq, something Republicans would like to avoid at all costs, or the overall campaign on terror, the only major issue where Republicans have consistently held an advantage over Democrats.But in a sign of how this campaign might be different, Democrats struck a tone notably different from the elections of 2004 and 2002, when for the most part their strategy was to try to turn the subject away from national security. This time, Democrats attacked Republicans as failing to improve airline security and, most of all, argued that the decision to invade Iraq had been a distraction that depleted United States resources and allowed the world to become more dangerous.“The war in Iraq had nothing to do with the war against international terrorism, or very little to do with the war on terrorism,” said James Webb, a former Reagan administration official running as a Democratic candidate for Senate in Virginia. “It has distracted our attention, it has pulled our forces in, and we are now in a situation where we have 135,000 on the ground, which affects our ability to do a lot of things that we would be able to do otherwise.”Mr. Webb said one of his main tasks in trying to unseat Senator George Allen, a Republican, was to try to disentangle Iraq from the war on terrorism. “They have tried to keep it together — they have to make it one in people’s minds in order to cover the strategic error of Iraq,” he said in an interview.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said, “This latest plot demonstrates the need for the Bush administration and the Congress to change course in Iraq and ensure that we are taking all the steps necessary to protect Americans at home and across the world.”Republicans have successfully portrayed Democrats as weak on terrorism for two national elections in a row. Still, before this threat, Democrats showed signs that they were viewing problems in Iraq and the unpopularity of the war as ways of undermining Republicans on their signature issue. And some Republicans were concerned that the party might not be able to go to the well on national security a third time.Republicans have become increasingly alarmed that the war might drag down incumbents. A senior Republican consultant with ties to the White House, who was granted anonymity so he could describe internal research for a Republican member of Congress, said he had recently conducted a focus group in a highly contested Congressional district in the Philadelphia suburbs.He was shocked, he said, at the degree of hostility among Republicans toward the war, even accounting for the fact that Northeast Republicans are more moderate than their counterparts in the rest of the country.The importance of the struggle by both parties on whether this was an election season debate about terrorism or about the war in Iraq was demonstrated in a New York Times/CBS News poll late last month. Forty-two percent of Americans said they thought the Republicans were more likely than Democrats to make the right decision about the war on terror. The same percentage said they thought Democrats were more likely to make the right decisions about the war in Iraq.The White House had been aware for weeks that Britain was moving to shut down this plot. White House officials said that Mr. Cheney was kept abreast of the plot and the investigation, but that his comments on Wednesday, in a rare teleconference with news service reporters, were simply in reaction to what they said was an extraordinary political event, the defeat of a sitting senator.A senior White House official on Air Force One, speaking on the condition of anonymity, dismissed the notion that there was anything wrong with these kinds of issues being mixed up in a political campaign.“The issue is going to be discussed in the fall,” this official said. “Are you saying if the Democrats talk about the war, we shouldn’t? We will talk about the war, and we will talk about the consequences of the policies advocated by the Democrats.”'"
"'06-08-11,'0','A proposal for a 1,960-acre resort in the Catskills, which has worried environmentalists and elected officials, came under fire from the New York State comptroller yesterday in a report that said the developer understated both the project’s environmental impact and its economic risks.The project, known as Belleayre Resort at Catskill Park, consists of two luxury hotels, two golf courses and hundreds of units of housing in the midst of New York City’s watershed about 125 miles north of Manhattan. The proposal is wending its way through the state’s environmental review process.Last fall, an administrative law judge for the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation decided that 12 issues required further study after two years of hearings and a 6,720-page environmental impact statement. The process is on hold as the developer, Crossroads Ventures, appeals the decision.The report from the comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said the developer’s economic analysis was based on faulty assumptions about profitability and comparable developments.In a statement with the report, the comptroller’s office said that the developer had overstated the income the project would need in order to be profitable. “In this case,” the report said, “an analysis that overstates required income artificially supports a larger-scale project.”'"
"'06-08-11,'0','“I’m throwing away my whole face,” said Ms. Beasley, who lives in Phoenix and sells window blinds. “There’s my lip gloss. There’s my other lip gloss. There’s my lipstick. There’s my lotion,” she said as she pointed out objects in the barrel.Over all, airline and airport officials said, the system functioned reasonably well, no worse in many places than a typically horrendous day over Thanksgiving week. Flight delays of 60 to 90 minutes were common at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago. Travelers waited for more than two hours in security lines at Denver.International flights were harder hit, with delays of up to four hours, especially for travelers to Heathrow Airport in London.Many travelers, interviewed in airports across the country, shrugged with an air of resignation.“Missing our flight? We’re not going to think about that,” said Laura Paulick, who was inching toward the security checkpoint at Denver International Airport with her wedding dress, in a pink plastic garment bag, draped over one arm.Ms. Paulick’s flight was about an hour away, the security line was probably longer than that. Her fiancé, Jim Moody, had just run off to see about getting first-class tickets to short-cut the line. Their wedding is on Saturday afternoon in Pittsburgh, and 50 or so friends and family members, she said, were trying to fly there from all over the world.“I’m still optimistic,” Ms. Paulick said, craning her neck to see the line ahead.But even for optimists it was impossible to ignore the trappings of the day. This wasn’t just a peak-travel-season hiccup in an overtaxed system or the scheduling flub of a badly run airline, but rather a deliberately imposed reaction to what security officials in London and Washington described as a sophisticated murder and terror plot.At Logan International Airport in Boston, state police officers with machine guns patrolled the terminal. Gov. Mitt Romney activated the Massachusetts National Guard on Thursday morning for airport duty for the first time since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.In Los Angeles, Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa said that hundreds of law enforcement personnel, including uniformed and plainclothes officers from the Police Department, the airport police, the F.B.I. and federal air marshals, were patrolling the airport. More checkpoints and canine patrols will be added.“It just brought back thoughts of 9/11,” said Rachel Pressman, who arrived at O’Hare from London on Thursday. Ms. Pressman, 27, who has been studying in Prague and was trying to get to San Francisco, said she endured three pat-downs and four passport checks at Heathrow before boarding. Afterward, she added, her nerves remained jangled.“Every time the plane shook a little bit, it got people sort of worried,” she said.But there were acts of kindness, too.At Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, a woman arrived for a Delta flight carrying a tube of lipstick. It was her favorite shade, she told an airline employee, and she could not bear to throw it away.“She would not get on the plane,” said Lucia Grooms, a Delta employee.So Ms. Grooms took the treasured lipstick and agreed to mail it. She stood in line at the airport post office with a silver tube of gloss, an address scrawled on a napkin and a few wadded dollar bills that she said the passenger had pressed into her hands.Other people were creative in giving things away. Jan Jones, a retired nurse on her way home to Eugene, Ore., after a visit to her daughter and grandchildren near Atlanta, could not stand the thought of throwing out an expensive bottle of aftershave lotion that her husband had in his bag. So she said she went into an airport shop and wheedled the sales clerk into a promise of giving the bottle away.Some travel-related businesses, meanwhile, were already gearing up to address the numbers of people who might be showing up for business meetings or vacations with empty toiletry bags, ungelled hair and bad breath.A spokeswoman for the InterContinental Hotels Group, which includes the Holiday Inn, InterContinental and Crowne Plaza hotel chains, said company officials began talking on Thursday about augmenting the free toiletries that many of the company’s hotels already offer for guests who forget things like toothpaste or shaving cream.“We’re looking to add sunscreen and contact solution,” said Stephanie Yudin, the spokeswoman, who added that the company had received only a handful of cancellations on Thursday by stranded or delayed travelers.International travelers, in addition to the longer delays, were also facing more severe restrictions on luggage.A British Airways spokesman, John Lampl, said passengers traveling on the airline to England from the United States were not even being allowed to bring books on board. Mr. Lampl said that the same restrictions applying to British Airways flights originating in England — stricter than the new United States security measures — were being imposed on British Airways flights to England.Only pocket-size wallets, identification and essential toiletries like baby formula and sanitary napkins were allowed, he said. Forget that latest beach-read page-turner to while away the hours.“They’ll be stuck with our movies and magazines,” Mr. Lampl said.Some passengers were already second-guessing how good a job security screeners were doing in catching the newly prohibited items.“I did have a little thing of Neosporin that they didn’t catch,” said Debbie Cox, 60, of Fresno, Calif., who had just arrived in Denver to visit her daughters and was waiting at the luggage carousel.'"
"'06-08-11,'0','To rehearse the operations, a practice bomb was detonated in a Manila theater late in 1994. Another bomb was concealed aboard Philippine Airlines Flight 434 from Manila to Tokyo 10 days later. The bomb exploded on the way to Tokyo, killing a passenger, but the pilot managed to land the damaged 747. American prosecutors later concluded that Mr. Yousef had taken a liquid explosive onto the plane before disembarking.The plot, however, was foiled in early 1995 when a fire broke out in the apartment where some of the conspirators were working. Among the things found when the police investigated was Mr. Yousef’s laptop, with a file named “Bojinka.” They also found dolls with clothes containing nitrocellulose, according to the 9/11 Commission.“When the police hit the place, they were weeks away from starting,” said Michael J. Garcia, a prosecutor in the 1996 Bojinka trial and now the United States attorney in Manhattan. “In Ramzi’s laptop there were very detailed plans,” he said, including equipment, airports, flight numbers and the timer settings.Mr. Yousef was captured in Pakistan, turned over to the United States, convicted in New York and sentenced to life without parole.According to investigators, Mr. Yousef’s specialty was making bombs from innocuous-looking objects that could be smuggled through airport security — a digital wristwatch modified to serve as a timer, or a plastic bottle for contact lens solution filled with liquid components for nitroglycerine.When questioned after his arrest, Mr. Yousef refused to explain precisely how he had planned to carry out the bombings, according to testimony at his trial for the Bojinka plot.Brian G. Parr, a Secret Service agent, testified at the trial that under questioning Mr. Yousef made clear that other terrorists were aware of the explosive technique, and he did not want to compromise their ability to carry out similar acts.“He said that he didn’t want us to have knowledge of the techniques that they were going to use,” Mr. Parr testified, “because it may help us prevent other people from using those techniques.”And Mr. Yousef, in his statement to Mr. Parr, made clear that he had carefully analyzed how to carry explosives through airline security.For example, when questioned about one chemical mixture that could be used in explosives, Mr. Yousef said he would not have used it because it could have “been easily detected by airport security screening,” Mr. Parr testified.Mr. Parr said that Mr. Yousef “specifically said that he would have used a different type of device that even the most sophisticated bomb-screening machines would not have been able to detect.”Mary Jo White, the former United States attorney whose office successfully investigated and prosecuted Mr. Yousef in the Bojinka plot, recalled: “It was frightening. There were people wandering the globe able to do this. And that was 10 years ago.”Mr. Mohammed has told his interrogators that after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which involved explosives loaded onto a truck that failed to bring down the building, he “needed to graduate to a more novel form of attack,” as the 9/11 report puts it. That led to Bojinka, and the first thoughts about using planes to bomb the World Trade Center.'"
"'06-08-11,'0','The group became known as the Friendship Nine because they were students at Friendship Junior College in Rock Hill. Mr. McCullough is the first of them to die.Taylor Branch, in his book “Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954-63,” said the decision to go to jail had been “an emotional breakthrough for the civil rights movement,” because it used cheerful suffering as political witness in the manner of Gandhi during the struggle for Indian independence.Mr. Branch said it had also allowed protesters to escape the crippling cumulative cost of bail and fines.“The obvious advantage of ‘jail, no bail’ was that it reversed the financial burden of protest, costing the demonstrators no cash while obligating the authorities to pay for jail space and food,” Mr. Branch wrote.Within a week of the jailing, four professional civil rights organizers went to Rock Hill to seek arrest and joined them in the York County jail; 31 protesters were in an Atlanta jail and six were jailed in Lynchburg, Va.Despite news reports of the prisoners’ brave singing of hymns and patriotic songs, incarceration was exceedingly unpleasant. Claude Sitton, a reporter for The New York Times who visited the York County jail, said disinfectant fumes burned the eyes and ruined the taste of a cigarette. Inmates slept on the steel latticework of the bunks because “drunks set them on fire,” he reported. Some of the Friendship Nine were consigned to solitary confinement and lived on bread and water.In an article about the release of eight of the prisoners (the ninth was released pending appeal), The Times quoted Mr. McCullough as saying that the experience “served to strengthen my conviction that human suffering can assist social change.”Robert Louis McCullough was born on March 16, 1942, in Rock Hill, a textile manufacturing center near Charlotte, N.C. He attended the all-black Emmett Scott High School, and then Friendship, which no longer exists. The civil rights struggle had occupied Rock Hill since 1957, when a boycott of the local segregated bus company forced it out of business.Sit-ins against segregated lunch counters began on Feb. 1, 1960, in Greensboro, N.C., with students continuing the protests there for six months. Similar demonstrations had occurred in at least 16 other cities over the three preceding years but the Greensboro demonstration elicited the support of hundreds as the days went on. Sit-ins spread to Durham and Winston, N.C., and many other cities, including Rock Hill.At Friendship, Mr. McCullough gained the nickname Napoleon in deference to his leadership and diminutive height. In an article Wednesday in The Rock Hill Herald, David Williamson, one of the nine, called Mr. McCullough “our general.”Mr. Williamson said, “He used to throw his weight around, but he was the smallest one in the crowd.”Thomas Massey, another member of the group, told The Herald that he had initially balked at the lunch-counter protest because he had money and “didn’t have to sit on that white stool in that white dime store.”Mr. McCullough had replied, using his friend’s nickname: “It’s not just about you, Dub.

"'06-08-11,'0','GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical company, said yesterday that it had agreed to pay $70 million in a national settlement of civil lawsuits that accused the company of inflating costs of several medicines, including its blockbuster Zofran nausea drug.The deal follows a separate $150 million settlement that Glaxo reached in September to resolve government charges that it had fraudulently inflated the price of drugs bought by federal health care programs.The pharmaceutical company said the latest settlement resolved suits filed in recent years against it by individuals, health plans and six states.The states involved are Arizona, California, Connecticut, Montana, Nevada and New York.Glaxo said 34 other states and the District of Columbia would also be eligible to receive money from the settlement.The suits accused Glaxo of inflating the average wholesale price of its medicines as far back as the early 1990’s. Many insurers and government health plans reimburse doctors and pharmacies for medicines based on the stated average wholesale price.A Glaxo spokeswoman, Mary Anne Rhyne, said her company did not admit wrongdoing, but settled the cases in an effort to put the matter behind it.'"

"'06-08-11,'0','Mr. Einhorn’s inscrutable manner has worked out well for him and his investors. Over the last 10 years, he has built a $1 million fund, Greenlight Capital, into a $4 billion behemoth, delivering outsize returns. Through July, Greenlight Capital’s flagship fund was up about 9.5 percent, compared with a 3.1 percent return for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. He has delivered double-digit returns in all but two of the last 10 years.“Both poker and investing are games of incomplete information,” Mr. Einhorn said. “You have a certain set of facts and you are looking for situations where you have an edge, whether the edge is psychological or statistical.”The World Series of Poker certainly demonstrated Mr. Einhorn’s raw competitive streak. On the second day he won all the chips from David Williams, a former champion.“He didn’t give me the proper respect,” Mr. Einhorn said, referring to how the hand was played. Winning, he added, “was really fun.”On the sixth day, the pot was $7 million. His opponent tried an aggressive bluff. “I knew he had nothing because of how aggressive he was,” Mr. Einhorn said. He took it. “I won one of the biggest pots in the tournament. It was really quite a rush.”There were challenges as well. Playing in a convention room in the Rio Hotel and Casino filled with 210 poker tables, there were days when he did not finish playing until 3 a.m. “I’m not a late-night person,” he said.In the end, he faced Jamie Gold, the leader, and bet big. Mr. Gold had a better hand and Mr. Einhorn was out. (The tournament ended last night.)The tournament also highlighted some of Mr. Einhorn’s quirkiness: throughout the tournament, he wore a sweatshirt with handprints from his wife and children, a Father’s Day gift.“This is where I get all my good hands,” he said.He is giving all his winnings — $659,730 — to the Michael J. Fox Foundation. Mr. Einhorn sits on the board of the foundation, which is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson’s disease, which Mr. Einhorn’s grandfather had.“Seven hundred thousand dollars out of the clear blue sky, that’s pretty great for Parkinson’s research,” said Mr. Fox, the actor, who was planning to go to Las Vegas for the final round if Mr. Einhorn had made the final table last night. “We were all ready to go on the best road trip ever,” Mr. Fox said.Mr. Einhorn is held in high esteem in the world of value investing, an almost cultlike world steeped in the philosophy and investing style of Warren E. Buffett, Charles T. Munger and more recently, investors like Edward S. Lampert.Most value investors espouse a simple philosophy: buy good companies at cheap prices. Value investors seek to determine what a company is worth rather than guessing what price it could be: they boast that they avoid hot ideas, companies or sectors.Mr. Einhorn has a slight variation on those tactics. Instead of finding things that are cheap and then seeing if they are good investments, he finds things that are misunderstood and then determines whether they are cheap.He makes big bets, similar to the way traditional hedge fund managers operated. Few sectors are off limits. And when he gets mad at management for something, rather than sell, he puts the file in a drawer, seeking to avoid an emotional response.Although many value investors eschew technology, Mr. Einhorn owns a large stake in Microsoft, believing it to be misunderstood and undervalued. Likewise, while value investors have shunned homebuilding stocks, believing them to be overvalued because of a housing bubble, Mr. Einhorn owns a large stake in MDC Holdings, a large homebuilder. He is invested in chemical companies, French car companies and reinsurance as well.“What’s the common theme?” said Whitney Tilson, who runs T2 Partners, a hedge fund focused on value investing. “There isn’t one, because he’s an original thinker. He casts a wide net including all around the world and sees value in many different ways.”Though Greenlight is not explicitly an “activist” fund — funds that pressure management for changes and often threaten proxy fights — he has gotten into high-profile battles with management, including a nasty fight with Allied Capital, on which he has been short for years.In April 2005, a Greenlight Capital government filing took issue with New Century Financial, a major holding in the fund. “The issuer’s multiyear strategy to receive a higher price-earnings multiple by building a portfolio of loans to complement its loan origination business has failed,” the filing said. Greenlight threatened a proxy battle.Earlier this year, New Century agreed to expand its board by adding two directors and appointing Mr. Einhorn, among other measures.After two weeks of intense competition in Las Vegas, Mr. Einhorn has returned to Greenlight’s offices in Manhattan, and his days are filled with earnings conference calls rather than poker calls. Still, colleagues, competitors and investors have been calling, wanting to hear about his winning streak.“To go out and compete with the best players in the world — how many things can you do that with?’’ he said. “I couldn’t enter Wimbledon and compete against Federer.”Mr. Fox has not yet encouraged Mr. Einhorn to play in more poker tournaments.“He has a day job that is very demanding,” Mr. Fox said. After all, Mr. Fox is also a happy investor in Greenlight.'"
"'06-08-11,'0','Judge Ellis dismissed the defendants’ arguments that the indictment limited their First Amendment rights to learn about the way the government operates and use that information to influence policy.The defendants’ motion to dismiss, the judge wrote, “exposes the inherent tension between government transparency so essential to a democratic society and the government’s equally compelling need to protect from disclosure information that could be used by those who wish this nation harm.” But, he added, “the rights protected by the First Amendment must at times yield to the need for national security.”Lawyers for the two lobbyists argued that the 89-year-old Espionage Act, under which they were charged, was not intended to be used this way. The lawyers argued that even though the language of the law might apply, the application to their clients was so novel that the prosecution violated the well-settled principle that a statute must be clear as to what it prohibits because it would otherwise invite selective prosecution.Judge Ellis said the applicable test was “whether the language and application of the statute has provided defendants adequate warning that their conduct was proscribed.”In this case, the judge said, the “statute’s plain language rebuts this argument.” The infrequency of a statute’s particular application is unimportant, he ruled.According to the August 2005 indictment, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Weissman received classified information about the Middle East, Iran and terrorism from a Defense Department analyst, Lawrence A. Franklin. They then passed that information on to a journalist and an Israeli diplomat.Mr. Franklin pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12½ years in prison.

"'06-08-12,'0','ANCHORAGE, Aug. 11 (AP) — BP said Friday it would keep one side of the nation’s largest oil field open as it replaces 16 miles of pipeline, averting a total shutdown that could have put a larger crimp in the oil supply.The decision will allow BP to keep funneling up to 200,000 barrels of oil and natural gas from Prudhoe Bay. BP, which operates the oil field, had said it would have to shut down the field after discovering leaks and severe corrosion on the eastern side of the pipeline nearly a week ago.BP said it decided to continue supplying oil out of the western side of the field after reviewing 1,400 ultrasound inspections on five miles of the pipeline and discussing the matter with federal and state regulators.BP said it would monitor the pipeline around the clock and use infrared cameras from the sky and the ground to detect small leaks. It will run a high-tech device known as a “smart pig” through the line by November to search for weaknesses in pipe walls.“With greatly enhanced surveillance and response capability, I am confident we can continue to safely operate the line,” Bob Malone, chairman and president of BP America, said in a statement.The company said it was producing about 150,000 barrels of oil and natural gas per day from the western side of the field, but hoped to reach about 200,000 barrels a day.'"

"'06-08-12,'0','DENVER, Aug. 11 — Most travelers went to the nation’s airports on Friday battened down and prepared. They had packed their bags differently, arrived early and strategized about things that they had given little thought to before. Like drinking water. To chug or not to chug? To stop for a coffee before the security checkpoint or wait it out and hope there would be time to buy and sip before boarding?Mike and Barb Roberts, of Norwalk, Ohio, exemplified the new model of the airport traveler as planner extraordinaire. They were flying out of Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Cleveland.“All that’s in our carry-on is mainly reading material and clothes,” said Mr. Roberts, who had been with his wife in Boston this week celebrating their 25th anniversary. “Things like aftershave and contact lens solution we left out.”“We got up early to make sure we put certain things in the correct bags,” he added. “All the liquid things, we had to make sure we checked those.”That accomplished, they got to the airport four hours before the flight.Some security lines were long, as airport security workers screened and examined carry-on luggage for liquids, gels, creams and other newly prohibited items.

"'06-08-12,'0','Attempts by Wal-Mart and others to allow alcohol sales in other places that remain dry — 415 counties in the South and in Kansas still prohibit such sales — are meeting fierce resistance from some church groups and religious leaders. They argue that returning to the days when liquor flowed will mean more family violence, under-age drinking, drunken driving and a general moral decay in the community.But voters are increasingly likely to follow their pocketbooks rather than the words of their pastors. Alcohol proponents often make the case that liberalizing laws will increase tax revenue and reduce the need for property tax increases, an issue looming large in voters’ minds.More dry-to-wet measures have passed than have been defeated in the last four years in Texas, Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee and Kansas, the states where the battles are concentrated. “The communities who effectively make arguments about economic development and tax dollars typically win the votes,” said John Hatch, a political strategist based in Austin, Tex.Some churches are taking a moderate stand on drinking. The Rev. Mike Hunter, senior minister at the First Christian Church in Lufkin, Tex., said he was invited by some of the more conservative clergy members in town to participate in meetings to oppose legalizing alcohol, but declined. “It’s a decision we leave up to individuals,” he said. “The legal, responsible consumption of alcohol is not a pulpit point in our congregation.”The issue is now playing out in Lufkin, an old railroad town in the heart of the Texas Bible Belt 115 miles northeast of Houston. On a recent Monday night, 175 citizens gathered at the town’s civic center to voice their opposition to a referendum proposal, scheduled for a vote in November, that would allow sales of beer and wine in stores and drinks in restaurants all across Angelina County. Lufkin is the county’s largest town, with 35,000 people.“This is an unprecedented attack against the family,” the Rev. Ronnie L. Frankens, pastor of Homer Pentecostal Church in neighboring Diboll, said of the alcohol vote. “We are going to fight this tooth and nail.” His rousing words were greeted with cries of “amen” and “praise Jesus.”Like many in attendance that night, Linda Jones, who works for the city of Lufkin and whose husband is a pastor at the First Baptist Church in nearby Moscow, said she thought the measure, if passed, would invite more pernicious forms of commerce, like bars, nightclubs and liquor stores. She says she considers drinking to be a sin and does not partake. “My grandmother was an alcoholic and I never wanted to be like that,” she said.On the other side of the debate are people like Sarah Strinden, who moved to Lufkin in the 1980’s from Madison, Wis. She says that most people she knows are moderate drinkers and would just like the convenience of being able to buy beer and wine on their regular shopping trips. Currently, she says that getting some wine to go with dinner involves a 40-minute round-trip drive to a liquor store in Nacogdoches.In restaurants in dry areas of Texas, diners who want to order drinks can do so only if they become members of the restaurant’s “club.” Such memberships are usually free to the customer, but restaurants must spend up to $20,000 a year for record-keeping and fees to the alcoholic beverage commission. “Lufkin needs to come into the modern age,” Ms. Strinden said.Across the South, some business groups seem to agree with her, backing efforts to nudge dry towns and counties to go wet.“It’s going to be much harder to attract restaurants and grocery stores to your town if they can’t sell alcohol,” said Mr. Hatch, the political strategist who has been hired to help get the measure passed in Angelina County.Mr. Hatch and other proponents say their campaigns have been financed by a diverse group that includes grocery chains like Albertson’s, Kroger and Safeway; and restaurant groups like Brinker International, which owns Chili’s Grill and Bar, and Darden Restaurants, owner of Red Lobster and Olive Garden.And, of course, Wal-Mart. “I think Sam Walton, being the family-oriented man he was, would be rolling over in his grave about this,” Mr. Frankens, the pastor of Homer Pentecostal Church, said in a telephone interview, referring to the Wal-Mart founder. “I’m really disappointed in Wal-Mart as a company.”Wal-Mart does not break out revenue from alcohol, but according to A. C. Nielsen, at the end of 2004 Wal-Mart had United States alcohol revenue of $1 billion out of total domestic revenue of $229 billion.Retailers and restaurants say the ability to sell alcohol is not a precondition for choosing a new location, but it is a factor. For casual dining chains, the average restaurant check doubles when someone orders an alcoholic beverage, according to the research firm NPD Group.The Distilled Spirits Council, the Washington-based trade group for liquor manufacturers, says it has participated in half a dozen local elections, providing some combination of financial assistance and economic data.In Duncanville, a Dallas suburb of 36,000, voters bought the argument made by a group called Citizens for Shopping More and Less Taxes, which was financed by town residents, local convenience stores and real estate developers, as well as Safeway and Kroger. The group said the town would get some a much-needed tax boost by allowing beer and wine sales in grocery and convenience stores.The town is now seeing that boost. Before the vote in September 2003, Duncanville had experienced four years of declining sales tax revenue. But revenue rose slightly in the first two years, and is up 15 percent for the first seven months of 2006 compared with the period in 2005, according to the Texas comptroller. The Duncanville city manager, Kent Cagle, estimates that beer and wine sales are bringing in $500,000 a year in sales taxes.“This extra revenue has kept us from cutting new services and we’re starting to put back some of the things we had cut, like parks maintenance, some city positions and street maintenance and signs,” Mr. Cagle said.Those who fight against alcohol sales say the extra tax revenue comes at a cost. Lee Miller, a leader of Angelina Citizens for a Better Community, the group vowing to defeat the measure, points to data from the state of Texas showing that for every $1 in revenue the state received from alcohol, $9 is paid out for expenses like treatment for alcohol abuse, law enforcement services and motor vehicle crashes.“This will not benefit us as a community,” Mr. Miller said. “It costs us more money in expenses and in the lives of our children.”Mr. Miller, who does not drink, says he is concerned that if the vote passes, his 12-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son will have easier access to alcohol.Mr. Hatch, the political strategist, argues that Mr. Miller’s cost revenue figures paint an inaccurate picture because they do not consider the additional sales taxes from alcohol purchases, only revenue from alcohol excise taxes, the bulk of which flow to the state.Oscar Dillahunty, a 69-year-old, one-time beer distributor who hired Mr. Hatch and started Angelina County Citizens for Responsible Business, has estimated that the county could rack up at least $15 million in annual beer sales alone, which would translate into $225,000 in sales tax revenue for Lufkin and $75,000 for the county. He says his estimate is based on sales in a similar county in Mississippi, where he previously owned a beer distributor.As for concerns about social consequences, studies that have linked increases in the number of alcohol outlets to violence or drunken driving draw the strongest correlation between such problems and bars. Most of the recent dry-to-wet proposals in the South do not allow for bars.Many officials in towns and counties that recently went wet say they have not seen an increase in reported crime or drunken driving. Mr. Cagle, the city manager in Duncanville, said the town had not devolved into “Drunkenville,” as church groups claimed it would.Three police chiefs — David Walker of Fort Payne, Tex.; Benny Womack of Albertville, Ala.; and Eddie Phillips of East Ridge, Tenn. — all say they have not seen any increase in law enforcement problems since alcohol sales began in 2004.But just as the feared public mayhem wrought by alcohol abuse often fails to materialize, the economic prosperity is often absent, too. In Albertville, Ala., the Rev. Willis Kelly, who preaches at Douglas First Baptist Church, says he is still waiting for the town’s financial boom.“The folks that wanted it to go wet campaigned on the idea that it would bring in money to build a new school,” Mr. Willis said. “Last year they collected only a little over $100,000 in extra taxes. That wouldn’t even buy toilet paper.”Mr. Willis says no new restaurants have opened in Albertville, a town of 18,000 people 65 miles from Birmingham, since the vote in June 2004, and only one of the two grocery stores in town opted to sell beer and wine.Jon Howard, director of finance for Albertville, would not confirm Mr. Willis’s tax numbers and Mayor Carl Pruett declined to comment on the town’s economy.In Lufkin, where in recent years the economy has been surging without the help of alcohol sales, some citizens just want their town to be a bit more like the rest of the country and a little less Bible Belt. “This is the 21st century,” said Ernest Rowe, a 70-year-old retired forest worker. “I just want to be able to buy my case of Coors Light, come home and pop open a cold one.”'"

The S.E.C. adopted the first overhaul of executive pay rules in 14 years last month but shelved the measure on top nonexecutives after it received complaints that disclosing the salaries could stir jealousy among employees and help recruiters steal workers.BOSTON SCIENTIFIC’S LAWSUITS The Boston Scientific Corporation has almost 550 individual and class-action lawsuits pending because of problems with heart devices made by the Guidant Corporation, the medical equipment maker that Boston acquired in April.

"'06-08-12,'0','BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 11 — An audit by the international accounting firm Ernst & Young portrays Iraq as a country that cannot keep its books straight, where elementary accounting errors of up to a billion dollars are routine and where no one can say how much of the country’s oil revenues end up in government coffers.An auditing board sponsored by the United Nations, which had hired Ernst & Young to carry out the work, posted a summary of the findings on its Web site late Thursday. The audit focused on the nearly $22 billion that Iraq generated in 2005 from oil revenues, which form the basis for virtually the entire national economy.But in a country in need of every dollar it can generate to restore a crumbling infrastructure, pay government salaries and train its security forces, the auditors found enormous sums simply deposited in the wrong government account or counted differently by various official agencies. The actual oil exports could not be determined accurately because Iraq still does not have modern equipment for measuring what its pipelines pour into tankers.The panel, the International Advisory and Monitoring Board of the Development Fund for Iraq, was created by the United Nations to supervise an account dominated by Iraqi oil revenues but also including interest payments and money seized from Saddam Hussein’s government.Referring to the tracking of money from the development fund, sometimes called the D.F.I., the board said in statement that “overall control systems are ineffective,” and that the government’s financial institution suffered from a “lack of written policies and procedures” and “staff who are not properly trained to deal with the nature and complexity of D.F.I. transactions.”'"
"'06-08-12,'0','Most of the major search engines like Google, Yahoo and MSN collect and store information on what terms are searched, when they were queried and what computer and browser was used. And to the extent that the information can be used to match historic search behavior emanating from a specific computer, it is a hot commodity.As it stands now, little with regard to search queries is private. No laws clearly place search requests off-limits to advertisers, law enforcement agencies or academic researchers, beyond the terms that companies set themselves.“This is a discussion that we as a society need to have,” said Kevin Bankston, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a rights organization based in San Francisco.Mr. Bankston’s group, which is spearheading a class-action lawsuit against AT&T for sharing consumer phone records with the National Security Agency, issued an alert this week calling the AOL incident a “Data Valdez,” asserting that it may be in violation of the Electronic Communications and Privacy Act, which regulates some forms of online communications.“I am very skeptical of any claims that the monetary worth of this information to these companies is worth the privacy trade-off to millions of people,” Mr. Bankston said.That is not to say that marketers are not keenly interested in being able to push ads to a particular computer based on the types of searches coming from that address over time. For users who register as members with some search engines, including Yahoo, this is already happening — although consumers are unlikely to realize it.Which is why privacy advocates question whether such advertising models are appropriate in the first place.“In many contexts, consumers already have the expectation that information about their cultural consumption will not be sold,” said Chris Jay Hoofnagle, a senior researcher at Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley. “They understand that the library items that they check out, the specific television shows that they watch, the videos that they rent are protected information.”Indeed, legislation like the Cable TV Privacy Act of 1984 and the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 were tailored to keep the specific choices consumers make in their daily diet of cultural ephemera off limits.There are exceptions: video “genre preferences,” for instance, may be disclosed for marketing purposes.And of course, such fare as magazine subscription lists and club membership information are bought and sold for marketing purposes all the time.But how to characterize a search engine’s vast catalog, not of what an individual bought, rented or subscribed to, but merely what he or she was curious about — perhaps only for a moment in time — for reasons that are impossible to know?That’s one thing that the culture and the law need to address fully, Mr. Hoofnagle suggested. And simply relying on the terms of service posted by Internet companies to sort things out, he said, is not enough.“The problem with the consent model is that users don’t read the terms and it’s hard to comprehend what the effect of storing the data over time will be,” Mr. Hoofnagle said. “And there’s a corresponding promise that the company will protect the data,” he added, “and sometimes, obviously, those promises are broken.”Indeed, AOL’s publication of user search data comes in a social context that is newly sensitive about data leaks.“Part of this conversation should be about the responsibility of companies to maintain data securely,” said Mr. Hoofnagle, who was among several privacy advocates who were critical of ChoicePoint, the large commercial data broker, in the months before the disclosure in February last year that criminals had foiled its screening protocols and gained access to consumer information.“The longer companies hold onto information, the greater the risk,” Mr. Hoofnagle said.The ChoicePoint debacle, in fact, was a watershed moment for data security law, at least at the state level, with at least 30 states enacting some form of breach-notification legislation requiring businesses to notify consumers if their information is compromised.Numerous bills have been proposed in Congress as well, but pitched battles between privacy advocates, who seek comprehensive data protections for consumers, and the financial industry, which wants to limit any onerous legislation and pre-empt tougher state laws, have stalled progress.It is not surprising, then, that a bill by Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, that seeks to force Web sites, including search engines, to purge old data, has not moved since its introduction in February.“Corporate negligence with consumers’ personal information shouldn’t be tolerated by average Americans, the financial markets, or the federal government,” Representative Markey said in an e-mail message.The bill was inspired by the Justice Department’s subpoenas for search data held by MSN, Yahoo, AOL and Google this year — a move aimed at bolstering the government’s efforts to uphold an online child pornography law. Google was alone in resisting the subpoena in federal court, which mostly sided with the company, granting the government access only to information on Web site addresses returned in Google searches, rather than search terms entered by users.And yet the vast data troves held by search engines and Internet companies of all stripes continue to present an irresistible investigatory target, particularly in an era of terrorist plots like the one that seriously disrupted British airports, and much of the rest of global aviation this week.In December, the European Parliament passed sweeping data retention rules aimed at the telecommunications and Internet industries, requiring that fixed-line and cellphone records, e-mail and Internet logs be stored for up to two years. The measure was lauded by law enforcement groups but decried by privacy advocates and even industry, which would have to find space — and money — to store it all.Congress, too, has toyed with the idea of drafting data retention legislation, and Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales has signaled on numerous occasions that he would like to see that happen.Speaking at the Search Engine Strategies 2006 Conference and Expo in San Jose, Calif., on Wednesday, Google’s chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, suggested that government interest in the sort of information Google archives remains a chief concern for his company.“I’ve always worried that the query stream was a fertile ground for governments to randomly snoop on people,” he said.In a public forum with Danny Sullivan, the editor of Search Engine Watch, an online news blog, and the San Jose event’s organizer, Mr. Schmidt was asked about the AOL incident. “It’s obviously a terrible thing, and the data as released was obviously not anonymized enough,” Mr. Schmidt said.Mr. Schmidt also said his company, which stores every query its visitors make, deploys numerous safeguards to protect and keep that data anonymous, and that he was confident that “this sort of thing would not happen with Google — although,” he added, “you can never say never.”That might be the battle cry of privacy advocates, who wonder why any company that doesn’t have to, and that wants to maintain the faith of its customers, would bother to hang onto so much data.“This AOL breach is just a tiny drop in the giant pool of information that these companies have collected,” Mr. Bankston said. “The sensitivity of this data cannot be overemphasized.”A similar sentiment was at the heart of an e-mail message sent to employees by AOL’s own chief executive, Jonathan F. Miller, on Wednesday.“We work so hard to protect this kind of information, and yet it was made public without review by our privacy experts, undermining years of industry leadership in a single act,” Mr. Miller wrote. “The reaction has been a powerful reminder of how quickly a company such as AOL can forfeit the good will we have worked for years to engender.”'"
"'06-08-12,'0','The proposal, industry analysts said, makes strategic sense for CVRD as the company, once a state-owned domestic monopoly, seeks to build on the international growth that has enabled it to become a major player in global mining since it was privatized in 1997. Nickel, a key element in the manufacture of stainless steel, naturally complements its core business in iron ore, the primary component in steel making.Inco shareholders, especially cash-hungry hedge funds, could very well favor the prospect of an immediate and higher payout over the rival bids already presented, which offer a mix of cash and shares. Considering the high valuations of many mining stocks in today’s financial markets, analysts said, shareholders are likely to prefer cash to stocks that could lose value amid future market volatility.“There are some pretty elevated equity prices out there right now, so cash is most likely to be the preferable option,” said David Davidson, a mining analyst at Paradigm Capital in Toronto.Investors focused on the long term, however, might offer some resistance to the bid, especially considering what is expected to remain a healthy and sustained demand for metals and minerals well into the next decade. An immediate cash payoff, moreover, would create more tax liabilities than a partial payment in stock.“We like the sector and would like to continue having a position in these companies going forward,” said John Kinsey, an investment manager at Caldwell Securities, a brokerage firm in Toronto that owns Inco shares. “We’d prefer to keep part of the investment over a huge, taxable capital gain.”News of the CVRD offer caused mining stocks to buck a downward trend at the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday, with Inco shares climbing over 3 percent. Shares in CVRD, meanwhile, dropped slightly at the São Paulo stock exchange, as some investors sold amid concern the transaction could weaken the company’s cash reserves and debt structure.CVRD said its offer was backed by a two-year loan from four multinational banks: Credit Suisse, UBS, ABN Amro and Banco Santander. If Inco shareholders accept the deal, the company added, it would restructure the loan through longer-term financing.An Inco spokesman, Bruce Drysdale, said the company would not comment on the bid at least until it received CVRD’s formal offer on Monday. Peter Faur, a spokesman for Phelps Dodge, also declined to comment. Don Lindsay, chief executive of Teck Cominco, said in a statement that the company would evaluate CVRD’s bid, but that the company “will not be drawn into an expensive bidding war for Inco.”'"
"'06-08-12,'0','For years, when September looms, you reconnect with a particular circle, the parents of your children’s friends, classmates and teammates. There are car pools and play dates to schedule. You catch up on the summer’s doings when you drop the children off at the game or the concert. One fall after the next, you encounter dozens of people you know at back-to-school nights, field hockey practices or play rehearsals.And then, somewhat abruptly, all that ends. You’re prepared, sort of, for the unoccupied room, the empty seat at the dinner table. But a whole other cast of characters also falls away, which can take you by surprise.I wouldn’t call all these people friends, exactly. Yet they were certainly more than acquaintances. We were in one another’s homes, sometimes shared informal meals, passed on valuable intell about which piano teacher to sign up with and which science teacher to avoid.It always bugged my husband that when he ran into such people at the bank or the supermarket in later years, their first words invariably were, “How’s Emma?” Often, in these fleeting encounters, they never got around to “How is Paula?” or “How are you?” He always found the intensity of suburban child-centrism a little alarming.But it’s as pointless to complain about as traffic jams and big-box stores. Children are the currency of the suburbs, the common language, often the impetus for being there in the first place.One reason we got to know all these moms and dads, aside from simple proximity, is that it actually did take a village. Sooner or later, a day came when the school nurse called and told you to take your feverish second grader home, but you were on the wrong side of the tunnel at a meeting you couldn’t miss. Or you’d had minor surgery and couldn’t drive, or your car was in the shop. At times, we all needed someone to step into the breach, and we wanted those someones to be people we, and our children, knew and trusted.But another motive, I’m convinced, is that we yearned for yardsticks. How many assignments do you undertake without finding out for 15 or 20 years whether you did a good job or truly botched it? There was always a kind of score-keeping under way, and insights into how other families were faring proved sometimes cheering, sometimes discouraging.I always thought my daughter’s room was messy — until I saw the truly staggering disarray of some of her pals’ rooms. Possibly I should have been alarmed when, at age 7 or so, she went through a phase of eating only white foods: rice, bananas, naked pasta. But plenty of her friends had finicky culinary habits, too, as I learned from their parents and saw during communal dinners. I’m sure we provided similar comfort or dismay to other families.Very few of these adults are part of my social circle now, though I’m glad when I bump into them. The nodes that used to connect us no longer do; the concerns that seemed so pressing have receded. My grown daughter eats every ethnic cuisine you can find in Brooklyn, which is every ethnic cuisine. (Her room, though. ... )Some parents try to maintain these relationships. I know of one couple who gave an Empty Nest Dinner for all the adults they’d grown accustomed to seeing and no longer would. My friend Carol has met monthly for lunch with several women whose sons have been buddies since kindergarten; they’ve become friends themselves and may continue lunching even after their boys leave for college next year.These are warm gestures, but I haven’t tried to emulate them; it seems like fighting nature, somehow. Although I’ve made a point of holding onto one couple, I’ve let go of the others, accepting that we once had important matters in common but no longer do.The friendships I treasure now are different, founded on more adult interests. I meet people for lunch or a movie, and we don’t talk about our children all that much. They might wonder how Emma likes her new apartment; I might want to hear what Becky wore to the dance.But mostly we ask: What’s new at work? What happened at that job interview? Did you get any offers on the house? What did the doctor say?How are you?'"

"'06-08-13,'0','As the latest plot suggests, he said, that does not mean total victory is at hand. “We won the war against the old Al Qaeda. But we’re not winning against the global social movement that Al Qaeda was part of, because more and more kids are joining the movement,” he said.Michael Scheuer, a former head of the C.I.A. unit that focuses on Mr. bin Laden, says there may be more left of the old Al Qaeda than Mr. Sageman thinks. But he, too, doubts that Mr. bin Laden had anything to do with the airliner plot and emphasizes Al Qaeda’s role as the inspiration and support for a broader movement.“There are an amazing number of people who are connected to Al Qaeda” through training or funding, Mr. Scheuer said. “But the connection is not command and control.”Some government officials acknowledge privately that Washington has been slow to consider the possibility that the international jihad movement is without any central organization.“We’re still wrapped up in thinking that this is a hierarchical organization,” said one intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We have a major problem out there, because the fact is that there is no command and control, and there are so many copycats out there.”Top American officials said in their first comments after news of the arrests in Britain that the scheme bore “the hallmarks” of Al Qaeda. Media coverage dwelt at length on the possibility of ties to the group. The identification on Friday of Mr. Rauf appeared to nail down a connection.Speculation about a possible role of another suspected militant still being sought in Pakistan, Matiur Rehman, an explosives expert, has added to the notion of a Qaeda role, though few agree on whether he is linked with the group’s operations in Pakistan.Mr. Rehman is a “person of interest” in the airliner plot but it is unclear whether he played a role, the intelligence official said. Even top intelligence officials are uncertain about what is left of Al Qaeda beyond its top two leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, who are believed to be in hiding in Pakistan.“Those of us in the counterterrorism community debate this all the time: what do we mean when we say ‘Al Qaeda’?” said Brian Fishman, of the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy. “There’s a lot of disagreement.”The West Point center has published a study of Al Qaeda documents that include an almost comically bureaucratic set of personnel rules on salary and vacation. One reads: “The salary of a married Mujahed brother is 1,000 Pakistani rupee. The bachelor Mujahed qualifies for a round-trip ticket to his country after one year from joining the organization.”The date of the documents is uncertain, but they clearly were written when Al Qaeda was based in Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 and had the greatest freedom of action, Mr. Fishman said.“It really looked like a corporate organization,” he said. “But even then, bin Laden and Zawahiri saw their job as inspiring a movement of youth around the world. They were under no illusion that they could topple the United States on their own.”In fact, Al Qaeda was not for long the stable and hierarchical organization implied by its personnel policies. Much of the discussion of the group this week focused on the similarities between the foiled trans-Atlantic plot and an earlier failed scheme dating from 1994, the so-called Bojinka plan to bring down 11 airliners over the Pacific.But contrary to widespread belief, said Paul R. Pillar, a former C.I.A. analyst now at Georgetown University, neither the Bojinka plot nor the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center were, strictly speaking, Al Qaeda operations. Both took place before Mr. bin Laden moved from Sudan to establish his base in Afghanistan in 1996 and intelligence officials believe neither was directed by him.Ramzi Yousef, who is now imprisoned in Colorado, was involved in both the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the Bojinka plot, in which Mr. Yousef’s uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, also played a role. Only in 1998 did Mr. Mohammed formally join Al Qaeda, but his later role as the chief architect of the Sept. 11 attacks has led to the association of the group with the earlier plots.Nonetheless, the invocation of Al Qaeda, and the still-chilling image of Mr. bin Laden, have provided an effective way to encapsulate and personalize the otherwise overwhelming threat of terrorism. In the same way, the image of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the head of the loosely affiliated branch of Al Qaeda in Iraq, came to stand for the entire Iraqi insurgency.But the insurgency has continued uninterrupted since Mr. Zarqawi was killed in June. Similarly, the larger terrorist threat would likely not be significantly diminished if Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahiri were killed, most specialists believe.References to Al Qaeda by American officials have unmistakable political implications, as demonstrated by the Bush administration’s bitterly disputed attempts to link Saddam Hussein to Al Qaeda to justify the invasion of Iraq. There are also legal implications, stemming in part from the Congressional authorization of military force approved days after the Sept. 11 attacks, which targeted those who “planned, authorized, committed, or aided” those attacks rather than terrorists generally.But the focus on Al Qaeda reflects a natural human tendency to paint the enemy in understandable terms, Mr. Fishman said.“The world is simpler when we have one enemy,” he said. “When we talk about a social movement and self-radicalizing, homegrown groups, that’s nothing like we have faced in the past.”'"
"'06-08-13,'0','Every few minutes or so, there is a surprisingly loud sound as a boulder comes thundering down, sending a cloud of dust into the air. The sharp crackle of smaller stones rolling down the cliff face is almost continuous.The spectacle is a reminder that the Alps have been hit hard by rising temperatures, and it underscores warnings from scientists that thawing permafrost — the frozen soil that can glue mountains together — will cause more havoc.Glaciers in the Alps may have lost up to a tenth of their volume in the hot 2003 summer alone, researchers at Zurich University have said, and the ice now only occupies a third to a half of its volume in 1850.Warming is at least part of the reason the five million tons of rock are slowly sliding off the Eiger — one of Switzerland’s most legendary peaks, whose infamous North Face has claimed the lives of dozens of climbers.Several sometimes fatal accidents among climbers have been attributed to increasingly unstable conditions on lofty slopes and ridges. Switzerland’s news media have even started pondering the endurance of the snow-capped mountains that define the nation’s identity. But Hans- Rudolf Keusen, a geologist, whose company, Geotest, has been ordered by the authorities to monitor the Eiger rock slide, cautions against jumping to conclusions.“It’s got to do with the retreating of the glacier, which at least partially is caused by global warming,” he said. But he added: “The Alps are not falling apart. Not that quickly anyway.”Huge rock slides took place in the Alps long before there were any signs that world temperatures were rising.In 1806, a chunk of mountain 20 times the size of the rock now coming off the Eiger, killed 457 people in a valley near another mountain, wiping the entire village of Goldau off the map in one of Switzerland’s worst disasters.When he opened his cabin for business in June in the heartland of Switzerland’s tourism industry, Mr. Burgener became the first to notice something moving in the rock on the cliff face.His hopes of making more money seem dulled by his worries about what climate change is doing to this valley.“Anybody can see it,’’ he said. “It’s going rapidly, with the glacier disappearing, the moraines are getting bigger, the streams coming down are enormous. And it hasn’t rained; it’s all meltwater.”He should know. His cabin was built only this year — after a mudslide swept the ground from under his old place just a few hundred yards away.'"
"'06-08-13,'0','Stocks actually rose Thursday, after the authorities in London announced that they had uncovered a plot to set off bombs in airplanes bound for the United States. But the market fell for the week anyway.The prospect of resumed interest rate tightening by the Federal Reserve weighed on the market, even though the central bank decided Tuesday not to raise its benchmark rate after 17 consecutive increases. But the bank said it would study data on economic growth and inflation and decide whether to raise rates at future meetings. The market fell after the Fed statement, and it fell again on Wednesday.It rebounded Thursday, after the announcement of the thwarted terrorist plot. But on Friday, stocks fell again, on a report that retail sales had risen briskly — raising the chances of future interest rate increases.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 152.32 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 11,088.03. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 12.62 points, or 1 percent, to close at 1,266.74. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 27.34 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 2,057.71.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.97 percent from 4.89 percent the previous week.'"
"'06-08-13,'0','Visa Signature, American Express Platinum and MasterCard Premium are vying for customers like them with the lure of experiences — whether behind-the-scenes access at events like the Tonys or the Kentucky Derby, or the chance to participate in anything from fly-fishing jaunts to high-fashion events to simulated space flights.These packages can carry hefty price tags, though many consumers are willing to pay. (And some retailers grumble that they are really paying part of the cost because of the higher transaction fees that card companies charge for using premium cards.)Visa is generally aiming its Signature programs at people with household incomes of $125,000 or more — an estimated 25 million adults fit this category — and who charge an average of $28,000 a year on their cards. Other card companies are also focusing on that segment.These people are typically not in the select category of mega-spenders — those who put $250,000 or more a year on their credit cards and who may be invited to acquire an American Express Centurion card, which offers a more rarefied level of access. Nonetheless, the card companies find the midlevel spenders attractive because of the sheer total volume of their purchases.Consumers are no longer satisfied with credit-card perks like airplane seat upgrades and help in travel planning, said James F. McCarthy, senior vice president at Visa USA for consumer credit products.“They want to be rewarded for their ‘spend’ with unique experiences that match their personal interests,” he said.June Hersh and her daughter, Jennifer, attended a Mother’s Day event that American Express organized in New York for holders of its Platinum and Centurion cards at the Madison Avenue boutique of the fashion designer Carolina Herrera.“It was a blast,” said Mrs. Hersh, whose family owns the Murray Feiss Lighting Company in the Bronx.“It was an old-fashioned ladies’ tea with flowers and lovely china and a runway fashion show,“ said Mrs. Hersh, who divides her time between Manhattan and Bedford, N.Y. “They did not stint.”Also included were $500 gift certificates, delivered by Federal Express, for everyone in the 20 sets of mothers and daughters; each attendee paid $550 for the afternoon. Mrs. Hersh used the certificate to buy a purse, and her daughter bought a sweater.Mrs. Hersh, a longtime cardholder, wasn’t likely to desert American Express, but the event certainly helped to cement her loyalty. “It was like going to the Emerald City,” she said, “and being able to peek behind the curtain.”Some American Express Platinum cardholders looked behind the curtain of space flight last month with a zero-gravity flight on a modified Boeing plane in Orlando, Fla. At $6,500 a person, the chance to fly with the Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin proved so popular that American Express has added a second “go weightless” flight.In the quest to offer new experiences, card companies are not neglecting dining. But even the chance to snare a reservation at a hot restaurant may not satisfy the affluent, so the card giants are offering various invitation-only epicurean events.In April, American Express card members nibbled on canapés and sipped Champagne at Daniel, the Manhattan restaurant, to celebrate “Eggs,” the book from the chef Michael Roux, and got autographed copies.In October, also in Manhattan, invited card members will learn about the qualities of Dom Pérignon Champagne from an expert, sample top vintages and wrap up with a dinner at the high-end Japanese restaurant Morimoto, for $550 a person.Card companies are not jettisoning tried-and-true packages like those for the Super Bowl, but they are giving participants more personalized service and more access to places they could not go otherwise.Mary Theresa Allen and her husband, Jim Michael, of Oakland, Calif., are Visa Signature cardholders who signed up for Visa’s Super Bowl XL package last February in Detroit. For $5,995, the couple got a three-night hotel stay, end-zone seating and a visit to the broadcast booth. They also mingled with the players at parties. Visa also provided transportation around Detroit for the couple, who were among three dozen people attending with Visa.“It was so electric to see the best of the best,” said Ms. Allen, a financial adviser and an Oakland Raiders fan. Their experience prompted the couple, in their 50’s, to sign up for this year’s Tony Awards package as well as one for the Kentucky Derby. In the Derby package, they received lodging, some meals and transportation around Louisville, tickets to both the Kentucky Oaks race and the 132nd running of the Derby, a tour of the Churchill Downs stables and a private brunch at the derby’s museum. The price was $4,250 a couple, without airfare.Statistics appear to show the appeal of premium cards. While American Express would not reveal figures, Visa USA said that in the first quarter of this year, 3.5 percent of its consumer credit accounts were of the Signature variety, accounting for $30.3 billion, or 22.2 percent, of its card spending. In the same period, spending on the Signature card —introduced in 1997 — grew 20 percent and the number of new accounts was up 38 percent over the same period last year, according to Visa. As of May, there were 11.3 million Visa Signature cards.Seeking to increase spending by cardholders, MasterCard International in January introduced its own package of special offers geared to the affluent, said Nicole Risafi, vice president for global premium products.THE battle for big spenders has been fought for decades, of course, but surveys show that the newest twist is persuading them that they are getting value for the money spent, Mr. McCarthy of Visa said.Two-thirds of those with premium cards say they like to do everything they can to maximize rewards from their cards, according to a Visa survey released last year. And 78 percent of affluent spenders have payment cards that enable them to earn rewards and enjoy perks, compared with only 38 percent of the general population.What is the downside? Some cards carry hefty fees, like the $395 yearly cost of the American Express Platinum card. Fees vary for Visa Signature, from $40 to about $150, but some are free, depending on the issuing bank.Invisible to the customer is the higher fee — sometimes as much as a full additional percentage point — that a merchant is charged when premium cards are used. While stores have protested, and the National Retail Federation is lobbying Congress for changes, complaining that they are footing the bill for customer perks, the criticism doesn’t seem to have slowed their clients’ rush to premium cards.“The key is access,” Mr. Powell, a longtime Broadway buff, said. “You have a list of what you want to do in your life. And these programs are over and above whatever you could do on your own.”'"
"'06-08-13,'0','ON Monday afternoon, a musician from Park Slope named Lafayette Harris Jr. hopped onto his silver mountain bike and crossed four lanes of traffic on busy Fourth Avenue. He rode past a sprawling gas station and a row of noisy auto body shops to within two blocks of the Gowanus Canal, coasting up to the gleaming new eight-story Holiday Inn on Union Street, which was open for reservations on its first day in business.The lowlands east of Fourth Avenue, in an area that most people still aren’t calling Park Slope, might seem an unlikely location for a hotel that charges $139 a night ($149 on weekends, with rates rising to $199 and up in the fall peak season). But for Mr. Harris, whose wife just gave birth to their second son, it was perfect.“We don’t have much room, and we want to have people be able to visit,” he said with a smile, minutes after booking a room for his parents. “I don’t want my mom and dad to sleep on the floor.”Cathy Pascale, the hotel’s director of sales, said that most guests had similar stories. Many were planning visits to friends or family in the area or to a Brooklyn wedding — 35 or 40 wedding groups, she said, have already reserved rooms for the fall.In the coming years, she said, she hopes that both of the desirable neighborhoods that surround Gowanus — Park Slope to the west, Carroll Gardens to the east — will expand, eventually meeting somewhere around the front door of the 115-room hotel.'"
"'06-08-13,'0','Some opening systems are powerfully in vogue for years and then begin a long retreat into obscurity, followed by a return to popularity. Sometimes new moves are discovered that give openings new life. But there can be other reasons they come back to the stage. One is that currently accepted methods of play begin to lose their kick and fail to give the opponent problems to solve. They no longer perplex, and have become useless for winning games.What is needed above all is a timely inspiration. But you may run out of them. They don’t grow on trees.So until you come across one, you have to do something. And lying at hand are the old familiar discarded ones. Thus, you trot them out for a last go. And they are not totally without value, except for that loss of zing.Take the use of 6 g3 against the Najdorf Sicilian. Some great theoreticians, like Reuben Fine, swore by it in the mid-1940’s. After all, it gave White a bulwark in the center. Nobody seemed to notice that it was passive and not conducive to producing attacking play. Only later was this point grasped.What’s wrong with it can be seen in a game in the 10th Petr Izmailov Memorial rapid tournament between Rustam Kasimdzhanov and Sergey Karjakin. Black was never under any pressure, and at the end, Kasimdzhanov fell into a little trap.The Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense arises after 5 ... a6.

"'06-08-13,'0','Despite some short-term fluctuations, inventory levels in the United States, for example, are “well above the upper end of the average range,” according to a recent Energy Department report. Growth in global demand has cooled, and new oil supplies have padded what had been a threadbare cushion of supply over demand.“You’re growing supply,” Mr. Dell said. “You’re growing inventories. And demand growth is slowing. But the price keeps going up.”The reason for this anomaly, he said, may be found in financial markets, specifically in the billions of dollars that investors, mainly pension funds and other typically conservative institutions, have poured into commodities in recent years.Commodities futures that track indexes like the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index or Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index have become fashionable for many investors. Their reasoning is that this asset class, though volatile, affords portfolio protection because it has often performed well when stocks and bonds have been weak.Close to $100 billion will be invested by pension funds and other institutions in futures contracts tied to the commodities indexes this year, up from less than $20 billion three years ago, according to Goldman Sachs.Pension funds, whose charters often prohibit short-selling, have been exerting upward pressure on futures prices, several analysts said. “They want to be long. They want to stay long and ‘don’t bother me with it.’ ” said William H. Brown III, president of WHB Energy Research in Chappaqua, N.Y. “It definitely adds a positive bias to the market.”This persistent upward pull on futures prices creates an arbitrage opportunity that drags the price of spot oil higher as well, according to Mr. Dell. With futures prices higher than the spot price, why not buy oil, store it and then sell it forward in the futures market at a profit? Mr. Dell and others argue that this is precisely what’s happening.“It’s a typical commodities play currently being employed in oil markets,” said Sal Gilbertie, a trader at Fimat USA in New York.Similarly, Phillip Verlander, an independent energy economist, said that on Aug. 4, for example, it was possible to “buy heating oil in New York Harbor at $2 a gallon and store it and sell a future to deliver it in December for $2.24,” and that many traders were doing so.Mr. Dell said that current oil prices were a bubble comparable to the tech investment bubble of several years ago — and that the oil bubble was likely to burst before very long.Others on Wall Street agreed that the flood of institutional dollars had had some effect, but they disagreed about just how much. Edward L. Morse, chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers, said, “There is no doubt in my mind that there’s an impact from a new class of investors into commodity markets, especially pension funds and also speculative investors including hedge funds.” That impact can at times be as much as $10 a barrel, but “fundamentals play a much bigger role,” he added.In a similar vein, Mr. Stuart of UBS said: “Explosive growth in commodity-related financial investments has translated into sharply higher prices and higher trading volumes on long-term oil futures. In effect, financial buyers have become consumers of oil, contributing to the persistence of high prices.”But he said that tight supplies, China’s growing appetite for oil and other considerations were more important. “The arbitrage that’s available is only one of the factors supporting the price of oil,” he said. Mr. Stuart expects the average price of oil to hold around $69 a barrel next year; oil has been trading around $75 recently.ON the other hand, Mr. Brown of WHB Energy Research supports Mr. Dell’s view of current price levels. He has studied the historical correlation of oil prices with inventory levels and, at current levels, oil should sell for just $27 a barrel, he said. The impact of passive, long-term investors “is in my view $33 a barrel,” he said, with other factors, like flagging production in the North Sea and in Nigeria accounting for much of the rest of the gap. Still, he says he does not expect prices to tumble unless there was “a major slowdown or even reversal of demand growth.”Mr. Dell said that prices could weaken once global storage capacity filled up, limiting the possibility of arbitrage profits. He said that this could happen within four to six months but emphasized that it would be hard to predict precisely when oil prices might move down.In Cushing, Okla, a giant oil storage hub, the tanks are indeed filling up. “In today’s environment, all the major tankage owners are being very well utilized,” said Rick Sandahl, senior vice president for market development at Enbridge Inc. He said that 80 to 90 percent of his company’s storage capacity of 12.5 million barrels was in use. Asked if his customers seemed to be hoarding oil to take advantage of a price arbitrage, Mr. Sandahl replied: “I would think it’s a factor in their decisions.”Investors who believe that oil prices are ready for a fall would want to avoid mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that are linked to commodities indexes. Mr. Dell said that stock investors should “underweight” oil, recommending only such “defensive” plays as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Total and Apache, all of which, he said, have “considerable excess cash flow beyond their capital spending needs.” As such, he added, they could withstand a drop in oil prices “and still deliver their growth plans.”'"
"'06-08-13,'0','THE Federal Reserve has chosen a wait-and-see approach on inflation and economic growth, and the central bankers will not have to wait long for a sign that their work is done — or not. The Fed and Wall Street are likely to pay close attention to reports this week on July inflation.Data on producer prices are scheduled for Tuesday and consumer prices on Wednesday.“Those are critical numbers,” said Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investors. A Bloomberg News poll of economists predicts increases of 0.2 percent in core producer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy items, and 0.3 percent in core consumer prices.The stock market has experienced wide swings since the Fed decided last week to hold the target on its key interest rate at 5.25 percent. Buyers evidently zeroed in on the absence of an 18th consecutive rate increase, while sellers appeared to focus on the Fed’s statement suggesting that further increases were ahead if the data warranted them.Mr. Koesterich cautioned that the inflation figures this week might relieve the bulls of some of their hope that the tightening cycle is over.“The risk is that both core numbers will be higher than expected,” he said. “In the last couple of employment reports, hourly earnings have been above expectations, and we’re also seeing capacity constraints in manufacturing. It’s not clear to me that inflationary pressures are behind us.”What is clearer to him is that the Fed has an extra incentive to raise rates again if further signs of rising prices appear.'"

Then you remember that he is a 42-year-old comic who makes his living acting like a raunchy adolescent.With Jimmy Kimmel, he served as a host of “The Man Show,” which featured the Juggy Dance Squad, bikini-clad babes jumping on a trampoline and showing off their, uh, buoyancy. Then for a decade he served as the comic relief on “Loveline,” a nationally syndicated call-in radio program for kids with sex and drug problems. He went big time in January when that other puer eternis, Howard Stern, moved to satellite radio and opened up his broadcast radio spot on the West Coast.

After the waitress listed the specials, including scallops, the fellows ordered halibut salmorillo and pinot noir.For a moment it sounded as if they worked for NPR. Then Mr. Carolla redeemed his dudeness. “I don’t understand scallops,” he said. “I’d recognize a cow, a pig, a swordfish or a lobster, but I’d scuba past a scallop.”“Maybe scallop is a word like ‘beef,’ ” Mr. Dameshek said. “It really isn’t an animal.”'"

The route is scheduled to go past sari shops, Indian banquet halls and an apartment complex where an arrest by a white police officer a few weeks ago spiraled into protests that culminated with epithets like “cockroaches” flying outside the municipal building.Edison is the sixth-largest municipality in the state, with 100,000 people spread over more than 30 square miles of what has long been a blank canvas for New Jersey’s distinctive rendering of the American experience. It is where the electric light was invented; where Ford, Westinghouse, Revlon and Lockheed Martin all built, and closed, factories; where capes and split-levels flourished along the commuter highway arteries; and where, over the last quarter-century, so many Indian immigrants have settled that they now account for about a third of the population, enough to help elect the first Asian mayor.Jun Choi, 35, grew up in Edison, the son of Korean immigrants who owned several dry cleaning businesses. He dreamed of becoming an astronaut, not the mayor. After earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, he was lured by politics, getting a master’s in public administration and working on Bill Bradley’s 2000 presidential campaign. He had never run for public office when he challenged Mayor George A. Spadoro in the Democratic primary in spring of 2005. He shocked everybody by winning, then won in November, too, by just 191 votes over a former Democratic councilman running as an independent.But tensions that started simmering last year when he was a candidate boiled over recently into the kind of emotionally charged racial issue that is much more difficult to discuss rationally in public than overdevelopment or cronyism, the themes of his campaign.On the day before last year’s India Day parade along Oak Tree Road — the central thoroughfare of what has come to be called Little India in North Edison and the Iselin section of neighboring Woodbridge — the Edison police stopped a group of volunteers who were hanging Indian flags from utility poles without a permit. There was swearing and resistance, according to the police; excessive force, according to the two men arrested. An internal investigation cleared the officers. The men paid a fine for hanging the flags, and the rest of the charges were dropped.'"

Jack Flaws, who owns Jack’s American Bistro and Wine Bar on Main Street in Old Saybrook, opened this new seasonal spot, Jack’s at Harbor One Marina, on Memorial Day and plans to keep it going through late October.Mr. Flaws said he had been thinking about a hot dog place for eight years and sampled a lot of sausages along the way. His all-time favorite, he said, and the one his own hot dogs are modeled on, is the one he ate as a child at Crickets in Stratford, which is now closed. A critical element, Mr. Flaws said, is the bun: the outside should be toasted in fresh butter until crispy, while the inside remains soft.Jack’s serves beef, turkey, pork and vegan hot dogs ($2.50) with a variety of accompaniments, from the “New England,” with mustard, hot pepper relish and sauerkraut, to the more elaborate “Chicago,” served in a poppy seed roll with mustard, jalapeño, tomato, cucumber and celery salt. Jack’s also makes a couple of salads, a lobster bisque, and eggs, granola and bagels for breakfast, and delivers to boats at Saybrook Point and Harbor One yacht slips. Mr. Flaws seems particularly proud of his house-made lobster dog ($13). This creation is made with lobster that is cooked until slightly underdone and shelled, ground with butter to keep it moist, then seasoned and stuffed into casing.

"'06-08-13,'0','As a longtime homeowner and resident of the Queen City of the Sound, I take exception to Joseph Berger’s description of our city as “the unassuming city of New Rochelle.”New Rochelle is far from unassuming. We have a thriving and involved population who have taken matters into our own hands when our city’s quality of life has been threatened, as in the Ikea debate. And we have a dynamic city government that protects our city’s future through the right kind of development.It has been a continuing challenge in New Rochelle to preserve the quality of our schools, our public library, and our police and fire protection in the face of dwindling tax dollars from the state government.Development of our downtown is the right direction for our city. No one prefers skyscrapers to idyllic parks, but the reality of fiscal constraints suggests that the right development will bring needed tax dollars to our schools, library, public services and city infrastructures.New Rochelle’s development is more than just high rises downtown (look at what is planned for Echo Bay). It’s about the rebirth of a vibrant city in an effort to improve the quality of life for all of its residents.As a 58-year-old lifelong resident of New Rochelle who has waited a long time for the Queen City’s grandness to return, I was disappointed by Joseph Berger’s Aug. 6 column.My husband and I built, ran and sold a business here, in part to support the renaissance of this city. We took a substantial risk to do this — but, unfortunately, we were just a little bit ahead of the development curve.

When the facts came out, it was obvious that I was no kingpin, but instead a low-level drug offender. But I was still sentenced to 15 years to life under the Rockefeller drug laws when I rejected a plea bargain. After serving 12 years, I was granted clemency by Gov. George E. Pataki.Recently, a report released by Bridget G. Brennan, New York City’s special prosecutor for narcotics, proclaimed that high-level drug offenders are being released under the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004. Ms. Brennan called for a kingpin statute.I agree. We do need a kingpin statue that would be applied to major traffickers. But it should not be used as a prosecutorial tool to encourage sentencing pleas from defendants like me.There are hundreds of low-level, nonviolent drug law offenders stuck in prison who deserve to have a chance to regain their freedom. Most have served a tremendous amount of time and are eligible for relief under the changes. They remain jailed because of the “kingpin” rationale that has become a standard response by district attorneys to block applications for re-sentencing under the new reforms.Anthony Papa New YorkThe writer, a communications specialist for the Drug Policy Alliance, is the author of a book about his experience in prison.Like any self-respecting shopper, I spend an inordinate amount of time at Stew Leonard’s (“Super-Duper Markets,” July 30).

"'06-08-13,'0','In Bergen County, sales were down 14 percent in the first half of this year from a year earlier, and inventory as of June 30 was up 85 percent; in Essex County, sales were down 14 percent and inventory was up 50 percent; in Hudson County, sales were down 15 percent and inventory was up 73 percent; in Monmouth County, sales were down 16 percent and inventory was up 57 percent; and in Morris County sales were down 18 percent and inventory was up 66 percent.Many real estate sales agents, though, said that the statistics sound worse than the reality.“I remember selling a condo in West Orange in 1986 for $288,000,” said Ken Baris, president of Jordan Baris Inc. Realtors. “Then, when the market really did drop, I sold the same unit again in 1993 — for $150,000.“That condo today — a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath unit at Eagle Ridge — would sell for close to $400,000,” he said. “It gained tremendously in value over these boom years, and while its value might be down a bit from the peak of the home-buying frenzy, there is no crash in the marketplace, or bursting bubble, or anything remotely like that.”Mr. Baris said there is simply no chance, in his opinion, that the value of the condo he cited might drop as sharply as it did 15 years ago because, he said, “this market just isn’t like that,” for a variety of reasons.Mr. Otteau’s report to subscribing real estate brokerage firms keeps track of signed contract sales in all 21 counties.“Given that the New Jersey housing market realized an 87 percent increase in home prices from 2000 to 2005, the adjustments now taking place come as no surprise,” said Mr. Otteau, referring to asking prices.He predicted a “bumpy ride” over the next few years if mortgage interest rates continue to rise, along with energy prices, and buyers and sellers struggle to assess the impact of such increases on home values.“There is mounting evidence,” he wrote in his report, “that home prices will decline over the short term as motivated sellers make decisions to accept a lower selling price in exchange for a quicker sale.”Meanwhile, new-home builders are starting to provide significant concessions to buyers, like subsidizing mortgage interest or making one or more mortgage payments, he noted. Those steps have the effect of lowering the effective price of the houses.Mr. Baris and other brokers said many sellers are having difficulty accepting the idea that they missed the moment when houses were selling for prices that had previously seemed far-fetched.“When the market was really going crazy, we had a lot of people who said they wanted to wait for the peak to put their homes up for sale,” said Mr. Baris, who runs his West Orange-based firm with his father, Jordan Baris. “We always told them, ‘You won’t know the peak until it’s passed.’ But a lot of people don’t believe it.”Maureen Doyle, who manages the Morristown office of ReMax, said a large majority of the houses on the market are now sold for less than the asking price, or only after the asking price has been reduced, perhaps even more than once — cuts that had been rare for the past few years.“Certainly, there are houses selling for full price — or even a little over” — if they are priced competitively, she said. “That’s the trick.”Two weeks ago, she said, she sold two houses, one for more than the asking price and the other for the asking price — which was the highest of three bids.“Last year, if you got three bids on a house, the lowest one would be for the asking price,” she said. “Still, three bids is great.”Mrs. Doyle said she made a rule in her office some years ago that if a house did not sell within 21 days, the price should come down. If a homeowner balked, she said, “that’s a stubborn seller.”In light of the glut of houses on the market, though, Mrs. Doyle said she had extended the waiting time before a price cut to a month or five weeks.In the exclusive community of Short Hills, in Morris County, Mrs. Doyle’s ReMax colleague, Jane Goetz, still sees the glass as half full.“Yes, buyers are being more selective,” she observed. “Buyers are looking less at houses that need work, and seem to want it all done.”For example, she said, she was representing the seller of a Victorian home that she called “an architectural masterpiece,” but that needs updating. It would have sold within a week last year, she said. Now, it has been awaiting serious interest for more than a month.On the other hand, Ms. Goetz said, she has a buyer who is willing to spend from $1.8 million to $4 million to buy just the right house in Short Hills or Summit, and she has not been able to find something appropriate.“Believe it or not, there’s not a lot out there right now,” she said.Mr. Baris said that looking at the increase in the percentage of unsold homes can be misleading. “In the early 90’s, when the market was really low, there were 600 houses on the market in West Orange,” he said. “At one point about two years ago, at the peak of the frenzy, for the first time ever in modern history probably, there were under 100 houses for sale in West Orange.”He estimated that there are now 200 houses on the market there, double the number of two years ago, and perhaps up 40 or 50 percent in the last six months. “I think that really does sound worse than it is,” he said, “The market was so crazy hot for a while that everything looks bad compared to it.”'"
"'06-08-13,'0','The history of Africa is often one of chaos and violence, greed and corruption. A veritable treasure chest just waiting to be opened, it is a place where fortune seekers have time and again jettisoned reason and humanity to line their pockets. In the age of European colonial rule, some of history’s famous, and some might say well-regarded, men undertook wildly reckless campaigns to protect their investments. More than 100 years later, the story seems to be repeating itself.In his history of the failed 2004 coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea, Adam Roberts provides a detailed account of how mercenaries sought to overthrow President Obiang Nguema and replace him with a puppet who would guarantee an abundance of riches from the country’s vast oil fields. Simon Mann, a British aristocrat and former officer in the Special Air Service, spearheaded the coup. He was educated at Eton, trained at Sandhurst and lived a privileged life in Britain and later in South Africa. As much as he loved cricket and garden parties, he was a thrill-seeker who reveled in Rambo-esque escapades throughout southern Africa. During the 1990’s he and another soldier of fortune, Tony Buckingham, worked with Executive Outcomes, a private security company that provided hired thugs to just about anyone in Africa.Their army, however, was anything but ragtag. Employing veterans from the notorious South African Army 32 Battalion, Mann and his partner directed major military operations in Angola to protect oil installations. In time, Executive Outcomes was deploying its troops in places like Papua New Guinea as well. It was not Western influence that eventually curtailed the company’s operations, but rather Nelson Mandela’s South African government, which passed an anti-mercenary law in 1998 making it illegal for anyone to offer military aid overseas. Without its South African base, Executive Outcomes was all but finished.Here is where Roberts, a staff correspondent for The Economist, picks up his story of the Wonga coup (“wonga” is British slang for a lot of money). He moves deftly between the politics of Equatorial Guinea — the tiny West African country he claims to be the most wretched on earth — and the growing restlessness of Mann and his cronies. At times Roberts overplays the gruesome nature of Equatorial Guinea’s dictatorial rulers, Macias Nguema and his nephew and successor, Obiang, particularly when it comes to accusations of cannibalism, but nonetheless he draws a convincing picture of wholesale corruption and brutality on the part of the country’s ruling class. His depiction of the soldiers amassed by Mann in the run-up to the coup oscillates between amusing and disturbing. The African leaders and the Europeans epitomize arrogance and avarice, and there is scarcely a likable person in the entire book.To reconstruct the planning and execution of what one conspirator called the “Assisted Regime Change,” Roberts draws largely on recently released documents in the British National Archives, as well as a host of private documents from and interviews with nearly all of the story’s major players (though he fails to provide any footnotes for his sources). With this evidence, “The Wonga Coup” offers an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at precisely how an aristocratic renegade like Mann and his accused fellow plotters and financial supporters — including Sir Mark Thatcher (the son of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher) and, possibly, Jeffrey Archer — can amass an army to depose an African leader. Yet, despite a vast input of cash — estimated to range from $3 million to $20 million — and endless coordination, the backing and strategy were far from sufficient. The coup was an utter failure.In his attempt to offer a detailed microhistory of it, Roberts often offers up too much detail without enough broad context. The minutiae can sometimes make for tedious reading. Nonetheless, “The Wonga Coup” is a forceful example of how a group of rapacious Europeans can hatch a fantastic plan to overthrow a foreign government, gain the tacit support of Western officials — not to mention international corporations — and fully expect to succeed in executing their grandiose vision. Moreover, several of the major plotters, despite leaving an abundant paper trail documenting their activities, escaped any formal rebuke, and instead suffered varying degrees of public humiliation, while a few others bore the brunt of formal prosecutions.'"
"'06-08-13,'0','Mutual funds, on the other hand, seem to encourage merger activity, Ms. Qiu found. When mutual funds have hefty positions in companies, those companies are more likely to strike lots of merger deals — and more bad ones, at that. Mutual funds were the most passive monitors of merger activity among the institutional investors Ms. Qiu measured.“Mutual funds are not really acting in interests of shareholders,” Ms. Qiu said. “Corporate managers may know that when they see a majority of their owners are mutual funds that they are kind of protected.”Ms. Qiu studied data from 1993 to 2000, which comprised 1,362 companies and 2,022 merger events. She found that when the stake in a company held by its largest public pension fund investor increased 1 percent, the frequency of mergers declined 4 percent at the company.That 1 percent increase also corresponded to an 8 percent reduction in value-destroying acquisitions, Ms. Qiu found. You know the deals Ms. Qiu is talking about: those vanity projects that chief executives pursue simply to “buy” earnings or revenue growth rather than generate growth internally and organically.INTERESTINGLY, public pension funds do not get in the way of mergers likely to benefit an acquirer’s shareholders, Ms. Qiu said. In fact, companies with a large public pension fund presence performed better in the long run after acquisitions, her study found. A 1 percent increase in public pension fund ownership corresponded with an increase of 0.41 percent to 3.01 percent in the 12-month outperformance in those companies’ shares.Mutual fund ownership, on the other hand, corresponds to greater merger activity at companies and to acquisitions engineered to buy growth. In addition to quantifying how mutual funds fail in their duty to investors to act as cops on the merger beat, Ms. Qiu’s data might also help investors assess how well a deal might perform down the road. If an acquirer has large public pension funds behind it, the merger will probably be a success, she said. If the company has mostly mutual fund or other private institutions as shareholders, the merged companies are more likely to underperform.“Those bidder firms that had a higher percentage of public ownership tended to show a better performance,” Ms. Qiu said. “So when you look at M.& A., whether you want to buy or sell the stock, that would be an indicator.”Mutual fund executives often argue that they prefer to vote with their feet and sell if problems appear, rather than agitate for change at troubled companies as pension funds typically do. (This is not possible for index fund managers, of course, who must own the companies that are part of whatever index they are mimicking.)But the vote-with-your-feet argument loses credibility in the face of Ms. Qiu’s study, which instead indicates a tendency among mutual funds to hear-no-evil-see-no-evil, at least in mergers. One reason for that willing suspension of disbelief may be that large mutual fund concerns have too much to lose by battling with the same companies whose 401(k) business, money management services and trust operations they oversee or seek.“The cozy, clubby relationship leads management not to worry about mutual funds actively promoting corporate governance,” Ms. Qiu said. “Unless we see some change from the mutual funds themselves that shows they are interested in corporate governance, we will continue to see this pattern.”And mutual fund shareholders will keep paying for this passivity with smaller returns.'"
"'06-08-13,'0','DO options traders know more about buying and selling stocks than the rest of us?It seems that much of the time, they do. A new study has found that a portfolio based on the preferences of options traders has consistently beaten the overall stock market. In reaching that conclusion, the study paves the way for what may be a very profitable stock-picking strategy.The study, “The Information in Option Volume for Future Stock Prices,” appears in the fall 2006 issue of the Review of Financial Studies. Its authors are two associate professors of finance: Jun Pan of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Allen M. Poteshman of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Because of the way options are designed, traders have powerful incentives to go to the options market when they have information that is likely to affect a stock’s price, Professor Poteshman said. A call option, for example, which amounts to a bet that a stock’s price will rise, enables its owner to buy that stock at a predetermined level. If, by the time of the option’s expiration, the stock trades above that level, the option may be worth several times what was paid for it; if not, it will be worthless. In other words, the option has much leverage. As a result, a small percentage change in the price of the underlying stock can mean a difference of hundreds of percentage points in the option’s profitability.Similar risks and rewards exist for put options, which are bets that a stock’s price will fall. Puts enable their owners to sell that stock at a preset level, and will be worth an increasingly large amount if the stock trades below that level by the time that put expires. If not, the put will be worthless.Until now, there has been no comprehensive study of option traders’ track records as stock pickers. That hasn’t been for want of trying: the requisite data simply was not available to researchers. The volume figures that options exchanges report publicly, for example, reflect a combination of several kinds of transactions, muddying the overall picture. The volume number reported for a given option, for example, may reflect new purchases by options traders, but it may also include the sale of positions previously acquired. That makes it hard to tell whether traders actually favored a stock.'"
"'06-08-13,'0','He balances the initial seething turbulence with quiet introspection. A breathtakingly lovely second movement precedes technical fireworks and reflective, harmonically colorful phrases in the third, before Mr. Hemelin propels the majestic finale to a virtuosic conclusion.The curio “Clairs de Lune” was written by the obscure French composer Abel Decaux from 1900 to 1907 and is his only known work. The four short, dreamy pieces hover in a compositional time warp, strangely prescient of future works by Schoenberg and Debussy. “Clairs de Lune” is naturally dwarfed by the more substantial sonata, but Mr. Hamelin’s evocative playing renders it worthwhile. VIVIEN SCHWEITZERMINIMALISM is so 1960’s. True, the genre came of age in the 70’s and 80’s. But in its purest form Minimalism was conceived by and for nervous systems attuned to the sinuous unfolding of Indian raga, the roiling ecstasy of a John Coltrane saxophone solo, the dreamy torpor of an improvised Grateful Dead set.The composer Marc Mellits, born in 1966, freely partakes of stylistic elements from Minimalism: the tumbling arpeggios of Philip Glass, the hypnotic drumming of Steve Reich. But he uses them in tightly concentrated bursts that more accurately reflect an era of short attention spans and text messaging.Three works on this new disc by Real Quiet — Andrew Russo, pianist; Felix Fan, cellist; David Cossin, percussionist — are collections of colorful, contrasting two- to three-minute miniatures, compiled in a manner not far removed in spirit from the Baroque suite or the solo piano collections of Debussy and Ravel. (The fourth, the eight-minute “Disciples of Gouda,” is a veritable sprawl by comparison.)Mr. Mellits’s penchant for the offbeat is in evidence, in titles like “Trans Fatty Acid’s Rein” and “Mechanically Separated Chicken Parts” (from “Tight Sweater”) as well as in winking musical references like those in “4LB” (from “Fruity Pebbles”), a Leonard Bernstein tribute that quotes Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 and the “Brady Bunch” theme.Mr. Russo, who has issued rewarding discs of music by George Crumb, John Corigliano and John Adams, alternates between elegant restraint and manic intensity in “Agu,” a solo piano suite. Elsewhere he anchors Real Quiet, a trio that offers a surprisingly wide range of timbres seemingly ideal for this music. But “Fruity Pebbles,” scored for a conventional piano trio, demonstrates that Mr. Mellits’s idiom is as adaptable as it is congenial. STEVE SMITHLEV ZHURBIN, a Russian-born violist who works under the name Ljova, seems to be everywhere lately. He has arranged music for the Kronos Quartet and for Yo-Yo Ma’s Silk Road Ensemble, composed soundtracks for a handful of films and turned up regularly in New York freelance ensembles.For this debut CD Mr. Zhurbin, who is 27 and lives in New York, has taken a route increasingly favored by both pop and classical musicians: he recorded the music mostly in his home studio and released it on his own label.Except for an eerily atmospheric cover of Bjork’s “Army of Me” and an arrangement of a Romanian folk song, the works here are originals. And except for an accordion line in one piece, Mr. Zhurbin does all the playing, multitracking his viola so that throaty melodies are supported by pizzicato rhythms, lush chordal figures and counterpoint.He is an eclectic, with an ear for texture. In the opening “Central Park in the Dark” (no relation to the Ives work), the viola tone is deep and recorded with enough closely focused grittiness to put its songlike melody line in perspective. Modal blues melodies are heard in several works, both directly (in “Crosstown” and “Breadbasket Blues”) and in odd mixtures (with African folk music in “Plume”). “Bagel on the Malecon” borrows Latin rhythms, and Mr. Zhurbin also touches on country music (in “Coffee & Rum”) and Middle Eastern dance figures (in “Ori’s Fearful Symmetry”).Still, his best works are more fully in classical styles. “Collage,” for one, uses electronic loops to create a Minimalist texture. And if “Spring Valley Sunset,” an unadorned solo rhapsody recorded in a field, with bird song and other attendant noises, is sonically the least polished track, it is nevertheless the most strikingly original and soulful.

But the most satisfying food was the simplest: tiny corn cakes served with succulent shredded beef; hearts of palm mingled with orange and avocado in a refreshing salad; and classic slow-roasted pork served with traditional black beans, white rice and delicious, sticky fried plantains.On my first visit, our waiter announced his presence with “Hola!” as he whisked my napkin from the table and let it float to my lap.

"'06-08-13,'0','Mutual funds, on the other hand, seem to encourage merger activity, Ms. Qiu found. When mutual funds have hefty positions in companies, those companies are more likely to strike lots of merger deals — and more bad ones, at that. Mutual funds were the most passive monitors of merger activity among the institutional investors Ms. Qiu measured.“Mutual funds are not really acting in interests of shareholders,” Ms. Qiu said. “Corporate managers may know that when they see a majority of their owners are mutual funds that they are kind of protected.”Ms. Qiu studied data from 1993 to 2000, which comprised 1,362 companies and 2,022 merger events. She found that when the stake in a company held by its largest public pension fund investor increased 1 percent, the frequency of mergers declined 4 percent at the company.That 1 percent increase also corresponded to an 8 percent reduction in value-destroying acquisitions, Ms. Qiu found.

"'06-08-14,'1','In Senate testimony in June, Henry A. Crumpton, the State Department’s counterterrorism chief, suggested that American-led efforts to pursue the two had severely limited their ability to act.“There is evidence that core leaders, including bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri, are frustrated by their lack of direct control,” Mr. Crumpton said, asserting that they had been isolated as they lost safe havens in Afghanistan and Pakistan. “We must retain this unrelenting pressure against Al Qaeda, especially their leadership, to further diminish the links throughout their global networks.”American diplomats in the region play down the importance of Mr. bin Laden, saying Pakistani military operations in the northwest region of Waziristan have curtailed his movements. They are less certain of the limits on Mr. Zawahri.Michael Scheuer, who tracked Mr. bin Laden in the 1990’s at the Central Intelligence Agency, is skeptical about the standard government claim that the two men are on the run.“If we were really chasing them around, we would have them by now,” Mr. Scheuer said. He said it was clear that the Qaeda leaders still had some operational ability because they were able to make audio and video tapes and to send them to allies who post them on the Web or pass them to Al Jazeera, the Arabic television channel in Qatar.Since the two leaders have often said their role is to inspire the global jihad, their ability to get their message out is itself a notable achievement. In a letter last year to the leader of the Iraq insurgency, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Mr. Zawahri wrote, “We are in a battle, and more than half of this battle is taking place in the battlefield of the media.”Mr. Zarqawi was killed on June 7, when American forces located him at a safe house north of Baghdad and dropped two 500-pound bombs on it.An analysis by the private Virginia company IntelCenter said that Al Qaeda’s clandestine media operation in Pakistan, As-Sahab, had released at a record pace this year 37 video and audio messages through the end of July, including 6 from Mr. bin Laden and 11 from Mr. Zawahri.“I just don’t see that they have any trouble disseminating information to followers, and they seem to have more sophisticated communications than they did six months ago,” said Chris Heffelfinger, a terrorism analyst who monitors jihadist Web sites for the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.Some American officials concede that the loyalty both men inspire makes even the large bounty on their heads — up to $25 million each — an ineffective weapon. “I’m not sure that the $25 million does a damn bit of good,” said one American intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity.Counterterrorism experts agree that Pakistan has become the most important center for jihadist networks, in some ways replicating the role of Afghanistan before American troops ousted Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in late 2001.The efforts of the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, to help American antiterrorist operations have been limited both by the popularity in Pakistan of groups violently opposing Indian control of Kashmir and by his government’s minimal control over the lawless tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.It is in those areas that Mr. bin Laden, the 49-year-old son of a Saudi construction magnate, and Mr. Zawahri, 55, an Egyptian doctor who was jailed and tortured in Egypt in the 1980’s, are believed to be in separate hiding places.The American intelligence official said the men are believed to have direct contact with a small number of trusted aides who speak to others for them. “They’re extremely careful about who they talk to,” the official said.American military and intelligence agencies have made repeated attempts to hunt them down. In January a missile fired by an American Predator drone, a pilotless aircraft, targeted a house in the tribal Bajaur district where Mr. Zawahri was believed to be attending a dinner; it killed 18 civilians and a number of militants, Pakistani officials said, but missed its prime target.In typically defiant style, Mr. Zawahri responded two weeks later with a taunting video statement broadcast on Al Jazeera.Calling President Bush a “failed crusader,” Mr. Zawahri asked: “Bush, do you know where I am? I am among the Muslim masses enjoying their care with God’s blessings and sharing with them their holy war against you until we defeat you.”As often in such tapes, Mr. Zawahri addressed “the American people,” saying “Bush and his gangs are shedding your blood and wasting your money in frustrated adventures” in Iraq and Afghanistan.Mr. bin Laden’s somewhat rarer recent pronouncements have been audiotapes accompanied by a still photo, perhaps indicating that he wanted to avoid video cameras for security reasons. Like his deputy, he often makes reference to current events, implicitly asserting a claim to leadership in the Muslim world.“They try to connect all the different crises, in Iraq, Lebanon, other places, and present themselves as the vanguard of the global Muslim community,” said Mr. Roy, the French terrorism expert.In April, Mr. bin Laden urged jihadists to go to the troubled Darfur region of Sudan if Western troops were deployed there. In May, he recounted his selection of the 19 hijackers for the Sept. 11 attacks and insisted that the just-sentenced Zacarias Moussaoui was not one of them. In June, he eulogized the just-killed Mr. Zarqawi as a fellow “lion of Islam.”“Even if we lost one of our greatest knights and princes, we are happy that we have found a symbol for our great Islamic nations, one that the mujahedeen will remember and praise in poetry and in stories secretly and aloud,” Mr. bin Laden declared in the rambling 19-minute tape.'"

"'06-08-14,'1','LOS ANGELES, Aug. 13 — Oliver Stone’s “World Trade Center,” the 9/11 rescue drama from Paramount starring Nicolas Cage, placed an underwhelming No. 3 at the box office over the weekend, but its $19 million gross far exceeded the opening weekend of last spring’s “United 93,” the first Hollywood movie to tackle the events of Sept. 11, 2001.“Everyone was wondering what the effect of the Heathrow incident would have on the grosses,” said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Company, which tracks box-office results. “I think it may have helped, by making the movie that more relevant.”“Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,” the Columbia Pictures comedy starring Will Ferrell as a Nascar racer, held on as the nation’s most popular movie through its second weekend, grossing $23 million, while the teenage dance romance “Step Up,” from Buena Vista Pictures, opened to $21.1 million.Paramount executives said they had positioned “World Trade Center,” which opened on Wednesday, to benefit from strong word of mouth and a paucity of serious movies on the late-summer release schedule.“Next week you have ‘Snakes on a Plane,’ which has a very targeted, specific audience, and other than that, you don’t have anything else vying for the attention of adults,” said Rob Moore, president for worldwide marketing, distribution and home entertainment at Paramount. “This is a very different, unique movie — the issues it deals with, how emotional it is — and when you play to an older audience, you really do have the luxury of time. I’d never tell you that with ‘Nacho Libre’ we had the luxury of time. That is why we picked the August release date, and why we picked the Wednesday opening.”'"
"'06-08-14,'1','Perhaps more important, they would help to remove swimmers from the stagnant waters of the city’s rivers and floating pools, where infection and disease, let alone drowning, were very real dangers. “They served a lifesaving function,” Mr. Benepe said. “In addition to keeping people cool, they were very much about providing a safe place for the poor.”Constructed from inexpensive materials — bricks, steel, concrete and glass — the pools followed a three-part prototype: a vast rectangle for ordinary swimming with semi-circular wading and diving areas on either end, said Hilary Ballon, a professor of architectural history at Columbia University.As imagined by the architect Aymar Embury II and his team, these palaces for the poor evoked architecture many New Yorkers weren’t likely to have experienced. “He was a major fan of great historic architecture, and he was giving them sort of a trip to Europe or Asia by visiting a local park,” Mr. Benepe said. “You could leave your tenement slum and visit something that was jaw-dropping in its excessive beauty.”Turrets and buttresses turned the Colonial Park Pool (renamed for Jackie Robinson in 1978), at West 146th Street and Bradhurst Avenue in Harlem, into a medieval castle. The McCarren in Brooklyn, the only one of the 11 pools that is no longer in use for swimming, though music and dance performances and film screenings are held there, was given a Romanesque attitude. Herbert Magoon, who had designed bathhouses at Jones Beach, conjured up the Crotona, at 173rd Street and Fulton Avenue in the Bronx, as an Art Deco castle, its pool decorated with images of fish, birds and a scorpion.If John Matthews Hatton’s gleaming Art Moderne facade at the Betsy Head in Brooklyn didn’t move you, maybe the endless sky at the Highbridge Pool in Washington Heights, far above the Harlem River, would. Or the Astoria, one of the largest pools and Moses’ favorite, framed by the Hell Gate and his beloved Triborough Bridge.Today the city’s outdoor pools are free. But Moses wanted his building programs to be self-sustaining, and he charged a 20-cent entrance fee for adults at all times, and a dime for children after 1 p.m., at a time when subway fare was a nickel.And though the pools were not officially segregated, separations occurred. In his biography “The Power Broker,” Robert A. Caro writes that Moses said he could keep blacks away from the pools in white neighborhoods by making the water cold. But Kenneth T. Jackson, editor of the Encyclopedia of New York City, expressed doubts that this was true. “That’s not to say they didn’t have ethnic tensions in New York, especially in the 1930’s,” he said in a telephone interview. “It was Italians versus Jews versus blacks versus everyone else. Let’s don’t be Pollyana-ish about it, but it was not correct that Moses intentionally kept African-Americans out of the municipal swimming pools by manipulating the water temperature.”Ms. Ballon noted, “When you look at film footage of Highbridge and others, there was an integrated crowd.”What is now the Jackie Robinson Pool was built because of pressure from African-Americans to provide services in Harlem, which was terribly underserved, said Marta Gutman, an associate professor of architectural history at City College.But systems for heating the water were present in the pools in the 1930’s, she added. “The Moses team, since this issue of public health and hygiene was so important to them, used up-to-date sanitary systems,” she said.City water was filtered through charcoal beds, and then sanitized using chlorine gas. The water in the pools was heated, aerated by large jets and changed three times every 24 hours. Swimmers had to shower before entering the pool and then walk through two footbaths, the first to sterilize, the second to rinse. “You have to remember, there was no polio vaccine,” Ms. Gutman said. “This was serious stuff.”There was a time, Mr. Benepe recalled, when he swam in the Jackie Robinson and the Thomas Jefferson, in East Harlem, with his mother at his side. “These pools continue to play very much the same function as when they opened in 1936, maybe more so,” he said. “When the pools opened in the summer of 1936, some 45,000 people used then.’’During the heat wave two weeks ago, he said, “around 65,000 came through our pools one day.’’ The city now has 51 outdoor pools.“The people who built these felt like they were doing God’s work,” Mr. Jackson said. “They did an important job, and they did it well, to stand for generations.”'"
"'06-08-14,'1','“Have you thought through the logic of this? How many Muslims are American citizens? ... Should we force them to wear a little red crescent badge? If you can outlaw and deport Muslims then you can do the same to any religion or faith. The way to defeat Islam is to share with them the Gospel.“... I’m not suggesting Islam is a religion of peace. I’m suggesting that few of the billion or more Muslims are true to the religion of Islam and thus do not constitute an immediate threat. It is a war against Islam we are fighting even if no one wants to admit it. But those born into the Muslim religion are more in bondage to it than they are followers of it.”The following user, called 831, was upset by a television interview of young Muslims, who expressed the idea that the West should suffer some of the war and strife that Muslims are experiencing in the Middle East.“These people are just plain sick! They believe that they would be justified in the deaths of innocent people in the west just because of the fighting in the Middle East. These people are sad! Very, very sad people!“... I too believe that they should get rid of any Muslims with our countries & also close down these mosques. If this is how these people think then they should go & live in the countries that hold the same ideals as they do. But they would soon find out that these same countries would not allow them to have the same life stiles they have here or to be able to do the same things as they do here.““You can’t shut down every mosque and deport every Muslim, it’s unconstitutional. A better idea is to spy on the mosques, especially since no proselytizing religion is ever going to tell anyone they can’t come in. How else can one win converts but that they first hear the message?”From: Resting in Him“Werner, I hear what you are saying, and you are right, I didn’t really think it through thoroughly. Other than exposing these people to the gospel and hoping they get saved, there really isn’t any way of preventing the threats than by what we are already doing through the various law enforcement agencies.““Help me — I don’t want to appear rude, ugly, racist or otherwise. But I will never understand why we as Westerners try to bend over backwards to appease a religion that teaches violence towards those outside its belief system. ... Islam is not some country that just has differing political views — these are people who are ensnared by a demon, if not Satan himself, going by the name Allah.“No one is suggesting they be subjected to the horrors of concentration camp, or beaten and arrested on site. But what would be wrong with at least an immediate cessation of all incoming Muslims/Arabs, and perhaps a watch list or even eventual deportation of those in the country?”“I’m not trying to argue at all, but only trying to understand how we are supposed to reach those that have only hate and killing in their hearts? And for the Muslims that do not feel this way, I feel sorry for them. They all are in my prayers, but for the ones that aren’t yet to the point of wanting to kill, do you believe they will stay peaceful long? Even the peaceful ones are dedicated and I believe will also rise up soon to join the rest.”“I agree with a lot of what you’re saying as well except that we still have a duty to witness to anyone whom God brings before us. The probability of success is not anything we need to concern ourselves with, but rather the duty to give the word that God has given us to all who can hear.”“Oh, I agree. As I stated, I would witness to a Muslim if I could, but the problem with where I live, they are not nice people. My daughter works at a 7-Eleven store and her boss is Muslim and he’s not exactly the nicest person to work for. We just haven’t had any good experiences with them.”'"
"'06-08-14,'1','During the last decade, the cost of recording and producing music and video has plummeted, giving amateur auteurs a chance at stardom. But at the same time, the expense involved in making video games has gone up: the development kits needed to create games for the consoles made by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo cost thousands of dollars, and those companies usually send the kits only to established producers.Microsoft is trying to change that. Today the company is expected to announce the fall release of a product called XNA Game Studio Express, a basic version of the company’s game authoring tools that will let aspiring designers write games on a PC and test them on an ordinary Xbox 360. (To test games, the designer pays $99 a year to translate the game from the PC into the Xbox format.)For Microsoft, the goal is to inspire amateurs to share or sell relatively simple games on the company’s Xbox Live network. (Microsoft will not own any rights to products created with these tools.) Programs created with XNA Game Studio Express will not look as good as most packaged titles. But at a time when gamers seem tired of sequels and genre standards, the company says it believes that some kind of independent games business could provide a breath of fresh air. “We thought a lot about ‘The Blair Witch Project,’ ” said Scott Henson, a director for Microsoft’s game developer group, referring to the low-budget horror film that became a surprise hit in 1999.And, of course, the company hopes the process of making games proves as addictive as playing them. “On the Internet, we’re going from a monologue world to a dialogue world,” Mr. Henson said, referring to sites with user-created content like MySpace and YouTube. “It’s amazing how much participation there is.”The idea of user-generated content has deep roots in PC gaming in the form of “mods,” altered versions of published games that use their underlying technology with a different setting or storyline. “This kind of thing is ingrained in PC gaming space, and there’s a high crossover,” said Josh Larson, director of industry products for CNET Games and Entertainment.How many gamers actually decide to program as well as play will depend on the ease of using Microsoft’s tools, said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Games Monthly. “I can’t imagine this being widespread,” he said. “But it could inspire a new generation of game developers.” ROBERT LEVINE'"

"'06-08-14,'1','Consumer researchers know that people are terrible at remembering store prices: two seconds after taking a product from a shelf, the average person has roughly a 50 percent chance of remembering how much it cost. But few researchers have examined why some prices are more memorable than others.According to a new study, it is a matter of syllables. Each extra syllable in the price reduces the chances of it being recalled by 20 percent, according to the study, which will be published in the September issue of The Journal of Consumer Research. In other words, someone faced with a $77.51 camera (eight syllables) and a $62.30 bookshelf (five syllables) is about 60 percent more likely to forget the camera’s price than the bookshelf’s, after half a minute.“The way information goes from the environment to your memory, there is this phonetic loop which is a two-second buffer,” said Xavier Drèze, one of the study’s authors.Hungarians are far better than Americans at recalling long prices; on average, they can recall 19 to 24 syllables with decent accuracy, while Americans can recall only 13. The authors suggested that this was because Hungarians speak 41 percent faster, both out loud and when repeating sounds to themselves “subvocally.”'"
"'06-08-14,'1','“The guys understand the importance of this fiber project,” said Robert Fighera, a lineman and chief union steward in the Bronx, nodding to the workmen nearby. “We’re also stockholders, and we know we have to install this or we’ll fall by the wayside of all these other companies.”While the stakes for Verizon in New York are high, so are the challenges. To sell the television services that it believes will really help it win back customers, Verizon needs to win a franchise from the city similar to what Cablevision and Time Warner Cable now have, and similar to what Verizon already has in towns like Massapequa Park on Long Island and Nyack in Rockland County.In New York, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s office asked the City Council in mid-July to approve a measure that would allow the city to start negotiating new cable franchises.“Competition among cable providers is a win for the city’s cable subscribers,” said Paul J. Cosgrave, the commissioner of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, the agency that negotiates with Verizon and other companies interested in a franchise.A City Council subcommittee will begin discussing the matter today. But the list of lawmakers and regulators who need to sign off on any new franchise is long, so it could take months before Verizon wins the right to start selling television.Verizon faces more pressing hurdles getting its fiber lines in place. Nearly all cables in Manhattan are underground, so workers often must navigate serpentine conduits and congested streets. The company spends countless hours getting permits from the Department of Transportation and other agencies to pull up manhole covers, divert traffic and use public rights-of-way.Though conditions vary widely, building underground fiber networks in highly congested urban areas can cost $100 or more per foot of cable installed, according to Michael Render, president of Render, Vanderslice & Associates, a market research firm. By contrast, placing fiber underground in the suburbs costs $7 to $25 a foot.Since stringing fiber along telephone poles is often cheaper than burying it, Verizon is concentrating first on the Bronx, Staten Island and Queens, which have more single-family homes and cables above ground. By the end of the year, about 90 percent of the 170,000 homes on Staten Island will have access to Verizon’s fiber network.Elsewhere, Verizon is trying to reach the most customers the fastest, which means building in neighborhoods with the greatest concentration of phone and data lines. The team in the Bronx, for instance, is connecting homes to the Cruger Avenue switching station, which handles about 75,000 phone lines, making it the second-busiest in the borough.In Queens, workers have been connecting areas around the switching station in Bayside, which serves 85,000 phone lines. Verizon, which has been selling phone and data lines in the neighborhoods there, says that about 25 percent of the families that can buy the new services are signing up.In time, the goal is to wire the city’s biggest apartment buildings so that Verizon can reach hundreds and possibly thousands of customers at a time. But to do that, Verizon must deal with landlords, who control access to the buildings. Like the cable providers before them, Verizon must negotiate rental fees with each owner before it can install its equipment, a time-consuming and expensive process.“When you have a bunch of guys who own buildings seeing a big company with lots of money that wants more space in basements, they can play a gatekeeper role,” said Jeffrey Halpern, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.In Verizon’s territory, 22.4 percent of the housing is multifamily dwelling units, versus 18.2 percent in AT&T’s region and 15.7 percent on BellSouth’s turf, Mr. Halpern estimates.But when landlords prohibit Verizon from installing fiber to each apartment, the company must use existing copper phone lines or cable lines to reach its customers. That can slow broadband speeds and diminish one of the fiber network’s biggest advantages.To sidestep this problem, Verizon is negotiating with hundreds of developers to install its fiber network as buildings are being constructed. For example, the company got in on the ground floor at the Octagon, a new development on Roosevelt Island in the East River with about 500 apartments. As the buildings went up, Verizon installed fiber optic lines in hidden conduits, buried switching boxes out of view in closets and scattered jacks throughout the apartments.Even there, Verizon couldn’t keep out the competition: Time Warner Cable and a company called MST NuVisions also offer broadband and other services in the building.“The goal is to provide tenants with the most amount of choice,” said John Renner, who works for Becker & Becker, the developer.Without a franchise, Verizon cannot sell its video service to residents at the Octagon and elsewhere in New York. But in places where it is sold, Verizon’s television service, at $40 for about 200 channels, has attracted modest numbers of subscribers. Verizon says that in areas where it has been available for three months, the service has grabbed 7 percent of the market.Cable companies say that figure is exaggerated, and they call Verizon’s television service a “me-too product.”“There’s really no reason why anyone would want to switch from our service to theirs,” said Tom Rutledge, the chief operating officer at Cablevision, which competes with Verizon in the New York area.Whatever headway Verizon makes, Cablevision and Time Warner are likely to respond with products of their own. The companies now offer faster broadband speeds and are signing up hundreds of thousands of customers — many of them formerly with Verizon — for discounted phone service.The heated competition could spur Verizon to build its new network faster. There are just too many dollars at stake.“This is a once-in-a-lifetime investment,” said Christopher Levendos, the director of engineering and planning for the fiber project in New York. “It’s revolutionary in size and scope, rewiring the entire copper system.”'"

"'06-08-15,'1','• Antiretroviral pills like tenofovir to prevent infection among prostitutes, drug injectors and other people at high risk of becoming infected before and after exposures.An analogy would be taking anti-malarial drugs before traveling to an infected area. A study of 400 at-risk women in Ghana to be reported at this meeting shows that a drug, tenofovir, was safe when given to uninfected women. Findings about effectiveness are due later.The need is urgent to make prevention measures of proved effectiveness widely available because four million people are becoming infected each year and fewer than one in five people at high risk for H.I.V. have access to such preventions.As treatments have proved effective, “the harsh reality is we are quickly falling behind in H.I.V. prevention,” Dr. Helene Gayle, the president of the International AIDS Society, which is the main organizer of the conference, said at a news conference.No new prevention method under study is likely to be 100 percent effective, which will increase the difficulty of putting them into practice, the panel said, adding that educational campaigns will be needed to integrate the new methods with effective older ones.The panel cautioned against the complacency about risk behavior that could follow broader use of effective preventions.More donor funding will be needed to introduce and deliver the new preventions, said the panel, known as the Global H.I.V. Prevention Working Group. It made a number of recommendations, including one to find ways to help poor countries train enough health workers to carry out male circumcision safely.Last year, a study in South Africa found that circumcised men were 60 percent less likely than noncircumcised men to become infected with H.I.V. by female sex partners. In 2007, findings should begin to come in from three additional studies under way in Kenya and Uganda aimed at confirming the South African study and determining whether male circumcision also reduces the risk of H.I.V. transmission from men to their female partners.Ongoing prevention studies involve about 80,000 people, and tens of thousands more will be needed for future studies designed to confirm early findings and to test newer versions of old methods, the panel said. It warned that the array of studies is fast exhausting the numbers of sites to conduct studies, potential volunteer participants and trained staff to carry them out.The panel also recommended the development of new ethical guidelines to conduct clinical trials in poor countries owing to inadequacies of existing ones.Officials in the Cameroons and other countries have stopped a small number of prevention trials because of embarrassing fiascos involving poor communications between researchers, volunteers for and participants in the trials, community leaders and government officials. Poor communication has slowed progress in additional trials.No formal agreement exists on which preventions trial sponsors should provide to all participants. Another ethical issue is determining whose responsibility it is to treat participants who become infected during a prevention trial. New infections will inevitably occur in such trials, Dr. Gayle said.Additional ethical questions involve whether the preventions and treatments should be offered to the broader communities in which the studies are conducted when resources are limited, Dr. Gayle said.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','No such takeover is possible as long as the Volkswagen law is in force. But Porsche now says the law is unnecessary and, indeed, an irksome restraint on its own ambition to exercise greater influence over the company.“We want to take full advantage of our rights as a shareholder,” Mr. Wiedeking told a group of journalists recently.Though Porsche’s involvement with Volkswagen, which also owns the Audi, Skoda and Lamborghini brands, is a tale with plenty of odd twists, Mr. Wiedeking has opened an intriguing — some would say slightly baffling — new chapter. He may not get immediate satisfaction, but he is digging in for a long fight at one of Germany’s flagship companies.On its face, there is little practical meaning to Mr. Wiedeking’s statement about joining the European Commission’s lawsuit: Gitte Stadler, a spokeswoman for the European Court of Justice, said there is no provision for private parties to do so. Nor, apparently, has Mr. Wiedeking made any dent in the ironclad resolve Lower Saxony’s premier, Christian Wulff, and other politicians to to hang on to the state’s position in Volkswagen.“The state government has always fought for the continued existence of the V.W. law, because it guarantees good development for Volkswagen and secures the interests of its operations in Lower Saxony,” said Mr. Wulff, who like Mr. Wiedeking is a Volkswagen director.But more broadly, Mr. Wiedeking is opening a debate about the future of the company after the Volkswagen Law, which most legal experts expect will be overturned by the court challenge. And analysts say he is putting Porsche in position to prevent others from taking over the company and to speed an overhaul of Volkswagen that is already underway.“Wiedeking will look to open an attack on all possible fronts, and you can expect more from his direction,” said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, the director of the Center for Automotive Studies in Gelsenkirchen. “Porsche is sending a message that it wants to have the final word.”Albrecht Bamler, a spokesman for Porsche, declined to elaborate on the motives behind Mr. Wiedeking’s statement. But it was no accident, analysts said, that he made the remarks to a group of German newspaper editors on Aug. 3.Mr. Wiedeking appears to have engineered a turnaround of sorts within the two families that, between them, control all the voting shares in Porsche, the Porsches and the Piëchs. Ferdinand Piëch, the present chairman and former chief executive of Volkswagen, was a longtime supporter of the Volkswagen law; he is also a director at Porsche.Porsche has also obtained advance approval from German antitrust authorities to exercise the options it holds and increase its stake in Volkswagen to 25.1 percent — enough to block any major decision under German corporate law, but only if the law is repealed and Porcshe can vote all its shares.Porsche and Volkswagen officials expect a decision from the European Court of Justice, which is based in Luxembourg, sometime in late 2007, though appeals could drag on for years after that.The European Commission’s challenge to the law argues that it violates European Union rules that require equal rights for shareholders.Analysts said that Mr. Wiedeking may have in mind the battle between Germany and the commission over the Landesbanken, a cosseted financial institutions that until last year enjoyed state guarantees for its debt. In that fight, which lasted a decade, the state’s long defense of the guarantees, which were ultimately overturned, had the effect of delaying the bank’s adoption of new business models that did not depend on state support.Erika Mann, a Social Democratic member of the European Parliament from the area around Volkswagen’s main plant in Wolfsburg, said that Mr. Wiedeking has gotten people thinking about life after the Volkswagen law. Ms. Mann, who supports the law, said that realism must dictate the best course of action.“A fallback strategy is not a bad thing,” she said. “A bad thing would be to be surprised, and not to be prepared. To go into endless court battles would be the worst of all worlds.”Indeed, from the perspective of investors — and Porsche is the company’s biggest — the last thing Volkswagen needs is to play a waiting game.Volkswagen’s chief executive, Bernd Pietschetsrieder is struggling to put through a painful overhaul of the company’s operations that could affect up to 20,000 jobs. But its unions — powerful allies with Lower Saxony’s politicians in efforts to keep jobs in Germany — are resisting many of Mr. Pietschetsrieder’s proposals, and their opposition has been a drag on Volkswagen’s stock.“Even if the actual effects of Porsche’s efforts are minimal, they need to slowly raise the shareholder friendliness” at Volkswagen, said Jens Schattner, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt.Still, Porsche may yet provoke an intra-German clash.The state of Lower Saxony is said by the German press to be considering how it might increase its own stake in Volkswagen to 25.1 percent, the same blocking minority position that Porsche seeks. Matthias Sickert, a spokesman for the Lower Saxony government, declined to confirm the reports, but pointedly refused to deny that such preparations are afoot.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','Wholesale prices rose only a tiny amount in July, the government reported today. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, wholesale prices fell.The figures were a sign that inflation could be easing somewhat, and appeared to bolster the Fed’s decision last week to forego another increase and leave its overnight lending rate at 5.25 percent.Many economists, however, noted that the statistics could understate the true picture of inflation. The overall pace of price increases last month was held in check largely by falling automobile prices, while prices rose for goods in the early stages of manufacturing .In a report issued this morning, the Labor Department said that the producer price index, measuring prices that businesses charge one another, rose by 0.1 percent in July, the slowest rate of increase since June 2005. The core index, which excludes food and energy, dropped 0.3 percent. The core index had not fallen in any month since last October.Producer price statistics tend to bounce around more from month to month than those for retail prices, and economists generally put greater store in the consumer price index, which will be reported tomorrow.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','Posada had gone 10 days since his last hit, and his 0-for-25 skid coming into the game was the longest such streak of his career.He received no sympathy from his friend Jeter, who went 0 for 32 in 2004.“I told him he’s got a long way to go,” Jeter said. “He’s got a couple of games to go before it gets serious. If he got out seven more times, then we’d sit down and encourage him.”Posada singled twice, then homered on Brendan Donnelly’s first pitch in the eighth inning. That triggered a four-run rally that put the game out of reach and ensured another victory for Randy Johnson, the 276th of his career.Johnson, who carried a no-hitter into the seventh inning in Chicago on Wednesday, took a shutout that far last night. He worked seven innings, allowing two runs, eight hits and a walk. He joined Mike Mussina and Chien-Ming Wang as the only three teammates in the majors with 13 victories each.With a sharp slider and a dose of splitters, Johnson struck out five, including the 4,500th strikeout of his career when he got Tim Salmon swinging on a slider in the fourth. Johnson, who waved to his family in the stands after the inning and patted Posada on the helmet, dismissed the importance of the milestone.“I’ve been around a long time and struck out a lot of hitters,” said Johnson, who trails only Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens on the career list. “That’s probably why my arm is so tired after I pitch. I could not strike anybody out the rest of my career and I’d be content. Winning ballgames is really how you measure a starting pitcher, not strikeouts.”The Yankees threatened to score in the second, when Jason Giambi led off with a double against John Lackey (10-9). Rodriguez then grounded to third, keeping Giambi at second before Posada singled to center to snap his streak.“You get that first hit, it really changes things around,” Posada said.The third-base coach, Larry Bowa, tried to hold Giambi at third, but Giambi ran through the sign and was thrown out easily on a two-hopper from center fielder Reggie Willits. When Cabrera doubled to lead off the third, though, the Yankees did not waste it.Jeter launched a fly ball to deep center with one out, and Willits crashed into the wall in pursuit. Jeter stopped at second, not knowing where the ball was, then broke into a home run trot. It was his 10th homer of the year.The Yankees seemed poised to build on their lead until an unusual defensive play cut them down in the fourth. Rodriguez was on second and Robinson Canó was on first with no outs.Posada ripped a low liner to second, and Rodriguez froze before the ball skipped on the dirt.Second baseman Howie Kendrick flipped to shortstop Orlando Cabrera for an out, and Cabrera, without hesitating, fired to third to catch Rodriguez for a 4-6-5 double play.“That was a gutsy play,” said Rodriguez, who was booed by the crowd. “I’ve never seen that in my 12 years. I’ve never seen a ball come behind my head.”The missed chances hurt when the Angels tied the score in the seventh on a single by Chone Figgins and a double to the right-field wall by Kendrick. Right fielder Bobby Abreu, who was criticized in Philadelphia for not going to the wall for fly balls, chased after the ball but could not catch up.Johnson was done after seven, but the Yankees scored in the bottom of the inning to make him the winning pitcher. After Johnny Damon’s leadoff single and Jeter’s bunt single, Abreu bunted for the first time since 1998.Rodriguez said he could see the situation forming: Abreu’s sacrifice would open first base, and Giambi would be walked intentionally. The bases would be loaded for him.“I had plenty of time,” Rodriguez said. “Once the bunt sign went on, I had a great opportunity to visualize the situation coming to me.”He could not have visualized anything better than a grand slam. He settled for a sacrifice fly, which nestled into the glove of Vladimir Guerrero at the wall. It was not sensational, but it was sufficient.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','Pittsburgh is not saying where the Russian star Evgeni Malkin is, or when it expects to see him. The 20-year-old Malkin remained out of sight yesterday after leaving his Russian Super League team, Metallurg Magnitogorsk, on Saturday after it arrived for training camp in Helsinki, Finland.Malkin left with his belongings and passport and, possibly, a Canadian visa. Malkin’s former Russian agent, Sergei Isakov, told the Soviet Sport newspaper that Malkin had the visa before leaving for Finland. Malkin’s North American agents, J. P. Barry and Pat Brisson, would not confirm that or say where Malkin was.“I can tell you I think he is safe, but I cannot comment on anything else,” Brisson said. The Penguins had no comment regarding Malkin, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2004 draft.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','During the N.F.L. preseason, defeats are meaningless, but injuries can be demoralizing.Some veteran players say the four-game preseason is too long because it increases the risk of injury before the regular season begins. Clinton Portis, the Washington Redskins’ star running back, sustained a partly dislocated left shoulder during Sunday’s 19-3 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. Portis, who was hurt while making a tackle after Mark Brunell threw an interception, was examined yesterday and will spend the next few weeks rehabilitating. His status was questionable for the Redskins’ regular-season opener Sept. 11 against the Minnesota Vikings.“As soon as we get the soreness out of there, they feel like he can start rehabbing,’’ Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs said during a news conference yesterday. “We would hope he’d be ready for the opener.’’Portis said that the preseason should be shortened.“Let’s get rid of some of these games,’’ Portis told reporters after Sunday’s game. “Even the young guys don’t need four games to go out and prove themselves. Four games is ridiculous, and then you go out and play a 16-game season, and then you’ve got the playoffs behind that.’’In 1978, the N.F.L. reduced its number of preseason games to four games from six for each team, the same year that the league went to a 16-game regular-season schedule from 14 games. The length of the preseason is prescribed in the league’s constitutional bylaws. For the length of the preseason to be changed, three-fourths of the league’s 32 teams would have to vote in favor of the change. Before any possible change would be voted on, the league’s competition committee would study the pros and cons and make a recommendation.Bill Polian, the president of the Indianapolis Colts and a member of the committee, said there had not been a request to discuss shortening the preseason in recent years, and he said he would not be in favor of making a change.“In my humble opinion, four games is perfect,’’ Polian said in a telephone interview. “We’re not like basketball or baseball, where there’s not nearly as much contact. You need the four games to integrate players into your system. Linemen need the physical contact, as do linebackers, to get ready for the season.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','The S.E.C.’s handling of the Pequot investigation first came under Congressional scrutiny last spring after a former investigator for the agency, Gary J. Aguirre, accused senior agency officials of giving in to political pressure when they blocked him from taking the testimony of John J. Mack, a Wall Street executive and a major fund-raiser for President Bush.At the time, people who have been briefed on the agency’s position say, S.E.C. officials argued that Mr. Aguirre had not made a strong enough case for taking testimony from Mr. Mack. Mr. Mack, who was about to be named Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, is close to Arthur J. Samberg, who oversees Pequot, and he briefly worked for the fund before joining Morgan Stanley.But after several Congressional committees began looking into Mr. Aguirre’s charges, the S.E.C. reversed course and recently interviewed Mr. Mack, more than a year after Mr. Aguirre first tried to do so.The S.E.C.’s investigation, first reported by The New York Times, has not resulted in any charges against Pequot or Mr. Mack. Both deny any wrongdoing and Morgan Stanley has previously stated that no one, including Mr. Aguirre, has produced any evidence that Mr. Mack engaged in insider trading.Mr. Aguirre, who ran the commission’s Pequot investigation, was fired by the S.E.C. only days after the he received a two-step merit pay increase. Mr. Aguirre’s firing is also being investigated by the Office of Special Counsel, a federal agency that examines whistle-blower complaints.In their letter to Mr. Cox, Senator Specter and Senator Grassley asked specifically for records of any communications involving Linda Thomsen, the S.E.C.’s enforcement chief, and Mary Jo White, the former federal prosecutor who now works at the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton.Mr. Aguirre told Congressional investigators that the Pequot investigation ground to a halt after Ms. White went over his head and contacted Ms. Thomsen.Ms. White said Morgan Stanley’s board hired her to help vet Mr. Mack before he was named to head the company a year ago on June 30. Ms. White said she gave Mr. Mack a clean bill of health. She denies ever suggesting that the S.E.C. close its investigation.Mr. Specter and Mr. Grassley have also asked that the S.E.C. allow Congressional investigators to interview six S.E.C. staff members, including Ms. Thomsen and two of Mr. Aguirre’s supervisors, Mark Kreitman and Robert Hanson.The letter states that Ms. Thomsen briefed the Finance Committee staff about Mr. Aguirre’s allegations on May 3 and that the S.E.C. staff told Congressional investigators that the matter had been referred to the agency’s inspector general, Walter J. Stachnik, who “conducted a complete and thorough review and had subsequently closed the case.”The Times subsequently reported that the inspector general, as part of his review, had not interviewed Mr. Aguirre. The inspector general late last month reopened its inquiry into Mr. Aguirre’s firing.But that decision did not appear to satisfy Mr. Specter and Mr. Grassley, who questioned whether the inspector general was “capable of conducting a reinvestigation worthy of any public confidence,” according to their letter to Mr. Cox. Mr. Aguirre has told Senate investigators that before his firing, he was looking into profits Pequot made on positions it took, beginning in early July 2001, in shares of Heller Financial, a Chicago-based business lending concern.On July 30 that year, a unit of General Electric announced that it was acquiring Heller for $5 billion in cash. Heller’s stock rose 50 percent on the news of the deal, indicating investors were surprised by the transaction, even though it had been the subject of rumors several months earlier.Mr. Aguirre said he suspected Mr. Mack might have leaked nonpublic information about the impending deal, though the former S.E.C. investigator has not publicly discussed why he suspected him. Morgan Stanley has denied that Mr. Mack did anything wrong.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','“The president told us that the British attacks are a stark reminder that the nation is at war with Islamic fascists who will use any means to destroy those of us who love freedom,’’ Mr. Ford said, “yet his administration has dismantled the very infrastructure that is responsible for catching those terrorists.”Those statements and others challenging Republicans head-on over antiterror initiatives are a sharp contrast to Democrats’ actions in the two previous elections, when they stumbled in the face of Republican efforts to paint them as weak. Democrats say polls show that Republicans and Mr. Bush have lost stature on the subject on terrorism as Americans have become disillusioned with the war in Iraq. They also believe that more voters are able to separate the war from efforts to protect the nation against terror attacks.“During the 2002 and 2004 elections, Republicans tried to sow fear in the American public by claiming that they were the only ones who could keep America safe,” Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said in an e-mail message to supporters. “This from the same crowd that has driven Iraq to the brink of disaster, left Osama Bin Laden on the loose to attack again and continues to ignore our security needs at home.”Republicans said they believed that the Democratic efforts would fizzle and that voters would ultimately choose to trust Republicans on the issue of security. And Mr. Bush, in remarks at the State Department on Monday, disputed the notion that his policies had contributed to a more dangerous world.“Some say that America caused the current instability in the Middle East by pursuing a forward strategy of freedom, yet history shows otherwise,” Mr. Bush said, ticking off terror attacks that occurred in the United States, Africa and elsewhere long before he took office.Democrats say that such comments may have had power in the past, but that Republicans are no longer getting the benefit of the doubt. They were heartened this past weekend when leaders of the Sept. 11 commission said the war in Iraq was draining resources that could be put to domestic defense.Other Democrats say the administration’s initial support of a business deal that would have allowed a Dubai company to assume control of parts of some seaport terminals was a turning point in the public’s view of Mr. Bush’s credibility on national security. As a result, they say they are advising candidates to respond quickly and with force to Republican attacks.While a new poll by Newsweek showed a rise in Mr. Bush’s public approval rating on security issues in the aftermath of the arrests in Britain, the latest nationwide CBS News Poll, conducted Aug. 11 to 13, found that the recent threat had had little effect on the public’s view of the president and the two political parties.The war in Iraq remains the most important issue facing the country, the poll shows, but terrorism has re-emerged as a major issue for many Americans, cited by 17 percent, up from 7 percent last month. The latest CBS poll showed no change in Mr. Bush’s job approval rating, which is at 36 percent, the same as in a New York Times/CBS News poll last month. His approval rating on handling terrorism, long a central element of his political strength, also remained unchanged at 51 percent.While Republicans are still seen as doing a better job than Democrats in handling terrorism, the difference in the latest CBS poll is now about 8 points, about the same as a month ago, compared to the 25-point advantage Republicans held on the question four years ago. The telephone poll was conducted with 974 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said such findings reinforced his view that Mr. Bush had failed to blend the Iraq war and antiterrorism in the public’s mind. Mr. Emanuel said that Mr. Bush’s public standing was cemented in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and that Republican efforts to improve the president’s image by emphasizing terror could not overcome the damage done by the bungled response to the storm.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','Joel W. Harnett, a businessman and civic watchdog who finished last in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City in 1977, but fueled debate by helping to force the release of a federal investigative report on questionable financial manipulations by city leaders, died on Aug. 11 at his home in Phoenix. He was 80.The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Lila.Mr. Harnett, who resigned as chairman of the City Club of New York, a government watchdog group, to run for office, sued the Securities and Exchange Commission to release a report that the commission contended was not yet finished. After a Manhattan federal judge began looking into the evidence, the commission released the report.It essentially said that Mayor Abraham D. Beame had deceived the public about the city’s perilous financial condition while it was selling a record number of securities to unsuspecting investors. The document drew a storm of caustic comment from Mayor Beame’s six challengers.The primary campaign ended with Edward I. Koch, then a congressman, winning the Democratic mayoral nomination; Mario M. Cuomo, then lieutenant governor, finishing second, and Mr. Beame third. Mr. Harnett was last in the seven-person race.Mr. Harnett focused on economic issues in his campaign, emphasizing a need to cut taxes to remain competitive with other cities and states. A marketing executive at Look magazine himself, he argued that the city needed to sell itself better.'"

"'06-08-15,'1','Sunday’s concert at the formerly abandoned McCarren Pool in Williamsburg offered spectacular new proof of a familiar old fact. Often broke but rarely poor, indie-rock fans are an intensely price-sensitive bunch.The headliners were Beirut, the emerging brass-enhanced band led by the 20-year-old crooner Zach Condon, and Deerhoof, the long-running San Francisco band that recently lost a member to become a herky-jerky power trio. If tickets had been $20, hundreds of fans might have shown up. If tickets had been $10, a few thousand might have appeared. But since admission was free, the place was packed (though solicitors at the front gate made a paradoxical plea: they asked for donations to help keep these concerts free).The pool’s official capacity is 5,500, which meant an almost comically large audience for a couple of cultish bands. McCarren Pool is a big, shallow, crumbling rectangle, and the familiar Williamsburg sights — stubbly chins, flip-flopped feet, retro sunglasses — seemed to stretch toward the horizon.“We would like to thank all of you for coming,” said Greg Saunier, Deerhoof’s drummer, and he sounded dazed and amused. “Many thank you’s.”The free concerts at McCarren this summer are subsidized partly by ones that aren’t (like the Sonic Youth and Yeah Yeah Yeahs doubleheaders this past Friday and Saturday). And when you haven’t bought a ticket, you also haven’t bought the right — or maybe, in this city, the obligation — to complain.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','Men with low testosterone were much more likely to die within a specified time frame than their counterparts with normal levels, researchers reported yesterday.Low testosterone levels, common in aging men, are associated with insulin resistance, which can be a precursor of diabetes and other serious diseases.The researchers used a Veterans Affairs database to study the medical histories of 858 men over age 40 for four years, categorizing their testosterone as low, normal or equivocal, with varying low and normal tests. Just over half had normal levels, 28 percent were equivocal and 19 percent low.The findings appear in The Archives of Internal Medicine.Men with equivocal testosterone had a 38 percent greater risk of death during the study than those with normal testosterone, and those with low testosterone levels had an 88 percent greater risk.The correlations held after controlling for age, medical morbidity, weight in proportion to height, race and other factors.“People need to look at these results very cautiously,” said Dr. Molly Shores, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington.A major concern, Dr. Shores said, is the use of synthetic testosterone, considering the marked increase in its use over the last five years.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','He left the game-calling to Mike Tirico and the analysis to Theismann while carving out his natural territory as a snarky, but not irritating, commentator who will keep track of story lines and ask Theismann to explain terms like the silent snap count. (Kornheiser called it “mime football.”) Or did he think Theismann was discussing the “nap count”?And ESPN gave him a forum to respond to viewer e-mail, complete with a theme song. Next week, he may be singing with Hank Williams Jr.Kornheiser’s wit showed often but he had plenty of openings in a ho-hum preseason game. When Tirico said there were more than 11,000 lakes in Minnesota, Kornheiser said, “And you won’t see any Vikings players on any of them this year,” a reference to the team’s sex cruise last season.When Tirico noted that Oakland quarterback Aaron Brooks had signed a two-year, $8 million contract, Kornheiser looked at his statistics at that moment (no completions in four attempts) and asked, “With those numbers, how much more would you give him?”He challenged Theismann’s claim that Tom Walsh, the Raiders’ new offensive coordinator, was closer to football in recent years as the owner of a bed and breakfast than Joe Gibbs was before his return to coaching. “He’s preparing meals and making beds,” Kornheiser asked. “Are you comfortable with that?” Yes, said Theismann. “Would you be comfortable with Bob Newhart?” Kornheiser replied. “He ran a B&B.”Kornheiser also offered the kind of “why’s he playing?” judgments that he said he would last week. When Mike McMahon came in to relieve Brad Johnson as the Vikings’ quarterback, Kornheiser raised the issue of McMahon’s career 44.5 percent completion percentage, a steep drop from Johnson’s 61.9 percent.“What’s he doing out there?” he asked.“He played for Brad Childress in Philadelphia,” he said, referring to the Vikings’ head coach, the former Eagles offensive coordinator. He said that Childress remembered a great pass by McMahon against Dallas.“Then McMahon was lucky he saw that play,” Kornheiser said.Kornheiser endeared himself to English teachers and fans of proper usage by pleading for good grammar while reflecting on the wrongness of He Hate Me, the XFL nickname of Oakland’s Rod Smart.And so, as this is written, at the start of the fourth quarter, at 10:40 p.m. Eastern, Kornheiser is awake demanding that Theismann explain his doubts about Matt Leinart’s quarterbacking skills.•While Kornheiser started in his new position, Fox Sports announced yesterday morning that Joe Buck would, every Sunday, start his day as the host of “Fox NFL Sunday,” then slip into the game booth.Buck joked that the demands of his new job working with Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson would render lousy his first-half game calling. “But the game is won or lost in the fourth quarter,” he said.He insisted that while he was making more money, he didn’t do it solely for the cash. He said his late father, Jack, earned more when he called baseball for CBS, but suffered with the criticism that came with it.Bradshaw, the co-host of the Fox program, offered simple advice to reduce Buck’s preparation for his new job. “If you have any thoughts, keep them condensed to eight seconds, and just traffic-cop us,” he said.Update: it’s 11:06 p.m. and Kornheiser is talking about Raiders Coach Art Shell. Still awake. Tony, you fooled us all. Shame on you.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','MaxJet flies 767’s configured with 102 seats that recline to a 60-inch pitch, and competes with airlines in the United States offering less luxurious business-class products, but at discount round-trip fares ranging from $1,750 to $3,750. Most published business-class fares on other commercial airlines on that route range from about $6,000 to $9,000, though many major airlines negotiate corporate volume discounts.Is Silverjet a real deal? Mr. Hunt says it is, and his competitors agree, to a point. The airline raised about $44 million in an initial public offering in the spring, bringing its capital to about $63.5 million, and it is still attracting investors, he said.The trans-Atlantic market, Mr. Hunt said over breakfast recently, is ready to be shaken up because business and leisure travelers feel they have been shaken down by established airlines.“The business and leisure consumer flying in business class is being ripped off because they’re paying 10 times what they would pay in coach class,” he said.Silverjet — which will fly into London’s least congested airport, Luton — has ambitious customer-service plans. For one thing, its seats recline a generous 75 degrees, more than MaxJet’s. “We want to deliver an Eos product, and great service, at a MaxJet price,” he said.Good luck, said Gary Rogliano, the chief executive of MaxJet. Silverjet’s £999 fare (around $1,900) “is the average price,” he said. By that he meant that, like many other airlines, Silverjet will sell advance-purchase tickets at deep discounts and then charge more as seats fill up.“I regard them as a serious potential competitor,” Mr. Rogliano said. “But I do think they’re going to have to go back to the till” for more capital to sustain operations.David Spurlock, the founder and chief strategic officer of Eos, said that the 767’s that MaxJet operated and Silverjet planned to use were more expensive to operate than the 757’s that Eos flies.Mr. Rogliano said that Silverjet’s plan to install 100 seats with 75-degree pitch on a 767 would cut back on space passengers want for things other than sleeping.Mr. Spurlock agreed that Silverjet’s seats would make for a tight cabin. “They’re not investing in what the consumer wants to buy, which is floor space designed to give people a complete choice in how they work, rest or relax,” he said.On the other hand, Silverjet plans to offer discount car service to and from the airport. Silverjet also plans expedited check-in and boarding procedures and high-end airport lounges — whether newly built or shared with another premium carrier.And the airline is already signing deals with corporate travel management firms to sell seamless connections on discount feeder flights — say, JetBlue from Florida to Newark, Silverjet to London, and from there Ryanair to Hamburg. “We expect the vast portion of our bookings to come from third-party agencies,” Mr. Hunt said.The Newark departures will have appeal to many travelers wanting to avoid Kennedy.“Clearly, flying out of Newark, we put at risk losing the Long Island customer, the Queens customer. But Manhattan? From Manhattan, among a lot of business travelers, Newark is actually preferred,” said Andria Piekarz, president of Silverjet’s operations in the United States.Silverjet is currently hiring pilots, crew members and support employees. I like Ms. Piekarz’s attitude on that. “We’re going to hire people who are happy when the plane’s full, not when it’s empty,” she said.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','We, on the other hand, have The Kiss.This would be the lip-lock captured memorably in an Alfred Eisenstadt photograph from Aug. 14, 1945, showing a sailor and a nurse in a euphoric, spontaneous embrace in Times Square, filled that day with celebrating New Yorkers.Recalling that moment seems to have become an annual event for the Times Square Alliance business district. The alliance commemorated V-J Day’s 60th anniversary last year by re-enacting The Kiss with the man and woman who said they were the 1945 smoochers.“People had such a good time that we thought, ‘Why not do something again this year?’ ” said Tim Tompkins, president of the business group.Yesterday, the alliance invited couples of assorted ages, colors and — this being 2006 — sexual orientations to a “commemorative kiss-in” on the Times Square traffic island that is home to the armed forces recruiting station. The idea was to “celebrate peace, love and hope,” described by the alliance as “universal ideals,” available evidence to the contrary notwithstanding.Ten couples lent their lips for the occasion. The youngest were barely old enough to remember the 1991 Persian Gulf war. The oldest looked to be Vietnam-era types.Wearing white sailors’ caps or carrying red roses, they stood around a painted bronze statue of The Kiss, rendered by J. Seward Johnson Jr. and called “Unconditional Surrender.”Their kisses ranged from the almost chaste to the deeply soulful, ardent enough for Mr. Tompkins to call out, “Keep it G-rated, guys.”As if all this wasn’t silly enough, Japanese television crews were on hand to record, faithfully but bizarrely, an event rooted in the most inglorious defeat in their nation’s history.Oh, well. Think of it as a bit of midsummer frivolity in a season that has been anything but frivolous, what with new turmoil in the Middle East, fresh fears of terrorism and — need it be said? — a war in Iraq that shows no sign of ending soon.Lighthearted though it was, the Times Square exercise carried a somber reminder that the Iraq conflict has now lasted almost as long as the United States’ participation in World War II. Today is Day 1,246 since combat began on March 19, 2003. A little over three months from now, in late November, Iraq will overtake Pearl Harbor to V-J Day in duration.Perhaps it is not too soon to wonder what memory of this war, whatever you may think of it, will be cherished six decades from now, as The Kiss still is.Will Americans relive the toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue in Firdos Square in central Baghdad? Or maybe re-enact the dental exam that Mr. Hussein had after his capture? Might “Mission Accomplished” banners be in vogue in some distant future?One always makes predictions at one’s peril, but it is hard to believe that the war’s final moments will be accompanied by the same kind of exuberance felt on V-J Day. More likely, people will greet the end not with a kiss but with a sigh, signifying relief or fatigue, longing or distress. Take your pick.'"
"'06-08-15,'1','Mutombo, in fact, came to the United States and to Georgetown University in 1987 with the intention of studying medicine, of being a doctor like his cousin, Louis Kanda, a Washington heart surgeon, only taller. Basketball instead left him affluent and famous and restlessly unfulfilled.That night in the ballroom in 1998, he shared a central African proverb: “When you take the elevator up to reach the top, please don’t forget to send it down.” On the way, even the most philanthropic intentions can meet resistance in a country as porous in infrastructure as Congo.“You have a woman giving birth, and she needs to get from the third floor to the fifth floor, and then the electricity goes out,” Mutombo said. “The people we hired to do the planning said we would be much better off with a flat, spread-out building.”The good news was the donation of land by the government in a crowded working-class area near the airport and a reduction in the estimated cost (to $29 million from $44 million). The less sanguine reality was the discovery of squatters on the land (Mutombo paid them to leave) and the unlikelihood of raising any millions after a groundbreaking ceremony five years ago on the very day Americans were tragically reminded of the more homespun proverb that charity begins at home.“We had just finished the ceremony and watched the Sept. 11 attacks at the Inter-Continental Hotel on CNN,” Mutombo said. “I was heartbroken, and I also said: How can I go back and ask for money when they are in mourning and they have so many widows and children to take care of?”As the months passed, as normalcy returned, N.B.A. family fund-raising was still more problematic than Mutombo anticipated it would be. For all of the league’s African-American influence, for all its global ambitions, he never did get the widespread player support he had hoped for.For peace of mind, purity of heart, he prefers to acknowledge the sense of homegrown obligation felt by many players and, he added, demonstrated last year in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. He shared his mental list of those who were generous: his Georgetown comrades Alonzo Mourning and Patrick Ewing; and Juwan Howard, Gary Payton, Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming.Mutombo concluded that it was his passion, his dream, and no one had a greater obligation than he did. For almost a decade, he has nursed fragile agreements with the Congolese government (and himself when he contracted malaria on one of his trips). He continued soliciting corporations, writing checks, and now he begins another fund-raising campaign, asking the masses to call his foundation (1-877-FUNDDMF) and promise a few dollars to help with the long-term costs of the 300-bed facility.He has a wife and seven children (four are the adopted offspring of two deceased brothers) at home in Atlanta. At 40, he is playing out his career with the Houston Rockets, and his best wage-earning days are behind him. But, as he said, “It’ll be my job to keep this hospital open for the rest of my days.”He will return to Congo next week, as the country struggles to count the votes of its first democratic election in four decades. Ewing, Mourning and their old college coach, John Thompson, will lead an N.B.A. contingent later this month.“This is going to be the proudest day of my life,” Mutombo said.Years ago, when he was an N.B.A. rookie, a Georgetown sports information official told me that Mutombo was the most sincere player he had known, and maybe the funniest. The official said that he ran into him on campus right after Mutombo signed his first megamillions contract. Mutombo stopped, looked at him sideways and, in the gravelly accent that has entertained basketball people for almost two decades, said, “I remember you!”Nor has he forgotten his home, his roots, his people. To prove it, the ribbon gets cut Sept. 2 and the proverbial elevator goes down.'"

Seward Johnson Jr. and called “Unconditional Surrender.”Their kisses ranged from the almost chaste to the deeply soulful, ardent enough for Mr. Tompkins to call out, “Keep it G-rated, guys.”As if all this wasn’t silly enough, Japanese television crews were on hand to record, faithfully but bizarrely, an event rooted in the most inglorious defeat in their nation’s history.Oh, well. Think of it as a bit of midsummer frivolity in a season that has been anything but frivolous, what with new turmoil in the Middle East, fresh fears of terrorism and — need it be said? — a war in Iraq that shows no sign of ending soon.Lighthearted though it was, the Times Square exercise carried a somber reminder that the Iraq conflict has now lasted almost as long as the United States’ participation in World War II. Today is Day 1,246 since combat began on March 19, 2003. A little over three months from now, in late November, Iraq will overtake Pearl Harbor to V-J Day in duration.Perhaps it is not too soon to wonder what memory of this war, whatever you may think of it, will be cherished six decades from now, as The Kiss still is.Will Americans relive the toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue in Firdos Square in central Baghdad? Or maybe re-enact the dental exam that Mr. Hussein had after his capture? Might “Mission Accomplished” banners be in vogue in some distant future?One always makes predictions at one’s peril, but it is hard to believe that the war’s final moments will be accompanied by the same kind of exuberance felt on V-J Day. More likely, people will greet the end not with a kiss but with a sigh, signifying relief or fatigue, longing or distress. Take your pick.'"

"'06-08-16,'1','Today, however, I'm convinced that it's a myth. That's how compelling I found the letters of protest from working I.T. people. (Angry Mac fans are requested to read the excerpts themselves before responding.)One key point that I missed was that maintaining the company's desktop computers is actually a pretty tiny part of the I.T. staff's job. Wrote one reader:""As CIO of a Fortune 500 software company, I can assure you that this is not true for at least one fundamental reason: Every I.T. organization I'm familiar with already has plenty of I.T. work to do. We do not need Windows foibles to keep us busy or to justify our jobs or our budget.""Anyone who tracks I.T. finances would be more than happy to move those hardworking desktop support folks onto something that contributes more directly to our bottom line. We already have more demand than we can handle to improve order management, increase the efficiency of the sales force, maintain compliance with legal standards, fight security threats (which come in many forms, not just desktop), provide new services for our customers, and help our own employees collaborate better. Every I.T. dollar spent on desktop support is a dollar less we're spending on these more strategic initiatives.""Another correspondent made the point this way: ""I encourage you to spend one full day in the life of an I.T. pro at a corporation. The I.T. department gets all kinds of calls [having nothing to do with desktop operating systems]: when your VPN connection fails, when you deleted a file off the network that you shouldn't have, when your hard drive fails (Windows or Mac -- they use the same hard drives), when your email doesn't go through, when your Internet connection goes down... Many of these functions are performed by devices that don't run Windows, Mac or Linux; ever hear of a little company called Cisco?""Don't think that by adopting Macs, the I.T. Pros will be looking for work.""Wrote a third: ""I would LOVE a more stable, bug-free operating system, so that I could make more progress on strategic projects instead of constantly handling simple break/fix issues for users. I don't improve my chances for a raise or a new job by doing basic repair work; I do it by adding real value to the company through those more strategic tasks.""One reader also pointed out that the Mac's areas of special expertise have little relevance in the corporate world. ""Home users may complain about the difficulty in using cameras, scanners, camcorders, iPods, etc. with their PC, but we don't do that stuff here in the corporate world. The Mac shines with interoperability with these third-party items, but we still wouldn't use them in corporate.""Conversely, Windows's weaknesses are minimized in the corporate world: ""How many Windows people have a story of the game their son/daughter/spouse downloaded, and everything has been screwed up since? But in corporations, we don't install games and other software that we haven't tested.""Now, many of my correspondents acknowledged that Mac OS X may indeed require less maintenance and handholding than Windows XP. Nonetheless, they wrote, Windows will continue to dominate in the corporate world for reasons like these:* Cross-product Microsoft deals. ""Sometimes the decision is based on initial price alone, without regard to Total Cost of Ownership. Let's say that I call up my Microsoft VAR [value-added retailer] and say that I need 1,000 Windows XP Pro licenses. I'm certainly not going to pay retail for those. And I get 'points' if I buy other Microsoft licenses (Server, Exchange, SQL, ISA, etc.), which drives the cost of all of them down.""* Competition. ""The Mac would leave us with a single source of hardware. I can't pit Dell against Apple the way I can pit Dell against HP.""* Standardization. ""In the corporate world, standardization is king. OS standardization gives us the ability to manage them centrally using one technology. It means that we only have to keep up with patches for one system, and that we have to know the nuances of only one system (""quick, tell me how to do XYZ""). This is not an argument for or against Mac--it just means that we don't particularly want five users on Mac and fifty on Windows, or vice-versa.""* Inertia. ""I don't need to trade the time we spend supporting Windows for time spent retraining our company how to use the Macintosh, finding suitable applications, and researching the best solution for handling users' compatibility problems when exchanging information with our customers, our partners, and our own legacy data.""So there you have it: I should not have repeated the old saw about I.T. people protecting their own jobs.Now, humble pie is never a tasty dish to eat in public. But if I can help erase an old myth--to contribute to a more rational dialogue between Mac and Windows fans--well, pass me the spoon.'"
"'06-08-16,'1','TEHRAN, Aug. 16 - Iran’s foreign minister said today that his country is willing to discuss suspension of its uranium enrichment program during negotiations with European nations.Iran has said that it has the right to enrich uranium for industrial purposes, and the foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said Iran will not retreat from any of its rights. He was speaking less than a week before the date when Iran has promised to respond to a package of incentives offered by the United States and some European nations in exchange for suspension of its nuclear enrichment program.“We declared that the best way is to resume negotiations,” Mr. Mottaki said during a news conference in Tehran today, as reported by the ISNA news agency.“The Islamic Republic of Iran also stated in its statement that we are willing to talk about all issues,” he said. “We can even discuss the issue of suspension, which is not acceptable based on any logic. But the discussions should be serious.”He later said that Iran “will not back down from its rights under any circumstances.”Mr. Mottaki said that Iran was still planning to give a formal response to the package by Aug. 22.'"
"'06-08-16,'1','Higher energy prices helped push overall consumer prices up moderately last month, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s view that inflation is likely to ease in the coming months.When the volatile prices of energy and food are set aside, though, inflation actually slowed in July, giving investors hope that the Fed may be done raising interest rates for a while. Stocks moved higher today on the news.The consumer price index, which measures what everyday Americans pay for goods and services, rose 0.4 percent in July. The “core” index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2 percent in July, a slower rate than in the previous four months.Over all, the report was not as encouraging for investors as Tuesday’s figures on the producer price index, which fell in July when food and energy are omitted. Still, the news was well received on Wall Street, where investors added to Tuesday’s healthy gains in stock and bond prices in early trading today. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite all rose.When the Federal Reserve held its benchmark overnight lending rate steady at 5.25 percent last week — the first time in two years that the Fed’s policy committee met without raising the rate — it cautioned that inflation would remain a problem, but would eventually be contained by a slowing economy.'"

"'06-08-16,'1','As everyone with a television is aware, Lebanon has just suffered through a terrible month, with more than 1,000 people killed, most of them innocent civilians. But Iraq has suffered through an even worse month. Since June, more than 3,000 Iraqis have been killed each month, and the rate continues to rise. While Lebanon is now trying to pick up the pieces, Iraq is falling apart at an accelerating pace.As Americans debate where to go from here on Iraq, one thing should be clear. Staying the course until President Bush leaves office 29 months from now is not an option. It is no longer even clear just what course America is on. Most of what Washington now claims to be doing cannot withstand the most elementary reality test.Just this week, Mr. Bush defined America’s purpose as supporting an inclusive national unity government. Every day, it becomes increasingly clear that there is no such unity government, that there never has been and that the various branches of the Iraqi leadership are not trying to create one.Iraq’s elected government is dominated by two Iranian-backed Shiite fundamentalist parties. They are backed on the streets of Baghdad and in the Shiite south by two Hezbollah-like armed militias. In Parliament, their power is reinforced by two Kurdish separatist parties, also with their own militias, which have been allowed to run the Kurdish northeast like an independent state within a state.Washington doesn’t complain too loudly about these militias, because without them, the Iraqi government would be even weaker than it is now. But so long as they are allowed to enforce their murderous brand of vigilante justice, it is ludicrous to claim that Iraqis enjoy democracy or the rule of law.'"
"'06-08-16,'1','Taken together, both figures pointed to the possibility that inflation pressures were easing.If inflation is on the verge of retreating, the Fed’s job will be much easier, allowing it to avoid additional increases in interest rates that might threaten to put the brakes on economic growth. In leaving interest rates untouched for the first time in two years, the Fed’s policy-setting committee said last week that it expected inflation would be tempered as the economy slowed naturally.But many economists argued that the numbers could be presenting a distorted picture of inflation. The pace of wholesale price increases last month was held in check largely by falling auto prices, and there were signs in the data that prices are rising in the early phases of manufacturing.“In terms of what it actually tells us about overall inflation, I’m not sure it’s all that important,” said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs.Ethan Harris, chief United States economist with Lehman Brothers, said, “It looks to us like this is a fluke.”The figures surprised economists, who had generally forecast a larger gain in the overall index and a rise in the core index.With opinion divided on yesterday’s report, attention will shift to the Labor Department’s more important measure of consumer prices, which includes services as well as goods. While overall prices in June probably continued to advance, analysts said the core Consumer Price Index might not show much change.Producer prices in July fell in numerous categories, but were particularly weighed down by lower vehicle prices, reflecting heavy discounting by American automakers. Passenger car prices fell 0.8 percent. Prices of light trucks, including sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, dropped 3.1 percent.Food prices also fell widely. Egg prices were down 26.1 percent, processed turkeys fell 3.9 percent and shellfish fell 9.1 percent.The cost of home heating oil also dropped, but gasoline rose.What was more troublesome to many economists was the upturn in prices further up the manufacturing chain. So-called intermediate prices, which include everything from refined sugar to plywood to auto parts, rose 0.5 percent, after a 0.7 rise in June. “There are a lot of pipeline inflation pressures,” said Julia Coronado, senior United States economist for Barclays Capital.A concern among some economists is that those inflation pressures will not ease unless interest rates rise further and the economy slows sharply enough that unemployment turns up.“The Fed is basically betting that economic weakness is going to do away with these inflation pressures,’’ Mr. Hatzius of Goldman Sachs said. “I agree, although I think you may actually need more economic weakness than the Fed is anticipating.”Many economists expect economic weakness to come in large part from a slowdown in the housing sector. Yesterday, there was further evidence of a softening housing market in a new report from the National Association of Realtors, which said sales of existing homes fell from April through June in 28 states. The decline was led by states once at the top of the housing boom, like Arizona, California and Florida, which all experienced declines of more than 25 percent.The National Association of Home Builders also reported yesterday that confidence among builders fell to the lowest level in 15 years.And despite the evidence that the housing sector is deteriorating rapidly, investors looked favorably at Home Depot, which yesterday reported profits that topped Wall Street’s expectations. Its shares jumped 3.6 percent after the company said it earned $1.86 billion in the second quarter, up from $1.77 billion a year earlier.Following are the results of yesterday’s auction of four-week Treasury bills:'"
"'06-08-16,'1','In March 2005, the government predicted that the average drug premium would be $37 a month in 2006, rising to $41 in 2007. In August 2005, federal officials lowered the estimate for this year to $32, based on the proposals submitted by drug plan sponsors. In June, after seeing which plans were chosen by beneficiaries, the administration said the average premium turned out to be about $24.Dr. McClellan said the average premium would remain around $24 if beneficiaries stayed in the same drug plans in 2007 and could decline if they again chose less costly plans.Lower premiums save money for beneficiaries and the government. Medicare pays insurers a subsidy, which is about three times as much as the beneficiary’s premiums.Premiums are not the only measure of cost. Drug plans also charge co-payments, and different plans cover different drugs. So a beneficiary who takes nine drugs might find that a plan with a premium of $55 a month costs less over all than one with a $12 premium.Many insurers set premiums low this year in the hope that they could entice beneficiaries to sign up, so the companies would win large shares of the potentially huge, lucrative market for Medicare drug coverage.“Some plans decided to operate at cost, or below cost, to get a substantial share of the market,” said Babette S. Edgar, a former Medicare official who is now a consultant at the Gorman Health Group. “But plans cannot sustain that strategy and still make a profit.”Plans would eventually have to increase premiums to become or remain profitable, Ms. Edgar said.Vicki Gottlich, a lawyer at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group that counsels beneficiaries, said: “We do not know enough to determine whether the low premiums in 2007 are good for beneficiaries. Plans may be keeping costs low by unduly restricting access to the drugs they cover.”About 16.5 million beneficiaries are in free-standing prescription drug plans. More than 6 million beneficiaries are in managed care plans that cover hospital care and doctors’ services as well as prescription drugs. People can sign up for drug coverage or switch plans from Nov. 15 to Dec. 31.Companies that want to offer drug coverage submit proposals specifying the total amount they need to be paid by the government and beneficiaries. Dr. McClellan said the bids submitted by drug plans for 2007 were, on average, 10 percent lower than those for 2006. And the bids for drug coverage offered by managed care plans were lower still — about 18 percent less than in 2006, he said.Managed care plans, known as Medicare Advantage plans, can coordinate a patient’s care, and the skillful use of medications can help control spending on other services, Dr. McClellan said. Insurers can use some of those savings to reduce premiums for drug coverage.People with low incomes pay no premiums or reduced premiums for drug coverage, if they sign up for low-cost plans charging less than a specified amount. Medicare officials said they were using their authority to minimize the number of low-income beneficiaries who would need to shift plans next year. Seven out of eight beneficiaries receiving extra help can stay in their current plans and will not have to pay any premium for drug coverage in 2007, the officials said.'"
"'06-08-16,'1','Less than three weeks after being named Pfizer’s chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler has moved to put his stamp on the drug maker with a wide-ranging executive reorganization.Pfizer, in an announcement yesterday afternoon, said that David L. Shedlarz, a vice chairman, would become Mr. Kindler’s chief deputy. Karen L. Katen, another vice chairman and the president of Pfizer’s biggest division, will leave that post immediately and retire from the company early next year.Ian Read, who now runs Pfizer’s European operations, will assume responsibility for worldwide sales and marketing from Ms. Katen. Pat Kelly, Ms. Katen’s deputy for the United States, is also losing his post. He will be succeeded by Peter Brandt, currently the executive vice president for the United States division.Pfizer, the world’s largest drug maker, also elevated two scientists, Dr. John LaMattina and Dr. Joe Feczko, into the ranks of executives who will report directly to Mr. Kindler. Dr. LaMattina will continue to oversee drug discovery and development. Dr. Feczko will be Pfizer’s chief medical officer, responsible for the company’s sometimes tense relationships with regulators and the study of drugs that are already on the market.No scientists reported directly to Hank McKinnell, Pfizer’s previous chief executive. The elevation of Dr. LaMattina and Dr. Feczko reflects the fact “that science is at the heart of what we do,” Mr. Kindler wrote in an open letter to Pfizer employees yesterday.'"
"'06-08-16,'1','ZURICH, Aug. 15 (AP) — UBS said on Tuesday that its second-quarter profit rose 47 percent, topping analysts’ forecasts, helped by its private banking and investment banking operations.UBS, the largest bank in Switzerland with offices mainly in North America and Europe, said it earned 3.15 billion Swiss francs ($2.54 billion), up from 2.15 billion francs ($2 billion) a year earlier.“Our performance was strong, and was achieved despite the market reversal in the middle of May,” said Clive Standish, the chief financial officer. “Recurring income continued to benefit from the high levels of invested assets. Underwriting fees were at a record. Corporate finance and brokerage fees rose, as did revenues from trading activities.”The results for the period, which ended June 30, exceeded analysts’ estimates, which averaged 2.77 billion francs ($2.2 billion). Shares in UBS rose 0.2 percent, to 66.20 francs ($53.38).“These earnings are very good. Even without one-off disposal gains, the numbers are in line,” said Javier Lodeiro, an analyst at Bank Sarasin.The results were helped by the sales of stakes in Babcock & Brown, an Australian investment company, and in the London Stock Exchange Group.UBS’s financial business revenue, which excludes industrial holdings, rose 33 percent, to 12.06 billion francs ($9.7 billion), helped by higher commissions and fees from major clients.

"'06-08-16,'1','But investors are not heeding the advice. For more than a year, analysts have predicted that the stock would reach $40 or more. Instead, it has hovered around the mid-30’s, sometimes rising to $36, more often dropping to $32.“G.E. has gone through a rigorous portfolio transformation,” said Deane M. Dray of Goldman Sachs, who has a $40 price target on the shares, “but the stock just isn’t responding to what G.E. does or does not do.”The problem, said Robert T. Cornell of Lehman Brothers, who is looking for a $43 price, is that “the market doesn’t understand that G.E.’s growth is a function of all of its processes.”•The company, based in Fairfield, Conn., is striving to change that. For several years, it has used analyst meetings primarily to showcase how specific businesses contribute to its revenue. Now, it has temporarily tabled that approach in favor of one that lays out how G.E. helps its businesses grow, not just the other way around.“We are definitely honing the total G.E. message, trying to make everyone understand how the pieces of G.E. fit together,” said Keith S. Sherin, the chief financial officer. “Investors should realize that G.E.’s management spends tons of time focusing on processes to achieve growth.”It has certainly tried almost everything else to jump-start its stock. It has sold its insurance operations, excising a source of great unpredictability in its financial results. It has greatly increased sales in China, India and other emerging economies. It has pumped huge amounts of money into fast-growing businesses like fuel-efficient engines, security devices, water quality and consumer finance.In December 2004, Jeffrey R. Immelt, its chief executive, promised investors that G.E. would deliver 8 percent growth without acquisitions. And, for the last 18 months, it has done just that.But somehow, G.E. cannot wash away the stigma of the conglomerate that dogs almost every diversified industrial company.“G.E. is in so many businesses that it remains one of the hardest companies on the planet for investors to understand,” said Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School who has written extensively about G.E.Worse, others say, is the reverse halo effect its diversity causes. Investors tend to judge the company by its weakest link. If NBC falls behind in the ratings, or G.E. Plastics suffers squeezed margins, investors flee. “There’s this perception that G.E. is broken unless every segment is operating at peak efficiency,” Mr. Dray of Goldman Sachs said.Investors also bridle at buying a pie when all they want is a slice. There is no way to invest in, say, G.E.’s water business without buying into its aircraft engine and commercial finance businesses as well.“Investors can get in and out of businesses according to the cycle they are in, but G.E. just can’t,” said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management, which does not own the stock.G.E. executives do not try to refute this inescapable logic. Instead, they seek to persuade investors, through analysts, that the value of G.E.’s corporate processes more than eclipses any flexibility that single-industry companies can offer investors.“We need investors,” Mr. Sherin said, “to understand that we are an operating company, not a conglomerate that just holds on to businesses.”•To that end, G.E. held a meeting in May that focused on how its research yields technologies that work over a range of disparate businesses — sensors, say, that do double duty in security systems and medical diagnostic devices. It showed how G.E. was increasing its revenue from high-margin services by cross-selling financing and fleet management and equipment.“We tried to get investors to understand how much synergy and leverage there is across the portfolio,” Mr. Sherin said.And last month it concentrated on new techniques like Lean Six Sigma, a process by which each business can streamline methods for processing orders and delivering goods and services. And it introduced Net Promoter Score, a deceptively simple process by which G.E. businesses ask customers if they would recommend G.E. to others. On the basis of their answers, customers are tagged as promoters, neutral or detractors. Subtract detractors from promoters, and that’s the score.G.E. also used the meeting to telegraph more subtle signals. Mr. Immelt did not attend, something that Mr. Cornell of Lehman Brothers called a “missed opportunity to show his C.E.O.-level determination.” But others said they thought that Mr. Immelt’s absence was deliberate.“They gave us a good glimpse of G.E.’s bench, a sense of how sharp the next generation of G.E. management will be,” Mr. Dray said.Just as important, Mr. Tichy said, “it showed that the business leaders are all singing from the same G.E. hymnal.” (The company’s official stance: The meeting last month was held in part to “showcase the many experienced G.E. business leaders,” a spokesman, Russell Wilkerson, said.)The new approach has not yet given a long-term boost to the stock, although the shares did close up 38 cents yesterday, at $33.20.Investors remain optimistic. “G.E. is doing nothing wrong,” said William H. Miller III, chairman of Legg Mason Capital Management, which owned more than three million G.E. shares as of June 30. “G.E. will perform quite well over the next five years, as its consistent earnings and dividend growth recapture the market’s attention.”'"
"'06-08-16,'1','But just as French and British consumers can now shop at American-style convenience stores, the practice of product placement is gaining popularity overseas. In fact, the European Union is considering rules that would liberalize what are now strictures on — and in some instances, virtual prohibitions against — the inclusion of products and brands.• “Product placement has emerged as a key marketing strategy worldwide,” said Patrick Quinn, president at PQ, who offered a preview of the report in a telephone interview yesterday.“There’s a new media order emerging,” Mr. Quinn said, “fueled by a fear of ad-skipping technology, doubts about traditional advertising’s effectiveness and, in some countries, a search for new revenue streams as government subsidies decline.“As brand marketers are seeking to effectively engage consumers with an emotional connection, product placement is no longer a novel tactic and is increasing dramatically.”The PQ report tracks several types of product placements. One type is paid placements, where marketers spend money to weave their wares into the plots, scripts and content of entertainment offerings. Another type is barter, when, for instance, an airline provides tickets to the producers of a TV series in exchange for the airline appearing or being mentioned in an episode.Spending on paid placements worldwide will reach $3.1 billion this year, the PQ report forecasts, compared with $2.2 billion in 2005. The United States led last year with $1.5 billion in paid placements, the report says, followed by Brazil, Australia, France and Japan.By 2010, the report predicts, worldwide paid placements will total almost $7.6 billion.If the European Union approves the changes under consideration, called the Television Without Frontiers Directive, there could be triple-digit percentage increases in the money that marketers spend in Europe for paid placements, the report says.Spending on all types of placements, according to the report, will total $7.4 billion this year, compared with just under $6 billion in 2005. The United States was also first last year in all placements, at $4.5 billion, followed by Brazil, Japan, Australia and France.By 2010, the report forecasts, all worldwide placements will total almost $14 billion.Placements are “going to be an integral part of the business” for the foreseeable future, said Dick Lippin, chairman and chief executive at the Lippin Group in Los Angeles, a public relations and marketing agency. Lippin is forming a unit, called Brand to Hollywood, meant to help advertisers forge ties between products and celebrities as well as between products and events in the entertainment industry like award shows.•When Mr. Lippin started his agency in 1986, he said, marketers were content to just run commercials during TV shows; the few ways to dodge the spots included using remote controls or leaving the room.Today, Mr. Lippin said, because “technology has had a tremendous effect on what consumers watch and don’t watch,” the marketers “are coming to us asking how to place their products and brands into the entertainment world, for maximum effectiveness.”The list of marketers engaged in product placement and branded entertainment is lengthening each week, particularly online. Their ranks were once dominated by makers of packaged foods, soft drinks and other lower-priced products, which could be easily inserted into the background of a scene.But that is changing, as illustrated by the five sponsors of “Gold Rush,” a game in the form of a seven-week, online reality series from Mark Burnett Productions, the creator of placement-laden programs like “The Apprentice” on NBC and “Survivor” on CBS.“Gold Rush,” which is to begin on Sept. 13 on a Web site operated by the AOL division of Time Warner (aol.com/goldrush), will have only one packaged-goods sponsor, the Coca-Cola Zero brand sold by the Coca-Cola Company. The others are a retailer, Best Buy; an automaker, the Chevrolet division of General Motors; a wireless carrier, T-Mobile; and a bank, Washington Mutual.The placements will include using Chevrolet cars and trucks to drive contestants to competitions — and to transport the $2.2 million in gold to be hidden around the country that lends the series its name.AOL has included product placement in previous online series like “The Biz,” sponsored by Chevrolet and Sprint, but those were “baby steps” compared with its aggressive pursuit of sponsors for “Gold Rush,” said Kathleen Kayse, executive vice president for sales and partnership alliances at the AOL Media Networks unit of AOL in New York.The biggest problem with product placement and branded entertainment is how often projects blur or cross the line that traditionally separates editorial content and advertising, potentially alienating the consumers they are meant to woo.“We’ve got experience understanding what consumers are willing to accept as entertainment and what they are not willing to accept as commercialization,” Ms. Kayse said.“The last thing we want to do is put the consumer in the position of feeling it’s too commercialized,” she added.'"
"'06-08-16,'1','Mr. Sidarth, who is of Indian descent, was not convinced.“I think he was doing it because he could, and I was the only person of color there, and it was useful for him in inciting his audience,” Mr. Sidarth told The Post.The senator’s communications director, John Reid, said in an interview Tuesday that Allen campaign workers had good-naturedly nicknamed Mr. Sidarth “Mohawk” because he would not disclose his name and the sobriquet seemed appropriate for Mr. Sidarth’s hairstyle.Perhaps, Mr. Reid suggested, “Mohawk” morphed into “macaca,” with results that turned out to be regrettable.After his initial use of the term, Mr. Allen went on to urge the crowd to “give a welcome to Macaca here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia.”Mr. Reid said those words were not an effort to stamp a “foreigner” label on Mr. Sidarth, who was born in Fairfax County, Va. People who follow the campaign of Mr. Allen, who was born in California, know that he often talks about “the real America, real people in the real world,” meaning people outside the Washington Beltway, Mr. Reid said.Mr. Allen expressed further regrets on Tuesday, saying, “I apologize if my comments offended this young man.”Mr. Webb’s communications director, Kristian Denny Todd, was skeptical of the explanations from the Allen camp. “I think it’s reaching, at best,” Ms. Todd said.Jessica Smith, press secretary for the Webb campaign, said that Mr. Sidarth had been introduced to Mr. Allen in the past and that the senator’s staff knew who he was.Several Virginia polls show Mr. Webb, a Vietnam War hero, novelist and former Navy secretary under President Ronald Reagan, trailing Mr. Allen. Yet Ms. Todd said there was no discouragement in the Webb camp.“We have a fantastic candidate,” she said, adding that he was one who offered leadership instead of a rubber stamp for President Bush.Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said Tuesday that Mr. Allen was strong enough in Virginia that the verbal gaffe would probably not keep him from being elected to a second term.But should Mr. Allen run for president, the word “macaca” will hurt him, Mr. Sabato said, “not only because it is offensive on its face but also because it fits into a long pattern of insensitivity by Allen on racial and ethnic matters.”In 1984, as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, Mr. Allen opposed a state holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. After being elected governor in 1993, he issued a proclamation honoring Confederate History Month. He also kept a Confederate battle flag in his home, according to The Almanac of American Politics.The almanac also notes that as a senator Mr. Allen sponsored legislation to award $1.25 billion in grants for computers and technology for historically black colleges and universities — the measure died in the House — and that he proposed that the Senate apologize for its failure to enact antilynching laws in the 1930’s and 40’s.“I have worked very hard in the Senate to reach out to all Americans, regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity or gender,” Mr. Allen said on Tuesday.'"

In his speech, Mr. Ahmadinejad underlined Iran’s intention to respond formally to the incentives offer by next Tuesday.'"

"'06-08-16,'1','For thousands of subway riders, it has become an essential commuting tool. Plug in the iPod, and tune out the world. Instead of that overbearing panhandler or a crackling service announcement, the possibilities for these riders range from Debussy to Death Cab for Cutie.And now comes TransitTrax, the New York City Transit podcast.It is perhaps an unlikely concept: messages offered by the subway system to riders who are frequently trying to avoid listening to the subway system.But since the podcast began on June 12, more than 1,600 people have programmed their iPods or other MP3 digital music players to tune in, downloading the messages in advance. They listened 2,576 times last week to TransitTrax audio features, transit officials said.Yesterday, those tuning in might have selected a feature on what to do if “that sickly feeling” sets in as they are about to board a train (the advice: don’t get on).It was among 16 selections, covering such subjects as work on the new South Ferry Terminal in Manhattan, weekend service changes and the “If You See Something, Say Something” campaign to guard against terrorism.'"
"'06-08-16,'1','I strongly disagree with your characterization of the reforms put into effect to protect Missouri’s election process from fraud and reassure voters about the system’s integrity.Unfortunately, Missouri has a history of voter fraud and election irregularities that undermine voter confidence. As secretary of state, I oversaw an investigation that determined that at least 1,300 illegal votes were cast and counted in the November 2000 election. Among this number were unregistered voters and the deceased.We then made sweeping election law reform to combat fraud and provide ballot access, which led to record voter turnout the next election cycle.Requiring voters to present photo identification will further enhance voter confidence by providing the assurance that those who request ballots are who they claim to be.To ensure that the estimated 4 percent of voting-age Missourians who do not have a state-issued photo identification may acquire one, our Department of Revenue is working with nursing homes and senior centers to distribute free ID cards. The secretary of state has also begun a multimillion-dollar campaign to encourage Missourians to obtain identification. Missouri has been and will continue to be a leader in protecting the integrity of the ballot box.'"
"'06-08-16,'1','Not that the show comes up blank on this score. There are some attractive small paintings (Pop by Adam McEwen; Op by John Armleder and Philippe Decrauzat; a series of brushy collaborative pictures by a cohort named Trudi), as well as a few funky, free-standing sculptures (a magazine stand by Alice Könitz; Michael Phelan’s beer-bottle-balancing carved wood bear).Drawings come in several mediums, from pencil (by the collective Scorched Earth) to spray paint (by Simon Bedwell and the team of Kim Gordon and Jutta Koether). Margo Victor contributes a terse film titled “Rotten Riotous West,” and there’s a beautiful collage, a homage to female artists of the past, by the late and truly lamented Steven Parrino.Almost any of these items would find favor in an art fair booth, though multiple authorship might be a liability: the single brand-name genius still sells best. But then, the whole point of the show is to suggest that a fair amount of new art doesn’t conform to the standard retail models, and that “artist” is a highly flexible category.Much of the material Mr. Heitzler has brought together is collaborative in more ways than one. Many of the artists are cross-disciplinary, working with visual art, music and language, together or separately. Quite a bit of what they make is designed to be spread around, not enshrined.Large-edition posters, for example, account for a lot of the show. The protean Matthew Brannon has designed several of them for the gallery called United Artists Ltd. Some of the artists who have shown there (Carol Bove, Wade Guyton) in turn design posters for his shows.Just as artists can take care of their own promotion, so they can create their own group histories. Sam Gordon is doing precisely this in his remarkable DVD compilation, nearly two hours long, of clips of “art moments” from the recent past. So is the group called ESL/Esthetics as a Second Language in a multimedia show-and-tell about how the Dee exhibition was formulated.Artists make trenchant critics. Witness the work of the British collective named BANK, which for several years wielded an acid-dipped pen to edit, comment on and grade commercial gallery news releases.And artists also make smart and resourceful dealers. Reena Spaulings is the name of both a fictional artist and an artist-run gallery on the Lower East Side; “she” is a well-known example, and figures in the Dee show.In 2003 the curator Mr. Heitzler and his wife, Flora Wiegmann, opened a gallery as a yearlong art project in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Called Champion Fine Art, it kept the line between art and commerce — as well as between artist, curator and dealer — fluid and ambiguous.Also fluid in the Dee show is the line between “visual art” and everything else. The show has a whole table devoted to inexpensively produced CD’s and vinyl records made by solo artists (Peter Coffin, Mr. Parrino) and groups (Electrophilia, Gang Gang Dance, Hurray).A second table holds a sampling of artists’ books (by Phillip Andelman, Robbie Kinberg, Mai-Thu Perret), along with zines and broadsides created by individuals like Adam Putnam, or collectives like BANK, K48/ Scott Hug and the SCA Chinatown Academy. Some look highly polished, others scrappy; a few were probably stapled together in somebody’s kitchen. Several are by the amazingly prolific imprint called Pruess Press.Finally, the work of one artist at Dee, Fia Backstrom, combines practically all the mediums and disciplines mentioned above. Purely in terms of volume, she could be called the show’s star. She’s also the nodal point for its social and cultural politics.“Bring the War Home” was a slogan used by the Weather Underground, the radical 1960’s collective that wanted to create violence in the United States to mirror that being generated by the war in Vietnam. The phrase was later adopted by Martha Rosler for a series of photo-collages that inserted news photos of American soldiers and stricken Vietnamese civilians into glossy shots of suburban homes.Ms. Backstrom’s contribution to this show is political in a very different way. Rather than address specific in-the-news issues, it poses skeptical questions about the very concept of group behavior, whether in the macrocosmic form of wars, politics movements and global markets, of which the art industry is one; or in the microcosmic form of artists’ communities, collaboratives and collectives, like those included in the show.No group, she suggests, is beyond making a compromise. And Mr. Heitzler is clearly aware that his show keeps one foot in the commercial world at the same time that it is trying to feel out firm ground in an alternative sphere. The necessary ingredients are vigilance, self-awareness, self-criticism — resistance to the passivity that holds the present art world in its grip. Mr. Heitzler brings this message home to Chelsea. May it continue to be brought home in a hundred ways this fall.'"

"'06-08-17,'1','MONTREAL, Aug. 17 — Kim Clijsters, the defending United States Open champion, hurt her left wrist Wednesday night in a match at the Rogers Cup and defaulted with a lead of 6-1, 2-3. She may have to miss the Open, but she will not know the extent of the injury until she has a magnetic resonance imaging exam Thursday morning.Clijsters, ranked second in the world and seeded No. 1 here, had surgery on the wrist in 2004 and was sidelined for nine months.“I’m scared,” she said Wednesday night. “It feels very similar. I’m hoping that it’s just inflammation.”After Clijsters won the first set and took a 2-1 lead in the second against the 19-year-old Stéphanie Dubois of Canada, she called for a trainer. She had her left wrist taped, then she fell on it when she tumbled while stretching for a volley.“From the beginning, I could feel that my backhand wasn’t right,” Clijsters said. “I was slicing more than usual to protect it. It was hurting and then I slipped and landed on it in the worst position possible.”Clijsters said she experienced some pain last week in the wrist.A RARITY: FEDERER EXITS EARLY Roger Federer’s 55-match winning streak in North America ended yesterday.

"'06-08-17,'1','Boeing published a marketing survey of 3,200 airline passengers in April that seemed to indicate that such a service would soar in popularity. The company reported that the chance to use the Internet on the plane would influence the travel plans of 5 out of 6 travelers in its survey, and that of those who has actually used Connexion, 92 percent would recommend it to others.But the company said today that only a handful of people — in the “low single digits” — on each Connexion-equipped flight were actually using it.“Given the usage level, we just didn’t see the kind of numbers that add up to a business,” said John Dern, a Boeing spokesman. “You could say it flew well technically, but it didn’t fly so well as a business.”Mr. Dern said that the decision to abandon the service was entirely unrelated to the airport security alert in Britain last week, which led officials there to ban all carry-on baggage for a few days, including laptop computers. Still, he said, the difficulties faced by airlines since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, have not helped.Ken Dulaney of Gartner, the San Jose, Calif., based research firm, predicted that in-flight Internet service would be attempted again. “It seems clear to me there is a business there, just not the way Boeing built it,” Mr. Dulaney said. “There will be a fire sale of Boeing’s investments, and then someone will take over this niche market.”Mr. Dulaney compared Connexion to the Iridium global satellite-based telephone system. That business collapsed shortly after it was completed, but was taken over by new owners and is still in operation.“The service was really badly marketed, so that is something the new operators can improve,” Mr. Dulaney said of Connexion. “The biggest problem right now is that airlines can barely afford a new tire, much less a service like this.”Airbus, Boeing’s biggest rival in commercial aviation, seems to agree with Mr. Dulaney that in-flight online service has a future.“We are full speed ahead with deploying wireless Internet on board our aircraft,” said Justin Dubon, an Airbus spokesman. “We see Internet as much more than just surfing the Web.”Airbus plans to introduce its own version of in-flight Internet service with the delivery of the first of its giant A380 aircraft to Singapore Airlines later this year, Mr. Dubon said. The service, OnAir, is a joint venture between Airbus and SITA, a Swiss company that manages communications systems for the airline industry.For Lufthansa, which had installed Connexion on several of its Airbus aircraft as well as some Boeing planes, the imminent shutdown of the system poses a daunting problem.“We really want to continue offering this service, but right now we just don’t know how we will,” said Michael Lamberty, a spokesman for the airline. “Fortunately, Boeing said the service will continue for several months, so perhaps we can find a solution.”'"
"'06-08-17,'1','A federal jury in New Orleans found today that the giant drug manufacturer Merck failed to warn doctors about the medical risks of Vioxx, its once-popular prescription painkiller. The jury ruled that the company must pay a retired F.B.I. agent who suffered a heart attack while taking the drug $51 million in damages.Merck suffered another setback today in a separate Vioxx lawsuit, when a New Jersey judge ordered a new trial in the case of a postal worker who said Vioxx caused his heart attack. The original trial jury had sided with Merck in that case.Merck took Vioxx off the market in September 2004 after a clinical trial showed that it could cause heart attacks and strokes in some patients.Merck faces some 14,000 lawsuits over the drug, involving about 27,000 plaintiffs, in various federal and state courts. The results have been mixed in the cases heard so far; out of nine jury verdicts including today’s, the company has won five, including two in recent months.The verdict today, handed up in New Orleans, came in the case of Gerald Barnett, 62, who suffered a heart attack in 2002 and later underwent quadruple bypass surgery. The jury rejected the company’s assertion that Mr. Barnett’s history of heart disease bore all the blame for the attack, and found that the company was liable because it “knowingly misrepresented or failed to disclose” important information about the drug to Mr. Barnett’s doctors. The jury said Merck “acted in wanton, malicious, willful or reckless disregard” for Mr. Barnett’s rights.The company has maintained that it did nothing wrong in marketing Vioxx, and promptly withdrew the drug once its dangers became known. It has also maintained that there was no heart risk if patients took the drug for less than 18 months, and has said it will fight every lawsuit brought by people who claim that Vioxx caused their injuries.'"
"'06-08-17,'1','A passenger on the D train, Esfir Skarbo, 61, said that most of the people in her car started using their cellphones. “They didn’t know what to do,” she said. “Everybody called home. Everybody was on the phone.”The evacuations were highly unusual, occurring as they did on one of the two East River bridges that are shared by subways, cars, bicyclists and pedestrians. The Manhattan Bridge is used by the B, D, N and Q lines. Other subway lines run on the Williamsburg Bridge.“It was a difficult and slow operation,” a fire official, Assistant Chief James Esposito, said last night in a news conference on the bridge, describing the evacuation.The three traffic lanes on the lower level of the Manhattan Bridge were closed so they could be used for the evacuation.Passengers left the B train by the last car and the D train from the front car and some side doors. Many needed stepladders and were assisted by rescue workers. One firefighter passed a toddler and then a stroller off the D train and into the hands of another firefighter.More than 100 firefighters and emergency medical workers were called to the fire. Although it was declared under control at 7:55 p.m., a third alarm was sounded at 8:09 p.m., summoning additional firefighters to relieve exhausted colleagues and to assist with the train evacuations. The last passengers to be evacuated walked off the bridge around 8:40 p.m., after being stranded for more than two hours.Fire marshals determined that the fire was accidental. “There was no malicious intent,” Chief Esposito said. Investigators found rubbish and cigarette butts around the source of the fire and suspected that homeless people might have spent time at the site, he said.Many passengers said that being stuck in a train for hours on a bridge over the East River was unnerving.“I was trying to keep the people calm,” said Pat Giganti, 64, a legal secretary from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who was on the D train. “We had one guy going, ‘Open the door. Open the door.’ I was like, ‘No. You wait.’ ”The man she identified as being impatient was P. J. Dooley, 59, a part-time messenger who also lives in Bay Ridge. Mr. Dooley said that some passengers nervously wondered whether foul play might have been involved.Paul J. Fleuranges, a spokesman for New York City Transit, the arm of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that operates the subways, said that power was restored to the affected subway lines at 9:02 p.m. and that full service was restored at 9:25. For three hours, service on the B, D, F, V and Q lines had been rerouted or suspended.The Manhattan Bridge, opened in 1909, underwent extensive renovations starting in 1986 that reduced the number of subway tracks in use. All tracks were reopened in 2004.Although track fires in the subway tunnels are a routine occurrence, they rarely cause injuries or major disruptions. In March 1999, however, a fire near the Bergen Street station in Brooklyn, on the F and G lines, damaged a control room, and in January 2005, a fire in a signal relay room near the Chambers Street station in Lower Manhattan crippled service on the A and C lines for several weeks.The long wait to be evacuated took a heavy toll on many passengers.Shamsa Qureshi, 54, a B train passenger, who was treated for smoke inhalation at Brooklyn Hospital Center, said she fainted in her subway car as it was being evacuated. She was lifted out of the train by police officers and taken on a stretcher to an ambulance.""I can’t breathe,” said Ms. Qureshi, a pharmacy manager who works in the Bronx and lives in Coney Island. “I can’t see anything. I fainted.”Ms. Qureshi said the evacuation brought back memories of the August 2003 blackout. “I suffered a lot that day,” she said. “I think that was the pressure on my mind,” she said.Tania Perez, 29, of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, said that “people were sweating — dripping with sweat.” She said she could still see and smell smoke from the tunnel after an hour stuck on the D train.Shimmy Schaff, 34, of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, said he saw a woman faint in his car on the D train.Christina Liviakis, 28, of Marine Park, Brooklyn, said her car was being evacuated when a man excused himself and walked quickly to the back of the car to relieve himself. “It was the most civilized public urination I’ve ever seen in my life,” she said.'"
"'06-08-17,'1','He could choose anyone for those two spots, but he is likely to choose from those ranked between 10th and 20th. Lehman is 19th but has said that he would not choose himself.A new system for qualifying has put more weight on this PGA Tour season than on last year’s results, creating a roller derby atmosphere that has left players scrambling to improve their positions each week.Davis Love III and Fred Couples, two mainstays of the Ryder Cup, have slipped to the 15th and 16th spots, but they would seem to be candidates because of their experience.Love said earlier this season that the pressure to make the team had altered his play at times. Golfers this season have been awarded more points for top-10 finishes.“Every time I see Tom Lehman, I start looking at the list of points and trying to make a top 10,” Love said. “I’m turning what I usually make — a 5th or 8th or 10th — into a 17th and 25th just because I’m thinking about it.“I don’t want to be a pick,” Love said. “I want to earn my way onto the team.”Cink, like Love, is without a victory in a season that has mirrored those of several players.He has moved up and down the standings and waited for a victory. Cink climbed to No. 12 from No. 20 after tying for fifth at last week’s International. Cink has played on the last two Ryder Cup teams, but he said he understood that the 12th spot left him vulnerable.“I think I’m right where I should be,” he said. “I’ve had some high finishes but no wins. But coming into this week, 12th is better than 13th.”Chris DiMarco (sixth), Vaughn Taylor (seventh), J. J. Henry (eighth), Zach Johnson (ninth) and Brett Wetterich (10th) can hold onto their spots with one more good showing, but Taylor said they were trying not to dwell on the Ryder Cup.“I think we’re all just trying to get it done,” Taylor said. “There’s not really much to talk about. It’s just one of those things where you know what you’ve got to do, and there’s not much conversation about it.”Some players, like Scott Verplank (ranked 20th), have professed their love for the Ryder Cup, a lobbying tactic that could help those outside the top 10.“It’s the greatest tournament I’ve ever played in,” he said. “There’s not a lot of nerves in that for me. That’s as fun as it gets. I know I’d love to have a chance to win a major, but I don’t know if that’s better than teeing it up with 11 other guys representing the United States. That’s right there at the top of the list.”Jerry Kelly, ranked No. 13, skipped the last two tournaments on the PGA Tour so he could rest for the P.G.A. Championship. Kelly said he burned himself out in years past by playing in the weeks leading up to the championship. He has never made the Ryder Cup squad.“Some of my best events have come off of two-week breaks, and I figured that’s what I needed to do for my best shot at making the Ryder Cup,” said Kelly, who approached Lehman earlier in the year. “I said, ‘Tom, do I have to really politic you to let you understand how badly I want to make this team?’ He knows how badly I want to make this team.”In their own ways, the players have tried to show Lehman what making the Ryder Cup would mean to them, but only the P.G.A. Championship remains now.Cink said there was no reason for him to broach the subject with Lehman.“I know he’s thinking about me, but he’s thinking about everyone at No. 11 through 15,” Cink said. “I have to give him a reason to pick me or just go out and play well.”'"

Further tests will be done tomorrow to see if the cancer has spread beyond the spleen. If it has, no surgery will be performed, he said.If Lost in the Fog recovers, he could go on to a career as a sire.After winning his first 10 races, including the Grade I King’s Bishop at Saratoga, Lost in the Fog had his lone defeat in 2005 in the Breeders’ Cup Sprint.He was not the same horse this year, losing two of three starts, including a ninth-place finish in his last race, the Smile Sprint Handicap at Calder on July 15.“Something like this is very rare,” the New Jersey-based veterinarian Dr. Allan Wise said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a case of lymphoma in a horse that age. Usually, it would involve an older horse, like an old broodmare. I never heard of it in a fairly young, athletic horse.“There are some theories that a horse can get this when something goes wrong with the immune system, but we don’t know what or why. That’s why it is usually the very old that get this; their immune systems are too old.”Gilchrist says he thinks the lymphoma was at least partly responsible for Lost in the Fog’s poor form this year.“It could have been there for a year and it’s definitely been there for the last six months,” Gilchrist said. “It shows you that this horse has the heart of a lion. It certainly could explain why he had some subpar performances.”'"
"'06-08-17,'1','The City Council moved yesterday to tighten security requirements at nightclubs and bars, passing legislation that would allow the city to close down places that fail to conduct background checks of their security workers.The legislation, which was unanimously approved, would reinforce existing requirements under state law for the licensing of security guards — like background checks and training for bouncers — that many council members say have long been ignored. It would authorize the city’s police officers to treat bars and nightclubs that do not comply as public nuisances.In addition, the legislation would make the security requirements a condition of issuing cabaret licenses, which permit dancing, to the city’s 250 or so nightclubs. If a club violates the requirements three or more times within a two-year period, the legislation calls for the cabaret license to be suspended or revoked.The Department of Buildings would be the third line of defense helping to enforce the security requirements at bars and nightclubs by making compliance a condition of issuing public assembly permits, which are required for places holding more than 75 people.Mayor Michael R.

"'06-08-17,'1','MIAMI, Aug. 16 — Florida’s attorney general said Wednesday that he had gathered enough evidence to conclude that four men, all dead now, played a role in the 1951 bombing deaths of two civil rights leaders, Harry and Harriette Moore.The attorney general, Charlie Crist, a Republican running for governor, said a 20-month investigation by his office had strongly suggested that the men — Earl J. Brooklyn, Joseph N. Cox, Edward L. Spivey and Tillman H. Belvin — were involved in the killings.“In all likelihood, indictments from a grand jury would be sought against these four if they were still living,” Mr. Crist said in a news release.Mr. Moore formed the Brevard County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the 1930’s. He helped register black voters in an area governed by Jim Crow laws, and called for investigations into lynchings throughout the South.The Christmas night explosion at the Moores’ home in Mims, southeast of Orlando, went unsolved despite periodic efforts by law enforcement to revisit the case. Mr. Moore died in the bombing, which occurred on the couple’s 25th wedding anniversary; Mrs. Moore died nine days later.Mr. Brooklyn — whom Mr. Crist described in a news release as a Ku Klux Klan member “known for being exceedingly violent” — had floor plans of the Moore home and recruited volunteers, including Mr. Belvin, for the attack, the news release said.'"
"'06-08-17,'1','A panel appointed by the International Astronomical Union thinks it has come up with a dandy compromise to the years-long struggle over whether we should continue to count Pluto as a planet. The trouble is, the new definition of a planet would include an awful mélange of icy rocks found on the outer fringes of the solar system. It would be far better to expel Pluto from the planetary ranks altogether, leaving us to bask in the comfortable presence of the eight classical planets that were discovered before 1900 and have excited wonder ever since.Pluto, discovered in 1930, never deserved to be called a planet. It is far smaller than first thought, smaller in fact than our own moon. Its orbit is more elliptical and tilted in a different plane than those of the other planets, and its icy, rocky body is more like a comet’s core. If Pluto were discovered today, it seems highly unlikely that anyone would consider it a planet. But Pluto has emotional partisans who resent anyone picking on the puniest planet, so efforts to demote it invariably meet resistance.Now a panel of astronomers and historians has come up with a new definition of the word “planet” that would keep Pluto in the club. Under the new definition, a planet would be any celestial body that orbits around a star and is large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. That definition would produce an ugly porridge of 12 old and new planets, with dozens more on the way.Ceres, heretofore considered the largest of the asteroids, would qualify. The panel suggests that people might want to call it a “dwarf planet,” raising the question of why bother to call it a planet at all.Pluto would still count as a planet but would be shunted into a new category called “Plutons,” which would include any object that meets the definition and has an orbit beyond Neptune’s. Two other bodies already qualify as plutons, namely Charon, which had been considered a moon of Pluto, and a recently discovered ice ball somewhat bigger than Pluto. Many dozens of distant ice balls may ultimately qualify for planethood.All this just to keep Pluto as a planet. Whatever merit the new definition may have scientifically, it is an abomination culturally. When the astronomical union votes on the matter next week, it ought to reject the new definition and summon the courage to scratch Pluto from the list of planets.'"
"'06-08-17,'1','Mr. Rauf has emerged as the main coordinating figure of the London case. His arrest led to the arrests of 24 people in Britain last Thursday.“He became a central figure in all this,” said a senior government official who insisted on anonymity because of the investigation. “He was a connecting figure and central to it.”Mr. Rauf came to the notice of British investigators who traced telephone calls between him and people in Britain who were under surveillance, the official said.“There were frequent calls from there and to him,” the official said, adding that the British had asked Pakistan to watch Mr. Rauf, who had been under surveillance for a few weeks.Reuters, quoting unnamed intelligence officials, reported that Mr. Rauf was arrested on Aug. 9, hours before the arrests in Britain.He remains in custody, appearing before a judge over the weekend, said a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, Tasneem Aslam.Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao said Tuesday that Britain had not requested Mr. Rauf’s extradition. Pakistan does not have an extradition treaty with Britain, but Mr. Sherpao said that international conventions covered such requests and that a special case could be made.The senior official here said that a senior Qaeda agent still at large was the mastermind of the plot and that Mr. Rauf was the main contact for the would-be bombers in Britain. Pakistani officials have implied that the Qaeda figure is based in Afghanistan, but the official said he was not Afghan, adding that all the group’s top leaders were from Arab countries. He also said a third country was connected because of the financial trail.Mr. Rauf, reportedly 29 years old, was born in Pakistan and lived nearly all his life in England, until 2002, when he returned to Pakistan after having been implicated in the stabbing death of an uncle in Britain, the official said. Mr. Rauf was arrested in Bahawalpur, the official said.His connection to Jaish-e-Mohammed would explain much about any involvement with the bombing plot or Al Qaeda. The group was founded by Maulana Masood Azhar in February 2000 to support mujahedeen fighting in Kashmir and Afghanistan. It became closely associated with the Taliban and Al Qaeda.As Pakistan cracked down on jihadi groups after Sept. 11, 2001, Jaish-e-Mohammed changed its name and split into two groups. Those groups were also banned because of continued pressure from the United States. A splinter group of Jaish-e-Mohammed was blamed for masterminding an assassination attempt against President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan in 2003.'"

"'06-08-17,'1','They have usually been depicted as deadbeats, like the father in a John Hancock Financial Services commercial in 2000 who told his distraught ex-wife that he was thinking of moving to California with his girlfriend, leaving their son “Joey” behind.But the divorced father in commercials may be in the midst of an image overhaul. In a new Ford Motor commercial, he is seen as loving and functional, the kind of guy who spends time with his children on the weekends and gets along swimmingly with his ex-wife.Advertisers say they are trying to accurately reflect their customers, many of whom do not fit into the nuclear-family tableau often seen in commercials. The Ford ad is also an indication that major marketers are becoming more comfortable with the subject of divorce, which they used to consider too depressing or controversial.“Divorce is so common that I don’t think people view it as sad and depressing anymore,” said Allen P. Adamson, managing director at the New York office of Landor Associates, a corporate identity consulting company owned by the WPP Group. “It’s on every movie, every TV show. There aren’t any more ‘Leave It to Beaver’ families around.”The Ford commercial shows two parents, two children and a dog spending a weekend shopping, driving and hanging out at the beach — but at the end of the day, the father is dropped off at his apartment. “Thanks for inviting me this weekend,” he says while hugging his children. “Sure,” responds his apparent ex-wife, perched behind the wheel of the Ford Freestyle. The commercial ends with the father waving as the car drives away.'"
"'06-08-17,'1','A 60-second television spot for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York began running yesterday on broadcast and cable stations in upstate New York and on cable stations in Westchester County and on Long Island.THE SCRIPT Local leaders who were skeptical of Mrs. Clinton during her 2000 campaign open the reel. “I was very unsure,” says Geri Barish, an activist on Long Island for breast cancer awareness. Then Mrs. Clinton appears, wearing a pink and white striped shirt and a pearl choker, sitting in a homey setting with family photographs and a vase of pink roses in the background.“New Yorkers took a chance on me in 2000, and I have worked hard every single day to deserve that chance,” she says, facing the camera but speaking as if to someone off to one side. “Once in a while we can really make a difference and help one child or one family.”THE TITLE “Standing Up for New York”ON THE SCREEN Clips of four men praising the senator for bringing money, jobs and services to constituents. Capt. Peter L. Gorman, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, credits her with helping bring $20 billion in federal money to the state after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. Thomas Maguire, the state’s former adjutant general, praises her for fighting to keep the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station open. Brian Hammond, a worker in Waddington, N.Y., says she helped the economy. And Joseph Ward, a father in Lisbon, N.Y., says that when his son needed a bone marrow transplant, Mrs. Clinton’s office assured him that the hospital would help absorb the cost.ACCURACY She is widely credited with delivering federal money to New York City after Sept. 11. On the economic front, critics accuse Mrs. Clinton of exaggerating her success in revitalizing upstate New York, arguing that manufacturing jobs are still being lost in the region; in the ad, Mr. Hammond says only that her efforts “brought some life to our economy up here.”SCORECARD This is Mrs. Clinton’s first ad in her 2006 Senate race, and it is characteristically on message, focusing on her work for New York without any allusion to a possible presidential bid. But the subtext — that she can win over skeptics — is one that could be applied in a presidential race. And there is no mention of the Iraq war, which Mrs. Clinton voted to authorize, a subject that has become increasingly problematic for candidates across the board.'"
"'06-08-17,'1','After nearly a two-year head start, Johnson & Johnson is about to face competition in the market for artificial spinal disks.Synthes, a Swiss orthopedic devices company, told investors after European stock markets closed Tuesday that it had received regulatory approval to sell its Prodisc lumbar disk replacement in the United States.For now, only surgeons at the 19 hospitals that participated in the Prodisc’s clinical trials will be implanting the device in this country. But Synthes plans to start a training program next month for others who want to do the implants, Peter Fehlmann, a Synthes spokesman, said yesterday.Synthes is just one of several large device companies, including Medtronic, Abbott Laboratories and Stryker, that expect to compete with Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy Spine subsidiary for a share of what analysts believe will be a billion-dollar segment of the orthopedics industry.Implanting the Prodisc — thousands of which have already been implanted in patients in Europe — could be an alternative to spinal fusion surgery for as many as 25 percent of the 220,000 Americans who undergo fusion annually. The companies are also racing to develop cervical disks for the neck and upper spine.Johnson & Johnson’s disk, known as the Charité, was approved in October 2004. But sales have been disappointing. Insurers have continued to classify the disk as experimental, and many refuse to cover the cost of the implant procedure, which can cost more than $10,000 per disk and several times that amount in hospital and doctors’ fees.'"
"'06-08-17,'1','Many in the field of intercultural research have been working for years to help people more effectively achieve their goals across borders — not only in business transactions, but also across borders of politics, faith, professions, age and other sometimes formidable barriers.But Mr. Brooks’s conclusion that we are “foolish to think we can address the root causes” of young Muslim men’s martyrdom and that we will “just have to fight the symptoms of a disease we can neither cure nor understand” does not follow from the analysts he cites.While it is true that long-term cultural change is rarely, if ever, imposed from the outside, that does not mean that policies in one country have no effect on culture change in other societies.In all civilizations, having an unyielding outside adversary strengthens those who would support the most militaristic, radical and uncompromising aspects of their own societies. When one nation or group threatens another, only extremists are strengthened.Democratic societies have more resilience in this regard, which may ultimately, we may hope, allow the United States to step outside the vicious circle of mutual demonization.'"
"'06-08-17,'1','So much fuss about a labeling problem! Pluto is a cold round object orbiting a hot round object — call it what you will. How arbitrary our labels are.When the human race finally manages to do away with itself, all else in the universe will continue to exist (with the possible exception, depending on our method of self-destruction, of the rest of the earth’s biota).Gone, however, will be the names and categories and interpretations that we have imposed on it.Oh, the things we do in the name of schoolchildren, things like redefining our planetary system so that traditional textbooks and classroom charts can be saved.And in the process, Pluto is saved.All hail the Planet Definition Committee and its ingenious compromise. Washington lawyers (those guardians of definitional reality) could not have done a better job.Moral: when in doubt, redefine reality until it suits our needs.Meanwhile, don’t fret over the illogic of it all. Forget about the nagging scientific problems raised by giving Charon, a moon of Pluto, planetary status. Let it come along for the gravitational joy ride.And forget about those 43 other known objects in the Kuiper Belt, too. What is important? Saving our children’s charts!After all, what would happen if we actually confessed to children that there are things in space we can’t yet explain? Would our world really come to an end if Pluto fell off the solar charts? Incredibly, some seem to think so.With reference to the controversy surrounding the newly proposed qualifications for membership in the Planets Club of our dear old solar system, let me state categorically that I oppose lowering the bar to admit second-class celestial bodies.Sphericity and orbital path are all very well, but the gravity of the issue demands closer examination of the candidates’ pedigrees and ancestry.The fact is that the present nonumvirate takes precedence by virtue of direct connection with the Olympian gods. Even tiny Pluto at the periphery bears the name of the ruler of the underworld and lord of wealth, and as such can claim kinship with mighty Jove himself.Granting entry to a mere oarsman like Charon or the fictional daughter of a tavernkeeper like Xena would only degrade the exalted status of planethood and discourage true scions of the pantheon from joining its ranks.'"

"'06-08-18,'1','Europe’s genocidal adventures in Africa receive a passionate reckoning in the ambitious documentary “King Leopold’s Ghost.” Working from Adam Hochschild’s best-selling history of the same title, the producer and first-time director Pippa Scott has enlisted a legion of talking heads to help tell a story of insatiable greed and unimaginable terror. Among those tapped for their expertise are academics, historians, Congolese elders and, for some reason, the memoirist Frank McCourt. Mr. Hochschild proves particularly effective, since he gets right to it: “What made it possible for Congo state officials to deal out all this pain and terror? Race.”The barbarism of King Leopold of Belgium, the subject of another recent documentary, “Congo: White King, Red Rubber, Black Death,” remains shocking. In the mid-1880’s, with the help of the explorer Henry Morton Stanley and the approval of the world’s leading powers, Leopold seized a swath of Africa (then the Congo Free State, now the Democratic Republic of Congo) more than 76 times the size of Belgium, turning it into a personal capitalist venture. Using a large private army whose numbers included Congolese orphans, the king and his agents squeezed the land of its resources, slaughtering elephants for ivory, tapping trees for rubber. The Congolese were uprooted, separated, enslaved, whipped and mutilated (hands were cut off, sometimes for accounting purposes), leaving as many as 10 million dead.Ms. Scott’s outrage is palpable, but she has bitten off enough here for a 10-hour television series. (A former actress who played the oldest daughter in “The Searchers,” Ms. Scott produced a “Frontline” film on Radovan Karadzic.) King Leopold would be enough for one documentary, as would Patrice Lumumba and Mobutu Sese Seko, both of whom are too quickly crammed into the film’s overloaded, visually chaotic two hours. The flurry of archival photographs, maps, paintings, quotations and far too many unidentified film clips, both archival and of recent vintage, fiction and nonfiction, overwhelm rather than elucidate. The voices of Don Cheadle, who provides some of the narration, and Alfre Woodard and James Cromwell, each reading historical documents in accented English, just prove distracting.Produced and directed by Pippa Scott; adapted by Ms. Scott from the book by Adam Hochschild; narrated by Don Cheadle, with the voices of Alfre Woodard and James Cromwell; edited by Oreet Rees; music by Yoav Goren; released by Linden Productions.

"'06-08-18,'1','FOR years the boozy, beautiful world of Charles Bukowski has proved catnip to European filmmakers and a few American actors happy to go along for the rough ride: Ben Gazzara, Mickey Rourke and now Matt Dillon. Bukowski’s own story (his parents moved to Los Angeles from Germany when he was 3) clearly holds attraction for certain creative types, as do all his tales of ordinary madness. That many of those stories take place in Los Angeles may be particularly seductive, since few images telegraph the paradox of the American dream better than a drunk passed out in the shadow of Hollywood.Hollywood, as sign or guiding principle, is nowhere to be found in “Factotum,” and there isn’t a palm tree in sight. Shot in a seedy, forlorn Minneapolis, far from that city’s green-canopied streets and Prairie School architecture, the film was directed by the wonderfully named Bent Hamer, a Norwegian whose earlier features include the deadpan comedy “Kitchen Stories.” Working with the producer Jim Stark, Mr. Hamer adapted the screenplay from the 1975 novel of the same title, with snippets from three other, more characteristically Bukowskian sounding volumes: “The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills” and the posthumous “What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk Through the Fire” and “The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship.”Published when Bukowski was in his mid-50’s and starting to reach a wider readership, “Factotum” presents the age-old struggle of man against mediocrity. Henry Chinaski (Mr. Dillon), Bukowski’s familiar alter ego, is the heroic survivor of countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing, mind-deadening jobs. Or, as he puts it so nicely in the novel: “How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 6:30 a.m. by an alarm clock, leap out of bed, dress, force-feed” — there is, naturally, a scatological dimension to this list — “brush teeth and hair, and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?”In “Factotum” Henry answers this most reasonable question mostly by trying to avoid working, or at least working too hard, for other people. (Bukowski himself toiled for the Postal Service for more than a decade.) To that end, he takes a succession of menial jobs that require him to polish the vainglorious décor of a newspaper building (he holds out hope, briefly, for a job as a reporter), jackhammer ice and sort pickles. He does all of this with degrees of competency and just enough interest to keep him from collapsing into a stupor, though on occasion he does drop into the nearest bar. There, in a flood of alcohol, he casts a bloodshot eye on the adjoining flotsam and jetsam, taking notes on the human condition.Of course Bukowski-Chinaski was always working, even when he could barely hold down a job, sending out manuscripts and collecting, for many lean years, rejection notices. In “Factotum” Mr. Hamer shows us Henry coiled over a dimly lighted table, pressing his pen hard into sheets of paper, as the words float on the soundtrack. Mr. Dillon, wearing a beard and the flushed cheeks of a committed lush, sounds as persuasive as he looks. Whether he’s nuzzling another drunk (Lili Taylor and Marisa Tomei take turns baring necks and psyches) or swapping philosophies with another shirker (Fisher Stevens), the actor delivers much of his dialogue with the hushed deliberation of a man who spends a lot of time in his head, which makes sense, given the company he generally keeps.Like the film itself, Mr. Dillon’s performance works through understatement. It’s easy to go big with Bukowski, the way that Barbet Schroeder did in his 1987 film, “Barfly,” in which a freewheeling Mickey Rourke plays a skid-row Puck in a theater of the damned. There are intimations of soul amid this film’s bloody grins and barstool gargoyles, but what it lacks is an appreciation for Bukowski’s tenderness, for those sighs of feeling that rise up when life is this hard, but the soul enduring it has not hardened in turn. Mr. Dillon’s phrasing carries the weight of such feeling, as does the hypnotically slowed gestures that give him the aspect of a man sitting at the bottom of a pool and thinking about drowning.'"
"'06-08-18,'1','Ford Motor executives are trying to develop an expanded version of the North American turnaround plan that the company announced in January. The plan, called the Way Forward, called for the company to close 14 plants and eliminate 30,000 jobs by 2012 to streamline its operations and cut costs.Ford is now looking at deeper cuts, on a swifter timetable than the original plan. It is expected to announce the additional steps in September.General Motors is undergoing a similar effort to trim costs and turn around its North American vehicle business; it has said it will close all or part of a dozen factories and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs.Ford’s announcement today that it would cut fourth-quarter production by 168,000 vehicles will have an immediate impact on its bottom line. Auto companies count vehicles as sold when they are shipped from the factory to the dealer, not when they are ultimately purchased by the consumer. Under this system, cutting production directly reduces the manufacturer’s potential for revenue and profits.Ford also said it is cutting back its production in the current quarter by another 20,000 vehicles, beyond the cutback of 40,000 vehicles that it announced in July. All told, the company now expects to build slightly more than 3 million vehicles this year. The F-series pickup alone accounts for about 30 percent of that total.Following the announcement, two of the major credit-rating agencies, Moody;s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s, said they were considering downgrading Ford, and a third, Fitch Ratings, lowered its rating of Ford by one level. All three agencies rate Ford’s debt securities well below investment grade.Shares of Ford stock traded at about $7.98 at midday, down 19 cents from Thursday’s close.Ford has not cut production this deeply since it underwent a financial crisis in the early 1980’s that nearly forced it to seek a federal bailout like the one Chrysler received.“This action, difficult as it is, reflects an assessment of the marketplace that is conservative, and more aligned with the shift in customer demand,” Mr. Ford wrote in the e-mail to employees.He went on, “As you know, an unprecedented spike in gasoline prices during the second quarter impacted our product lineup more than that of our competitors, because of the long-standing success of our trucks and S.U.V.’s.”Like Chrysler and General Motors, Ford makes relatively little money on the cars it sells and depends heavily on pickups and S.U.V.’s for profits. By contrast, the major Japanese automakers still produce more cars than light trucks and make substantial profits on both, though they too have introduced more pickup and S.U.V. models in recent years.Last month, Toyota surpassed Ford for the first time to become the No. 2 automaker in the American market, ranked by unit sales. (General Motors is No. 1.) Soon after that, Ford announced that it lost $254 million in the second quarter, on top of a $1.2 billion loss it reported for the first quarter.Ford Motor also said today that it would reduce its spending on sales incentives like cash rebates and below-market financing. American automakers make much heavier use of such incentives than Honda or Toyota do, and tend to see sharper fall-offs in sales when they have been curtailed or withdrawn.Under the revised production schedule, Ford Motor said it would temporarily shut down assembly lines in Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, Kentucky and Ontario at various times between now and the end of the year.'"
"'06-08-18,'1','Arguments in the third trial of John A. Gotti in a year opened yesterday with prosecutors and defense lawyers returning to one of the familiar, and crucial, points of the first two trials — whether Mr. Gotti helped run the Gambino family as recently as the summer of 1999.Mr. Gotti is being tried in Federal District Court in Manhattan on charges that he ordered the 1992 kidnapping and beating of Curtis Sliwa, the radio talk show host and founder of the Guardian Angels. Juries in the previous trials failed to reach a verdict.In 1992, Mr. Sliwa, who survived the attack, was shot three times after prosecutors said he unwittingly stepped into a stolen taxicab driven by a Gambino family associate as a second mobster waited with a gun in the back seat. Mr. Gotti is not charged with ordering the shooting.Mr. Gotti, according to prosecutors, ordered Mr. Sliwa’s kidnapping in retaliation for remarks Mr. Sliwa made on the air during his show about Mr. Gotti’s father, John J. Gotti. The elder Mr. Gotti died in 2002 while he was serving a life sentence for racketeering as the head of the Gambino crime family.The younger Mr. Gotti, 42, known as Junior, is also charged with loan-sharking and with construction industry extortion as part of a broad pattern of racketeering dating to the 1980’s. For this trial, prosecutors have added new racketeering charges and a witness-tampering count. Mr. Gotti faces more than 30 years in prison if convicted of all charges.'"
"'06-08-18,'1','The gaffe ended with Miguel Tejada crossing the plate to make the score 10-2, and with Gibbons scooting into second. The next batter, Fernando Tatís, hit a two-run homer against Octavio Dotel.“It was a goofy play,” said Rodriguez, who was initially given an error. It would have been Rodriguez’s 22nd error this season, one in which his shaky defense has become an ongoing issue. But the official scorer, Howie Karpin, changed the ruling, giving the error to Jeter for impeding Rodriguez’s ability to make the catch.“It was a stupid play all around,’’ Rodriguez said. “He called. I called. We didn’t hear each other.’’Jeter initially looked surprised that he had been charged with the error but then said he did not care. Torre said it should have been Jeter’s play, since he is the shortstop and in charge in the infield, but that no one could be blamed if they could not hear each other.In any case, it was Jaret Wright’s wildness that actually did the Yankees in. He walked four batters, all of whom scored, in three-plus innings. He hit one batter, threw a wild pitch and allowed five earned runs on two hits. Of his 75 pitches, only 39 were strikes.“I couldn’t throw strikes; it was awful,” Wright said. “The command of the fastball, it was completely gone. I just got myself in trouble and couldn’t get out of it.”Wright (9-7) had gone 10 consecutive starts without allowing a home run, a stretch of 223 batters. But he allowed a homer to the game’s first batter, Brian Roberts.Johnny Damon got the run back by homering against Orioles starter Rodrigo López to lead off the bottom of the first. And the Yankees took a 2-1 lead on Robinson Canó’s bases-empty home run into the upper deck in the second.But the lead was short-lived. In the top of the third, Wright threw 13 balls in 15 pitches to walk three consecutive batters. Roberts scored from third on Wright’s wild pitch, and Gibbons hit a single that drove in two runs as the Orioles took a 4-2 lead.After Wright walked Corey Patterson to lead off the fourth, Torre replaced him with Ron Villone, who allowed a three-run homer to Nick Markakis. The Orioles had only three hits at that point, and yet the score was 7-2.The Yankees squandered their only real opportunity to mount a comeback, when Bobby Abreu flied out to center field to end the fifth inning with the bases loaded.As the game deteriorated, Yankees fans turned their attention to — who else — the Red Sox, targeting them with an unflattering chant. The fans, too, could not help but fixate on the next opponent.The Yankees placed starter Cory Lidle on the bereavement list yesterday after the death of his grandmother, allowing them to put the Class AAA Columbus reliever Brian Bruney on the roster for several days. Lidle must miss at least three consecutive days but not more than seven. Joe Torre said he expected Lidle back in time to start Monday against the Boston Red Sox. Bruney, a right-hander, made his Yankee debut in the eighth inning yesterday, allowing no runs.'"
"'06-08-18,'1','Mr. Barnett began taking Vioxx after a car accident in early 2000 and suffered a heart attack in September 2002. He continued taking Vioxx until shortly before Merck stopped selling the drug in September 2004.After less than a day of deliberations, the jury awarded Mr. Barnett $50 million in compensatory damages, and an additional $1 million in punitive damages. The case was tried before Judge Eldon E. Fallon of Federal District Court, who is overseeing 5,700 Vioxx suits.Plaintiffs’ lawyers lauded the verdict and said that it would increase pressure on Merck to reach a mass settlement.“If the jury believes that the person took Vioxx regularly, they will hold Merck liable for the heart attack,” said Robert Gordon, a plaintiffs’ lawyer at Weitz & Luxenberg. Mr. Gordon helped try a Vioxx case in New Jersey this spring in which a jury in state court awarded $4.5 million to Thomas McDarby, a 77-year-old man who suffered a heart attack after taking Vioxx for almost two years.Lawyers for Merck said they would not change their strategy.“While this is not the outcome we had hoped for, our commitment to defending these cases one at a time remains the same,” Merck’s general counsel, Kenneth C. Frazier, said in a statement.Merck noted that plaintiffs’ lawyers had chosen to try the Barnett case because it was stronger than the average suit the company faces.Before yesterday’s decisions, Merck’s strategy of aggressively defending cases, rather than looking for a settlement, appeared to be paying dividends. This summer, Merck has won state court cases in New Jersey and California, and lawyers for plaintiffs in federal court have dismissed hundreds of suits.Lawyers now estimate that Merck will face 35,000 to 40,000 lawsuits, rather than the 100,000 that were initially forecast, and investors have lowered their estimates of the company’s overall liability in the litigation to $10 billion or less, rather than the $20 billion or more initially forecast.Since their lows last fall, Merck shares are up about 50 percent, even after yesterday’s decline. They trade less than 20 percent below their levels in September 2004, before Merck stopped selling Vioxx. Merck closed yesterday at $38.83, down $2.35.But yesterday’s verdict highlights the risks of Merck’s strategy. While the company faces fewer cases than initially expected, those that remain appear strong. And Merck continues to struggle to explain e-mail messages from its scientists discussing Vioxx’s potential risks as early as 1997, two years before the drug reached the market.So far, plaintiffs and Merck have won four cases each, not including the New Jersey case in which the decision was overturned. Jurors have sharply punished Merck in each case it has lost, awarding plaintiffs an average of almost $90 million in compensatory and punitive damages, which are supposed to be given only in cases of egregious corporate conduct.Those large losses are unsustainable, said W. Mark Lanier, who won a $253 million verdict against Merck last year in the first Vioxx case to reach trial and worked alongside Mr. Gordon in the McDarby case.“This attitude of Merck — that we’re going to try every case — will destroy the company,” Mr. Lanier said. The history of complex corporate litigation, he said, shows that plaintiffs will become increasingly adept at presenting their cases, as they figure out which documents to highlight and witnesses to call.Christopher Seeger, a plaintiffs’ lawyer in New York, said the New Orleans verdict was particularly stinging for Merck because it came in federal court. Corporate defendants generally prefer federal courts because judges tend to keep tight rein on lawyers and to impose stricter rules on what evidence juries are allowed to see.Merck also received bad news yesterday in Atlantic City, where Judge Carol Higbee, who is overseeing 7,100 suits in New Jersey state court, threw out a decision in favor of the company reached in November.In December, after the verdict, The New England Journal of Medicine published an “expression of concern” about the way Merck had reported the results of a large clinical trial of Vioxx in a paper published in the journal in 2001. According to lawyers for both sides, Judge Higbee said that jurors should not have had to consider the article without knowing that its editors believed that Merck had misrepresented the results of the trial.The suit will be retried as part of a group of cases scheduled to begin in January.'"

The group inspected more than a million square feet of factory space, the company said.“We did find that the weekly limit on hours worked was exceeded 35 percent of the time, and so the supplier is changing its policy as a result of the audit,” an Apple spokesman, Steve Dowling, said. Apple said it limits the workweek to 60 hours, with at least one day off.'"
"'06-08-18,'1','And with most of the easiest deposits already tapped, mining companies are having to venture deep and far to obtain metals like copper, zinc and nickel.After a brief slump in June, nickel prices rose steadily and began surging early this month as rumors swirled in London that a big buyer had made a substantial bet that the price of the metal would fall by selling 10,000 metric tons of it short. One report identified the seller as Posco, a large South Korean steel maker, but the company denied that.In short sales, investors sell a borrowed commodity or a stock that they believe they will be able to buy later at a lower price. If the price falls, the trader can make a handsome profit. But if prices continue to rise, the seller must scramble to return the borrowed stock or seek to delay delivery, both of which can deal the trader a substantial and theoretically unlimited loss. If the bet is big enough, the seller’s desperation to buy can itself propel prices higher.It may be impossible to know who sold how much nickel short, and “it’s not actually that relevant,” said Kevin Norrish, an analyst with Barclays Capital. He contends that nickel’s price is being driven up by fundamental factors. In a report released this week, the International Nickel Study Group, an organization of producing countries, said that demand for the metal was exceeding current production levels.And Mr. Norrish added, “You have got lower production coming through than people had expected.”To ease supplies in the short run, the London Metal Exchange beginning today, has imposed a daily limit of $300 a metric ton on how much short sellers have to pay to delay delivery of any nickel they have borrowed that is due to be returned. Previously, the price to delay delivery was set by the market and could run into thousands of dollars a ton. “It helps the market to operate in an orderly fashion without getting out of control,” a spokesman for the exchange, Adam Robinson, said.The making of stainless steel takes up two-thirds of nickel production, with the rest going into aerospace, batteries and other uses. (The use of nickel in coins is minimal, and it makes up just 25 percent of the coin that bears its name; copper makes up most of it.)Russia is the largest supplier of the metal, followed by Canada and Australia, but increasingly mining companies are looking to places like Indonesia and New Caledonia, a South Pacific island group long associated with the nickel trade.In 2005, worldwide nickel production rose 7 percent, to 1.5 million tons, but output this year is slowing because of disruptions and delays at some big mines and production operations.In the meantime, the strong global economy and a boom in new steel plants in China, India and elsewhere have kept the demand for nickel robust and rising. Steel makers can substitute chrome and manganese for nickel if prices climb too high and mining companies are unable to keep up with demand, but that does not appear to be happening thus far, said Neil Buxton, an analyst with GFMS Metals Consulting in London.Jeremy Goldwyn, head of industrial commodities at Sucden, a London commodities broker, said the big question on most traders’ minds was, Once this short-term situation dissipates, will the underlying prices fall sharply as well?'"
"'06-08-18,'1','Hedge funds are also seeking returns from investments that are not tied to movements in the stock and bond markets. That desire for such uncorrelated returns has become more pronounced in recent months as traditionally uncorrelated assets have moved in the same direction as the markets. That unnerved a lot of money managers. Their response? High-risk bets on Mother Nature.The opportunity is the potential for over-the-moon returns. The risk is a total wipe-out.Three storms in 2005 cost the insurance industry $80 billion, making 2005 the highest catastrophic-loss year in history, according to Standard & Poor’s. Yet those storms also made 2006 a year of grand opportunity.The future will be no different. Hedge funds may be able to model, or predict, many things better than others. The weather is not likely to be one of them, but the bet does make sense: if hurricane season comes and goes without any epic disasters, the hedge funds in reinsurance will have made buckets of money on record high premiums. If disaster strikes, their capital — either in catastrophe bonds, sidecars or newly minted reinsurance companies — will be gone, paid out covering claims. “It’s not a short-term investment. It’s a long-term investment,” said Mr. Nutter. “They can sell, but they can’t just walk away.”Big names have marched down to Bermuda, the reinsurance capital of the world, and the Cayman Islands. Citadel, the $12 billion hedge fund based in Chicago that led the charge into reinsurance, set up New Castle Re late last year. Magnetar, founded by a Citadel alumnus, Alec Litowitz, founded Pulsar Re earlier this year. Highfields Capital Management, based in Boston, along with XL Capital, set up a sidecar called Cyrus Reinsurance, and Eton Park Capital Management joined a number of private equity firms in forming Ariel Reinsurance, based in Bermuda, in December 2005. Bankers say funds are looking at the sector with an eager eye. More recently, smaller players have expressed interest as well.According to Standard & Poor’s, hedge funds are the biggest buyers of catastrophe bonds. Invented in the wake of Hurricane Andrew, the bonds are issued by insurance or reinsurance companies. They pay 5 to 15 percent on the coupons, and they return on the principal if the maturity runs out without a catastrophic event.Roughly $1.8 billion of catastrophe bonds were issued in 2005. Through mid-August, $2.5 billion have been issued this year. Ten reinsurance companies have been founded since Katrina, as well as 10 sidecars. The sidecars allow hedge funds to give capital to an existing reinsurance company, limiting the funds’ exposure to past policies and allowing the hedge funds to get more of the profits as long as there is no catastrophe. Existing reinsurers have raised $12 billion as well.But the outlook is not all clear skies. History is filled with examples of insurance gone bust. D. E. Shaw and Eton Park Capital management were among the largest investors in the recapitalization last year of the Bermuda reinsurer PXRE. The company issued $375 million of preferred shares. In February, the company announced that its previous estimate of potential hurricane-related losses was not enough, and said it had to add another $281 million to $311 million to the tally. The stock slid to $4.05, from $12.40. Fitch Ratings has maintained a negative watch, in part because of “Fitch’s belief that PXRE has limited financial flexibility going forward.” The stock closed yesterday at $3.87.And not all hedge funds are racing in. One manager said this week that his fund had been looking closely at reinsurance. He said he had renovated a number of houses and had never had one come in close to budget. That led him to question whether reinsurance estimates of catastrophic losses would be any different.'"
"'06-08-18,'1','Black-box trading systems, as they are known, are responsible for a growing percentage of market trading around the globe, including an estimated half of all United States stock trades and a quarter of worldwide currency trades. AHL, as one of the longest-running, most successful programs on the market, has become the backbone of the Man Group’s rise to a £7.44 billion ($14 billion) market cap company.Recent weeks have been a struggle for AHL, but analysts and Man Group executives say that is part of the normal trading fluctuations for the highly volatile system. AHL Diversified Program, AHL’s basic performance measure, was down 3 percent in June and 3 percent again in July. Market indecision stymies many an investor and money manager, but it can seriously thwart a black box system like AHL. Automated trading systems rely on long-term momentum in any given market to calculate what the next trade should be, so when markets and prices do not move in a constant way, a system loses money. In June, AHL also suffered because gold had a precipitous one-day drop, and commodities sold off.“The last six weeks have been a bit of a nightmare for them, or for anyone looking for direction out there,” said Michael Sanderson, general financial equity research with Dresdner Kleinwort in London. Mr. Sanderson, who has the company rated a buy, added that there was little cause for alarm.Man Group executives say they are not concerned.“Even in times that people have started to get nervous about it, AHL has proven tremendously resilient,” said David Browne, the Man Group’s head of funding. In April 2001, the net value of the assets managed by AHL dropped 6.3 percent. By year-end, they were up 19.7 percent over 2000.The question that haunts AHL — and all black-box trading systems — is this: What if something completely unexpected happens that the system doesn’t predict?“Every market has that issue,” Mr. Browne said. “The advantage of AHL is that it is uncorrelated” to markets, and “often does quite well in those conditions,” he said. The fund expects annual volatility as high as 18 percent, and in many cases penalizes investors for exiting in the first six years, cushioning it from skittish investor movement. For the fiscal year ended March 31, AHL was the largest contributor to the Man Group’s $450 million in asset management performance fees, at 23.4 percent.AHL’s founders, Michael Adam, David Harding and Martin Lueck, have been gone from the Man Group for more than 10 years, and have since started up new funds themselves. The program is updated by an even quieter group of employees. They try to improve the AHL system by, for example, finding a better, faster way to conduct trades. Twice a day, analysts look at AHL’s risk levels and its portfolio allocation, checking to see that nothing has gone awry.For those jobs, hedge fund analysts need not apply.“Typically the research analyst staff come straight from academia,” said Tim Wong, head of research for AHL, who is an engineering graduate from Oxford University. “We want people who have quantitative skills, but a very open mind about the market data. If someone comes right from M.B.A. school, you have to get them to unlearn what they’ve learned about the right way of investing in markets.”“If I have to track the performance of our fund on a day-to-day basis, I do find it hard to be emotion-free,” Mr. Wong said. But, he added, “we really have to look at the data, and let the stats speak for themselves.”“Quite a lot of trades will fail, but over all, on average, we do have an edge, it just takes time” for it to become apparent, he said. “People can’t sit on the fence forever, and that’s the time we will profit: when people are coming back and putting their money on the table.”Analysts caution that the Man Group’s trading acumen cannot all be attributed to AHL.“The computer didn’t build itself,” said James Longsdon, an analyst with Fitch in London. “Clever minds went into building it.”'"

"'06-08-18,'1','Boeing published a survey of 3,200 airline passengers in April that seemed to indicate that the airborne Internet would soar in popularity. The survey found that 83 percent said Internet availability would have an impact on their future travel plans and choice of airline. Of those who actually used the service, called Connexion, 92 percent said they would recommend it.The problem, it seems, is that enthusiasm for the idea far exceeded the number of people who actually paid for the service.In announcing the project in 2000, Boeing predicted that the market for in-flight Internet access would be worth $70 billion over 10 years. But the company said Thursday that the number of passengers using the service on the 156 aircraft with 12 airlines amounted to little more than “low single digits” a flight. Boeing declined to say how much it cost to run the service.The cost to airline passengers is $9.95 an hour or $26.95 for an entire flight and revenue is shared between Boeing and the airlines.Lufthansa, which operates 62 aircraft using the system, said that the maximum number of passengers ever connected at one time was about 40 a flight, usually on routes to North America and Asia.“Given the usage level, we just didn’t see the kind of numbers that add up to a business,” said John Dern, a Boeing spokesman. “You could say it flew well technically, but it didn’t fly so well as a business.”Mr. Dern said that the shutdown was unrelated to the airport security alert in Britain last week, when laptops were not allowed on flights. But the difficulties faced by airlines after 9/11 have not helped, he said.Ken Dulaney at Gartner Research in San Jose, Calif., predicted that the system would rise again. “It seems clear to me there is a business there, just not the way Boeing built it,” he said. “There will be a fire sale of Boeing’s investments and then someone will take over this niche market.”“The biggest problem right now is that airlines can barely afford a new tire, much less a service like this,” Mr. Dulaney said.Airbus, Boeing’s biggest rival, seems to agree that Internet service on planes has a future.“We are full speed ahead with deploying wireless Internet on board our aircraft,” said Justin Dubon, an Airbus spokesman.Airbus plans to introduce its own Internet service with the delivery of the first of the giant A380’s to Singapore Airlines at the end of this year, Mr. Dubon said. The provider of the service, OnAir, is a joint venture of Airbus and SITA.Lufthansa offers Internet on several Airbus aircraft, but uses the Boeing system.Customers flying Airbus can expect the Internet to be a crucial part of their in-flight experience, Mr. Dubon said.“The possibilities are really endless once you put Internet in an aircraft,” Mr. Dubon said. “Passengers might be able to download films or even send a message to someone they see across the aisle.”For Lufthansa, Boeing’s imminent shutdown of the system is a problem.“We really want to continue offering this service, but right now we just don’t know how we will,” said Michael Lamberty, a spokesman for Lufthansa. “Fortunately, Boeing said the service will continue for several months, so perhaps we can find a solution.”'"
"'06-08-18,'1','A sharp drop in oil prices helped Wall Street extend its rally for a third session yesterday, with strong earnings from Hewlett-Packard also giving stocks a modest lift.Higher energy stockpiles and the continued cooling of Middle East tensions spurred the drop in crude futures. A barrel of light crude settled at $70.06, down $1.83, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Wall Street also welcomed a slight drop in the index of leading economic indicators, which helps to forecast future economic conditions. The index fell 0.1 percent in July after a 0.1 percent increase in June, suggesting that the economy could weaken in coming months. Investors are hoping for a modest slowdown in economic growth to keep inflation pressures at bay.Some of the day’s news was less encouraging, with slow sales at Sears Holdings dragging its stock down and other large retailers reporting slower sales. Yet investors remained enthusiastic after economic data Tuesday and Wednesday that showed a sharp drop-off in inflation risk.“Right now, as opposed to three weeks ago, you’ve got investors willing to buy on some good news, rather than simply not sell on good news,” said Chris Johnson, manager of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.'"
"'06-08-18,'1','Those complaining say that Dana ignored a provision of the bankruptcy law passed by Congress last year. That bill, whose main purpose was to make it easier for credit card companies to be repaid, also contained a section that was supposed to prevent companies from rewarding top executives with rich retention payments while others were suffering.To pay a retention bonus, the company must show that the executive is “essential to the survival of the business” and that he or she has a bona fide competing offer from another company offering at least the same pay. Even then, the law puts limits on the amount.There is no claim that Mr. Burns or his colleagues have other job offers, and some creditors heap scorn on the idea, questioning, in the words of a lawyer for one group of creditors, whether competitors are “actively seeking members of a management team that led Dana to financial distress.”The company evidently deems the new section of the law irrelevant, and figures that so long as it does not call a retention payment by that name, it can hand out big bonuses based on no more success than getting through the bankruptcy process, even if shareholders and creditors are wiped out.It wants the judge to bow to the business judgment of the company’s board. That would be the same board that doubled the company’s dividend a few days after hiring Mr. Burns in early 2004, two years before it filed for bankruptcy protection.Dana views it as unfair to blame Mr. Burns for the bankruptcy, and no one doubts the company faced real problems as its customers cut purchases and demanded to pay less while Dana’s costs were rising.But more is at stake than just how many millions will go to Mr. Burns, who declined an interview request. The issue is whether the new bankruptcy law will mean anything at all, or whether it will be another law that sounded good but was easily evaded.In a decision in the US Airways case last year, a bankruptcy judge in Virginia delayed a decision on retention and severance payments for top officers until after the case was concluded. He pointed to the new law, although it was not then in effect, and said it was a reaction to the “shady reputation” of executive retention plans in some bankruptcies.“All too often,” wrote Judge Stephen S. Mitchell, the plans “have been used to reward the very executives whose bad decisions or lack of foresight were responsible for the debtors’ financial plight.“But even when external circumstances rather than the executives are to blame,” the judge added, “there is something inherently unseemly in the effort to insulate the executives from the financial risks all other stakeholders face in the bankruptcy process.”Congress tried to do something about that. It is now up to the courts to decide whether it succeeded.'"

"'06-08-19,'0','In both of Nickelodeon’s new Sunday morning animated shows, a cartoon character cries — or leaks, anyway. On “Kappa Mikey,” virtual rivers run down the marsupial cheeks of a furry superhero. On “Shuriken School,” twin fountains spout from the eyes, or maybe the ears, of a fat, middle-aged sporting-goods store owner. In both cases, the cartoon creature has reason to weep, and the viewer has no impulse to sympathize.These gushers aren’t floods of emotion; they’re visual puns. If cartoons are one remove from reality, then anime, with its stylized exaggerations, is two. Like the shadow in Plato’s cave, it’s a refracted image of something that wasn’t exactly real to begin with. And the more fun it is to watch, the less you care about what you’re seeing.“Kappa Mikey,” an anime cartoon produced in the United States, which made its debut in February on the Nicktoons Network, now goes for a wider audience with a move to its parent network, Nickelodeon. (Episodes will continue to be shown on Nicktoons.) The hero of “Kappa” is Mikey Simon, a child actor from Ohio who, after winning a role on a hit Japanese TV show, must cope with culture clash and his innate nerdiness.This week’s episode, “Lost in Transportation” (titles are more clever than storylines), finds Mikey spurned by his four cast mates and befriended by a biker gang.The gang leader accosts Mikey: “You ain’t goin’ nowhere.” Immediately he’s chastised by an officer from the Grammar Police: “You ain’t goin’ anywhere.” This is almost as funny as the gang’s name: Chum. Chum as in shark bait, or as in buddies? Probably both. “Kappa” is all about ambiguity, but it also boasts a character named Guano. You’ve got to love a show that gets inspiration from bat excrement.'"

But I believe I’m going to be coming back.”PHILLIPS MAY MISS SEATTLE TRIP Give Andy Phillips credit for timing. Just when the Yankees needed an extra pitcher on their roster, Phillips strained a muscle in his rib cage Thursday and was placed on the disabled list before the game. The Yankees recalled reliever T. J.

We’ll just watch it for a couple of days.”Phillips was not sure if he would accompany the team to Seattle for the next leg of their trip. If he does, he might look up his friend Shaun Alexander of the Seahawks, the reigning N.F.L. most valuable player and a former classmate at the University of Alabama.When Phillips set the Alabama school record for career home runs, Alexander was at the game cheering for him.Phillips said a photograph of that moment, with Alexander in the background, is among his prized mementoes.'"

Woods drove so far to the left of the fairway that his ball was headed toward a village of white corporate tents. A spectator batted it back down into the rough, Woods chipped back onto the fairway and then made par after he hit a short-iron to 6 feet and made the putt.“I knew I got a weird hop,” Woods said of the fan’s assist. “Hey, I appreciate it. It’s nice to have Shaq out there knocking them back.”Woods did most of the difficult work on his own, though, hitting into trouble, scrambling back out, and making the tough shot look routine.Woods, Mickelson and Ogilvy will not play in the same group Saturday, which may not be a bad development for Mickelson. He flirted with tree stumps and gallery members for most of his round, hitting wild shots with his driver and loose shots with his irons.On the 191-yard, par-3 17th hole, Mickelson flew his tee shot into the crowd. It landed behind some spectators sitting behind the green. From there, Mickelson chipped onto the surface and missed a 6-foot putt for par. He is four over par on Medinah’s par-3 holes through two rounds.On the 18th hole, Mickelson drove into the left trees, an almost identical shot to the one that hastened his demise on his final tee shot at the United States Open in June, but he received a kinder kick back into the rough by the fairway this time.After Woods curled in his birdie putt, Mickelson responded with an 18-foot birdie of his own, minimizing the damage of an uneven day. Mickelson said he would spend the night watching film of his swing with his coach, Rick Smith.“My ball-striking has not been very good,” Mickelson said. “I’m only four back. I haven’t been able to get it going, but I’m fighting. I just have to get it turned around.”Ogilvy hit crisper, cleaner shots than both Woods and Mickelson and appeared unfazed by the electricity in the gallery. When Woods and Mickelson hit crooked shots, Ogilvy was often left alone by his ball in the fairway.“I’m pretty fortunate that I got to play with those guys,” said Ogilvy, calling the grouping a learning experience. “Their world is a bit different from my world. They can keep their world, but it’s fun for a few days.”Woods said of Ogilvy: “There is a reason why he’s the U.S. Open champion. Geoff is an extremely talented player, understands how to play major championship golf, and he’s getting the job done.”Stenson and Donald will represent Europe in the Ryder Cup next month, but they are bidding to win the continent’s first major championship since 1999. Andrade and Herron, two Ryder Cup hopefuls for the United States, could stamp their careers with a first major title.But most eyes will again will be on Woods, who will play Saturday with Riley, a childhood friend from their days in junior golf.After Woods finished his round and stood in the drizzle while conducting a television interview, Mickelson sidled up and held an umbrella over his head. The rivals laughed as Mickelson then pulled the umbrella away and tried to block the television camera.When Mickelson disappeared, Woods was in clear view again.'"
"'06-08-19,'0','Victoria Jackson Gray Adams, a key figure in the struggle by Mississippi blacks to win their political and civil rights in the 1960’s and the first woman to seek a seat in the United States Senate from her state, died last Saturday in Baltimore. She was 79.Her death was announced by her son, the Rev. Cecil Conteen Gray of Baltimore.Forty-two years ago, Mrs. Gray Adams, a teacher, door-to-door saleswoman of Beauty Queen cosmetics and leader of voter education classes from the hamlet of Palmers Crossing, on the edge of Hattiesburg, Miss., decided to take on Senator John C. Stennis, the Mississippi Democrat who at the time had been in the Senate for 16 years.In July 1964, she announced that she and others from the tiny Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party would challenge the power of the segregationist politicians, like Mr. Stennis, who represented her state. The time had come, she said, to pay attention “to the Negro in Mississippi, who had not even had the leavings from the American political table.”That decision became a turning point for the civil rights movement and for the Democratic Party, which for most of its history had been profoundly influenced by all-white delegations from the South. From Hattiesburg, the waves of the civil rights movement “swept quietly through the church world into politics,” the author Taylor Branch wrote in “Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years, 1963-65” (Simon & Schuster, 1998).Mrs. Gray Adams was defeated by a ratio of 30 to 1 in the Democratic primary, in part because Mississippi had effectively disenfranchised black voters. But the party she started and led went on to challenge the right of the all-white Mississippi delegation to represent her state at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City.'"

Her second term ends in January, and she is not running again; no Democrat is running to succeed her. Democrats are challenging Republicans in two of the five statewide offices this fall.'"
"'06-08-19,'0','SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 18 (Bloomberg News) — McAfee, the maker of antivirus software, has received a subpoena from a federal grand jury related to the firing of its former general counsel, Kent Roberts, over stock option grants.The grand jury in San Francisco sought information about Mr. Roberts and his options-related activities, McAfee, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said Friday in a regulatory filing. McAfee said it was cooperating with the investigation.McAfee said in May that it dismissed Mr. Roberts, less than two weeks after beginning an internal investigation into whether dates on options grants were chosen to inflate their value. The company found what it called an “improper” incident in 2000 that involved him.Early this week, McAfee said the inquiry showed that the improper grant would probably lead it to restate three years of earnings.A spokeswoman for McAfee, Siobhan MacDermott, declined to comment yesterday. Mr. Roberts, reached at a number provided by McAfee, declined to comment.'"
"'06-08-19,'0','The other day a song popped into my head, just a few up-tempo instrumental phrases — guitar, bass, drums and a Hammond B3 organ. I knew instantly what it was, though I hadn’t heard it in at least 20 years. It was a passing moment from “Martha’s Madman,” the first song on the first side of an LP called “The Jerry Hahn Brotherhood.” I bought the record when it was released in 1970. I was a freshman at Berkeley.It would have been easy to see the Jerry Hahn Brotherhood performing that year, though I never did. Its lone record was a sunny mixture of straight-up jazz with a blues spine, a music that wants the latter-day word “fusion,” though that word does so little good. Above all, it was a reminder of the eclecticism of the time. Audiences that would soon diverge found themselves packed in a hall together all night long, like one October weekend at Fillmore West when the Jerry Hahn Brotherhood shared the bill with Van Morrison and Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band.I heard “Martha’s Madman” in my head, and I did what I usually do. I went to the iTunes Music Store. Nothing. Same at Amazon. So I walked down to the barn, where all my old albums are stored, and dug out my vinyl copy of “The Jerry Hahn Brotherhood,” which is now sitting on my desk. I no longer have the equipment to play it. Nearly every album in those boxes in the barn was converted to CD long ago — some of them several times over. But not “The Jerry Hahn Brotherhood.”We live, of course, in an age of accelerating digital replication. Before long, it seems, every recording of every kind in existence, along with all the outtakes, will have been turned into a CD or a DVD or a digital file for download over the Internet. But some things get left behind.Digital conversion seems almost effortless, a virtual transcription of the world as we know it. But there is a financial friction to it nonetheless. These days it’s no longer necessary to produce an actual physical CD to sell in record stores. Downloadable files will do — no packaging required — but even making these has its costs.'"
"'06-08-19,'0','Justice Minister Haim Ramon said he would resign and face charges of sexual harassment lodged by a female soldier who had said Mr. Ramon forcibly kissed her in a government office last month. The announcement came a day after Menachem Mazuz, the attorney general, said he planned to indict Mr. Ramon, who is considered a close ally of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. The incident took place on July 12, the day Hezbollah staged a cross-border raid, igniting the fighting with Israel. “I am sure that I will succeed in court,” Mr. Ramon said in a statement. “A kiss of two, three seconds, based on the version of the complainant, cannot be turned into a criminal act.”'"
"'06-08-19,'0','But a surge in social unrest in recent years, including protests by people frustrated that they are unable to exercise their constitutional rights, has alarmed local and national leaders.Defense lawyers and legal scholars have also cooperated with one another and formed a nascent legal opposition. Mr. Gao and Mr. Chen are among an informal group of legal experts who consider themselves rights defenders. The moves to punish them may signal a broader effort to rein in legal protests.Mr. Gao was detained by the Beijing Public Security Bureau “for questioning related to his suspected involvement in criminal activities,” the official New China News Agency said in a two-line dispatch on its English-language news wire on Friday.The detention was not reported in Chinese by the agency or other state-run media. A spokesman for the Beijing police said he had no information about Mr. Gao’s case.Mr. Gao, 42, is a prominent defense lawyer and human rights crusader who was stripped of his license to practice law late last year. He has been under constant police surveillance and harassment since then.Until Tuesday, when he was detained while visiting relatives in Shandong Province, Mr. Gao remained openly combative. He issued sharply worded letters and statements denouncing official corruption and abuse of power and led a hunger strike to denounce persecutions of journalists and political opposition figures earlier this year.He rallied members of underground Christian churches and adherents of Falun Gong, an outlawed spiritual group, to assert themselves and press for greater freedoms.Mr. Gao has offended some other critics of one-party rule, who argued that his flagrant attacks on party leaders were self-aggrandizing and threatened to set back gradual progress toward legal and religious tolerance.But he has also been widely viewed as an international symbol of legal openness. Some opposition figures said the fact that he had been allowed to remain free despite his provocations indicated that officials under President Hu Jintao were reluctant to risk international opprobrium by arresting him.“This is a warning to rights activists all around the country that no one is too big to be punished,” Hu Jia, an opposition figure who is close to Mr. Gao and was himself put under house arrest last month, said in a telephone interview. “They are attacking the leading symbol of the movement to scare everyone else.”In a separate action, Shandong authorities held a two-hour criminal trial in Yinan County on Friday afternoon of Mr. Chen, 34, who taught himself the law despite being blind. The trial was marred by the detention of three of Mr. Chen’s legal advisers on Thursday.One of them, Xu Zhiyong, a Beijing legal scholar, was held in a local police station until Mr. Chen’s hearing concluded, members of Mr. Chen’s defense team said. None of Mr. Chen’s Beijing-based lawyers were permitted to attend the trial, defense lawyers said. The court permitted two local lawyers to defend him.Mr. Chen attracted international attention after he tried to organize a class-action suit last year on behalf of residents of the city of Linyi who had been forced to undergo abortions or sterilization in a campaign to meet population control quotas.Local Communist Party officials retaliated, putting Mr. Chen under house arrest and later charging him with destroying property and blocking traffic. His supporters say the charges are concoctions and that Mr. Chen was under police guard at the time the crimes were said to have occurred.There was no immediate verdict. The trial was postponed in July after Mr. Chen’s supporters had protested at the courthouse.Chen Guangfu, Mr. Chen’s elder brother, who attended the hearing, said Mr. Chen’s lawyers had argued that the prosecution relied mainly on secondhand accounts from local officials. The defense, he said, was not permitted to call witnesses.“It is difficult to accept that this was a fair trial if the defense cannot call witnesses to support its case,” Mr. Chen said.'"
"'06-08-19,'0','Microsoft nearly doubled its stock buyback, to $36 billion, after an initial invitation for shareholders to sell failed to generate enough interest.Investors tendered only $3.8 billion of shares at a price the company was willing to accept in a “Dutch auction” that expired Thursday night, missing a goal of $20 billion, Microsoft said yesterday. The company raised the buyback by $16 billion to try to make up the difference.Microsoft started the tender to support a share price that has fallen 10 percent in two years. The failure of the tender may still be a sign of optimism among investors who are expecting the stock to rise above the price Microsoft was offering.“Investors are figuring it’s worth more” than what Microsoft was offering, said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. For Microsoft, “it’s going to be a lot more expensive” with a buyback.Microsoft said on July 20 that it would seek to buy back $20 billion of its shares, or about 8 percent of the outstanding stock, for $22.50 to $24.75 each. The company said yesterday that shareholders had tendered 155 million shares, or 1.5 percent of the company’s stock, at $24.75 a share.The company completed a $30 billion stock buyback in June in half the time originally promised.'"
"'06-08-19,'0','VISITORS to this old whaling village may easily overlook the Annie Cooper Boyd House, an 18th-century bungalow tucked off Main Street behind a garden and among far more imposing early-19th-century homes, which are common here. A sign out front announcing the house stands at a 90-degree angle to Main Street and is hard to see except from the sidewalk.But the old summer cottage, filled with historical odds and ends from Sag Harbor and hundreds of paintings by Mrs. Boyd, an early-20th-century feminist and artist, is owned by the Sag Harbor Historical Society and has been open to the public on weekends for four years.This summer, the society completed the latest phase of a continuing restoration — financed by grants from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation — to replaster and paint the two parlors and the dining room downstairs. When the old plaster was removed, restorers found beams made from whole tree trunks, bark included.Last month, the society exhibited clothing from five generations of three related Sag Harbor families, donated after an old house in town was sold. On view this month are the eclectic and whimsical wooden figures of celebrities made by Bill Ball, a local artist who died last year, as well as his wooden images of local houses and paintings of downtown scenes.In turning the house from the home of Mrs. Boyd — and later her daughter, Nancy Boyd Willey — into a museum and exhibition space, the society decided to restore it according to the period in which Mrs. Boyd lived there, the first half of the 20th century.'"
"'06-08-19,'0','Handling disappointment (at the luncheonette, on the scales and at the polls) is a skill that Mr. Suozzi, the presumptive loser — if he faces facts — to Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in next month’s Democratic primary for governor, is acquiring on the fly. He has not lost a political campaign since he first ran, at age 29, for mayor of Glen Cove — a Suozzi-friendly office previously held by his father and an uncle. He went on to gain repute as a fiscal turnaround artist at the city and county levels.Now 43, he has three years left on his second term as county executive and vows not to seek a third, regardless of the outcome of his struggle against Mr. Spitzer.He is roughly 60 points behind in the polls and $12 million in arrears in campaign funds. So Mr. Suozzi’s road to the White House (you bet he wants to live there; he says any candidate for governor of New York who claims not to, as Mr. Spitzer has, is “disingenuous”) via the governor’s mansion looks like a dead end. His campaign is limping along on fumes, pixie dust and robust rhetoric that might be more robust if Mr. Spitzer cooperated and debated him again. No dice. Why give Mr. Suozzi, who exudes major charisma with his reform-a-rama platform, further exposure?Even Mr. Suozzi admits it’s a shrewd, if not democratic, strategy. He might as well be wearing a muzzle.So why does he, in his words, “soldier on”? Is he crazy, stubborn, possessed by a messianic complex? He does, when gesticulating, often end up with arms outstretched, minus the cross. “A messianic complex? Noooo,” he says between mouthfuls of soggy pie. “Stubborn, yes. I can be flexible, but I’m not flexible about this.“When I was younger, I needed to win. I still would like to win, but I don’t need to. I’m doing this because I believe I’m the best person for the job. To solve the problems people face in this state requires this type of battle to be fought and won.”Or lost. “A lot of people would love to see me quit, or would love to see me get crushed in this race and take great satisfaction in dancing on my grave. I’m not going to give them the satisfaction. I’m going to do everything I can to win. Or not get crushed. Losing the individual battle doesn’t mean you lose the war.”In early June, Mr. Suozzi contemplated surrender. His parents implored him not to quit the race. So did his three children. His wife had a different take: Sure, maybe he should quit, but if he did, he couldn’t live with himself, and if he couldn’t live with himself, neither could she.So he’s in. And remains a forward thinker, fully aware that Ronald Reagan served as president in his 70’s.Delayed gratification is better than none at all.'"
"'06-08-19,'0','The cuts will be most dramatic in Connecticut. The state is getting $13 million to distribute, down from $21 million, and state officials have decided to spend more on multitown emergency planning than on grants to municipalities. In Fairfield County, 23 municipalities will share $728,000 this year, down from more than $3 million in 2005.“Instead of giving everyone a smaller amount of money, we think we can get more benefit by going to a regional approach,” said Wayne E. Sandford, deputy commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security. So, for instance, the state will hire planners for a region, and they will assist the smaller towns.The only county in the region to get a grant larger than last year’s is Hudson County, N.J., which will receive $2.2 million, up from $2 million. The extra money came because New Jersey is trying to be more sophisticated in how it assesses risk, said Jack Burns, the coordinator of emergency management in Hudson, where Jersey City is located.“It’s a recognition of the fact that we have more risk,” he said, noting that the county has major transportation hubs, including the Lincoln, Holland and Amtrak Tunnels; an excess of chemical plants; and one of the densest urban populations in the nation.In New Jersey, cuts to counties will be softened by the fact that Jersey City, Newark and six counties around them will get extra money directly from the federal government under the same urban area program that serves New York City. In total, New Jersey will get about $52 million, or $8 million less than last year.Although the reduction in the amount of grant money to local governments has not generated the same level of controversy as it did when New York City faced budget cuts, local officials said that the level of spending was not sufficient to adequately protect government buildings, crowded beaches and chemical plants.“We can’t address all the things we want to address with this money,” Armando Fontoura, the Essex County sheriff, said. “We’re going to have to get creative and do it piecemeal.”Mr. Fontoura said the county was buying protective gear, such as masks and suits, for first responders, and some would probably have to do without for another year.With budget cuts, emergency-management officers say they are getting more sophisticated about how they spend the money.“We decided to look at what the risks are and, rather than buying toys, to minimize the risks,” Mr. Burns of Hudson County said. That means more money for security at sites that are considered potential targets, he said.In Nassau, where the money in previous years has been used to buy mobile command posts for the fire marshal, emergency management department and the county sheriff, some of the new grant money will be used for fences, cameras and other security at the county’s two water treatment plants, said Rick Bylicki, deputy commissioner for emergency management.“We do a lot of emergency exercises,” drilling first responders on how to handle large-scale emergencies, Mr. Bylicki said. “At Jones Beach, on a busy weekend, we might have a million people. We’ve done some planning on how to handle an anthrax attack there.”Exercises can be expensive, however, especially if they involve police overtime. “There will probably have to be a reduction on some of this,” Mr. Bylicki said.Many of the suburban counties have spent thousands of dollars on radios, and those purchases will continue, but at a slower pace. The communication problems among fire, police and emergency services departments that were apparent during rescue efforts after the World Trade Center attack also exist throughout the region.“We have concentrated heavily on communications,” said Joe Williams, commissioner of fire, rescue and emergency services in Suffolk County. “What we do is build on what we’ve done before, and we’re going to purchase more satphones and radios this year,” he added, referring to satellite phones.When violence broke out at a dance at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Morris County, N.J., in 2004, police had difficulty warning responding ambulances that there was potential danger in the area because their radios were not compatible.“We are using the bulk of the funding to buy radios for every police car, fire truck and ambulance in the county that will be able to operate the county system,” said Scott DiGiralomo, the deputy emergency management coordinator for Morris County. Morris will get $444,000 this year, down from $750,000. “This will extend that project a little longer before we reach the goal.”'"
"'06-08-19,'0','“We’re not critical of the service, but we believe a home in a residential zone is not an apt place for this facility,” he said. “Volunteers come and go. Parking is an issue. Twelve cans of garbage every pickup day; that can be hard on the neighbors.”The amended law, adopted July 11, bans animal hospices in residential zones but not in commercial districts.“The amendment was necessary because the town never had a category for animal hospices before,” Mr. Vecchio said. “Angel’s Gate will have to comply.”But Dan Dillon, a lawyer for the hospice, said he had appealed the zoning change and would sue the village if he loses. Mr. LaBruna said that more than 5,000 people had signed a petition asking the town not to amend its law to make the hospice illegal.“The town board says the hospice belongs in an industrial park, but why should Ms. Marino have to live in a warehouse?” Mr. Dillon said. “The amendment lumps the nonprofit hospice with money-making enterprises like veterinary clinics. But these are her pets, and there’s no legal limit on the number she’s allowed to have.”Mr. LaBruna said that he and Ms. Marino moved to Smithtown because the area was zoned for agricultural use and animals would be allowed.In May, Leonard and Shirley Samansky drove to Angel’s Gate from their home in Great Neck to see if it was the right place for their beloved but incontinent 17-year-old Jack Russell terrier, Sam.“There was no garbage, no odor, just happy, thriving animals and the magnificent people who care for them,” Mr. Samansky said.Today Sam is being cared for by Mr. LaBruna and Ms. Marino.“Angel’s Gate was never found to be operating illegally,” said Mr. Samansky, who is a lawyer and the mayor of the village of Saddle Rock. “What’s illegal is for the town to single them out and target them with a zoning change.”A few months before the Samanskys moved Sam, Ken Burke, who lives across the street from Angel’s Gate, joined with 10 neighbors and asked the town board for the zoning amendment.“It’s not an animal issue, it’s a business issue,” Mr. Burke said. “They’ve outgrown the facility. We want them moved.”Yvonne Lieffrig, the Smithtown town attorney, said the town was acting within its authority to make that happen. “The facility was never legal from the start,” she said.'"
"'06-08-19,'0','Industry analysts said Ford’s new cuts showed how urgently it must shift its model lineup to rely less on S.U.V.’s and pickups.“Ford cannot continue much longer without a radical change in its business model,” said John Casesa, an industry analyst with Casesa Strategic Partners. Both companies “have got to resize, restructure and reinvent themselves.”“This is only the resizing,” he said.The production cuts by Ford, which is the oldest of the major Detroit auto companies, will most deeply affect its F-series pickup truck, which has reigned as America’s best-selling vehicle for the last quarter-century and makes up 30 percent of company sales. The F-series will account for more than half the production cuts.“An unprecedented spike in gasoline prices during the second quarter impacted our product lineup more than that of our competitors because of the longstanding success of our trucks and S.U.V.’s,” Ford’s chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., wrote an e-mail message sent to employees. “This action, difficult as it is, reflects an assessment of the marketplace that is conservative and more aligned with the shift in customer demand.”That demand is favoring Ford’s Japanese competitors. Last month, Toyota passed Ford in monthly sales for the first time to rank as the second-biggest auto company in the American market (Ford is still ahead for the year).Because of the cuts, Ford said 10 plants in the United States and Canada would temporarily cease production at times through the end of the year, moves that will have a ripple effect on workers, car dealers and the communities where Ford builds vehicles.In all, Ford said it would cut 168,000 vehicles from its fourth-quarter production schedule, which is the equivalent of one point of industry market share. It is also cutting another 20,000 vehicles from its third-quarter plans, on top of previously announced cuts of 40,000 vehicles.The moves will have an immediate impact on the bottom line at Ford, which has already lost roughly $1.5 billion so far this year. Auto companies book vehicles as sold when they leave factories for dealers, not when they are purchased by consumers. Thus, production cuts eliminate the potential for revenue and profit.On Friday, the Standard & Poor’s rating service and Moody’s Investors Service said they were reviewing Ford’s credit ratings for possible downgrades. Both firms already rate Ford’s debt below investment grade.Bruce Clark, a senior vice president with Moody’s, said, “The truck and S.U.V. markets are falling out from under Ford much more quickly than it expected.’’Automakers generally make smaller, more incremental cuts in production to avoid the disruption of lengthy plant closings. Under union contacts, they must pay workers whether or not the factory is operating. The last time Ford made such draconian cuts was more than 20 years ago when it faced a financial crisis that nearly forced it to seek a Congressional bailout like the one that rescued the Chrysler Corporation in 1979.The automaker is making broad changes on a number of fronts.This summer alone, Ford halved its dividend, announced that its second-quarter loss was deeper than it originally expected, and hired a restructuring expert, Kenneth Leet, to advise Mr. Ford on whether to sell the foreign luxury car brands it owns, including Land Rover, Jaguar and Aston Martin.The moves coincide with an expanded role inside the company for Mr. Ford. Since July 1, he has served as Ford’s de facto chief operating officer, the first time he has directed its day-to-day functions in addition to his jobs as chief executive and chairman.In January, Mr. Ford announced the initial phase of the Way Forward plan. It called for Ford to eliminate 30,000 jobs through 2012 and close 14 factories.That plan, criticized by some analysts as inadequate, did not take into account the prospect of continued $3- a-gallon gasoline.In July, Detroit automakers collectively held just 52 percent of the American market, the lowest ever, while Asian companies took 42 percent, their biggest share ever.On Friday, Ford officials contended that no one in the industry could have anticipated that gasoline prices would remain so high, even though gas prices have been climbing since 2003 and spiked last year after Hurricane Katrina.George Pipas, Ford’s chief sales analyst, noted that pickup truck sales last year were flat compared with 2004. He said the company noticed a softening in truck sales only this April. But the decline since then has been swift. Sales of the F-series pickup fell 46 percent in July, compared with 2004, while sales of the Ford Explorer S.U.V. dropped more than 50 percent last month.Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors, said Friday that he did not anticipate making production cuts as deep as Ford’s, but he did not rule out some minor adjustments. He noted that G.M.’s planned production level for the third quarter was lower than a year ago to compensate for slower sales.“Our inventories are in good shape,” he told reporters Friday at a diner along Woodward Avenue in Royal Oak, which has been jammed throughout the week with thousands of classic cars for the Dream Cruise.Mr. Wagoner said that G.M. had many newer models that were selling well despite the higher gas prices and that he believed that the company’s new line of full-size pickups, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, would not suffer a significant drop-off because many buyers need a truck for work.“The fuel-price situation has been a little surprising to everyone — certainly to us,” he said. “We’re all moving to react to that.”Analysts disputed Ford’s contention that the high gas prices could not have been foreseen. “They might say nobody could see it coming; well, nobody but everyone in the world,” said James P. Womack, co-founder of the Lean Enterprise Institute, which studies manufacturing efficiency.“The whole deal in Motown,’’ he continued, “has been a hope and a prayer that interest costs would stay low, fuel costs would stay low and the Japanese would show some restraint.”Auto companies certainly cannot be expected to predict gasoline prices precisely. Because of that, Mr. Casesa said, their manufacturing operations need to be flexible so that they can shift from one type of vehicle to another without having to idle entire factories.Flexibility has become a hallmark of Japanese companies, particularly Toyota, which has plants in the United States that are able to turn out cars, minivans, sport utilities and pickup trucks — sometimes three different kinds of vehicles on the same assembly line.Both G.M. and Chrysler are scurrying to make their factories more flexible, and Ford insists flexibility will be a hallmark of the Way Forward program. It has been led by Mark Fields, who was named the company’s president for the Americas last fall.Mr. Fields, previously assigned to Ford’s operations in Europe, had only a few weeks to draw up the original Way Forward plan, and has repeatedly said that the program needs to be modified as circumstances change.Now, Mr. Casesa said, Mr. Fields is under pressure to make sure his next version is on target. Otherwise, his job will be in jeopardy. “Fields has already had his free pass,’’ Mr. Casesa, “and now he’s on the hot seat to announce a great plan and implement it.”Mr. Womack said he was concerned about the long-term prospects for Ford, which was founded by Mr. Ford’s great-grandfather, Henry Ford I, in 1903.“There is a tragic element here or at least a bit of pathos,” Mr. Womack said. “You just have the feeling that all the air is going out of all four tires as well as the spare. You’re in a time of discontinuity and a sea change is at hand.”Still, Ford can count on many true believers among its customers. Bill Deater, a farmer who lives near Port Huron, Mich., said Ford would overcome its rough times and rise again. He is a loyal Ford buyer and took his bright red 1948 Ford F-1 pickup to suburban Detroit this week for the Dream Cruise. His wife drives a 1966 Mustang convertible, and the couple also own a newer Ford Expedition and an F-250 pickup truck.“A lot of people in Michigan depend on them,” Mr. Deater said. “I think they can recover.”'"
"'06-08-19,'0','IF things are miserable for America’s new-car dealers, can a recession be averted? History says it cannot and suggests a downturn may have already begun.The accompanying chart shows the rate of change in sales by new-car dealers, comparing the most recent 12 months with the 12 months before that; it is adjusted for inflation. The rule — unveiled here for the first time — is that if the figure is down 2 percent or more, a recession is either under way or set to begin within a few months. The figure fell to a negative 2.4 percent when June sales figures were released last week by the Census Bureau.The available data go back to 1968, a period in which the American economy has recorded six recessions. The “dealer doldrums indicator,” as we will call it, called five of them, missing the 1981-82 recession only because it was not persuaded that the 1980 downturn had ever ended. It has never warned of a recession that did not occur.The risk of using 12-month figures is that by the time bad news is clear from new-car sales, it can be overwhelmingly obvious from other economic indicators. But such long periods avoid the possibility of false readings because of the volatility of new-car sales.The chart measures all sales by new-car dealers, which is how the retail sales statistics report the data. So it includes their revenue from used-car sales, parts and service. But it does not include sales by dealers who sell only used cars or repair garages that are not also car dealers.'"
"'06-08-19,'0','• Under the circumstances, that first-inning run and all the subsequent damage done by Damon were plain-as-day reminders of what the Yankees gained and the Red Sox lost by the Damon defection.If hitting the triple to the area of Fenway where the Damon legend grew like the whiskers on his formerly unshaved face wasn’t enough, Johnny-be-gone hit a two-run homer to right field in the fifth inning for a 3-1 lead. He added a crafty sliding catch in the sixth to keep the Red Sox from tying the score against Chien-Ming Wang before the Yankees blew it open, and he had a salt-in-the-wound two-run single in the ninth.He continued to burn Crisp and the Red Sox at night, with three more hits — including a bases-loaded flare that Crisp reached with a dive, but dropped — and a two-run homer against the rookie Jon Lester. Poor Crisp, who couldn’t buy a hit in the first game and couldn’t match Damon in the field either. He did not exactly validate the decision by Theo Epstein and associates to make center field the starting point of a thorough makeover that has rendered their lineup unrecognizable from 2005.Who could have predicted last summer, when Manny Ramírez was being shopped before the trading deadline, that one year later, he would be the only regular field player left standing?The infield is new. Javy López is the recently acquired replacement for the injured catcher, Jason Varitek. Eric Hinske brought his lefty bat from Toronto yesterday, ripped three straight doubles off a less-than-exemplary Wang and was practically feted before his fourth at-bat — he struck out against Scott Proctor — as if he were Yaz.The names and faces undergo a startling turnover every summer now — in Boston and New York and, come to think of it, just about everywhere — but nobody has made an impact on the rivalry this season the way Damon has. And nobody will. Not Josh Beckett, who pitches this afternoon against Randy Johnson. Not Bobby Abreu, who smacked hits all over the ballpark behind Damon and Jeter in his baptism of Red Sox-Yankees fire.No one will do what Damon has done to alter the dynamic, in part because the Red Sox haven’t replaced the intangibles that shaped their identity.“He’s got his own demeanor, his own attitude toward the game,” said Jeter, who wouldn’t admit under hypnosis that his M.V.P.-worthy season has anything to do with being permanently stationed in the No. 2 hole, behind Damon.“I don’t care where I hit,” Jeter said. “I was never one to go up there taking pitches when I was leading off.”That said, consider the damage that Damon and Jeter have done in tandem with their versatility, their big-moment mentality. When the Red Sox finally retired Damon in an important spot — with the bases loaded and one out in the seventh inning of the night game — Jeter promptly hit his bases-clearing double against Mike Timlin. Together, they have driven in 141 runs, Damon getting seven runs batted in in the doubleheader, Jeter the bailout three last night and one more in the early game. They left stunned Red Sox fans to boo the home team the way they did Damon.Damon admitted that his first trip here this season — when he saluted the fans by waving his cap — was an emotional experience. Now it is business. The fans curse him and show him their middle fingers. “It is what it is,” he said.• When he batted in the third inning of Game 1, the scoreboard reported Damon “went 3 for 6 with two home runs and 6 runs batted in against NYY in Game 7 of the 2004 ALCS.” There were only boos. That was then. This was now.Hard feelings are bound to linger when the Evil Empire surges forward at Fenway, led by the erstwhile Idiot of Red Sox Nation. The long weekend began yesterday afternoon and continued into late night and early morning. The second time became the longest nine-inning game in major league history. The series is less than half over, and already it feels like forever for the Red Sox.'"

"'06-08-20,'0','Friday night’s performance of Bertolt Brecht’s “Mother Courage and Her Children” began about 8 p.m. at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. David Suker showed up about 8:45 p.m. He was not late. He was early.Mr. Suker, 38, was the first person in line for tickets to the next night’s performance. He had a long wait ahead of him — some 16 hours before the theater would hand out the free tickets — but he had his blue air mattress and its battery-powered pump, a bottle of seltzer, a sleeping bag, a lantern and his Army training.Why did he wait so long? The political nature of the play — a 17th-century drama starring Meryl Streep as a resourceful mother who profits from a war that ultimately claims her children — appealed to him. But really, he said, he did it for a woman. They had a date planned for last night, and he figured what better way to impress her than with two tickets to one of the most popular shows in the city.“I thought it was a romantic thing to do,” said Mr. Suker, who teaches G.E.D. classes.It was about five minutes after 1 p.m. yesterday when Mr. Suker was handed two purple tickets (section C, row A, seats 107 and 108) for last night’s performance. He was thrilled, but did not feel like celebrating. He was looking forward to going back home to the Bronx to take a nap.Nothing is free in New York. Not even free theater.Scores of New Yorkers who have seen “Mother Courage and Her Children” since the play began Aug. 8 have paid to see it, not with dollars and cents, but with a good night’s rest. The Shakespeare in the Park play, presented by the Public Theater, has created a kind of theatergoers’ endurance test, as people like Mr. Suker camp out overnight 24 hours before Ms. Streep steps onstage, hoping to get a ticket for one of the theater’s 1,872 seats. The show runs through Sept. 3.The first person got in line for the show’s opening night the day before the performance, at 3 p.m. Tickets are also distributed at the Public Theater office at 425 Lafayette Street, and the first person lined up there for the opening-night show at 10:30 the night before. Some were fans of Ms. Streep. Some were New Yorkers who wait in line every summer for the free Shakespeare in the Park performances. Still others just wanted to make sure they get a seat.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','“Sometimes I shake my head and laugh at myself. There’s nothing I can do about it.”A concussion is a shaking of the brain that causes chemical changes. Athletes sustain an estimated 300,000 of them nationwide each year, according to the Sports Concussion Program at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Most recover fully, but experts believe a person who sustains one concussion is more vulnerable.Repeated trauma to the brain can result in cognitive and neurological disabilities, and even death.“With a single concussion, you’re going to recover,” said Dr. Micky Collins, assistant director of the University of Pittsburgh concussion center, where Matheny has been treated. “The problem is, when you have a concussion and undergo these chemical changes, you’re a lot more vulnerable if you have a second before the first one is recovered.”While comparatively rare in baseball, concussions have ended celebrated careers in other sports. The N.F.L. quarterbacks Troy Aikman and Steve Young eventually had to quit after too many concussions. So did the N.H.L. stars Pat LaFontaine and Mike Richter.Catchers are not the only baseball players susceptible to concussions.St. Louis Cardinals center fielder Jim Edmonds, whose postconcussion syndrome was diagnosed Wednesday, has had bouts of dizziness and blurred vision since crashing into a wall in Chicago on June 21.Matheny’s plight has others in the close-knit fraternity wondering when a foul tip, errant swing or collision may sideline them. Or, worse yet, end their careers, suddenly a distinct possibility for Matheny.The Padres’ Mike Piazza pointed to several dents and dings on his mask from where he had been hit in the head this season by either a ball or a bat. He considers himself lucky.“Catchers do receive the brunt of the head injuries. I’ve had minor vertigo in game situations,” said Piazza, who estimated that he has had four or five concussions over the years. He was also hit in the head by a pitch from Roger Clemens.“Fortunately for me, it hasn’t affected my playing, but it could. You get a little lethargic. Your reflexes aren’t as quick and you get dazed.”A ball can come off a bat at a greater velocity than a pitched one, and some pitchers throw fastballs approaching 100 miles an hour. Catchers compare the impact to being punched in the face.Matheny, who turns 36 next month, uses the hockey-style mask preferred by some catchers for its better sight lines, and he was initially convinced it contributed to his concussion. But the Giants enlisted two testing centers to compare the impact resistance of the hockey mask to the traditional catcher’s mask — and, so far, they appear to offer similar protection.Around baseball, opinions vary on the traditional-versus-hockey-mask debate.“Personally, I don’t like the new mask,” said Arizona Diamondbacks Manager Bob Melvin, a former catcher who had one concussion while in the minors. “I don’t think it absorbs the blow like the other ones. I’m concerned with the blows these guys are taking.”“Jason has taken hits on his mask that have bent the mask,” Larry Davis, the Athletics’ trainer, said. “There are a lot of hazards involved. They called catching gear for years the tools of ignorance.”Piazza uses a specially ordered mask that looks like a traditional mask but is heavier.“It protects me a lot better,” he said. “I’ve never sustained an injury because of a foul tip. You can’t protect everything. You’d be like a knight in shining armor.”Boston’s Jason Varitek will never forget a Class AA game in which Kevin Polkavich clobbered him at the plate and bent his mask. Varitek got the out and stayed in the game, despite seeing spots.He was woozy for a week and had a constant headache, but he never saw a doctor.Kendall, who during his career has caught more than 140 games in a season seven times, estimated that he had had seven concussions in 11 big-league seasons. One came when Gary Sheffield barreled into him at home plate in the late 1990’s at Dodger Stadium.“I ended up going to the hospital with a Grade II concussion,” he said. “I was in la-la land.”After going on the disabled list, Matheny became frustrated because he was incapable of focusing on his most basic daily duties, including sitting down with pitchers to study opposing hitters.Eventually, he left the team. He now spends most of his time back home in Chesterfield, Mo.“Some days,” he said, “doing absolutely nothing at home, I feel good.”But when Matheny exerts himself through physical activity, even minor household chores, the symptoms can reappear.Despite their frequency, it can be difficult to determine the severity of concussions. CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging tests can reveal bleeding, but they fail to show how a brain is functioning.“We’ve learned more about concussions in the past five years than the previous 50,” said Collins, of the University of Pittsburgh concussion center. “It wasn’t long ago that it was smelling salts and, ‘How many fingers am I holding up?’ ”Collins’s concussion center developed a computerized test called ImPACT that puts the brain to work and derives data about points of trauma — measuring attention, memory, processing speed and reaction time.“How can you manage something if you can’t measure it?” Collins said. “It’s one of those things where this type of evaluation is important.”Some hockey and football teams, Nascar and European soccer and rugby clubs also use that test to better determine the severity of brain injuries.Major league umpires now undergo brain testing before each season, and Matheny is determined to help bring such testing to baseball.But that will require some change in what Varitek called the “cowboy mentality” among major league catchers.Some catchers say they welcome steps to learn more about concussions.“I think baseball has become a little bit more hip to it,” Varitek said. “Trainers are more hands-on, and teams aren’t as apt to run their guys out there for 130 or 140 games.“Perceptions are changing, and that’s important. Ultimately it’s not about baseball, it’s about life.”'"
"'06-08-20,'0','The overall stock market rose every day last week, while a surge in Microsoft shares on Friday propelled the Nasdaq composite index to its best weekly gain in more than three years.A series of government and private reports suggested that economic growth was slowing and that inflation was moderating — contributing to a bullish mood in the stock market.

"'06-08-20,'0','In the case of AARP, the people on the business side of the magazine are actually part of a for-profit unit within the organization, while the editors of the magazine work in the main no-profit zone. Go figure.There are similar set-ups at the magazines Smithsonian and National Geographic and their parent groups. The Smithsonian has lately attracted attention over whether its business ventures are straying too far from its museum mandate and over the eye-popping salaries its top administrators and editors have drawn.Consumers Union, by contrast, is entirely nonprofit and it eschews any business relationships — in particular, selling advertising in its magazines or Web sites — that could call the integrity of its vaunted product ratings into question.AARP bills itself as the “world’s largest circulation magazine,” and it is true by a wide margin because of the expanding base of boomer readers as well as the organization’s focus on people who are interested in what James H. Fishman, the group publisher of AARP The Magazine, calls “living your life better after 50.”Six times a year, the magazine is shipped to 22 million homes representing 37 million AARP members. They receive the magazine as part of their $12.50 annual membership, which also gets them a regular bulletin. The magazine is even segmented among three editions — 50’s, 60’s and 70-plus — to make it more helpful to readers and marketers.In the new issue, Ms. Field graces all three covers. But, for instance, the 50’s edition has a special report to “Add 10 (Healthy) Years to Your Life.” The other two covers are less specific, instead promising readers “Amazing Secrets” to “Live Longer.” For whatever reason, an article on Eugene Levy gets a blurb on the 50’s cover, while Ann-Margret and Sir Richard Branson get mention on the 60’s and 70’s versions.So what kind of business does this add up to? AARP, according to the financial statements of its parent organization, increased advertising revenue by 37 percent, to $106 million, in 2005, from $77.6 million in 2003. Just as important, the magazine plays a central role in promoting AARP and affiliated products like insurance, from which the organization makes $300 million a year in royalties. Then there is $84 million in federal and other grants, as well as $55 million in contributions. This, of course, is not the sort of thing that shows up on the ledgers at Time Inc. or Meredith.According to the Publishers Information Bureau, ad pages at AARP The Magazine were up 13.6 percent during the first seven months of 2006, when the industry over all was basically flat, compared with the same period of 2005. The September-October issue with Ms. Field on the cover is, at 140 pages, the biggest the company has published for the 50’s category — the back cover is a beer ad, for Michelob Ultra, and Mr. Fishman said cosmetics companies in particular had fueled the magazine’s growth.“We don’t do anything that does not first respond to our social impact agenda,” Mr. Fishman said, but he added that any magazine needed to be entertaining to succeed. “Information like this can’t be a pill.”A similar ethos guides the publisher of Consumer Reports. Despite its disdain for advertising and the growth of all kinds of user-generated ratings for products saturating the Internet, readers apparently value the $60 million a year the magazine spends at its 400-acre site in Yonkers, N.Y., on buying and testing products.And — here’s what has the for-profit crowd salivating — in the last three years, the number of subscribers to consumerreports.org has doubled, to 2.43 million, a vast majority of whom are paying $26 a year to gain access to the organization’s database and archive. John Sateja, senior vice president for information products at Consumer Reports, said that only 500,000 or so of the Web’s subscribers were also subscribers to the print magazine — and they pay $19.95 for the Web site on top of their print subscriptions.The magazine, meanwhile, has managed to slowly increase its print sales both via subscription and newsstand in recent years, and now counts 4.3 million sales per issue, up from 3.8 million in 2003. A few weeks ago, the company added a new magazine, ShopSmart, to its lineup. Basically, it is a breezier version of Consumer Reports for busy female shoppers, aimed squarely at mainstream shopping magazines like Lucky from Condé Nast and Shop Etc. from Hearst. Unlike those magazines, which practically celebrate the mix of editorial and advertising, ShopSmart promises no ads and “no hype.”OF course, the accepted business models of publications like Lucky and even many newspapers make me question whether we live in a blurry age when readers would really feel that paid product plugs in Consumer Reports would really spoil the broth. Mr. Sateja said the company did poll its readers on that question and the response remained adamantly ad-averse. “As far as working for a nonprofit, the one refreshing thing is that we basically always try to do the right thing,” he said. “We are concerned about the consumer — we’re not only about profits.”And yet, business has never been better. Before print media start falling holus-bolus into the arms of circling private-equity owners, maybe they ought to look into this whole not-for-profit thing.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','THE placid lawns of Peter Cooper Village did not look much like a battlefield last week. A few silver-haired residents, some with walkers, chatted on park benches, while others read large-print novels.But the scene at Peter Cooper, a 21-building housing complex on First Avenue between 20th and 23rd Streets, represents the aftermath of a hard-fought two-year conflict over the landlord’s plan to replace building keys with electronic key cards bearing tenants’ photographs. The legal fight came to an end last month when a State Supreme Court justice ruled that the landlord, MetLife, could require use of the key cards. Tenants of seven Peter Cooper buildings were recently told that their metal keys would no longer work after Sept. 12, with the other buildings soon to follow.But the hostilities are not over — they have moved to a different, and bigger, arena. City Councilman Daniel Garodnick, who lives in Peter Cooper Village and like some other tenants criticizes the key-card system as an invasion of privacy, introduced a bill in June to, among other things, require landlords using such systems to purge the accumulated data every 30 days.“Our view is that you shouldn’t have to disclose to your landlord who your friends are and who’s watering your plants,” Mr. Garodnick said. “There’s clearly a movement to make entry systems electronic. What I’m trying to do is make some reasonable limitation on the data that comes out of those systems.”Mr. Garodnick, who has 31 co-sponsors for his bill in the 51-member Council, hopes that a hearing on it will be held this fall.'"

That’s what the Congressional Research Service, Congress’s nonpartisan public policy research arm, explored in a recent study.As the study notes, the Defense Department recently put the “burn rate” — a term for the sums being spent — for Iraq and Afghanistan at $6.8 billion a month. But as the study says, that excludes maintaining and replacing equipment or building and improving facilities. The official “burn rate,” it concludes, is only about 70 percent of the true cost.For fiscal 2006, monthly costs for Iraq alone could hit $8 billion, the study projected.The study found a bit of surprising news: that the cost of feeding troops in Iraq fell in fiscal 2005 to $1.2 billion from $2 billion, despite comparable troop levels. No, we have not cut rations. The change may simply reflect success at reducing costs, the study says.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','Ken Diamondstone, a small developer in Brooklyn, deserves a lot of credit. He’s running against State Senator Marty Conner, a long-term incumbent who also happens to be a lawyer specializing in election law. Mr. Conner has long been the go-to man for politicians who want to get pesky challengers off the ballot. Naturally, Mr. Diamondstone faced weeks of challenges at the Board of Elections and in court.The party establishment dislikes real elections, and prefers to bump competitors out of the race—either through their control over local boards of elections or with judges handpicked by those same party leaders. This year, one candidate was told the board mysteriously “lost” her petitions from voters. Another, Terence Park in Queens, had to go outside the county to find judges who agreed that a tiny mistake should not disqualify him.With that dismal history in mind, these are our endorsements in some of the upcoming primary elections for state legislature:State Senate District 25 (Williamsburg and Sunset Park in Brooklyn): Miraculously, a Brooklyn judge ruled that Mr. Diamondstone should be on the ballot, giving the district an actual race. He does not have a strong record of accomplishments, and Senator Connor is something of an Albany institution. But Albany needs change, not institutions. We recommend voting for Mr. Diamondstone to send a message that business as usual must stop.Assembly District 22 (Downtown Flushing in Queens): This vibrant neighborhood, with a strong Asian-American community, has a three-way race to succeed Assemblyman Jimmy Meng, who is retiring. The strongest candidate is Ellen Young, a protégé of City Councilman John Liu, who is establishing himself as a political force in Queens. Mr. Park, who was forced to work so hard to get on the ballot, is a worthy candidate but his concerns are better suited to the City Council. And Julia Harrison, a former councilwoman, has a troubling anti-immigrant record that disqualifies her from representing such a diverse area. We endorse Ms. Young and take her at her word that she will be a fighter in Albany.Assembly District 74, (Lower East Side to Midtown East in Manhattan): When Sylvia Friedman won a special election in February, she raised hopes that as a known local activist, she would be an advocate for change in the Democratic-controlled Assembly. But it seems that she is sliding too easily under the party leaders’ sway. For that reason, we endorse her opponent Brian Kavanaugh, a dynamic and thoughtful candidate who has worked for two former mayors, Ed Koch and David Dinkins, and for City Councilwoman Gale Brewer.Assembly District 57 (Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Prospect Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn): Hakeem Jeffries, a bright and eloquent young lawyer, did such a good job of challenging outgoing Assemblyman Roger Green a few years ago that Mr. Green’s colleagues in Albany rearranged this district to carve out the Jeffries’ home. Now Mr. Green has moved on and Mr. Jeffries has moved into the district so that he could try again.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','“For all my initial cynicism,” he ultimately acknowledges, “I came to the rather startling conclusion that by this standard, investment banking is about the best job in the world.” Indeed, he says, “although I liked to think of myself as the consummate outsider I had, over time, quietly adopted the values of the industry of which I had been a part.”Though Mr. Knee pursued a joint graduate program in business and law, at Yale and Stanford, he regarded his M.B.A. as merely a “door prize,” not a ticket to a career. His next six years were variously spent as a Washington lobbyist and an aide-de-camp for an airline executive. Then he heard from a former classmate who was working at Goldman Sachs. Feeling that he had nothing to lose, and a minimum of $225,000 to gain, Mr. Knee took the bait.A complete greenhorn, Mr. Knee had trouble getting other bankers to take him seriously. When he landed a plum assignment, which involved jetting from London to Hong Kong, the client was in Singapore, and appeared only on an overhead screen, leaving Mr. Knee feeling like a “minor character in a James Bond movie.” But he paid his dues, and gradually his stock rose.His tale is studded with arresting details, like his description of the process for setting bankers’ pay, and with often-trenchant insights. He explains that bankers rarely make good investors because they are mostly glorified salesmen; their job is over “once the deal closes.”In contrast to Wall Street’s short-term mind-set, Mr. Knee says he strove to develop a group of clients he could keep and nurture. Yet, frustrated at Goldman, he exited after only a few years for a rival, Morgan Stanley. By 2000, Wall Street was giddy with technology and Mr. Knee, a media specialist, was pulling down $3.25 million a year. Then came the bust, and he had the difficult task of deciding whom to sack.“There was no easy or obvious way to rank by pure merit,” he remarks in a typically acute observation. Then Mr. Knee himself was pushed aside, and he departed for a smaller firm.The author fancies himself an anchor in the storm, an avatar of old-fashioned “relationship banking.” He yearns to be an adviser in the style of Sidney J. Weinberg, the legendary Goldman executive who was so mindful of his clients’ interests that he refused to let the firm represent more than one business in any industry. (So devoted was Mr. Weinberg to his role of trusted confidant that, in 1956, when taking the Ford Motor Company public, he refused to set a fee in advance. After the deal closed, he told the Ford family that it could reward him with whatever fee it deemed proper.)Mr. Knee’s subtitle, “Inside the Decade That Transformed Wall Street,” suggests that relationship banking died on his watch, but actually its demise has been long in the making. Ever since the 1970’s, investment bankers have been trained to peddle products — like mergers — to their various clients, rather than to strictly serve their clients’ interests, and banker-client relationships have steadily withered.By the time Mr. Knee arrived on the scene, in 1994, relationship banking was already an anachronism. There is a telling scene in which he visits a client, R. H. Donnelley, with a deal completed — pending word from Morgan Stanley that the firm would provide financing. Mr. Knee keeps running to the “bathroom” to call his office, without success. The client begins to get anxious.Finally, ducking out yet again, Mr. Knee screams at a banker — in bathroom language, if you get my drift — that headquarters has left him in a highly compromised position. It’s too little, too late; Mr. Knee loses the deal. He concludes that the premise of relationship banking — that the banker can deliver his firm to the client — is, sadly, no longer true.I WOULD have preferred that Mr. Knee not have taken so many cheap and often gratuitous shots. To cite one example, he says that a prominent banker, whom he names, is given to “occasional flatulence.” Well, who isn’t? And he burdens us with much inside politics, during which Mr. Knee seems to be settling personal scores.Finally, given that he barely seems to stay in a job past his bonus, one wonders what qualifies him as an expert on relationships. When he observes of West, a private publishing client, that its “culture of secrecy was pervasive,” I must, on the late Mr. Weinberg’s behalf, protest. Do relationship bankers kiss and tell? These quibbles aside, give Mr. Knee credit for a penetrating look at his craft and for observing that, in trying to advise their clients, bankers occasionally do some good.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','IT’S the end of an era at the New York Stock Exchange. One of the most enduring personalities in the exchange’s 213-year history has left the building.As the exchange became a publicly traded company in March through a merger with Archipelago Holdings, budget items for amenities like the exchange’s tailor and coatroom attendants were cut. And after 43 years of service, the exchange’s barber, Gerardo Gentilella, known as Jerry the Barber, no longer offers $8 haircuts and a smile in his basement barbershop under the central trading room.June 30 was his final day of work. Under the current chief executive officer, John Thain, the exchange chose not to renew his contract, which included a $24,000-a-year subsidy.Mr. Gentilella’s request for an extension on his contract until the end of the year, so he could work through the holiday tip season, was also denied. The stock exchange declined to comment on the matter.Mr. Gentilella, who is 75 and was born near Naples, Italy, began cutting hair at the exchange’s barbershop soon after his arrival in New York in the early 1960’s. Despite the varied styles that have come and gone since — the long sideburns of the 1970’s, the Gordon Gekko slick-back of the 1980’s, the George Clooney Caesar cut of the 1990’s — Mr. Gentilella was never one to accommodate trends.“I did not do any of that,’’ he said. “People came to me for classic cuts, and for 43 years, that’s what I did.”'"
"'06-08-20,'0','Thomas L. Friedman’s analysis of the effect of oil prices on Middle Eastern politics (“War on Daddy’s Dime,” column, Aug. 18) is right on the money. Iranian taxpayers are just suckers to subsidize their Middle Eastern client states and political proxies Hamas and Hezbollah.This brings up the sore point for the taxpayer in the United States, which has for many years now been running trade and fiscal deficits with the rest of the world, but continues to operate as if it were a center of world financial and economic resources.How much more of a sucker does it make us, to subsidize the government of Iraq, with blood and treasure we can ill afford, in order to protect the Saudis from a 16-year-old attack by Saddam Hussein on Kuwait, at our expense?Thomas L. Friedman is right to be obsessed with the price of oil. We should all be so obsessed.Reducing our dependency on and subsequent cost of this product is a triple win: For foreign policy wonks, it lessens the influence and importance to us of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Nigeria, all areas that are either unstable, or hostile to America.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','THE clever little Smart car has been a cult favorite — though a perennial money loser — in Europe since its debut eight years ago. Americans who have seen them on the streets of Geneva, London and Paris have been left wondering why such adorable cars, originally a joint venture of Daimler-Benz and the watchmaker Swatch, are not yet available at dealers in the United States.The short answer is: lots of reasons. Unfavorable exchange rates are one hangup, but others, like a lack of federal certification for exhaust emissions and safety, are being addressed now, and the Smart is finally coming to the United States. Sort of. Probably. Soon.DaimlerChrysler, Smart’s parent, had planned to bring Smart’s full line here in 2005. Just before the introduction, it was called off.In June, DaimlerChrysler announced that it would bring the next generation of the Smart ForTwo coupe to the United States in 2008. But a check of the new Smart Car of America Web site reveals a more pessimistic time frame: “The plain and simple truth regarding purchasing a Smart car is that there will not be adequate amounts available through normal channels for several years.”The Web site suggests that those who just can’t wait should buy a Smart from one of several unofficial importers. Prices range from $25,000 to $35,000. Or you can pay $55 to sign up for something called the Exclusive Client Waiting List.The company already has a name for these early customers: Smart Americans. When Smart Car of America does start selling its own cars, distribution will be handled by UnitedAuto Group, a dealership chain, not Mercedes-Benz dealers as first planned. Dave Schembri, a former Mercedes executive who was in charge of the canceled 2005 introduction, has been hired to select 30 to 50 new dealers.'"

"'06-08-20,'0','Racism is a touchy subject on Long Island, as anywhere. But while people may argue about the existence or extent of racial steering and discrimination, segregation here is a fact, easily confirmed by checking Census data or simply by traveling around the Island and watching, say, as school lets out in Cold Spring Harbor or Northport or Hempstead or Wyandanch.In places like these, the Island seems less like a 21st century American suburb and more like some sprawling reimagined southern plantation. According to the local advocacy group Erase Racism, two-thirds of Long Island’s municipalities are less than 1 percent black. Ninety percent of black Long Islanders live in 20 percent of its communities.This is an old, old Long Island complaint. But the chances of actually doing something about it have just improved, in Nassau County anyway, now that the county Legislature has passed a bill to put teeth into its housing-discrimination laws.The bill was spurred by Erase Racism’s report last year demonstrating how real-estate agents steered black applicants away from white neighborhoods, and how local officials impeded the development of integrated housing and lagged in enforcing fair-housing laws, routinely referring complaints to state or federal agencies where cases can go unresolved for years. Under the bill, the Nassau County Human Rights Commission would be required to act on a complaint, first by trying to mediate a settlement or, if that fails, going before a county judge. Real estate agents and their firms or rental landlords could be fined up to $50,000 if found guilty of discrimination.A bill before the Suffolk Legislature contains similarly tough enforcement measures but also has loopholes that advocates fear may prevent reasonable complaints from being investigated and prosecuted at the local level. Suffolk’s executive, Steve Levy, says that placing too much of an enforcement burden on the county would let New York State off the hook, and that adopting a bill like Nassau’s could open the doors to a deluge of housing complaints.It is easy to understand such administrative jitters. But there is no excuse for not acting on a backlog of injustice. If, as advocates suspect, there are vast numbers of aggrieved home seekers and would-be tenants on Long Island who don’t fight discrimination because they believe it’s futile, then the time to start dealing with it is now.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','Margolick, speaking of the wartime period, writes that Poles killed thousands of Jews, “most famously, as Gross related in ‘Neighbors’ (2001), a book that caused an uproar in Poland, 1,600 of them in the town of Jedwabne in July 1941 — crimes little noted at the time nor since remembered in Polish history books.”Why is the number 1,600 still being quoted, or rather, misquoted, as conclusive? On July 9, 2002, after an intense, long-awaited investigation, the Institute of National Remembrance in Poland issued a widely accepted report on the Jedwabne murders, available online at www.ipn.gov.pl/eng/eng_konf_jedwabne_press.html.The report cites eyewitness accounts of two groups of victims, who were led from the town marketplace to a nearby barn, where they were murdered. The first group “may have consisted of 40 to 50 people,” the report found, while the other “included several hundred people, probably about 300, which is confirmed by the number of victims in both graves. ... The figure of 1,600 victims or so seems highly unlikely, and it was not confirmed in the course of the investigation.”Rather than continuing to take Gross at face value, why don’t Margolick and the Book Review recognize that it was approximately 40 Polish perpetrators responsible for the death of several hundred Jews in German-occupied Jedwabne, and not 1,600? Not to diminish this event in any way, numbers do represent an integral part of historical accuracy.As a Polish citizen who arrived in the United States six years ago to undertake my graduate degree and later married an American, I am concerned that Margolick’s review might leave anunfairimpression of the Polish attitude toward Jews today. In the 25 years that I lived in Poland, I never witnessed any anti-Semitism from anyone in my family — including the elders — my friends or my schools. I am deeply sympathetic to the horrendous suffering Jews have endured, I fully support their desire to share their experiences, and I do not doubt the validity of Gross’s book. Isimply want to emphasize the fact that, thankfully, anti-Semitism is no longer part ofthe Polishculture.Margolick writes off the Poles as incurable anti-Semites. First, he dismisses contemporary Poland as “a place of necro-nostalgia.” Margolick sees no redeeming value in what, I believe, is actually a very healthy phenomenon: many young Poles (with Catholic or Jewish roots) are interested in all the cultures of their once multiethnic country. This interest in the pre-Holocaust culture of Polish Jews goes beyond the death in the Holocaust to affirm the life that was before it.Second, in mentioning the recent street attack by a hooligan against Poland’s chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, Margolick fails to mention the public’s outrage or the meeting that took place one day later between Poland’s president and Schudrich. After the president expressed his solidarity and assured Schudrich that he would not tolerate anti-Semitic incidents, Schudrich left “feeling touched” by the president’s gesture (Gazeta Wyborcza, June 29).Charles Chotkowskiis correct: while the suggestionthat Hitler be thanked for exterminating Polish Jewry met with tumultuous applause from delegates of the Polish Peasants Party, it was not put to a formal vote. (Readers can decide the significance of this distinction.) My figure forthe death toll in Kielce comes from Gross, whoincludesJews killed in the vicinity of thecity,often in and around neighboring train stations;“news of the pogrom traveled out of Kielce,” he writes, “and found a receptive audience keen to emulate the effort.” When one takes these victims intoaccount, he continues, “the total murdered may have topped 80.”As for the toll at Jedwabne, Eugene Markow ishalf-right: while the panel disputed the figure of 1,600 (the prewar Jewish population there, reduced to zero by war’s end),it concluded that the real figure would probably never be known. And as reported in many places, The New York Times among them, anyone who listens to the Catholic Radio Maryja knows that Polish anti-Semitism lives on, fond wishes and official condemnations notwithstanding.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','Five years after the attacks of 9/11 and President Bush’s promise to get Osama bin Laden “dead or alive,” the mastermind of the operation is still free and issuing widely publicized video and audio threats. By contrast, the C.I.A.’s unit set up to find him, code-named “Alec Station,” was recently, and quietly, disbanded after 10 years of failure. In the Middle East, America has become bogged down in an endless war and occupation in Iraq while Israel, backed by the United States, is now involved in a bloody war in Lebanon. Calling the invasion of Iraq “a godsend to Osama bin Laden,” the former Alec Station chief Michael Scheuer warned that American foreign policy in the region was playing directly into his hands. “It validated so much of what he has said and told Muslims: that the Americans want Arab oil; that the Americans will destroy any Muslim regime that appears to be powerful; the Americans will destroy any country that appears to be a threat to the Israelis; and they’re willing to invade any Muslim country if it suits their interests.”As the Middle East becomes an incubator for an army of future bin Ladens, it is a good time to look back at where, for Americans, it all began. The most comprehensive examination of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was conducted by the 9/11 Commission, chaired by Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton. Now Kean, a former governor of New Jersey, and Hamilton, a former congressman from Indiana, have written “Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission.” Told in a dry, colorless style, like the report itself, the book offers little new information on the actual attacks, but provides a keyhole view of the commission’s bureaucratic war with a White House obsessed with secrecy and control. Months after the commission’s creation, the staff was still battling the White House and the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee to get a look at an earlier 9/11 investigation by Congress, the Joint Inquiry report, protected under a dubious claim of “congressional privilege.” “This was frustrating,” the exasperated Kean and Hamilton complain, “particularly since we were a creation of Congress.” They add, “We were hung up with both Congress and the Bush administration over the documents that were mandated to be the starting point of our investigation.” Things only got worse.The man standing at the gate was Alberto Gonzales, then the White House counsel and now the attorney general. In public, George W. Bush was a president deeply concerned about getting to the bottom of the most deadly attack on American soil in the country’s history. But in private, he ordered his lawyer to throw up every roadblock possible. In shirtsleeves behind the coffee table of his second-floor West Wing office, Gonzales spoke to the members of the commission as if they were bringing an insurance claim. “He never referred to the president by name or title,” Kean and Hamilton report, “but rather always said ‘client’ — ‘Let me take this back to my client,’ or ‘I’ve got to protect my client.’” The biggest battle came over access to the White House morning intelligence report, the President’s Daily Brief, especially the one dated Aug. 6, 2001, barely a month before the attack. Titled “Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.,” the document noted that the F.B.I. was investigating suspicious Qaeda activity on American soil “consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.” When finally asked to provide the commission with his own testimony, the president said at first that he could spare only an hour of his time — and then with just the two chairmen. Later it was made clear that no recordings or transcripts would be permitted.But throughout the life of the commission, as this book indicates, the real power resided not in the commissioners themselves, largely don’t-rock-the-boat Washington insiders, but with the families of the victims of the attack who had mobilized into a collective force known as the Family Steering Committee. “Pressure grew on the White House to loosen its restrictions,” Kean and Hamilton say. “The 9/11 families were adamant that all 10 commissioners be present; indeed, they wanted the president and vice president to testify in public, under oath.”The White House gave in to the demand to meet with the full membership, but there was no way the president was going to testify publicly, or under oath. In fact, he insisted that he and Vice President Dick Cheney appear together, a move that led many skeptics to speculate that they wanted to ensure they kept their stories straight. Because of the insistence on secrecy, whatever was said in the room was largely lost to history. Unfortunately, Kean and Hamilton shed little additional light on the event, which is one of the problems with the book: an overabundance of self-censorship by the authors.Another major failure of the commission was its inability directly to question people in United States custody who played key roles in the plot, because of a decision by the director of central intelligence, George Tenet. At a lunch meeting in his C.I.A. office, “Tenet opened by saying, ‘You’re not going to get access to these detainees,’” the authors write, adding “Lee, who has known Tenet for 25 years, could tell from Tenet’s demeanor that there would be no give in his position on the matter.” The decision probably had less to do with the security of the detainees than with the fact that many of them were being held in secret foreign prisons and subjected to such torture as waterboarding. “At one point,” Hamilton and Kean note, “we were told that even the president of the United States did not know where these top Al Qaeda detainees were.” The commission decided to appeal Tenet’s denial, but once again the commissioners came up against Gonzales and his stonewalling. The best they could do was to send their questions to the C.I.A.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','Mr. Aikawa also wrote the script for “Conqueror of Shambala,” which takes place two years after the final television episode. Ed has somehow been transported to Weimar-era Munich, where he lives with a young engineer who resembles Al. But Alphonse Heiderich has fallen under the sway of the pro-Nazi Thule Society, whose members want to cross the dimensions that separate them from Ed’s world, which they call Shambala. They hope to find weapons there that will enable Germany to conquer the earth. A combination of science and alchemy reunites Edward with Alphonse; together they save two worlds from tyranny.“Bringing the characters from their fantasy world to the real one wasn’t that much of a problem,” Mr. Mizushima said. “But we didn’t want to make a movie with an easy story or the clichés of an all-star cast. We wanted the film to be true to the original themes, so we set the bar very high. The details, the shorter production time, the different characters, the different times, the different backgrounds were all very challenging, but we knew they would be when we started.”Viewers who aren’t familiar with “Fullmetal Alchemist” may find “Conqueror of Shambala” somewhat confusing. But the action-packed film will delight fans, most of whom are under 30. The original manga and the television and movie adaptations provide audiences with the kind of adventures earlier generations found in “The Hardy Boys” and “Tintin.”Unlike the wisecracking nonentities that populate many recent American animated films and TV shows, Edward and Alphonse are strong, believable characters. Their alchemical talents make them exciting, but it’s their vulnerability that wins fans’ hearts. In a wrenching moment Ed says, “I wouldn’t blame you if you did, Al, but I’ve got to know: Do you hate me for all that’s happened?” Stunned, Al answers, “Brother, I could never hate you.”Mr. Mizushima said: “Ed believes that he made Al lose his body when he tried to revive their mother, but Al feels responsible for their troubles because he couldn’t stop Ed. I wanted to portray them as good and similar brothers, but they still have these negative feelings because of what they each believe they owe each other.”Although he admitted, “I didn’t think ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’ was going to be so loved throughout the world,” it has enjoyed a huge success in print and on DVD.Gen Fukunaga, president and chief executive of FUNimation Entertainment, the American distributor, said: “ ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’ is an incredibly popular series. It is the second-best-selling anime series of all time, and it is second only to ‘Dragon Ball Z.’ ”“Dragon Ball,” which comprises more than 400 episodes and 18 features, built its popularity in the United States over more than a decade. “Fullmetal Alchemist” won its fans in a little over a year.Cammie Allen, product manager at Viz, the publisher of the English-language manga, said: “Each volume of ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’ has appeared in Bookscan’s Top 50 list upon release, and the first volume was the best-selling manga of 2005. Over one million copies of the ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’ books have been published in North America since the launch in May 2005.”In addition, “Fullmetal Alchemist” has spawned lines of toys, posters, key chains, jewelry and costumes. On a typical day there may be 800 related items for sale on eBay. Heather Russell, president of the Japanese online auction service Rinkya Inc., said: “Our customers buy so much ‘Alchemist’ stuff that it even made me go out and buy the DVD’s. Everybody loves Ed.”At the Anime Expo fans dressed as Edward, Alphonse and minor characters from the series thronged the cavernous Anaheim Convention Center.“The Conqueror of Shambala” is the end of Mr. Mizushima’s association with “Fullmetal Alchemist.” He and Mr. Aikawa are already at work on a new television series. Its story “takes place in the Edo period and involves some master craftsmen who are trying to make a gigantic fireworks rocket that can reach the moon,” Mr. Mizushima said. “It’s a slapstick comedy, so it’s very different.”But Ms. Arakawa has said she has no plans to end the “Fullmetal Alchemist” manga, so the adventures of the Elric Brothers will continue on the printed page.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','When a defense is characterized as leading to careful play, that does not mean that it is unassailable, only that it cannot usually be blasted during the first 20 moves. It does not come with an insurance policy that guarantees a lifetime of security.Yes, there have been defensive geniuses who have sometimes given the impression of invulnerability, like Emanuel Lasker, Samuel Reshevsky and Tigran Petrosian. But even they could be outsmarted. Reshevsky was once beating me with beautiful play. But with both of us in time pressure, I set up a trap, and just before he could destroy me, I won his queen and the game.Quiet play may not mean your opponent has forgotten that you are there, but something quite different — that he just needs time to weave the trap.Therefore, do not put too much credence in what may seem to be olive branches. Just assume your opponent is always out to get you.In the game between Jaan Ehlvest and Alonso Zapata at the 34th Annual World Open in Philadelphia, Ehlvest’s calm positional Maroczy Bind led his opponent to believe that the whole game would be played in the same mood. But Ehlvest showed him that the middle game could be played sharply and aggressively to a victory.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','Not the super-charged decibel level of the male mating call, the coy wing flap of compliant females, or the spooky red eyes of the periodicals.Not the unexpected appearance in central Texas last month of a giant, ear-splitting cicada that had not been seen there for decades.And so, as summer begins to wind down, let us pay our respects, not just to the creatures that produce so much of summer’s ambient noise, but also to the people who love them. People like John R. Cooley, a biologist at the University of Connecticut and his pal, Mike Neckermann, a longtime cicada aficionado, who were out gathering specimens on a gravel path behind Wethersfield High School on Friday morning.Of cicadas, both the periodical variety and all the rest, you must remember this: It’s the males that make almost all the noise. If you’re hearing a chorus of insect sounds on summer nights, it’s mostly crickets and katydids. The cicadas are generally out during the day. The celebrated periodical cicadas are, for reasons unknown, exclusively a North American phenomenon. Cicadas generally do no harm to plants or people.There are few purer expressions of summer. They mature later than other bugs, spend a month or so trying to mate and then are gone with the first decent frost.Dr. Cooley finds them truly “charismatic” — so much noise, so little time.But he said that unlike New Zealand or Australia, where populations are especially rich, or Japan or France, where they are beloved parts of local folkways, America often fails to give them their due.“It’s kind of a small discipline,’’ he said, referring to the academics who study them. “You could pack all the real hard-core, I won’t say nut cases, I would say enthusiasts, into a small room.”Dr. Cooley and Mr. Neckermann wandered off, the woods at first depressingly quiet.But around 10 they heard the first welcome rattle of Tibicen chloromera, the swamp cicada, which tends to assert itself between the morning rush hour and noon if the sun is out. Soon they heard a joyful chorus of buzz, hiss and rattle.They brought nets and a parabolic microphone, first without much success.But then Dr. Cooley, snapping his fingers to imitate the wing flap of a willing female, caught one male, its wings already frayed with age, which buzzed furiously in his palm. Then he found another, a female paralyzed by the sting of a cicada-killing wasp.Both seemed horrible ways to go, the first like a police sex sting, the second like a horrible accident.But, then, it turns out, there’s something quite familiar about the cicadas’ short, noisy life.“They don’t have enough time to do what they have to get done,’’ he said. “Just a few weeks to mature, to mate, to survive, to lay eggs. It’s really a frenzy of activity and then it’s over in a few weeks.”IT does feel familiar — yet another poor player who struts and frets his hour on the stage and then is heard no more.They can gather in scary multitudes and so do we. We both spend a lot of time obsessing about sex and trying to formulate successful mating rituals. We both screw up — accidentally flying into a bicyclist in Nanjing, blowing up innocent people in buses, at cafes, while they worship, as they sit down to eat supper.We feel imperiled and so should they; researchers like Dr. Cooley are just beginning to figure out how much our activity is cutting down cicada populations and driving some groups to extinction.We both make lots of noise, and in the end, not much of it amounts to anything. For both of us time is maddeningly brief and fleeting.And for them and for us there’s nothing like a sunny summer morning, full of warmth, hope and promise to stir something ancient, peaceful, alluring, magical.'"
"'06-08-20,'0','Tentatively, the two started hunting. For around $1 million, they figured they could get plenty of space, both indoors and out — ideally with a rental unit to help defray costs, and even a parking spot. (Ms. Hojaiban often drives to visit her parents in Meriden, Conn.)“We were novices, and would basically do an online search and come up with all these houses we wanted to look at, and then not actually look at anything,” Ms. Hojaiban said. “It is an ungodly amount of money. We had a nice apartment in the city. There was no fire behind us, nothing forcing us to move.”She was fond of Astoria, but the few houses for sale there were as expensive as houses elsewhere, yet the rental income was lower. “A lot of the rental units were illegal basement apartments — cash-only headaches,” she said.Mr. Jawde liked Brooklyn. “I was more on the side of new, and Carla was more on the side of character,” he said. “You know how the house hunt brings out all of these differences. We had a hard time finding places we agreed on.”The couple visited a four-bedroom duplex condominium on Russell Avenue in Greenpoint. They liked the neighborhood, but the apartment, at more than $500,000, felt like a place someone had bought and flipped. On the way, though, Ms. Hojaiban spotted the house on Driggs Avenue with a sign for an open house.The place “was kind of eerily great,” Mr. Jawde said. It had a roof deck, a two-bedroom rental, and even a one-car garage. “The neighborhood had a good vibe,” he added. “I felt I could grow old there with Carla and be happy. It felt sad because it seemed impossible we were going to get it. It was the most crowded I’ve ever seen an open house.”The listing broker, Kara Kasper of the Corcoran Group, received several offers in the low $1 million range. “If people are cornering you about how to put in an offer, that is an aggressive open house,” she said.The bidders with the $1.4 million offer, who were downsizing, put down a deposit of 5 percent and requested time to sell their house in Brooklyn Heights.Finding it too time-consuming to hunt on their own, Ms. Hojaiban enlisted the help of Julia Hoagland, a Corcoran agent she had met through a friend.Their bids on three other two-family Brooklyn town houses weren’t accepted. They didn’t much mind.Even if a place was close enough, none felt quite right. “It was a scary situation, too, because there were so many buyers,” Mr. Jawde said. “I felt it was conducive to bad decisions being made. Carla and I could talk ourselves into a place, and I hated that.”He found the hunt “boring and annoying.” Eventually, the two barely glanced at the e-mail listings Ms. Hoagland sent.Then, nearly six months later, the Driggs Avenue house resurfaced. This time, it was listed at $1.2 million.“That was so scary and so exciting,” Ms. Hojaiban said. “We had compared every place to it, and now we had to put our money where our mouth was.”But why was it again on the market? They worried something was wrong with the building, which had once housed the Greenpoint Volunteer Ambulance Corps. They had it examined by an architect friend as well as a home inspector. But the problem involved the earlier buyer’s finances, Ms. Kasper said.The two offered $1.17 million, with a down payment of 40 percent. Meanwhile, Mr. Jawde was watching mortgage rates rise. “My dad kept saying: ‘Why are you wasting money on the mortgage? I’ll help you out; I’ll give you a loan,’ but I didn’t want to do that,” he said. “I wanted it to be a business deal, more by the books.” (His father, Dr. Andre Jawde, is a heart surgeon.)Mr. Jawde decided to use the services of CircleLending (circlelending.com), which structures interfamily loans. His parents function as the bank, while Mr. Jawde and Ms. Hojaiban gain the tax benefits of a mortgage. They are paying an interest rate of just under 5 percent.“My father could probably make more money investing, but he is happier having the ability to help the kids out,” Mr. Jawde said.The two moved to their new house last winter, and spruced up the rental unit. Mr. Jawde insisted on adding a padded wall-to-wall carpet in the room above their bedroom. “Carla was against the carpet because it has such nice floors,” he said. “I’m generally a little more practical.” They hear no noise from their upstairs tenants — two roommates, who pay a total of $2,100.There are downsides to financial responsibility, Mr. Jawde said. “It hit me that I can’t quit and play golf.” They must clear the snow, make repairs on the rental unit and pay tax and utility bills, which somehow are higher than they had anticipated. They fed peanuts to the squirrels on the roof deck; now the squirrels eat the tomatoes they are trying to grow.“But it’s great,” Mr. Jawde said. “It’s making us feel like we have a home, which we never had, especially if you live in New York and are our age.”'"

That's what the Congressional Research Service, Congress's nonpartisan public policy research arm, explored in a recent study.As the study notes, the Defense Department recently put the ""burn rate"" -- a term for the sums being spent -- for Iraq and Afghanistan at $6.8 billion a month. But as the study says, that excludes maintaining and replacing equipment or building and improving facilities. The official ""burn rate,"" it concludes, is only about 70 percent of the true cost.For fiscal 2006, monthly costs for Iraq alone could hit $8 billion, the study projected.The study found a bit of surprising news: that the cost of feeding troops in Iraq fell in fiscal 2005 to $1.2 billion from $2 billion, despite comparable troop levels. No, we have not cut rations. The change may simply reflect success at reducing costs, the study says.'"

"'06-08-21,'0','BEIJING, Aug. 21 — A Chinese researcher for The New York Times who has been jailed for nearly two years on charges of leaking state secrets to the newspaper may learn the verdict in his case as soon as Friday, according to one of his defense lawyers.“It is very likely that they are going to announce a verdict but there is nothing definite,” the defense lawyer, Mo Shaoping, said today.The researcher, Zhao Yan, has denied the accusations against him, and The Times has repeatedly denied that he leaked any state secrets to the newspaper. Mr. Zhao, 44, has also said he is innocent of a second, lesser charge of fraud not related to his work for The Times. In June, Mr. Zhao had a secret trial in which defense witnesses were forbidden to testify.Without explanation, the authorities have delayed issuing a verdict. If one is announced on Friday, it would come as the same Beijing court has just completed another trial against a journalist. Last week, Ching Cheong, a Hong Kong-based journalist for The Straits Times, a Singapore newspaper, was tried on charges that he gave state secrets to Taiwan. His wife has denied the charges. He could face the death penalty if convicted. No verdict has been announced.Meanwhile, the Chinese authorities have also been cracking down on defense lawyers who have tried to use Chinese law to fight against abuses of power, corruption and other issues. Last week, the Beijing police detained Gao Zhisheng, a prominent and combative dissident lawyer. At the same time, officials in Shandong Province last week held a secret trial for Chen Guangcheng, a legal expert and peasant rights advocate. Local police detained three of Mr. Chen’s lawyers the day before the trial and then refused to let the Beijing-based attorneys take part in the closed trial.Mr. Zhao, the Times researcher, was detained in Sept. 2004 after a high-level investigation was ordered to determine the identities of anonymous sources in a Times article published that month. The article reported that former President Jiang Zemin had unexpectedly offered to quit his final leadership post as head of the military. Mr. Zhao spent more than 21 months in detention before his trial in June. Under Chinese law, a verdict should have been announced in July, but that deadline passed without any action.'"
"'06-08-21,'0','None of the players immediately below Wetterich were able to move into the top 10 in the Ryder Cup standings, including Cink, who played with Pavin on Sunday and shot 69 to finish tied for 24th. (Only the players who finished in the top 10 in the P.G.A. Championship received Ryder Cup points.)“I feel like I can help the team, and if I’m picked, I’ll be honored and I’ll try to represent the U.S. as best as I can,” Cink said.Micheel said he did not think Lehman would pick him, despite his strong showing at Medinah.“I don’t expect a call,” he said. “I was actually lobbying for Davis Love. I talked to Corey Pavin on Friday and I said, ‘Look, if you’re looking for a guy that’s playing some really good golf, I’d look towards him.’ ”Micheel, who shot 69 on Sunday, played with Love during the championship’s first two rounds.“I don’t know how he finished, but in my view he was swinging about as well as I’ve seen him swinging,” Micheel said. “He was just playing great.”Love did not finish well, bogeying his last three holes in a round of 76. He shot 40 on the back nine and has admitted to feeling pressure trying to earn a spot on the team.“I don’t know what he should do, really,” Love said when asked if Lehman should pick him. “He doesn’t really have anybody from 10 down that’s playing that well. He’s in a tough position. I saw him sneaking around out there today watching. I didn’t really show him much and I don’t think anybody else is either.

"'06-08-21,'0','“We are a party that gravitates toward front-runners,” said Rick Davis, who was Mr. McCain’s presidential campaign manager in 2000.Mr. McCain, of Arizona, has long had a constellation of loyal friends and advisers, some of whom date to his years as a naval pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam, not to mention his presidential bid in 2000.But as he has tried to claim the mantle of Mr. Bush’s natural successor, Mr. McCain has expanded his orbit to encompass supporters who have been part of Mr. Bush’s circle, and others who have not previously backed the senator.His still-informal network includes Richard L. Armitage, the former deputy secretary of state; John A. Thain, chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange; and Sig Rogich, who directed the advertising for the 1988 and 1992 presidential campaigns of Mr. Bush’s father.He is reaching out to Christian conservatives, who helped sink his 2000 presidential bid, by enlisting the aid of figures like Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah and former Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, both of whom have strong evangelical followings.His growing kitchen cabinet spans an array of issues and backgrounds, and includes James Jay Baker, a former lobbyist for the National Rifle Association; Niall Ferguson, a historian at Harvard; and Barry McCaffrey, who was the drug czar under President Bill Clinton.There is as yet no formal policy council and no regular meetings of the McCain brain trust, aides said. They cautioned that the senator consults widely and that some of those enlisted as advisers or supporters might not play official roles in his campaign, if he decides to run.Some figures listed as advisers by McCain aides, like Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, have been silent in public about their preference, and it is not clear how involved they may become.Yet the scale and breadth of the list suggest how much time, effort and care Mr. McCain is investing in preparing for a presidential campaign, using the lessons of his race in 2000 and his subsequent effort to rally the party around him.There is a whiff of opportunism among those signing on early with Mr. McCain as loyalties begin to migrate from the president to those who would succeed him, and Mr. McCain’s potential rivals for the Republican nomination are all scrambling to keep up with him in the hunt for money, expertise and ideological credentials.Senator George Allen of Virginia has lined up Ed Gillespie, the former chairman of the Republican Party and a Bush backer; Mary Matalin, a close adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney and to the first President Bush; and Frank J. Donatelli, a consultant and former Reagan aide.And Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts is working with Ron Kaufman, who was a political adviser to the first President Bush and a major fund-raiser for the current president.Mr. McCain is leading the effort to recruit big-name supporters, drawing on a deep vein of contacts from his 24 years in politics and two decades in the military. “He has the most active cellphone known to the phone company,” said John Weaver, his chief strategist.At this early stage, there is no sign of any battle for influence over policy or political strategy among Mr. McCain’s supporters. The real power continues to reside in his longtime inner circle — Mr. Weaver; Mr. Davis; and his Senate chief of staff, Mark Salter. They talk daily, even hourly, as they try to lock up talent, and they and a handful of close political advisers convene weekly conference calls with activists and fund-raisers.While Mr. McCain has been especially successful in signing up prominent Republicans who have close ties to Mr. Bush, some of his advisers differ among themselves or with the current administration’s policies.Some of Mr. McCain’s economic advisers, including Dan L. Crippen and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, both former directors of the Congressional Budget Office, have taken a harder line on budget deficits than has Mr. Bush. The group Mr. McCain consults on foreign policy includes neoconservatives like William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, as well as members of the so-called realist school of foreign policy thought like Brent Scowcroft and Mr. Armitage, who along with his former boss, Mr. Powell, battled the influence of neoconservatives in Mr. Bush’s first term.Many McCain advisers and money people say it is easy to make the switch from Mr. Bush to Mr. McCain because they have always admired Mr. McCain, or because Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush agree on the things that really matter.Like the fund-raisers, some strategists and policy advisers who approach the McCain campaign seem willing to put aside longstanding concern among conservatives about Mr. McCain.Dan Schnur, who was communications director for Mr. McCain’s 2000 presidential bid, said there were potential Republican candidates for 2008 who might be closer to Mr. Bush philosophically and politically than Mr. McCain is, citing Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas and Senator Allen. But neither has drawn the support of a sizable cadre of senior Bush advisers.“There may be other candidates who are more logical stewards of the Bush legacy than McCain, but none of them is going to get elected president in 2008,” said Mr. Schnur, who added that he did not expect to be involved in any McCain campaign. “McCain may stray from the Bush line more than other candidates in the field, but none of them is going to be in a position in 2009 to do anything about it.”Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush have grown closer politically in the past few years because of a shared commitment to a decisive battle against terrorism and the insurgency in Iraq, although it is unclear if support for the war will win votes in 2008.But differences remain on a number of issues, including government ethics, federal spending, stem cell research, climate change and treatment of terrorism suspects. Those divergences and any future splits could prove problematic for Mr. McCain, as well as for some of the Bush loyalists who have signed on with him or are considering doing so.Despite his past challenges to Mr. Bush, many who served in the president’s campaigns or his administration are lining up behind Mr. McCain.Among the more prominent members of the Bush team who said they expected to play a role in Mr. McCain’s candidacy, if he chooses to run, are Mark McKinnon, a Texas political media consultant who has worked for Mr. Bush for years; Terry Nelson, political director of the Bush 2004 re-election campaign; Nicolle Wallace, that campaign’s communications director; Wayne L. Berman, a Washington lobbyist, friend of Mr. Bush’s and prolific fund-raiser; and F. Philip Handy, chairman of Jeb Bush’s two races for governor in Florida and a major supporter of the president.Mr. McKinnon said that Mr. Bush and his chief strategist, Karl Rove, had been careful not to signal their preference among potential successors. “That said,” Mr. McKinnon added, “I think a lot of people are surprised at the extent to which there has been rapprochement between the Bush and McCain worlds.”He said Mr. McCain’s biggest challenge would be assuming the role of front-runner rather than free-speaking insurgent or underdog. “He has to be the leader of not just a movement, but the party,” Mr. McKinnon said. “That’s a whole different drill.”'"
"'06-08-21,'0','From Mr. Azhar come many of the most disturbing connections. He was captured in Indian Kashmir and was one of three convicted prisoners held in India who were exchanged in a deal between the Indian government and the hijackers of an Indian Airlines plane in Dec. 24, 1999. The hijackers forced the plane to land in Kandahar, Afghanistan, which was then in the control of the Taliban, and negotiations through the Taliban led to India releasing three people from jail in exchange for the 150 hostages on board the plane.Another of the prisoners was Ahmed Omar Sheikh, a British citizen of Pakistani descent who was later convicted for his part in the killing of Mr. Pearl, a Wall Street Journal correspondent.After Mr. Azhar was freed in 2000, he founded Jaish-e-Muhammad, ostensibly as an organization supporting mujahedeen fighting in Afghanistan and Kashmir, but by 2002 it had already been cited as a terrorist organization by the United States and banned by the Pakistani authorities. Mr. Azhar lives and works in Karachi, editing a jihadi newspaper, Al Qalam, or The Pen, according to his father, Allah Baksh Sabir.Mr. Sabir now runs the Usman-o-Ali madrasa in Bahawalpur, which was founded by Mr. Azhar. Last week, he told reporters that Mr. Rauf had been a member of Jaish-e-Muhammad. The next day, ringed by police officers and plainclothes intelligence officials, he denied making such comments and denied even knowing of the existence of Mr. Rauf, even though his son is Mr. Rauf’s brother-in-law.The brother-in-law, Maulana Suhaib, in his late 20’s, is a teacher at Dar-ul-Uloom Madnia, but he had gone into hiding, said Mr. Sadiq, the teacher, who added, “He was very worried because a lot of people have started coming round.”“He said he had nothing to do with anything,” Mr. Sadiq said. “Maulana Suhaib did not know who Rashid Rauf was and never expressed any apprehensions before.” Of Mr. Rauf, he said: “I used to hear that he was doing big business, selling house furniture and goods such as fridges. I always heard he was a rich man.”In this southern tip of Punjab, where there are almost equal populations of Sunni and Shiites, Sunni extremism has existed for many years. The Sunni extremist groups have grown out of the Deobandi branch of Islamic scholarship, which is anti-Shiite in its teaching and emphasizes the importance of jihad, or armed struggle. The Taliban in Afghanistan were overwhelmingly Deobandis, as are the most active jihadi militant organizations in Pakistan.Connections between Pakistani and Afghan extremists grew as Pakistani intelligence services harnessed the Deobandi groups to fight the Soviet Army in Afghanistan in the 1980’s. As with Jaish-e-Muhammad, the intelligence services also recruited the groups to fight Indian rule in Kashmir.Another Sunni extremist group with links to the region is Lashkar-e-Jangvi, which is increasingly seen as an armed instrument of Al Qaeda in Pakistan. It is believed to recruit from other terrorist groups, and to have a number of members who were in Jaish-e-Muhammad.One of Pakistan’s most wanted men is linked to that group. He is Matiur Rehman, who is a main suspect in an assassination attempt on President Pervez Musharraf in 2003. He is from the Bahawalpur district and, according to his father, was a student at the Dar-ul-Uloom Madnia madrasa. Interviewed in his home in the village of Had Rajgan, 47 miles from Bahawalpur, the father, Ali Muhammad Sirhindi, said Mr. Rehman had studied there for five years and then at age 19 went to fight in Afghanistan.Any connection Mr. Rauf might have to global jihad is now the subject of an international investigation. He does not seem to have been on the police’s radar here before the British authorities asked the Pakistanis to put him under surveillance. He was living openly in a middle-class two-story house in the town on a narrow unpaved street, in a neighborhood called Model Town.The house was quiet on a recent visit, and a metal grill across the entrance was padlocked. Several homeless families were living in tents on an empty plot of land across from the house. Neighbors came out to stare as journalists arrived with a police escort to visit the house, but they said they had seen little of the people living there.“He was arrested a couple of weeks ago, and police conducted a raid about two weeks ago,” said one neighbor living along the street, asking not to be identifed for fear of trouble from the police.The family moved in about a year ago, but an elderly man inside the house shunned a welcoming visit, another neighbor said. “I never went back,” the neighbor said. “A lot of veiled women and bearded men would come to visit around midnight.”Fateh Muhammad, 38, who lives one house down, said of Mr. Rauf: “He was very religious. He used to go to the mosque. He had a long beard, but nearly a month ago, he cut it.”The police carried away a few things after the raid, including computers, but no one was arrested. The rest of the family left, Mr. Muhammad said.In a small town where everyone knows everyone, the neighbors’ reticence to speak in detail told its own tale. Police cars and plainclothes intelligence officers followed foreign reporters everywhere they went in the town, taking notes during some of the interviews and sometimes warning interviewees not to answer a certain question. One resident on Mr. Rauf’s street whispered that security officials had warned neighbors not to talk to anyone about the family.Police officials in the town said they were too busy to be interviewed, except the deputy superintendent of police, who said Mr. Rauf had not been known to the police before his arrest. He could not even confirm his arrest had occurred in the area, which suggested that intelligence agencies, rather than the police forces, had picked him up.'"
"'06-08-21,'0','The war games started in the southern province of Sistan-Baluchestan on Saturday and are expected to continue along the eastern and western borders of the country in 14 provinces. The games are named after Zolfaghar, the sword of Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. Ali is revered by Shiites as Muhammad’s successor.State television showed helicopters shooting, bombs being dropped in the desert and paratroopers jumping out of helicopters. The report said various types of helicopters, fighter planes, live ammunition and bombs were used.“This operation was planned in response to the evil intentions of the enemy,” Maj. Gen. Ataollah Salehi said on state television on Saturday.Brig. Gen. Muhammad Hassan Dadress told the semiofficial FARS news agency that Iran was not displaying “the major part of its military capability.”“The army of the Islamic Republic has developed its equipment in the shortest period of time according to the most modern techniques and equipment of the enemy so that it can confront any threat,” he said.The military maneuver came during increasing international pressure over Iran’s nuclear program. Uranium enrichment is a process that can lead to making fuel for nuclear reactors or, if the uranium is enriched to high enough levels, nuclear bombs.Iran contends that its nuclear program is for peaceful energy purposes. The United States and Europe contend that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Iran has said it will give its official response on Tuesday to a package of proposals by Germany and the five permanent members of the Security Council — China, Britain, Russia, the United States and France. The package includes economic incentives and a promise to help develop Iran’s nuclear program in return for Iran’s freezing its enrichment program.Iran has come under increasing international pressure since the war in Lebanon broke out. The United States and Israel have accused Iran of financing and arming Hezbollah.The daily newspaper Shargh on Saturday quoted a Turkish newspaper report that Turkey had forced two Iranian aircraft on their way to Syria to land in Turkey after Israel said the two aircraft were carrying weapons for Hezbollah. It said no weapons were found on the planes.Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a senior cleric who is in charge of the powerful Expediency Council, warned the United States in a sermon during Friday Prayer not to initiate a war on Iran over its nuclear program.“We hope America has learned a lesson from the war in Lebanon and refrains from getting involved in another conflict and causing insecurity in our region,” he said in remarks broadcast live on radio. “The problem should be resolved by wise people through negotiations so that we can end this regional and international issue in a good way.’’'"
"'06-08-21,'0','“You can’t walk in peace in the city of Dakar anymore,” said Aminata Diaw, a history professor here at the University Cheikh Anta Diop, who has studied the culture of charity and begging in Senegal.Almost all African capitals are crowded with beggars. The World Bank estimates Africa’s cities are growing twice as fast as the rest of the world’s cities. But Dakar has a special allure for the indigent, and the country’s relatively robust economy adds to its drawing power.“Sixty percent of the beggars come from Mali and Guinea alone because this is a religious country that gives greatly to the poor,” said Assan Sagne, an expert on micro-finance for the government’s Project to Fight Poverty. “The beggars understand that Senegalese culture is morally obliged to help them.”On a recent Friday, a day of prayer, it was not long before Mr. Sorro’s first patron dropped spare change into his calloused hands. In 2002, Mr. Sorro, 42, left his wife and two children at home to try his luck here.“I looked at my situation at home,” he said. “When I had the occasion to come, I did.”Dakar has another category of beggars as well. Impoverished village families often send their boys to the cities to attend Koranic schools, where they are expected to support themselves by begging.The boys are known as talibé, and 100,000 of them wander the streets of Senegal’s cities.Outside idling buses and taxicab windows, the boys chant Arabic prayers for coins, food or sugar cubes. Some find the system exploitative, and rumors abound of imams who amass significant wealth from their charges.Nevertheless, people give, freely and often.“It is not only the poor in our society who need this culture of charity, but the rich as well,” Professor Diaw said. “People give for better luck in their studies, their work, or their lives. They think it is something concrete on the path to heaven.”Even though Amina N’Doye, a 27-year-old hairdresser, struggles to pay the rent for her hair salon, she follows the suggestion of her imam and gives milk to a group of hungry talibé. “Giving brings blessing and benediction to your work,” she said.A 50-year-old disabled man who calls himself Sensou said: “It hits the people of Dakar on the day of prayer to see beggars. They are always more generous.” He came to Dakar 20 years ago from the southern town of Fouta, where his family still lives.Sensou looked around and then quietly opened his hands to show his daily earnings: exactly three coins so far. He counts on bigger donations on the days of prayer — Thursdays and Fridays — to help pay his $40 a week rent for a room downtown.But with Dakar becoming ever more cosmopolitan — from ice cream shops to government conferences — the beggars do not seem to fit in anymore.“There is a confrontation growing,” said Professor Diaw. She said the beggars clustered around the pastry and ice cream shops in the center of the city that are popular with well-to-do residents. “Since you are eating dessert, it means you have already eaten and are no longer hungry. Beggars come to confront you because they know you have means.”Babacar Faye, chief of accident prevention for the city’s Traffic Commission, recently told local reporters that beggars were “posing serious problems, especially on Friday mornings.”Mr. Sorro said he was tired of waiting for Thursday and Friday, and afraid that even those days might soon be gone.“I usually get enough to eat, and that is all,” he said.“If I could, I would be back in Ivory Coast,” he said. “Dakar is hard. But if you leave, you cannot survive begging. In any case, I’m here.”'"
"'06-08-21,'0','CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Aug. 20 (AP) — Technicians on Sunday successfully swapped out two bolts securing a crucial communications antenna on the space shuttle Atlantis because engineers thought they were too short.The last-minute change was not expected to affect the schedule for Atlantis’s planned launching next Sunday on a mission to resume construction on the International Space Station.“Everything went well and we’re good to go,” said a NASA spokeswoman, Tracy Young.The work began Friday evening and wrapped up Sunday afternoon. Technicians built scaffolding on a platform six stories above the ground to get inside the shuttle’s cargo bay and reach the antenna, which transmits images and other essential data between the space shuttle and Mission Control.Atlantis has flown with the bolts without trouble since they were first installed two decades ago. The problem was discovered after the shuttle was rolled to the launching pad when a review of paperwork on bolts on three space shuttles was ordered because a related problem was found in Discovery.Technicians found the bolts they removed to be holding the antenna securely. “It was a precautionary measure,” Ms. Young said.'"
"'06-08-21,'0','At 59E59 Theaters, two Norwegian plays begin and end with the suicide of a young woman. The plays on this double bill could not be more different in depth and tone.One, Henrik Ibsen’s “Rosmersholm,” is the story of a former minister, recently widowed, who lives in what he calls “a spiritual marriage” with a pretty young libertine. The other, Jon Fosse’s “Deathvariations,” watches as an older couple try to come to terms with their daughter’s death as they look back on their marriage and her life. “Deathvariations” is by far the more successful.Mr. Fosse, born in 1959, has been compared to Ibsen and to Beckett, and it is easy to see his work as Ibsen stripped down to its emotional essentials. But it is much more. For one thing, it has a fierce poetic simplicity.“He comes walking towards me with rain in his hair,” says the Daughter (Natalia Payne), referring to the Friend (Charles Borland), who represents something like the seductive antithesis of the life force. The Friend shares an important thought with her: “You know, love always hides.” The Older Woman (Diane Ciesla) remembers seeing her daughter lying dead: “She wasn’t in her face anymore.”As the Older Woman and the Older Man (Dick Hughes) begin confronting their grief, in opposing ways, “deathvariations” turns to their younger selves (Deborah Knox and David L. Townsend), back when they were newly married, expecting a child and moving into a horrible basement apartment.Everything is up in the air, but then, as one character says, “that’s what life is.” Later, when the Young Woman learns that the Young Man is having an affair ( “Tell me her name.” “Now you know.”), it has the inevitability of sunset.'"
"'06-08-21,'0','“With one-way fares to Geneva from £29, Pisa from £34 and Krakow from £34, you might expect check-in to be a nightmare,” the ad said. “But with British Airways, you can avoid the queues by checking in and printing your own boarding pass online.”Because online check-in was briefly suspended, “we thought the content was inappropriate, given the situation at Heathrow,” a spokeswoman for British Airways said. Indeed, long lines built up, and some travelers had to wait outside airport terminals in the rain.In a break with the industry’s customary “speak no evil” practice in dealing with delicate matters, the latest terror alert prompted several ads with topical references.The Advertising Standards Authority, which regulates British advertising, said Friday that it had received complaints about a newspaper ad from Ryanair, the low-cost airline. It featured a picture of Winston Churchill making a “V for victory” sign and exhorted Britons to “keep flying to defeat terrorists.” The authority is looking into the complaints, which came from people who “found it offensive to use the terrorist threat for commercial gain,” a spokeswoman, Donna Mitchell, said.Another low-cost airline, Thomsonfly, also referred to the security alert in a newspaper ad with the headline, “One U.K. airline has kept flying.” It said the carrier had not canceled any flights since word of the plot was disclosed.Not all marketing activity relating to the terrorist alert involved efforts to drum up business. “Customer relationship management” — which involves communicating with existing customers and trying to keep them loyal — is a fast-growing marketing discipline of particular importance to airlines in difficult times.The logjam at British airports provided the biggest test yet of a text-messaging service developed for British Airways by a mobile marketing agency called Incentivated. The system sends messages to ticket holders about flight delays or cancellations and can sometimes automatically rebook them on the next available flight.But users must register for the service on British Airways’ Web site, so it was not able to reach all the customers affected by flight disruptions. Incentivated did send out 20,000 text messages in the first four days after the alert, an average of 23 people from each affected flight, the marketing agency’s commercial director, Robert Thurner, said. And while the system was unable to prevent scenes of chaos, “without this, it could have been even worse,” he said.British Airways now uses the text system only to provide information on schedule disruptions, but Mr. Thurner said it might eventually prove helpful in other ways. Passengers could choose to receive discount fare offers and information on hotels or gyms at their destinations, for example.“Just because this was a bad-news scenario doesn’t mean it couldn’t be used for good things as well,” he said.'"
"'06-08-21,'0','“You can throw a lot of things to scare them, but there are still guys finding value,” Mr. Harris said of investors bullish on online casinos. He said he also believed that panicked overselling had made some Internet gambling stocks cheap now.That sentiment is not universal. The controversy swirling around BetOnSports has raised questions about whether other companies might soon be in the Justice Department’s sights, industry executives and analysts said.“None of us know whether this indictment is specific to BetOnSports or a sweeping attack against online gaming per se,” said an executive from a publicly traded online gambling firm who requested anonymity because company lawyers had told him not to comment to the press. “We’re keeping our heads down.”There are indications that some major investors, including American investment houses, are beginning to distance themselves from the online gambling companies, either by dumping shares or by ceasing to provide analyst coverage.But other investors, notably hedge funds, have led a comeback. Shares of SportingBet hit 398.5 pence ($7.50) on July 4. On July 18, after the indictment, they tumbled, in heavy volume, reaching a low of 171 pence on July 21. The stock has recovered a bit and is now at 249.25 pence. Shares of PartyGaming also slid in mid-July on heavy volume, hitting a low of 85.25 pence on July 18. But they have revived strongly, hitting a high of 120 pence on Aug. 4. The shares are now at 111 pence.Neteller, a company used by many online gamblers for payment processing and one seen by some as an industry bellwether, was at 597.50 pence on July 4, fell to 319 on July 20, and is now at 400 pence.The day the indictment was unsealed on July 17, trading in BetOnSports was halted after a 17 percent slide in the shares. Kevin Smith, a company spokesman, said he thought it could be more than a month more before the London Stock Exchange reopened trading.There is no doubt there is allure to investing in the offshore casinos, some of which have enjoyed considerable growth. According to Nielsen Net/Ratings, PartyPoker.com recently has been among the world’s 10 fastest-growing Web sites, with its traffic up 185 percent in July from the previous year.Some online gambling companies continue to report strong profit growth and earnings. SportingBet said on Aug. 1 that it was on track to report £103 million ($195 million) in operating profit for the fiscal year that ended July 31. PartyGaming’s second-quarter revenue was up 49 percent from a year ago, to $319.3 million.I. Nelson Rose, a professor and expert in Internet gambling law at Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa, Calif., said he had recently been contacted by major institutional investors trying to decide how to deal with the risk and volatility.“The question I got the most was: ‘Should we buy?’” Mr. Rose said.Investors should do so only with the understanding that the investment is so risky that it could virtually disappear, said Sebastian Sinclair, an industry analyst with Christiansen Capital Advisors.Mr. Sinclair said that BetOnSports, which was getting 70 percent to 80 percent of its wagers from United States residents, has little business left. “They’re done; they’re toast,” he said. “If you’re an investor, your investment is worth next to nothing.”On July 16, federal marshals arrested David Carruthers, the chief executive of BetOnSports, as he changed planes in Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Mr. Carruthers had been a frequent traveler to the United States, where he met with financiers and sought to rally public support for legalization of online gambling.But for months, federal prosecutors in St. Louis had been building a case against him and the company on charges of operating an offshore casino in violation of the federal Wire Act of 1961.On July 17, prosecutors unsealed a 22-count indictment against BetOnSports and several current and former executives and said they would seek $4.5 billion in penalties. They also obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting BetOnSports from taking bets from United States residents.Mr. Carruthers has been released on $1 million bail in St. Louis, but he is confined to a local residence.Mr. Sinclair said he doubted that the Justice Department would succeed in shutting down another Web gambling company, unless its executives traveled to the United States.“The Department of Justice could say to SportingBet: ‘Shut down tomorrow,’ but I don’t see them doing it,” Mr. Sinclair said.This month BetOnSports affirmed that it would no longer take wagers from United States bettors, a move that Mr. Smith, the spokesman, said was intended in part to reassure investors that it was playing by the rules. He said it planned to focus on taking bets from Asian gamblers.But, for now, the potential growth from Asia is limited, said Mr. Harris, the analyst from Canaccord Adams. He said that the banking system was more fragmented in Asia than in the United States and that payment processors, like Neteller, had yet to prove they could ensure quick, easy, reliable payments on wagers placed from Asia.Another potential obstacle is legislation that has passed the House of Representatives, and is pending in the Senate, that could strengthen the laws against offshore casinos and make it a crime for financial institutions to process wagers.Such a step could have a considerable impact, analysts said. But they also say they doubt that the Senate will pass the bill, partly because of a gambling lobby that hopes for a piece of the action and does not want to see Internet gambling outlawed.As interest in Web gambling stocks has developed, the investors can generally be broken into two camps: long-term players like pension and mutual funds, and hedge funds that dip in and out of the sector.Some investors who have owned Web gambling stocks are now getting out. Last December, Fidelity Management held shares in BetOnSports worth about $363 million, or 14.1 percent of the outstanding shares. Those shares were largely held in mutual funds.But Fidelity Management has sold those shares, according to Vincent Loporchio, a company spokesman, who declined to elaborate.Last December, Morgan Stanley Securities Ltd., a British subsidiary of the American investment bank, held the largest position in BetOnSports, around 12 million shares, on behalf of one large investor.Its custodial position has changed considerably. The subsidiary now holds around 2.7 million shares on behalf of one or more large investors, indicating a large divestiture. Morgan Stanley declined to comment.Some big investment banks have become quiet on the subject. Citigroup’s online gambling analyst in London has moved to another sector, and has not been replaced. Morgan Stanley analysts are restricted from speaking about online gambling stocks, but the bank will not say why.Hedge funds, on the other hand, have been flocking to the volatile sector, and rapidly buying, selling and shorting as BetOnSports makes headlines, according to bankers in London who specialize in the sector. The hedge funds, though they have always been involved in the sector, appear to be trying to capitalize on the uncertainty, gambling on the day-to-day developments in the volatile industry.“BetOnSports is going to haunt the market,” predicted a London-based banker who took part in the public fund-raising for several Internet gambling companies and would not speak for attribution because he did not want to upset his clients.Even if no other online company is indicted, the case will be played out over months or years, he said, with events like bail hearings and trial dates making headlines. “Every now and again, the market is going to take a fright,” he said. “This is not a market that underreacts.”'"
"'06-08-21,'0','“The idea of logging in every day to see if you’ve won takes codes beyond simple proof-of-purchase promotions,” said Joseph Jaffe, president of Jaffe L.L.C., a marketing consultancy, and the author of “Life After the 30-Second Spot” (John Wiley & Sons, 2005).“The codes of yesterday were a foot in the door for marketers,” Mr. Jaffe said. “Now they’re substantive branding tools, encouraging full-blown relationships.”One example of the changes wrought by the Internet is a promotion called My Coke Rewards, introduced by Coca-Cola in February. The multiyear promotion is housed on a Web site (mycokerewards.com) where consumers open accounts, accumulate points by entering codes and can redeem the points for prizes from Coca-Cola or other companies including Adidas, Delta Air Lines and Hilton.“We could never do a program of the size and scale of My Coke Rewards without it being online,” said Katie Bayne, senior vice president for Coca-Cola brands in North America, who is based in Atlanta.The promotion has already “overdelivered on our expectations,” she added, with more than 2.5 million accounts opened and more than 543,000 prizes claimed so far using codes found on packages of Coca-Cola, Coke Zero and Diet Coke.•“Every 19 seconds, someone is redeeming value from our site, and the rewards are what they want, what they decide,” Ms. Bayne said. Among the most popular prizes are Blockbuster rentals, free Coca-Cola products, subscriptions to Hearst magazines and music downloads from Sony’s Connect.com.Coke’s principal rival, Pepsi-Cola, finished a code promotion on Friday that offered downloads of cellphone ring tones from the pepsismash.com Web site. The promotion, co-sponsored with Motorola and Yahoo, was Pepsi’s 14th online program in six years based on codes.“Our first, in 2000, was Pepsi Stuff, replacing an offline program for which we produced 150 million catalogs,” said John Vail, director for interactive marketing at Pepsi-Cola North America in Purchase, N.Y.“There were significant efficiencies to not printing 150 million catalogs,” he added dryly.By running the code promotions online, “there’s a great ability to immerse consumers in our brands,” Mr. Vail said, by adding features to the Web sites like games, which encourage visitors to linger and make them “more than code-redemption centers.”Computer users can be spurred to visit the Web sites as the promotions begin by sending e-mail messages containing what Mr. Vail called “starter codes” to those who took part in previous online programs.DaimlerChrysler has also recognized how the Internet can jump-start code promotions. When the company decided last week to add a sweepstakes to its current ad campaign featuring its chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, as “Dr. Z,” users were directed to local dealerships to receive cards bearing five-digit codes and to enter the sweepstakes at the campaign’s Web site (https://www.askdrz.com).“It was a combination of getting out quickly and getting broad exposure,” said George Murphy, senior vice president for global marketing for the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands in Auburn Hills, Mich.“We launched it on the AOL home page, and in a day we got 300 million impressions,” Mr. Murphy said. “That’s a scale you can never get with a direct-mail campaign, and it was much cheaper.”The giveaway of nine prize cars started last Tuesday and runs through Sept. 4. In the first 48 hours, there were 227,230 visits to the sweepstakes Web page, according to DaimlerChrysler. And 65.7 percent of consumers registering to enter the sweepstakes agreed to receive information about the prizes, which include the Dodge Challenger R/T.“To have 66 percent opting in is incredible,” said Christine MacKenzie, Chrysler’s executive director for multibrand marketing. “The average is 10 to 30 percent.”Another DaimlerChrysler model, the Chrysler Crossfire, is among the big-ticket merchandise being auctioned in the first significant foray online by the Hershey Company. One billion packages of Hershey candy are being imprinted with codes in a promotion called Wrapper Cash, which began on a Web site (hersheys.com) on May 15 and continues through Oct. 31.“We’ve already auctioned off 7 of the 12 Chrysler Crossfire roadsters” that are part of the promotion, said Vaughan Smith, senior director for strategic partnerships at eBay in San Jose, Calif., which is a sponsor of Wrapper Cash.“We’re always keen to give people more exposure to and experience with auctions and bidding,” he said.This is the largest code promotion in which eBay has taken part, Mr. Smith said. The others involved brands like Dr Pepper and 7Up, sold by Cadbury Schweppes.There are drawbacks to moving code promotions to the Internet, primarily the privacy concerns some consumers have when providing personal data.•“Marketers must avoid being greedy and asking for too much information,” Mr. Jaffe, the marketing consultant, said, adding: “It’s a double-edged sword. Just because you can get information doesn’t mean you should.”Ms. Bayne said that Coca-Cola North America “is really careful” about the privacy of consumers taking part in My Coke Rewards, making sure there are opportunities to opt out of providing information.Perhaps the best feature of Internet-powered code promotions, Ms. Bayne said, is that consumers do not know which product packages are winners until the codes are entered online. “I remember making midnight runs, under the cover of darkness, into local markets, going into stores to put the five winning caps on bottles,” she said, laughing. “With this technology, you don’t need to do that.”'"
"'06-08-21,'0','Defensive signaling has always, in theory at least, been straightforward. At first you signal attitude: whether you like partner’s lead or not. If attitude is known or irrelevant, you give count, telling partner how many cards you have left in the suit. If attitude and count are known or irrelevant, you may send a suit-preference signal.That is relatively simple and very sensible. But nowadays many pairs use a different approach. Instead of following that rote routine, you are supposed to give the signal that partner wishes to receive. Fair enough, but how will you always know what partner wants to learn? If you take the bidding and dummy into account, you will often guess correctly, but there is potential for a misunderstanding.As an example look at the diagramed deal, Board 33 of the final of the World Youth Teams Championship, which ended on Aug. 8 in Bangkok. The winners were Joshua Donn, Jason Feldman, Ari Greenberg, Joe Grue, John Kranyak and Justin Lall from the United States. They won more easily than the final score of 235 international match points to 220 suggests, because Italy annexed the last session by 82 imps to 1.At both tables South reached five clubs after identical sequences. In the other room, neither Grue (East) nor Kranyak doubled, and Kranyak led the spade king. At the given table, Francesco Ferrari (West) did double, then led the spade ace. What should East play, and how should his card be interpreted by West?For the theoreticians, Kranyak’s jump to four spades did not put them in a forcing auction. If West had wanted East to decide between bidding five spades and doubling five of a minor (should the opponents bid that high), he would have cue-bid over three clubs, not gone straight to game.'"
"'06-08-21,'0','The world already knows that Fidel Castro, the temporarily sidelined president of Cuba, was a pitcher in his younger days — he even briefly played with a barnstorming team after the revolution — and remains a huge sports fan. Now it knows something else: like Zinédine Zidane, Tracy McGrady and Reggie Bush, Mr. Castro is an Adidas man.Not that Adidas, the multinational athletic equipment company based in Germany, is taking out billboards to spread the news. Rather, the world’s news media spread the word after the Cuban government released the first photographs of Mr. Castro, 80, recuperating from surgery for intestinal bleeding in Havana. Mr. Castro was shown in a resplendent red, white and blue jacket with an Adidas symbol on the right breast, the kind of unintentional product endorsement that any company trying to sell in the United States might want to avoid.“We don’t really look at it as anything,” said Travis Gonzolez, head of public relations for Adidas, adding that the company also provided athletic shoes to President Bush. “It’s not a positive, not a negative.”“We are a sports brand. We are making products for athletes, we are not making them for leaders.”The company had received neither praise nor complaints about the Castro photographs. Mr. Gonzolez said the company had a longstanding relationship with the country’s Olympic team, adding, “We are more proud when the Cuban athletes win Olympic medals, because we provided them the tools to succeed.” The jacket, he said, appeared to be a generic tracksuit from the country’s sports federation.Michael Cucka, a partner at Group 1066, a marketing strategy and branding company, described the worldwide publicity around the photograph as an example of how increasingly, “companies don’t control their brands anymore.”'"
"'06-08-21,'0','While the United States has an extradition treaty with Israel, it is unclear whether the treaty covers the crimes that Mr. Alexander is accused of, law professors said. Furthermore, given Mr. Alexander’s stature and record of military service, Israel may be reluctant to readily hand him over, they add.While Mr. Alexander is widely known in Israel, his profile in the United States is lower.Former colleagues describe him as a meticulous, highly intelligent man who often asked about their family members and enjoyed watching sports and trading stocks. Yet the criminal complaint portrays a man who treated options as if they were free for the taking.Options give an employee the right to buy a stock at some point in the future at the price of the stock on the day the option was granted, commonly referred to as the strike price. The higher the stock price climbs, the more valuable the option becomes.Many executives became fabulously wealthy by exercising options during the technology boom, and Comverse executives were no different.Comverse stock soared on an adjusted basis from about $13 in early 1997 to a peak of $121.63 in 2001, when the tech bubble was deflating. It closed Friday at $21.24.Top executives and members of Comverse’s board, including Mr. Alexander’s father and his sister, who were directors for several years, exercised options for Comverse for profits of more than $295 million since 1997, according to an analysis of regulatory filings by Thomson Financial.Mr. Alexander alone accounted for half the options-related profits — about $140 million. In addition, Mr. Alexander received about $28 million in salary, bonuses and other perks during those years, according to Equilar, a compensation analysis firm in San Mateo, Calif.At Comverse, favored employees were given options that could be exercised overnight for millions in profits, prosecutors said. And when the options began to lose some of their value, Mr. Alexander and the other executives scrambled to make them more valuable by changing the grant dates of the options, a practice known as backdating, according to court papers.Prosecutors said Mr. Alexander had made about $6.4 million in profits from backdating, while the chief financial officer, David Kreinberg, and general counsel, William F. Sorin, each made about $1 million. All three resigned from the company in late April.One former colleague struggled to explain why Mr. Alexander might have risked his name and future for such a relatively paltry amount.“The one thing about Kobi is that he did have a sense of entitlement,” said Stephen R. Kowarsky, who was an executive at Comverse from 1985-97. “Most people are a little bit shy or self-effacing about asking for something, but not Kobi. It was easy for him to say, ‘I want that. I deserve that.’ ”A spokesman for Comverse, Paul D. Baker, declined to comment for this article.Mr. Alexander grew up in Tel Aviv. His father is Zvi Alexander, who spent 40 years in the oil industry in Israel. After serving as an officer in the Israeli defense forces, the younger Mr. Alexander earned a degree in economics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1977.He moved to New York, where he worked as an investment banker at Shearson Loeb Rhoades while attending courses at night for his master’s in business administration at New York University.It was in New York that Mr. Alexander met an engineer named Boaz Misholi. Mr. Misholi had a revolutionary idea about a voice- and fax-messaging system. The two men, along with Mr. Alexander’s brother-in-law, Yechiam Yemini, returned to Israel to create a company called Efrat.The start-up was financed in part with subsidies from the Israeli government, which was trying to stimulate its high-tech industry.In 1984, Mr. Alexander returned to New York to establish headquarters for Comverse, which would become a holding company for Efrat and other subsidiaries. The name was a blend of “communication” and “versatility.”By the early 1990’s, Mr. Alexander had survived a power struggle over control of the company that led to Mr. Misholi’s departure. Mr. Alexander had already made several major decisions that positioned Comverse extremely well for the telecommunications boom to come.While most telecommunications equipment manufacturers were focusing their efforts on telecom giants in the United States, Mr. Alexander steered Comverse toward Europe and its wireless phone markets.“We decided to do a lot of deals with the small and medium telecoms in Europe and then leverage the experience we had in the U.S. market,” said Mark E. McIlvane, who joined the company in 1986 as a sales and marketing executive and left in 1997.One of Comverse’s earliest and biggest customers was Deutsche Telekom, but the company eventually landed contracts with several European, Latin American and Far Eastern companies before it pushed into the United States market. That was achieved largely through the 1997 acquisition of Boston Technology.Mr. Alexander had ambitious plans for Comverse and his growing wealth. He talked of turning Comverse into the Nokia of Israel. He once bragged to a reporter that he could borrow money with little more than a business plan scribbled out on a napkin.In 2000, he cashed in more than $80 million worth of options. He then fulfilled a longtime fantasy by buying a stake in Tel Aviv’s basketball team. And when he found an apartment building in New York that he liked on West 57th Street, he bought several units in the building.Yet Mr. Alexander faced a common problem for companies in the tech boom — hiring and retaining important talent.It was around that time that Mr. Alexander, along with Mr. Kreinberg, then the chief financial officer, and Mr. Sorin, Comverse’s legal counsel, started a plan to alter the dates when options had been granted to employees, backdating them to a time when the stock price was lower so that the recipient could earn even bigger profits, according to the criminal complaint filed by federal prosecutors.Prosecutors say Mr. Kreinberg, with Mr. Sorin’s knowledge, engaged in a similar backdating scheme at Ulticom, a subsidiary of Comverse that went public in 2000 and provides about 4 percent of Comverse’s revenues.Another Comverse subsidiary, Verint Systems, which provides more than 25 percent of Comverse’s revenues, is also looking into its options practices.Prosecutors said the doctoring of option grant dates began at Comverse when an assistant who is unnamed in the court filings took on the job of compiling lists of employees for whom stock option grants were being proposed, for consideration by the board’s compensation committee. The assistant kept a record of the employee names, option awards and dates in a spreadsheet.According to information provided to the government by the assistant, Mr. Alexander or Mr. Kreinberg instructed the assistant at various times to insert earlier, incorrect dates — when Comverse’s stock traded a lower price — as the dates the stock options had been granted. Mr. Sorin would then call members of the three-person compensation committee to discuss the number of options that were to be awarded. Prosecutors said two members of the compensation committee (not identified in court filings) said they assumed that the option grants were dated on the date of the telephone calls. In fact, the calls came after the dates of the grants, prosecutors said.But the backdating of options was only part of the plan at Comverse.Around 1999, Mr. Alexander and Mr. Kreinberg instructed the assistant to create a secret account for options that the two could give to employees at Mr. Alexander’s discretion, as incentives for recruitment and retention. (The assistant, who had recently seen “Phantom of the Opera,” named the pool of options “I. M. Fanton,” in a misspelled rendering of “phantom,” according to court documents.) Mr. Alexander later transferred the options from this secret account to employees.When the tech bubble burst and telecom spending around the globe stopped seemingly overnight, Comverse executives found another way to give themselves and their employees and directors more profits.As Comverse stock sank, options across the company that were granted during the boom years were becoming worthless. So, in 2002, the board recommended and shareholders approved a plan to reprice the worthless options.For Mr. Alexander, who was sitting on more than 1.9 million options that were worthless, the plan permitted him to exchange those for options with a new exercise price. Since then, he has exercised options on more than 1.1 million shares for a profit of $16 million, according to Thomson Financial.'"

"'06-08-22,'0','Mr. Hussein and six co-defendants are charged with ordering similar attacks in a 1988 military campaign to eliminate the Kurds from their mountainous redoubts in Iraq’s far northeast. Prosecutors allege that the campaign, which Mr. Hussein’s government code-named Anfal, after a Koranic phrase that refers to “the spoils of war,” killed at least 50,000 Kurds and destroyed some 2,000 villages.The two villagers’ testimony Tuesday about the 1987 attacks, which pre-date the 1988 Anfal campaign, were meant to buttress the prosecution’s main argument against Mr. Hussein: that he directed a sustained effort to wipe out Iraq’s Kurdish population, as an act of genocide.After Mr. Hama testified, prosecutors called Tuesday’s other witness, Najiba Khider Ahmed, who described how tiny bomblets sprayed a noxious black gas into her village, Shahringsalen, near Balisan.“Villagers went blind and were vomiting,” she said. “We were wounded and without sight.”Later, she said, Iraqi troops rounded up surviving villagers and took them to a camp, called Rashkeen, where Ms. Ahmed said she and other villagers were held for nine days without food or medical treatment. Her brother, nephew and 3-year-old son died there, she said.“Saddam Hussein used to say we were his people,” she said, weeping bitterly and chopping her hand through the air, with Mr. Hussein’s eyes fixated on her. “If we were his people, why did he strike us with all those weapons?”Iraqi law allows not only defense lawyers but also the defendants themselves to question witnesses. Thus, at one point, after his lawyer, Khalil al-Dulaimi, questioned Mr. Hama, Mr. Hussein rose to briefly challenge the witness himself.“Who taught him to say ‘We were attacked because we were Kurds,’ ” Mr. Hussein asked.In an eerie suggestion of how deeply the poison-gas campaign has seared the lives of Iraqi Kurds, both Mr. Hama and Ms. Ahmed referred in their testimony to relatives killed in the gas attacks as having been “Anfalized.”Elsewhere in Iraq, a spokesman for the British military in Basra said today that troop levels in southern Iraq could be significantly reduced from their current level of 7,000 soldiers by sometime next spring “if the conditions are right.”“If we continue to make progress as we have been,” said the spokesman, Major Charlie Burbridge, “then we could be in a position to change over in 9 to 12 months” that could cut the number of British troops in Iraq to 3,000 to 4,000, he said.Most of those troops would be located in or near the oil-rich port city of Basra, Iraq’s second largest city.In Basra today, oil workers refused to work their 7 a.m. shift to protest what they said was low pay, said Taha Aweed Ibrahim, a spokesman for the striking workers. The strike ended at 4 p.m., Mr. Ibrahim said, after government officials agreed to meet with the workers to discuss wage increases.Also today, the American military said it captured a Saudi Arabian man in Ramadi on Sunday who is suspected of belonging to al-Qaeda’s Iraqi network and training suicide bombers.'"
"'06-08-22,'0','In a gathering with reporters yesterday, the outgoing commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, said he had told Goodell, who was closely involved in the negotiations of the new contract, to learn as much as he could about how the new collective-bargaining agreement would work.Tagliabue also sounded a warning for owners who have already started complaining that they cannot live with the deal.“Anyone who thinks they understand the economics of the current labor deal is either uninformed or kidding you because until they get through the first year or the first two years, no one’s going to understand the economics of this deal because it’s a new deal,” Tagliabue said.The arguments are not new. Several owners of high-revenue teams have said they should not be penalized for their ability to make money from local sources, and on occasion they have even referred to revenue sharing as writing “welfare checks” to owners who, in some cases, do not exhaust all means of increasing their own local revenue.In addition, owners who have new stadiums — which are usually linked to explosive growth in revenue for franchises — point to the enormous debt they have taken on to build them.But owners of low-revenue teams believe their very existence and certainly their competitiveness, will be threatened if they do not receive enough from the revenue-sharing pot.As unhappiness festers, some owners and team executives have mentioned the possibility that owners could choose to exercise their right to opt out of the labor deal in November 2008. That would force the owners and the players union back to the bargaining table to avert a season played without a salary cap, and a potential work stoppage.“The way things are now, it would be very difficult to continue this agreement,” said Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots. “Hopefully, we’re wise enough to tweak this arrangement. It’s like government. If you want to do Great Society programs, you have to have a great economy. If you want to have it be win-win, you have to grow the business.”The collective-bargaining agreement calls for players to receive 59.5 percent of total revenue, which many owners now say is too much. Some concede that the union was able to get that much because owners had not resolved their own divisions over revenue.The agreement also included a new plan for the sharing of some locally generated revenue. That plan calls for the 15 teams with the highest revenue in the league to contribute money to a pool that would then be distributed to teams with lower revenue.That pool would be about $100 million to $150 million each season, only about 2 percent of total revenue in a league that is generating more than $6 billion a year. For low-revenue teams, their portion of the revenue sharing pie is a critically important part of their budget planning. At issue is which teams will get how much money from the pool, and the criteria that a team must meet to get their revenue-sharing check.Owners had hoped to have the matter settled by now. The league has hired the consulting firm McKinsey & Company to study revenue sharing and to analyze how each franchise exploits local revenue streams — like stadium-naming rights, luxury suites, in-stadium advertising — within the constraints of its community. That will help determine which teams deserve how much money. McKinsey was also hired to dial down the rancor between owners.“There’s nobody that can’t field a competitive team now,” said the Jets’ owner, Woody Johnson. “There might be a time where teams should be helped. The whole success of the league depends on the 32nd team being able to win the Super Bowl. How do you encourage risk-taking? Because without risk-taking you have no growth. But if teams take risk, they have to have assurances that they’ll get their money back. How do you balance that in a way that is fair?”The salary cap is intended to keep teams competitive by offering some restraint on the spending for players. According to Forbes magazine, the Washington Redskins, the team with the highest value, made $120 million more in 2004 than the Minnesota Vikings, the team with the lowest value. That extra revenue becomes most apparent in other spending: upgraded training facilities or higher pay for assistant coaches. Those are the things that low-revenue teams fear will erode their ability to compete.The Buffalo Bills’ owner, Ralph Wilson, one of only two owners who voted against the collective-bargaining agreement, has been one of the most outspoken critics of the deal and of the revenue-sharing plan. He has involved political leaders in his effort to draw attention to Buffalo’s situation.In a letter obtained by The New York Times, Tagliabue sought to assure State Senator George D. Maziarz that the Bills could be successful under the new deal.“In recent years, the Bills have had revenues at levels that have enabled them to avoid heavy dependence on special C.B.A.-related revenue sharing; the only distribution to the Bills in the current decade was $481,000 in 2003,” Tagliabue wrote in a letter dated Aug. 10.For the sake of budget planning, the revenue sharing plan needs to be in place by the end of the regular season.Goodell is likely to have support from a core group of moderate, in revenue and in temperament, owners, including the Giants’ John Mara and the Steelers’ Dan Rooney. Goodell’s task will be to persuade high-revenue owners like Kraft and Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys to buy into a revenue-sharing plan, and then to draw a few of the low-revenue owners into the fold.Twenty-four of the 32 owners must approve a revenue-sharing plan and if they do not, the commissioner can decide himself. And even then, the labor deal will almost certainly have to be tweaked, at least to avoid the owners’ opt-out.“What the changes are, I don’t think you can sit here today and say what they’re going to be until you understand how the deal works,” Tagliabue said of the new deal. “So anyone’s who’s declaring it either dead or alive is, like I say, either uninformed or at best premature.”Carmen Policy, the former president of the Cleveland Browns, recalls negotiating with Goodell about the price that would be paid by Al Lerner for the expansion team.

"'06-08-22,'0','Wilder, who had as little interest in visual expressiveness as Jackson Pollock had in figure painting, remained a literary filmmaker to the end of his career, relying on such stock techniques here as endlessly repeated lines and situations (how many times will MacMurray light Robinson’s cigar for him before the gesture has a dramatic payoff?) and a condescending approach to his audience that led him to spell out everything in large capital letters (compare Stanwyck’s blatant, vulgar sexuality in “Double Indemnity” to Jane Greer’s elusive femme fatality in Jacques Tourneur’s “Out of the Past”). But there are so many other significant talents connected with “Double Indemnity,” foremost among them Stanwyck and Robinson (here in a picture-stealing performance that accounts for maybe 20 minutes of screen time), as well as a gallery of great character actors, that the film’s schematicism barely becomes an issue. This is a very good new transfer from Universal Home Entertainment, with a range of shadow detail that will send viewers to their contrast controls for precise readjustment, and it comes with a wealth of supplementary material, including commentaries by Richard Schickel, Lem Dobbs and Nick Redman. A second disc contains Jack Smight’s 1973 television movie from the same material, starring Richard Crenna and Samantha Eggar, which falls into the thanks-but-no-thanks category. $26.98; not rated.In the film-buff world, controversy still surrounds Joseph M. Newman’s 1955 Technicolor science fiction classic, with questions ranging from the exact extent of Mr. Newman’s involvement (Universal’s in-house science fiction auteur, Jack Arnold, once said he’d directed a substantial part of it, though new research suggests that his claim was much exaggerated) to just what aspect ratio it should be shown in — the classic, nearly square Academy ratio or the more elongated screen sizes that came into fashion when the film was first released. The Universal release offers the 1.33 image, which I think is the correct one given the film’s repeated emphasis on frames within the frame (some of them circular and even triangular) that would be cut off in a more narrow ratio. In any case, those who disagree need only to push the zoom button on their remotes to transform the picture into glorious 1.85.Though “This Island Earth” was previously released by Image Entertainment in the dawning days of DVD, this new version represents a big jump in color stability and sharpness, two important qualities in Mr. Newman’s cool, precise, emotionally uninvolved style. Mr. Newman, in this case, becomes a kind of accidental Luis Buñuel, who knew well that the most outrageous situations were best served by a neutral, naturalistic mise-en-scène. Though “This Island Earth” may not offer the schlocky, extravagant scares of most 50’s science-fiction films (some action with a rubber-suited mutant has been cut in at the climax), it does stay close in its easily parodied sobriety and earnestness to the tone of much literary science fiction.The stolid Rex Reason and the smoldering Faith Domergue (a Howard Hughes discovery who didn’t quite make it) are a pair of nuclear scientists enlisted by a vaguely threatening, silver-haired corporate type (Jeff Morrow) to participate in a Georgia think tank, which turns out to be harboring a flying saucer in its basement. With William Cameron Menzies’s “Invaders From Mars” (1953) and Fred McLeod Wilcox’s slicker “Forbidden Planet” (1956), “This Island Earth” remains among the most poetic and dreamlike of 50’s fantasies, full of imagery both wonderfully inventive (the matte paintings that represent the surface of the planet Metalluna, under constant asteroid attack) and pointedly banal (the flying saucer has a polished wooden floor). There are no extras to speak of on his budget disc from Universal Home Entertainment, but the price is practically irresistible at $14.98.

"'06-08-22,'0','Having a high body mass index increases the risk of disease, health authorities agree. But in people over 75, the proportion of height-to-weight appears to be less important than the waist-to-hip ratio as a predictor of mortality, British researchers report.They recorded the height, weight, and waist and hip measurements of almost 15,000 people over 75 and assessed their health. Then they followed them for an average of six years, during which 6,649 died.After adjusting for other factors, they found that a high body mass index, or B.M.I., was not associated with death from circulatory disease, cancer, respiratory disease or all causes considered together.In fact, men with a B.M.I. below 23 and women below 22.3 were the most likely to die during the course of the study. (In younger people, an index reading over 25 is believed to put them at risk.)In the older group, a high waist-to-hip ratio — waist measurement divided by hip measurement — was a more accurate predictor of disease risk. Those with the highest waist-to-hip ratio (closer to 1) were 40 percent more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those with the lowest (about 0.8).The study was published in the August issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Astrid E. Fletcher, the senior author of the study, said the findings suggested a need for fresh thinking.'"

"'06-08-23,'0','Ensuring that the finalists from last year’s United States Open cannot meet before this year’s finals, Andre Agassi was placed in the bracket opposite Roger Federer in the draw ceremony today at the United Nations.But Agassi could face a difficult road getting to the championship match.The 36-year-old Agassi, who is retiring from tennis after his 21st United States Open appearance, will face Andrei Pavel of Romania in the first round and would face Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in the second round, should both players advance. The unseeded Agassi could face Andy Roddick in the fourth round of the tournament, which begins Monday.Patrick McEnroe, the tennis analyst for CBS Sports, said Agassi’s draw was dangerous because of the presence of Baghdatis and Roddick.“Baghdatis plays a similar game to Andre,” McEnroe said in the ceremony. “He can take the ball early and go up the line. Baghdatis has the ability to make Andre change directions. That could be a difficult match for Andre.”McEnroe said that Roddick, with a new coach in Jimmy Connors, could also provide a tough test.“Roddick seems to be finding his game,” McEnroe said. “He seems to be playing a lot more aggressively and his mindset seems very positive. The fact that Jimmy Connors was willing to take the job, after not being that visible in tennis since he retired, said a lot to Andy.”'"
"'06-08-23,'0','She said she also lost the ability to give birth. After two miscarriages and the death of an infant, “the doctor told me my womb was affected by chemical weapons,” she said.“We were not at fault,” she added. “Whoever had a hand in this is a criminal.”Another Balasan woman, Badrya Said Kheder, said nine of her family members died from a gas attack in the spring of 1987. At one point in court, she said she could not keep talking because she still suffered after-effects that affected her throat.A third woman, Bahiya Mustafa Mahmood, said she was unable to flee for the first 24 hours, even to caves nearby. Trapped in her village, she tried to soothe her burning throat with milk. But it failed.“We drank the milk and when we vomited, it was like cheese,” she said.Mr. Hussein’s team of defense attorneys have spent little time disputing the victims’ claims of being subjected to chemical weapons. Instead, particularly today, they suggested that Kurdish families were collateral damage in an effort to root out Iranian troops in the area.Several questions worked around a single inquiry: Were there soldiers in the village loyal to Iran?Every witness offered a response much like the one provided by Ms. Baiz. “No, no never,” she said. “I never saw anyone like this.”But the line of questioning continued. The attorneys asked Ms. Kheder if she knew why the area was being bombed. (“There was no reason,” she said. “They were just bombing us.”) They asked repeatedly about shelters described by victims, suggesting that they were actually bunkers for Iranian soldiers or Kurdish Peshmerga militias opposed to the Iraqi government.The legal assault intensified after Mosa Abdullah Mosa, 50, the final witness of the day, admitted to being a Peshmerga militant at the time of two chemical weapons attacks, one in 1987 and another in August 1988. After he described harrowing scenes of death and injury, with some people’s eyes falling from their sockets, a defense attorney rose to declare “he’s a traitor.”A barrage of questions followed. Had he ever fought against the Iraqi government?“Nobody asked me to participate in a military operation,” said Mr. Mosa, a father of four who now lives in Tennessee. “I was a Guard in the First Brigade headquarters.”Was the militia keeping war prisoners from Iraqi government? “Sure, there was war prisoners,” he said. “They were released.”Why didn’t he lay down his weapons, as the Iraqi government asked?“The amnesties were false,” he said. “They were just trying to arrest us.”At one point, Ali Hassan al-Majid, known as “Chemical Ali,” commander of the north at that time, stood up asked Mr. Mosa — a defendant is allowed to question a witness under Iraqi law — if he knew anyone who served in the Iraqi forces, or only people who opposed them. When Mr. Mosa said the only government was run by Kurdish political parties, Mr. Majid concluded: “Then the state had no control at all over the area where he was.”Sabir Aziz al-Douri, a former intelligence officer who is also a defendant, offered a summary of his own. In the lead-up to a question for the witness, he said, “The Iranians and the Kurdish were joined.” He said Iran had large headquarters in the area, and he asked the witness for its address.Mr. Mosa pled ignorance. “I never heard that,” he said.'"

The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down as unconstitutional a part of the tax code that said only compensation for physical injuries was tax exempt. The ruling affects only the District of Columbia, but depending on whether the Internal Revenue Service appeals to the Supreme Court or decides to adopt the finding nationwide, it could mean the end of tax bills after many kinds of trials. The court ruled that awards for intangible injuries were not income but “compensation for the loss of a personal attribute.” In that sense, they are akin to awards for physical injuries, which are tax exempt, it said.'"
"'06-08-23,'0','Later yesterday, Ms. Peterkin was charged with kidnapping, custodial interference, criminal contempt and endangering the welfare of a child, the police said. Egypt did not appear to be physically harmed, the police said, but the episode raised questions about what happened during the visit at the agency between Ms. Peterkin and her daughter. It also led the city’s Administration for Children’s Services, which has a contract with St. Vincent’s, to begin an investigation.“A.C.S. has concerns about what took place in the supervised visit, and we are asking for a full explanation about what happened,” said Sheila Stainback, a spokeswoman for the child welfare agency.Mary Louise Morgan, a managing director of St. Vincent’s, defended the caseworker involved in the visit, whom she identified as Davina Perez, an employee since March. She said that Ms. Perez “conducted supervision in this case in a manner that was completely appropriate.”“However,” Ms. Morgan added, “in light of the entire matter, we are in the process of re-evaluating our visiting procedures and protocols.”Ms. Morgan said that St. Vincent’s, a multiservice child care agency, had been under contract with the city to provide child services for more than 20 years, and that she knew of no other similar case. Ms. Stainback said that St. Vincent’s so-called Equip score in 2004, the latest year available, was 83.18, which is considered “very good,” and is based on a total of 100. The Equip score — which stands for evaluation and quality improvement protocol — is a system of evaluation intended to help the city assess and improve the quality of foster care and preventive services provided by contract agencies.Those who knew Ms. Peterkin said that she was a doting mother who seemed to have a strong bond with her daughter, but that something happened recently to cause her to lose custody.“She was a good mother, but she spoiled her,” said Ms. Peterkin’s grandmother, Maggie B. Peterkin, 91, who said she raised her granddaughter from about the time she was 5. “The kid would cry, ‘Mommy, Mommy,’ and Deneen would pick her up and hold her.”Maggie Peterkin said her granddaughter had recently suffered some kind of emotional breakdown and thought it might have been what caused a court to intervene on Egypt’s behalf. The authorities said they believed that the child was taken from her in June.The abduction on Monday occurred about 5 p.m., at the end of a visit at the fifth-floor offices of St. Vincent’s, when Ms. Peterkin asked if she could accompany her daughter to the bathroom, officials said. Ms. Perez, the caseworker, allowed the mother to take Egypt to a bathroom and then went to a desk, which was directly across from the bathroom door, to retrieve a MetroCard for Ms. Peterkin to take the subway home.When the caseworker had her back to the bathroom door, Ms. Peterkin “chose to take advantage of a brief opportunity to abduct the child,” and slipped away, Ms. Morgan said. She said Ms. Peterkin was not deemed a flight risk and had been “completely compliant and cooperative in her supervised visits.”No one in the offices noticed because the child did not raise a fuss, officials said. Ms. Perez, who did not see them leave, continued to wait for them to come out of the bathroom until a long period of time had passed. Then she went into the bathroom and realized they were missing. Ms. Perez searched the building and a nearby subway station. The agency then notified the police.Ms. Stainback said caseworkers employed by contract agencies are required to follow the city child welfare agency’s policies, guidelines and practices. She said it appeared that the caseworker, “seemed to be taking the correct steps in terms of watching the comings and goings of the child, though turning her back briefly.”'"
"'06-08-23,'0','Microsoft said yesterday that it would provide advertising for Facebook, a Web site aimed primarily at college students, over the next three years.The two did not disclose the terms of the deal, in which Microsoft will be the exclusive seller and provider of banner advertising and sponsored links for Facebook. The site, a social network that allows users to set up pages about themselves, post pictures and create discussions, attracts a youthful demographic that is highly prized by advertisers.The deal follows an announcement earlier this month that Google had agreed to pay a minimum of $900 million over three and a half years to the News Corporation to provide search functions and advertising to MySpace.com, the hugely popular social networking site.Microsoft was one of the competitors for the deal with MySpace, which earlier this month registered its 100 millionth user, compared with Facebook’s 9 million registered users. “It’s basically a consolation prize,’’ Phil Leigh, president of Inside Digital Media, a market research firm specializing in digital media, said of the deal. “But Facebook is also a legitimate test bed, a place where Microsoft can test new technology in a commercial context,’’ he said.“What we’ll see is Microsoft attempt to do some fairly leading-edge type of things, involving banner ads, animation and interactivity,’’ he added. “Whatever technology they develop and use effectively in Facebook, they’ll be able to use it elsewhere.’’'"
"'06-08-23,'0','WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 (Bloomberg News) — The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has told the Securities and Exchange Commission that he is concerned that agency rules are slowing a Congressional inquiry into whether political influence derailed an investigation of the Pequot Capital Management hedge fund.“I have serious concerns about indications that the S.E.C. plans to impose unnecessary delays on Congress’s ability to get to the bottom of this important matter,” Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, wrote in a letter sent Monday to the S.E.C. chairman, Christopher Cox.Mr. Grassley said he was told by the associate general counsel at the S.E.C., Richard Humes, that documents could not be given to Congress without approval from the agency’s five commissioners. The earliest this could happen, Mr. Humes said, was Tuesday, the date of the commission’s next meeting. Mr. Grassley asked that the condition be waived.Gary J. Aguirre, a lawyer fired by the S.E.C. last year, told the Senate Judiciary Committee in June that he was not allowed to interview the chairman of Morgan Stanley, John J. Mack, while he was investigating insider trading claims against Pequot. Mr. Mack was briefly chairman of the $7 billion fund.Senate investigators are looking into whether the S.E.C. suspended its inquiry of Pequot for political reasons.A S.E.C. spokesman, John Heine, said, “We are committed to cooperate with the committee on finance and its staff to satisfy them as to the integrity of our investigative process.”A spokeswoman for Mr. Grassley, Jill Kozeny, did not return a phone call seeking comment.Senator Grassley and Senator Arlen Specter, Republican from Pennsylvania and head of the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr. Cox for documents related to the inquiry of Pequot Capital in a letter dated Aug. 2.'"
"'06-08-23,'0','By The Associated Press The Atlanta Falcons traded running back T. J. Duckett to the Washington Redskins yesterday as part of a three-team deal and acquired the holdout receiver Ashley Lelie from the Denver Broncos. The Broncos received Washington’s third-round pick in the 2007 draft as part of the deal, according to two officials within the league who spoke on condition of anonymity because the trade had not been announced.Last season, Duckett gained 380 yards and led Atlanta in touchdowns with eight. Lelie was the N.F.L.’s leader in yards per catch in 2004, but he held out of training camp this year in hopes of forcing a trade.Washington had been shopping for a running back since the star Clinton Portis partly dislocated his shoulder in the preseason opener against Cincinnati. The Redskins are unsure if he will be ready for the start of the regular season. Portis began his rehabilitation this week but has questioned whether the shoulder would hold up for the entire season because it would be an obvious target for opposing tacklers.The Falcons, meanwhile, were eager to land another receiver after losing Brian Finneran to a season-ending knee injury in the early days of training camp.COLTS WAITING FOR SIMON Indianapolis defensive tackle Corey Simon, a former Pro Bowl selection, is likely to miss a few more weeks after having arthroscopic surgery on his injured left knee.

"'06-08-23,'0','LOS ANGELES, Aug. 22 — Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and California lawmakers said Tuesday that they had agreed to raise the state’s minimum wage to $8 an hour over the next two years, making it among the highest in the nation.The governor had vetoed previous minimum wage bills, and had hoped to nudge this wage increase to $7.75, just $1 more than the current $6.75-an-hour minimum, which was passed in 2002. But under pressure from labor unions and the Democratically controlled Legislature, and facing re-election in November, Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, reconsidered.Under the deal worked out between the governor and the state’s Democratic leaders, minimum-wage workers would receive a 75-cent increase on Jan. 1, and an additional 50 cents in 2008. The bill needs to be approved by the full Legislature, which lawmakers of both parties said would happen by the end of the month.“I am very happy that we have made the decision together that we increase the minimum wage,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said at a news conference in Sacramento. “We have to make tough decisions, but to me this is the right decision to make.”“This is an election year,” he added. “To get this stuff done with Democrats and Republicans just really shows a lot.”'"

Does this president have any concept of reality?The country’s psyche is disgusted with the war in Iraq. Even the generals charged with waging war and winning the peace are privately saying that civil war is now a fact of life.The puppet government is ineffective, the police force is a disaster, and there is virtually no infrastructure left to support the economy.I hope that Mr. Bush gets his wish that “we clarify the different points of view’’ in the November elections. This is a failed president and a failed policy. Let’s heed the Democrats and begin an orderly pullout of American troops before more are lost or physically and emotionally wounded.President Bush creates conditions that contribute to an increase in the threat of terrorist activity against Americans, then faults those who favor changing those conditions, claiming that they create a more dangerous world.

"'06-08-23,'0','Performed on a balcony divided by neo-Grecian columns at Cipriani on Wall Street and seen in its first performance Monday at noon, this exercise by Ellis Wood Dance offers 20 women in vaguely flesh-colored undergarments and lots of red tulle.There are four fivesomes, with the central figure in each quintet bound in tulle, the rest cascading off down toward the street. Dead center is an orating actress, Cheryl Cochran, who intones a poem by Bil Wright. There is also a steady onslaught of no doubt deliberately cheesy music by Daniel Bernard Roumain.The idea is to posit Woman as the free, soaring spirit against the dull conformity of men in their “gray-flanneled armor.” Never mind that the audience on the opposite sidewalk seemed to consist mostly of dance fans and puzzled tourists, and that most of the gray-suited crowd had their coats off and walked right on by.The poetry is full of lines like “I am Venus, I am on fire” and “We are all free to burn,” which seemed a tad tasteless as the fifth anniversary of 9/11 approaches. The next logical step would be for a Chippendale’s troupe to perform in a suburban mall with poetry dissing “drab housewives with their squalling brats” and exalting the unencumbered freedom of randy Man. That might be deemed insensitive, even rude. Anyhow, the shock of the red tulle against the gray facade looks striking, and it is vaguely amusing to see the 20 women gyrating and writhing and squealing and twisting in their tulle bondage and beckoning down to the street while cooing, “Come on, come on, come on,” all the while safely protected by height and distance from any actual confrontation.But any hoped-for assertion of buoyant womanly triumph is sunk in a vast sea of silliness.'"
"'06-08-23,'0','As he spoke he drained several small plastic bottles of water in an attempt to expunge the lingering effects of his latest late night. Then he got down to making his favorite midnight snack, perhaps repurposed that day as a hangover cure.He started with the aioli.“Most Cubanos you get in run-of-the-mill places are too dry: the aioli makes them moist and adds another layer of flavor,” he said as he sliced garlic cloves in half. He minced the cloves and mixed them in a stainless steel bowl with egg yolks and mustard. Then he turned on the tap, ran his fingers under the faucet, and shook water droplets over the bowl.“A little water helps the eggs emulsify,” he said, drying his hands on a dish towel. “I think I learned that trick from my mother, who probably learned it in Italy.”Although Mr. Pelaccio is best known for his hot and steamy passion for Southeast Asian cuisine (he lived and cooked in Malaysia and Thailand), his first young love was Italian food. His parents lived in Rome before he was born, and Mr. Pelaccio grew up in Westchester County on his mother’s homemade carbonara, gnocchi, and penne with long-simmered meat sauce. As a college student he spent a semester in Florence, where spleen sandwiches with ricotta and slow-roasted pork dishes factored into his curriculum as persistently as Italian language courses.“Italy has informed my cooking style as much, or more, than Southeast Asia,” he said.This is one reason the panini press loomed large on the menu at Chicken Bone. It worked great for Cubanos, too.As he spoke Mr. Pelaccio coiled the slightly damp dish towel into a snake, and set it beneath the bowl of yolks to steady it as he whisked in the oils. Even with the anchor, however, the bowl slid and skidded on the counter.“Yeah, either that or a prep cook,” he said as he maneuvered the whisk, eventually ending up with a glossy bowl of pungent aioli.Next he tore up a hunk of roasted pork shoulder with his fingers and warmed the unctuous shreds in a skillet on the stove. Mr. Pelaccio roasts Berkshire pork for his recipe, but one could easily buy roast pork.“Just make sure it’s got some fat on it, like this,” Mr. Pelaccio said, holding up a chunk completely covered in pearly white. Once he shredded and heated it, the fat melted into a glistening pool, making a kind of confit.He piled the pork onto a baguette that he had copiously slathered with the aioli, to keep things moist, of course. Then he layered on grated aged Gouda and prosciutto and sliced jalapeños that he had pickled a few days before.Instead of a panini maker, Mr. Pelaccio pressed the sandwich between two heated cast-iron skillets. The flattened Cubano emerged singed black on top and golden around the edges, where the cheese had leaked out and crisped into lacy shards, like an Italian frico. The sandwich was voluptuous and assertive from the aioli; the pork was tender as velvet, seasoned with the salty cheese and the crunchy, fiery bites of pickled jalapeño. It was far more interesting and complex than the usual Cubano, but just as comforting and compelling. One might have even called it a crowd-pleaser.'"

"'06-08-24,'1','The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which announced the voluntary recall along with Apple, said the company had reported nine incidents of batteries overheating, including two that resulted in minor burns and property damage. The agency said no serious injuries or deaths were reported.Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., would not give any details about when it began getting reports of problems or when it began to investigate. “We discovered that some Sony batteries in previous models of PowerPC-based iBooks and PowerBooks do not meet Apple’s standards for safety and performance,” said Katie Cotton, Apple’s vice president of corporate communications.As was the case with the Dell batteries, the problem is contamination by metal particles inside the lithium-ion battery cells. The microscopic particles are able to bridge a porous separator between the positively and negatively charged zones of the cell and cause a short. This sets off a chemical chain reaction that can lead to the release of hot gases and liquids, smoke or a fire.Sony said that it “anticipates no further recalls of battery packs using these particular battery cells.” It also said it had changed its manufacturing process to improve the safety of the cells. “We believe the issue has been addressed to the satisfaction of our customers,” a company statement said.Jonathan Hoopes, a securities analyst with ThinkEquity Partners, said he did not think that the recalls would significantly hurt the two PC makers. “It will be a blemish on Apple’s brand as it was a blemish on Dell’s brand, but this is Sony’s problem,” he said.Apple’s recall could actually help Dell’s image, said Charles Smulders, managing vice president and a PC industry analyst at Gartner, a market research firm. “For Dell, having another vendor with a recall is good,” he said. “It shares the blame.”Sony supplies battery packs, or cells for them, to other laptop makers, but a company spokesman, Rick Clancy, said that because of the way those other notebooks are configured, the Sony batteries in them should not pose a fire hazard.Both Dell and Apple said they would continue to use Sony batteries in their laptops.Although market analysts say they do not think the recalls will hurt sales of laptop computers, which have been growing at an annual rate of about 45 percent this year, they say the industry is taking the risk of fires seriously. Computer makers fear that airlines or governments, for instance, may place limits on the use of laptops on planes. Today, before Apple’s announcement, the Japanese Trade Ministry ordered Sony and Dell to report the findings of their investigations into the notebook fires.Earlier this week, the leading notebook makers, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Lenovo, said they would be forming an industry group to try to set standards for lithium-ion batteries. Standards could reduce the complexity of the safety systems inside the notebooks that monitor the batteries. “I think that’s meaningful,” said Ted Schadler, the principal analyst for consumer technology at Forrester Research.Apple has recalled laptop batteries twice before: 28,000 batteries in August 2004 and 128,000 in May 2005. In those cases, the batteries were made by LG Chem of South Korea.An Apple Web site with information on the recall, support.apple.com/batteryprogram, was slowed by heavy traffic throughout the afternoon after the announcement was made today. At times it was difficult to reach. Those who succeeded in requesting a replacement were told they would get the battery pack in four to six weeks.Owners of affected computers should remove the battery packs and use the AC adapter to power the computer until the replacement arrives, the Consumer Product Safety Commission advised.'"

"'06-08-24,'1','Mark Regev, the spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, categorically rejected the claim that Israel had “acted outside international norms or international legality concerning the rules of war.” Unlike Hezbollah, he said, Israel did not target the civilian population, nor did it indiscriminately target Lebanese civilian infrastructure.He added: “Our job was made very difficult by the fact that Hezbollah adopted a deliberate policy of positioning itself inside civilian areas and breaking the first fundamental distinction under the rules of war, by deliberately endangering civilians. Under the rules of war, you are legally entitled to target infrastructure that your enemy is exploiting for its military campaign.”Citing a variety of sources, the Amnesty International report said Israel’s air force had carried out more than 7,000 air attacks, while the navy had fired 2,500 shells. The human toll, according to Lebanese government statistics, was estimated at 1,183 deaths, mostly civilians, about a third of them children; 4,054 wounded; and 970,000 people displaced, out of a population of a little under four million.“Statements from the Israeli military officials seem to confirm that the destruction of the infrastructure was indeed a goal of the military campaign,” the report said. It said that “in village after village the pattern was similar: the streets, especially main streets, were scarred with artillery craters along their length. In some cases, cluster bomb impacts were identified.”“Houses were singled out for precision-guided missile attacks and were destroyed, totally or partially, as a result,” the report said. “Business premises such as supermarkets or food stores and auto service stations and petrol stations were targeted.“With the electricity cut off and food and other supplies not coming into the villages, the destruction of supermarkets and petrol stations played a crucial role in forcing local residents to leave.”The Amnesty International report said the widespread destruction of apartments, houses, electricity and water services, roads, bridges, factories and ports, in addition to several statements by Israeli officials, suggested a policy of punishing the Lebanese government and the civilian population in an effort to get them to turn against Hezbollah.“The evidence strongly suggests that the extensive destruction of public works, power systems, civilian homes and industry was a deliberate and integral part of the military strategy rather than collateral damage,” the report said.It also noted a statement from the Israeli military chief of staff, Lt. Gen Dan Halutz, calling Hezbollah a “cancer” that Lebanon must get rid of “because if they don’t, their country will pay a very high price.”The Amnesty International report came as a number of international aid and human rights agencies used the current lull in fighting to assess the damage.The United Nations Development Program said the attacks had obliterated most of the progress Lebanon had made in recovering from the devastation of the civil war years. “Fifteen years of work have been wiped out in a month,” Jean Fabre, a spokesman for the organization in Geneva, told reporters.Another urgent issue, aid groups say, is the number of unexploded bomblets from cluster bombs littering the southern villages. Tekimiti Gilbert, the operations chief of a United Nations mine removal team, told reporters in Tyre: “Up to now there are at least 170 cluster bomb strikes in south Lebanon. It’s a huge problem. There are obvious dangers with people, children, cars. People are tripping over these things.”United Nations officials say at least five children have been killed by picking up the bomblets scattered about by the cluster bombs.Despite the cease-fire, southern Lebanon remained tense on Wednesday. Three Lebanese soldiers were killed trying to defuse a rocket that had not exploded. An Israeli soldier was killed and two others wounded when, according to the Israeli military, they walked over a minefield that Israel had previously buried.The Israeli military also said it had fired artillery rounds from the disputed territory of Shabaa Farms to the Lebanese village of Shabaa. There were no reports of casualties.'"
"'06-08-24,'1','After a year away from baseball, he tried to rekindle his career. But when tryouts in Arizona during spring training led nowhere, Querrey accepted that his athletic career was over and channeled his energy into becoming a first-rate businessman.“To succeed at sports or anything, you have to be committed to it 100 percent, and that was not the case for me with baseball,” Mike Querrey, a chief production officer for a mortgage company, said in a telephone interview. “I did not wake up every day and say, ‘Gosh, I want to play baseball.’ That’s not at all who I was.”Sam Querrey was introduced to tennis at age 7, when his family moved from San Francisco to Santa Rosa, an hour’s drive north, in search of more affordable housing. Though neither parent played tennis, they joined a swim and tennis club, La Cantera, because they thought it would be a fine way to make new friends. Chris enrolled Querrey in junior clinics, private lessons being beyond the family’s budget.Erin Morales, still the manager of the club, remembers Querrey picking up the game so quickly that he made it to the final of a club tournament that first summer while competing against youngsters who were considerably older. “He was 7 years old playing against 16-year-olds, and he was unruffled by that situation,” Morales said in a telephone interview. “From the beginning, there was a calmness about him. He was very comfortable competing.”Querrey enjoyed tennis, but he did not commit himself to it until he was 15, after grudgingly discarding baseball, football and basketball like favorite T-shirts that he had outgrown. “I liked them all, but I was best at tennis,” he said.By taking a route that bypassed tennis academies and did not go through the European junior circuit, Querrey was free to develop his game without feeling pressure to produce results. His parents were fine with his approach, their approval steeped in the belief that the more sports he played, the more friends he was likely to make.Querrey’s resistance to specializing at an early age cost him a few years of national exposure but preserved his childhood, a tradeoff he considers well worth it. Living his teenage years with his family in Southern California, he graduated with his class this year at Thousand Oaks High School and attended the senior ball. After losing in the first round of singles and doubles at the Legg Mason tournament in Washington, he said he was looking forward to returning to Southern California for two weeks. He wanted to relax at the beach with his school friends.“I’ve kind of lived more of a normal life,” Querrey said. “I’ve had more fun doing it that way and being a regular kid.”His plan all along was to attend at least one year of college before turning professional. His parents prepared accordingly, keeping meticulous records of all the expense money Querrey received while playing in pro events during his senior year in high school, lest the N.C.A.A. express concerns about his eligibility.But the better he played in those events, the harder it became to maintain his amateur status. For much of the spring, Querrey agonized over what to do. “By the time he signed the pro contract, he was so mentally exhausted we didn’t talk about it for a few days,” Chris Querrey said.Did her husband’s past inform her son’s decision? “Oh, definitely,” she said. “No doubt at all.”Patrick McEnroe, the United States Davis Cup captain, engaged Querrey as a practice partner during two of the United States’ recent matches. Besides being impressed with Querrey’s court sense, McEnroe said: “I like his attitude. He’s very low-key. He’s very much in touch with who he is.”Since turning pro, Querrey has not upgraded his surfer’s wardrobe. He has not moved out of the Thousand Oaks home that he shares with his parents and 16-year-old sister, Ellen. He remains appreciative of every opportunity that comes his way, so much so that after his hitting sessions with the Davis Cup team, he sent McEnroe a handmade thank-you note.But on the court he is not the same. “The moment I turned pro, my whole mentality when I was practicing changed,” Querrey said. “I became more focused. I started working out harder. You kind of realize tennis is your life now.”When Querrey was pondering turning pro, his coach, Grant Doyle, a former world No. 1 in juniors from Australia, told him he would need at least two weapons to survive. Querrey responded by spending three months working diligently on his serve and forehand. Doyle believes Querrey will eventually be able to serve consistently in the 150-mile-an-hour range (he can hit 130 to 135 now). “He’s kind of like a baby Roddick,” Floyd said.Earlier this month, as Querrey’s friends began leaving for college, Chris Querrey wondered if her son was having any second thoughts about turning pro. “Are you happy with your decision?” she said to him.Querrey smiled and said he was. He recognizes his good fortune. “All my friends would change whatever they’re doing to do what I’m doing,” he said.'"
"'06-08-24,'1','There is nothing that makes us more nervous than the Bush administration declaring something an “unqualified success.”That is exactly what Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said about welfare reform this week. In fact, in a column in The Salt Lake Tribune marking the 10th anniversary of welfare reform, Mr. Leavitt stressed the need for more of the same: stricter work requirements for poor people and a diversion of taxpayer dollars into programs to promote marriage.That is deeply disturbing. An anniversary like this should be a time of reflection, of building on what has worked and fixing what hasn’t. A “mission accomplished” attitude pre-empts any meaningful attempts to do just that.Very few people would argue that welfare reform has been a failure, or that the country should go back to the old system of open-ended welfare eligibility with no serious emphasis on work requirements. But it is flat-out wrong to declare victory as if the hard part of the journey is over. The evidence says otherwise.For the first five years, the shift from welfare to work went largely as hoped, with employment rates for single mothers rising and child poverty rates falling, helping to reduce the number of welfare cases. But since 2000, employment rates for single mothers have fallen and child poverty has increased. Caseloads have continued to fall, indicating that welfare is reaching fewer children at a time of rising need.That the economy was stronger in the mid-1990’s than in the current decade is not the only — or even the primary — reason for the backsliding. An important difference is the extent of government support for the working poor.Welfare reform has often been touted as a triumph of market incentives. But when it passed in 1996, government was deeply involved, offering supportive policies and programs, including a higher minimum wage, expanded aid for child care, a big expansion in the earned income tax credit to ensure that work paid better than welfare, and an extension of health insurance to all low-income children. Such support has diminished in the Bush years. Without it, people who would formerly have been trapped on welfare have very little chance of turning into anything other than working people trapped in poverty.'"
"'06-08-24,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 23 — Apple Computer said Wednesday that it would pay a one-time $100 million licensing fee to use Creative Technology’s patented music player technology, settling a string of recent legal disputes between the two companies.Creative, a maker of portable music players that compete with Apple’s iPod, had accused Apple of violating a newly granted software patent covering the way users navigate music selections.Creative applied for its patent in 2001 and was granted it in August 2005, soon after Apple’s application for a similar patent was denied. Creative filed its suit in federal court in San Francisco on May 15, and at the same time filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission to block the importing of iPods, which are made primarily in China. Apple countersued a week later.“This settlement resolves all of our differences with Creative, including the five lawsuits currently pending between the companies, and removes the uncertainty and distraction of prolonged litigation,” said Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive. Creative was “fortunate” to have been granted the patent as early as it did, Mr. Jobs said.Under the terms of the settlement, Apple could recoup part of its payment if Creative succeeded in licensing its patents to other companies. Apple will get to use Creative’s technology in all its products.'"
"'06-08-24,'1','Merck sold almost $3 billion of Vioxx a year before it withdrew the drug in September 2004 after a clinical trial showed that Vioxx sharply increased patients’ risks of heart attacks and strokes. Merck now faces more than 14,000 lawsuits from people who say that they suffered heart damage after taking Vioxx.And yet a drug in the same class as Vioxx — Celebrex, made by Pfizer — continues to have annual sales of nearly $2 billion, despite carrying an F.D.A.-ordered warning label that it, too, may pose heart risks.If Arcoxia is approved, Merck could regain some of the profits it lost when it withdrew Vioxx — money that could conceivably help the company pay the legal bills it faces over Vioxx.The new study, which covered 34,000 patients, shows that Arcoxia’s risks are comparable to the older painkiller, diclofenac, Merck officials said.Diclofenac, a prescription drug sold under brand names that include Cataflam and Voltaren, is not popular in this country, in part over concerns that it causes liver problems. But it is widely used in Europe.Merck is pursuing a high-risk strategy in pressing ahead with its application to sell Arcoxia in the United States, scientists said. Accusations that Merck did not tell doctors everything it knew about the risks of Vioxx have damaged the company’s reputation. Merck must now persuade skeptical regulators and doctors that it is fully disclosing Arcoxia’s potential hazards.Dr. Steven E. Nissen, the president of the American College of Cardiology, said Merck should have disclosed more information from the Arcoxia trial or not discussed it at all.“The bottom line here — they didn’t really release enough data for us to make a conclusion,” said Dr. Nissen, who is overseeing a large clinical trial sponsored by Pfizer to study the heart risks of Celebrex. “It was a very carefully crafted press release.”Dr. Bruce Psaty, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington, said that the trial would have been more meaningful if Merck had used naproxen — sold over the counter as Aleve — as a comparison drug, rather than diclofenac.Dr. Sean Curtis, who heads the Arcoxia development program for Merck, said the company would disclose the study’s full results before the end of 2006, both in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and at a medical conference.“We really want to present the entirety of the data after peer review,” Dr. Curtis said.Diclofenac is an appropriate comparison drug for the study because it is so widely used worldwide, he said.The Merck study, called Medal, included results from three clinical trials comparing Arcoxia and diclofenac. Patients took the drugs for an average of 17 months, and 10,000 patients took them for two years or more, Merck said.On average, patients who took Arcoxia were slightly less likely to have a heart attack or other serious cardiovascular problem than those who took diclofenac, according to the company.But patients on Arcoxia were significantly more likely to have hypertension or swelling, Merck said. Hypertension is a particularly troubling side effect, doctors said, because it is associated with heart attacks and congestive heart failure.Arcoxia and Vioxx, as well as Celebrex, are part of a class of drugs developed in the 1990’s called cox-2 inhibitors. Older painkillers like ibuprofen inhibit the production of two enzymes, cox-1 and cox-2, that cause inflammation and pain. But cox-1 enzymes also protect the stomach and taking the older medicines for long periods of time can lead to stomach pain or gastrointestinal bleeding.Drugs like Vioxx and Celebrex were specifically formulated to suppress the cox-2 enzyme without affecting cox-1. Scientists hoped that they would provide pain relief without damaging the stomach.But clinical trials have shown that Celebrex and Vioxx appear to cause many more heart attacks and strokes than the older medicines. The reason is still open to debate. But many cardiologists now argue that cox-2 is crucial to the proper functioning of blood vessels and that inhibiting it may increase the risk of dangerous blood clots.Another question that remains unanswered is whether the cox-2 inhibitors actually prevent stomach damage. In clinical trials, only Vioxx has been shown to reduce stomach bleeding compared with older painkillers.In reporting the main findings of the Medal study yesterday, Merck said that patients on Arcoxia had significantly fewer stomach and liver problems than those on diclofenac. But it did not explain whether the difference resulted from an excess of liver problems, stomach problems or both.Dr. Sidney Wolfe, the director of health research for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said Merck needed to provide much more information about the results of the trial.“They’re not presenting data or anything, they’re giving you a little hint,” Dr. Wolfe said. “There are more unanswered questions here than answered questions.”Dr. Psaty, the University of Washington professor, said that because diclofenac suppressed the cox-2 enzyme more strongly than other older painkillers, it could have some of the same heart risks as Arcoxia and other new cox-2 drugs.Unless a government agency carries out a large independent trial, patients and doctors may never know which painkillers are the safest, Dr. Psaty said.'"
"'06-08-24,'1','MOGADISHU, Somalia, Aug. 23 — The seaport here in the Somali capital reopened Wednesday for the first time in 11 years, the latest sign that the city’s Islamist rulers are trying to restore confidence after more than a decade of anarchy.Mogadishu International Seaport still must undergo drastic renovations after so many years of disuse, but it is ready to receive commercial traffic, said Sheik Abdulkadir Ali Omar, a member of the Islamic militia that has taken control of the capital and much of southern Somalia in recent months.The seaport has not been operational since 1995, when United Nations forces left Somalia during political and clan-based violence. The country’s last effective government was toppled in 1991 by rival warlords who then turned on each other.Businesses and aid agencies used a smaller port outside the capital.Mogadishu’s international airport, closed more than 10 years, reopened a month ago. Flights have been coming in and out of the airport daily, but it was not immediately clear how much traffic the seaport would get. Somalia still has no coast guard or navy, and pirate attacks are frequent along the country’s lawless coast.'"
"'06-08-24,'1','MOSCOW, Aug. 23 — Ukraine’s new prime minister, Viktor F. Yanukovich, has promised that his government will refrain from siphoning natural gas from Russia’s export pipelines to meet Ukraine’s shortfall this winter, a practice that has incensed Russian officials who characterize it as stealing.The assurance was the latest step by Mr. Yanukovich, a pro-Russian politician, to address some of the conflicts between Ukraine and Russia since Parliament elected him prime minister on Aug. 4.The move was a concession, of sorts, to Russia — Ukrainian officials had never publicly admitted taking the gas without paying — but one also likely to ease worries in Western Europe over the security of energy supplies this winter. About 80 percent of Russia’s gas exports to Western Europe pass through Ukraine.Mr. Yanukovich, who lost the election that came to be known as the Orange Revolution in 2004 but staged an improbable political comeback this summer, has brought a more conciliatory stance to the energy talks with Russia, as expected. Talks are under way for a contract for gas supplies in 2007.Mr. Yanukovich said Ukraine’s national energy company, Naftogaz, was preparing for the winter heating season by storing gas underground.'"

Rosenblatt, an analyst at Marble Harbor Investment Counsel, a money management firm that owns G.E. shares.Others suggested that Mr. Calhoun might be thinking of a new career as a turnaround artist for equity firms.“His operating experience could have an impact on any business,’’ said Jeffrey Sprague, who follows G.E. for Citigroup. “And now he’s in a sphere where he can identify companies that he can then help turn around.”While many had anticipated Mr. Calhoun’s departure from G.E., few expected it to come so soon.In July 2005, as part of a companywide realignment of businesses aimed partly at retaining executives, G.E. named Mr. Calhoun vice chairman for the newly created GE Infrastructure. The unit is a $47 billion business at the heart of G.E.’s strategy for industrial growth — on the surface, a higher-level job than running VNU, which had revenues of $4.3 billion last year.“Dave had such a huge portfolio here, we expected we’d get at least three years,’’ said William J. Conaty, senior vice president for human resources at G.E.Mr. Conaty said that Mr. Calhoun told him on Aug. 14 that he would leave, so G.E. had time to set up an orderly transition. In fact, G.E. worded its announcement yesterday as if it were describing a planned management shuffle rather than a scramble to replace a crucial executive.G.E. said that John G. Rice, 49, currently head of GE Industrial, would lead GE’s Infrastructure business, and that Lloyd G. Trotter, 61, who has been leading a corporate cost-cutting push, would now run GE Industrial. It also promoted Mr. Trotter to vice chairman, making him the first African-American to hold that position at G.E.“Jeff is sorry to lose Dave, but he took the opportunity to powerfully demonstrate his commitment to diversity,’ said Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan business school who has written extensively about G.E.Shareholders of G.E. seemed to take Mr. Calhoun’s departure in stride.

"'06-08-24,'1','A federal appeals court decision that barred the government from taxing some types of damage awards may encourage challenges to other sections of the tax law, legal experts say.The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled Tuesday that the government could not collect taxes on awards to compensate for nonphysical damages like emotional distress or injury to reputation. The court struck down as unconstitutional a provision of a 1996 law allowing taxation of such awards.Tax law experts said the ruling would encourage legal challenges to other parts of the tax code defining what income could be taxed. They also said the government would probably appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.“It’s certainly going to launch a thousand constitutionality arguments that people would have thought laughable before,” said Michael Graetz, a Yale University law school professor and a tax official in President George H.

A Justice Department spokesman, Charles Miller, said the department was reviewing the decision and had not decided whether it would appeal.'"
"'06-08-24,'1','LOS ANGELES, Aug. 23 (AP) — Frustrated by what they see as lax enforcement of immigration law, some businesses are suing competitors, accusing them of hiring illegal workers to achieve an unfair advantage.Businesses and groups opposing illegal immigration call the suits an effort to create an economic deterrent against hiring illegal workers.“We see the legal profession bringing to this issue the kind of effect it’s had on consumer product safety,” said Michael Hethmon of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, one group backing the efforts.In the first of what are to be a series of lawsuits, Global Horizons, a Santa Monica temporary-employment agency that supplies farm workers, brought a case Monday against two competitors and a grower. Companies planning to file additional suits include farms and factories that depend heavily on immigrant labor, said David Klehm, the lead lawyer for cases in Southern California.Similar cases have been brought in the past by employees claiming violations of federal antiracketeering laws, and have yielded mixed results. But the Global Horizons suit, legal experts say, is believed to be the first taking aim at illegal immigration on the basis of a state’s unfair-competition laws.'"
"'06-08-24,'1','The butterfly association also raises the concern that interbreeding of otherwise separate populations could cause genetic deterioration of endemic varieties that have adapted to local conditions and warp migratory behaviors. In principle, the farm-raised butterflies may also carry unfamiliar strains of pathogens, although diseased larvae rarely survive to adulthood.A less plausible concern is that the released individuals will compete with the natives for food; nectar is rarely in short supply. But the feeding of the subsequent generation is a more complicated issue: painted ladies larvae eat thistles, which include both nasty, invasive weeds and endangered species.Painted ladies aren’t the only issue; at $10 a pop for monarch butterflies, the butterfly association claims that commercializing these creatures generates another business: poaching. And in general, the butterfly folks have a deep, moral concern: they are appalled by having butterflies turned into fluttering playthings.Are mail-order butterflies worth the costs? Certainly, they are beautiful, but so are flowers and most brides. Butterflies do stimulate students’ curiosity, but so do ant farms (and the insects can be collected locally).As for the excitement of releasing butterflies, this is precisely the wrong lesson. Turning loose mail-order organisms is a recipe for disaster, given that billions of dollars are spent controlling invasive species that originated from heedless releases. So far, ecological harm by schoolroom butterflies to native fauna and flora is unproven. But the potential severity is sobering — as is the absence of any plan by industry or government for remediating damage.So we have a classic industry-conservation conflict: the North American Butterfly Association versus the International Butterfly Breeders Association. The conservation group advocates banning the release of commercial butterflies (an unlikely development) while the breeders deny that there’s a problem (a risky wager). So what’s the answer?There are reasonable compromises that address the most serious concerns, which, it is fair to say, are more educational and ethical than environmental. For weddings, butterfly farms could be required to ship only sterile adults. Of course, research would be needed to find the right dose of radiation or chemosterilant for a butterfly species, but the breeders claim to be concerned about wild butterflies and the butterfly association could “walk the walk” of conservation by offering some money for studies. The neutered butterflies might be a bit more expensive, but cost can’t be a big issue for a father of the bride who’s already plunking down $300 for the “Fill the Sky” package.But what about the eager students and future (might we say, larval) entomologists?Kill them. Not the students, the butterflies. If the point of the educational venture is to teach important lessons, then here’s one: We are responsible for the harm that we may cause in the world. So once the butterflies have emerged, pop them in the freezer. Tell the children that protecting our environment is not always easy, that we must accept the responsibility that comes with bringing a life into the world, and that like other animals produced for our needs and wants (the industry refers to the butterflies as “livestock”) we owe the butterflies a quick and painless death.If this is too harsh a lesson to teach in a culture that assiduously avoids confronting death, then a savvy teacher could work with students to collect local caterpillars, raise them and release the butterflies whence they came. That’s a real lesson in science — and ethics.'"
"'06-08-24,'1','Sumner Redstone, the 83-year-old chairman of Viacom, is old and cranky and enough of a loose cannon to have blurted out what ordinary people have been thinking for months, that Tom Cruise is out of control. It’s always fun when someone in Hollywood is blunt. Mr. Redstone cited Mr. Cruise’s distracting off-screen behavior as the main reason Paramount Pictures (owned by Viacom) chose not to renew its contract with his production company.Yet Mr. Redstone soon fell into the usual showbiz doublespeak, when he said of Mr. Cruise, “As much as we like him personally, we thought it was wrong to renew his deal.” He got that backward, at least from the moviegoers’ perspective. Tom Cruise’s real problem is: We just don’t like him anymore.Losing his likability is the cardinal sin for any movie star, and Mr. Cruise’s began to plummet even before his couch-jumping days. In the annual Harris poll charting America’s favorite movie stars, done every January, Tom Hanks — the essence of likability, genial on talk shows, a nice guy on screen — was ranked No. 1 for the last two years. Mr. Cruise hasn’t even been in the Top 10 since the poll in 2004, when he ranked No. 5.What stars like Mr. Hanks and Julia Roberts have is a connection to the audience that shines through the characters they play and has the audience on their side. Even the best actors sometimes use their likability as a wink to the audience: Meryl Streep as the wicked fashion editor in “The Devil Wears Prada” is more endearing than a villain should be, partly because it’s fun to watch Ms. Streep do comedy.The essence of Mr. Cruise’s appeal going all the way back to “Risky Business” and on through crowd-pleasers like “Jerry Maguire” was a fresh-faced, unpretentious exuberance, a glee that practically leapt off the screen and that even worked in unlikely roles like the outraged, paraplegic Vietnam veteran in “Born on the Fourth of July.”Mr. Cruise had that energy and connection as recently as 2004, and his last terrific acting job, in “Collateral.” He played against type as a villain with graying hair and he had to share the starring role with Jamie Foxx, but his audience was happy to see him really acting again instead of just outrunning some “Mission: Impossible” fireball.'"

To crank up the music, just dial up a song with the Nano’s scroll wheel and push Play.'"
"'06-08-24,'1','How high does it have to go? The answer is $2.10 a gallon. That is the price necessary to induce those who have gasoline to sell it now rather than to wait till next week.This argument does not depend on whether you think the gasoline market is a paragon of perfect competition or an evil oligopoly. All it requires is that you believe that people who own gasoline, like just about everybody with something to sell, prefer to receive a higher price rather than a lower price.Even if the price of gasoline were set by a perfectly benevolent conservationist, we would expect to see the same pattern of price movements. If oil will be scarcer in the future because of the BP pipeline shutdown, we would want to conserve the already-produced gasoline that we have now. That means that the price of gasoline has to rise right away to prevent hoarding and to encourage conservation.Storage arbitrage arguments were featured in a recent article in the Sunday Business section of The New York Times with the headline “Is a Futures Stampede Keeping Oil Prices High?” The article described a provocative report written by Ben P. Dell, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, that blamed speculation in oil futures markets for high oil prices.Mr. Dell’s argument was that inexperienced institutional investors had been investing in contracts for future delivery of oil, driving up futures prices. If the price of oil to be delivered in the future goes up, it has to pull the current spot price up as well.There is no risk associated with holding the oil in storage since owners can sell futures contracts, collecting a payment now to deliver the oil later. If you don’t happen to have a tank of oil in your backyard, that is not a problem: just go out and buy some on the market. The article pointed out that on Aug. 4 it was possible to “buy heating oil in New York Harbor at $2 a gallon and store it and sell a future to deliver it in December for $2.24.”Perhaps Mr. Dell is right that speculation in the oil futures market is driving up spot prices. But we should not expect that to be the normal situation. As long ago as 1953, Milton Friedman argued that speculation normally helps to stabilize prices rather than destabilize them.Mr. Friedman’s argument was applied to currency trading, but the same reasoning works here. If speculative trading tends to push prices higher when they are already high and lower when they are already low, then traders must be buying high and selling low.That would mean that traders have to lose money on average — which does not seem very likely. To the contrary, speculative traders try to buy low and sell high, activities that by their nature tend to push prices up when they are too low and down when they are too high.Since Mr. Friedman’s 1953 article several papers have been published, both supporting and attacking this argument. But the general principle seems quite robust.Mr. Dell’s report specifically cited the rush of new and inexperienced traders into commodities markets as the cause of the current problems. Mr. Friedman’s argument was a long-run argument: speculators who bought high and sold low would be driven out of business.But there is no reason speculators cannot lose money in the short run, particularly if they are inexperienced. Mr. Dell says that storage facilities are now close to capacity, which will make it more difficult to play the arbitrage game in the future. Indeed, crude oil prices have declined nearly 8 percent in the last two weeks.If speculators start to worry that the price of oil could soon be significantly lower, some of that stored oil would come back on the market, pushing spot prices down, and offering welcome relief to consumers.'"

"'06-08-25,'0','“When you have good product in guys like Gary, Jerry and now Garrett, it makes your job a lot easier,” Anderson said.Still, there is perhaps no other job in the business of sports that demands such a diverse and eclectic set of skills. Anderson must be a sharp handicapper and salesman, a methodical thinker. He also is a full-time travel agent, a part-time shrink and a sometime whipping boy.A jockey’s agent must supply his rider with a steady diet of “live horses” — those with a chance to win — while the trainers that he solicits demand a dependable jockey with a measure of loyalty. Often, it is an uneasy tightrope to walk.For example, the trainer Michael Matz is still angry with Bob Fries, the agent for Prado, over an incident that happened before the 2004 Arlington Million near Chicago. Six days before the race, Matz said, Fries reneged on a commitment to have Prado ride his horse, Kicken Kris, to ride another horse in the race.Even though Kicken Kris won the race, and Prado rode Barbaro in three of his six victories including the Kentucky Derby, Matz had few kind words about Fries.Anderson has mostly avoided these types of dust-ups during his career, which began in his native Southern California when he was 18. While the majority of jockeys churn through agents as quickly as they switch racing silks, Anderson has enjoyed long tenures with his clients.He had Stevens’s book, as the jockey-agent relationship is known at the racetrack, for nine and a half years; Chris Antley’s for six; and Bailey’s for five years until his retirement in January.Anderson has made a nice living along the way. Gomez earns 10 percent of every purse his mount wins, and 5 percent of the second- and third-place checks. Anderson collects 25 percent of his rider’s total earnings.“You want an agent who makes my job easy,” the trainer Todd Pletcher said. “When you give them a mount, you want them to show up, ride the best they can and not turn you around. Ron is a man of his word if he says his jock is riding your horse. You don’t have to worry about reading somewhere else that the guy is ending up on another horse.”To meet the needs of Gomez and the horsemen, Anderson is in constant motion. Before he approaches a trainer, his computer has told him which horses’ speed figures are the strongest and which fit with the projected pace of a race that may not be drawn for days. Another program tells him which competing jockeys are committed to ride which horses in the future.“I have a spreadsheet that shows the conflicts,” Anderson said. “Let’s say a jock has been riding two good horses that are likely to meet each other, or maybe one of them is going to run out of town on the same day. He and his agent are going to have to make a decision on which horse to ride.“So I need to get to both trainers and let them know Garrett is available if they lose their rider. It’s like digging under the fence to get there first.”It was Anderson’s reputation among horsemen that united him with Gomez, 34, and brought both of them east to New York last spring. When Bailey retired, Anderson was looking for a rider and Gomez wanted to change agents. One morning, Anderson recognized the number of the California trainer Julio Canani on his ever-ringing cellphone.“I got someone you need to talk to,” Anderson recalled Canani telling him before abruptly handing the phone to Gomez.Gomez had been tearing up the California circuit for a few years after putting to rest some personal problems that had thwarted his career. In 2003, Gomez spent 40 days in jail for narcotics possession.Unlike Bailey, who was the best jockey in the nation when Anderson became his agent, Gomez was a talented rider but not a finished product. Anderson saw an opportunity to help build a career as he did with Stevens, or to resuscitate it as he had with Antley.“I was no slouch as a rider before Ron,” Gomez said. “But I wanted that extra edge that would get me on very good horses and to win big races.”Within 24 hours of the telephone call, Anderson left New York for California. Gomez and Anderson returned east in April when Pletcher beckoned. Pletcher has long relied on John Velazquez as his main rider; they topped last year’s trainer and jockey standings.In April, however, Velazquez injured his shoulder and ribs in a spill at Keeneland and Pletcher was looking for a replacement. Pletcher had been impressed with Gomez on the few mounts he had given him out west; he had known Anderson for years.Beyond the opportunity to ride the best horses from the best barn in the richest races, Anderson worked other barns to get Gomez new mounts. When Velazquez returned in June, Gomez not only was established as Pletcher’s backup rider, but he also had a new client list.Anderson and Gomez rarely talk more than once a day, and each says he really does not understand the nuances of the other’s job.“I know he has data and a method to why I end up on what horses,” Gomez said. “But I don’t talk to him about it, just like he doesn’t tell me how to ride my horses.”After 33 years as a jockey’s agent, Anderson understands why it is good that he and Gomez do not talk more.“You only hear from them a lot when they go three days in a row without a winner,” Anderson said. “And it’s never good. So far, we’re not having that problem, and truthfully I’m excited. We’ve really only started together.”'"
"'06-08-25,'0','They cordoned off the street where Mr. Priklopil lived here, less than 10 miles northeast of Vienna, and released photos of the place in his house where the woman said she had been held.One photograph showed a small, cluttered room and narrow concrete stairs leading down to it from a tiny entrance that would have had to have been crawled through. Another photo showed a metal hatch that sealed the windowless, underground room.A federal police spokesman, Armin Halm, said there was a bed and a toilet in the cramped space. Images on television showed a small television in the room, which also had a sink and was littered with piles of books.Sabine Freudenberger, one of the first police officers to have contact with the woman on Wednesday, told an Austrian television station that the man apparently threatened her and said that was probably the reason she did not try to flee sooner.The police said the woman had been examined by a doctor and did not have signs of injuries, but added that her condition was still being studied.Officer Freudenberger said she believed the woman had been sexually abused but did not yet realize it, saying that the woman said “she did everything voluntarily.”Ms. Kampusch’s mother, Brigitta Sirny, said on Austrian television that she was very proud of her daughter.“She said ‘mama mausi’ to me,” Ms. Sirny said, recalling the emotional moment she met with the woman and embraced her. Mausi — literally “little mouse” — is a pet name some Austrians use in addressing their loved ones.Ms. Kampusch’s father, Ludwig Koch, his eyes glistening and voice wavering, told Austrian televisions that he had thought he would never see his daughter again.The state broadcaster ORF carried remarks from Erich Zwettler of the Austrian federal police saying that the woman escaped from her captor when the door to her hiding place was left open and she ran into a nearby yard, where she told an elderly woman she had been kidnapped and identified herself as Natascha Kampusch.Nikolaus Koch, a lead investigator, said on Austrian television that the police had contact with the suspected kidnapper about three months after Natascha disappeared in 1998. He had a “sturdy alibi” at the time, Mr. Koch said.'"
"'06-08-25,'0','There have been other eventful moments in the series, including the tackle of a scrambling Chad Pennington in 2003 that left him with a broken wrist and led to a 6-10 regular-season record.Last season, the Giants beat the Jets, 15-14. It was the first Giants’ victory in 10 years during the preseason series, which the Jets lead with 19 victories and 17 losses. There has been one tie.The veteran Giants receiver Amani Toomer, who has seen 11 of these preseason games and the buildup that goes with them, said interest in the series was piqued every few years because one team or the other was breaking in a new coaching staff.“We have that again for the Jets, and what that means is that they’re trying to build a new identity for the team,” Toomer said. “It’s an opportunity for them to prove to the city what they can do differently. So we’ll see. We want to prove ourselves, too, in our stadium. Otherwise, sometimes I think it’s more for the fans than anyone.”Giants cornerback Corey Webster said that as a rookie last season he was cautioned by veteran players to expect a higher level of intensity when facing the Jets than in a usual preseason game.“It might be the fans that get everyone jacked up because they’re more pumped than for a regular preseason game,” Webster said. “This year, I guess we’ll get booed in our stadium. Of course, we’ve been booed by Giants fans there, too.”The game is important on a level that has nothing to do with the rivalry. Friday’s game is the third of four in the preseason, which represents a turning point. The third game is traditionally the only one in an N.F.L. team’s preseason when the starting units play more than a half.The first two games are for shaking the rust off, with brief appearances by top players, and the theme of the last game is protecting the stars and figuring out which final cuts to make at the bottom of the roster.“The third preseason game is the closest to a regular-season game,” Giants quarterback Eli Manning said. “It’s not the same, but it is when you start trying out some things in real time that you hope to do in the regular season.”For the first time during the preseason, the Giants trained this week with a scout team that at least minimally mimicked the Jets’ defensive schemes so that the offense could rehearse how to attack it. That helps the coaching staff evaluate the success of players in carrying out a strategy.Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said Wednesday that Manning would play into the third quarter against the Jets and that Jared Lorenzen, one of the wild-card prospects of training camp, would be his replacement.Lorenzen, a 2004 free-agent pickup who has never played a regular-season down for the Giants or any other team, is clearly being auditioned for the No. 2 quarterback job, which would be a big step for an unknown talent.“This game is a significant measuring stick,” Coughlin said. “And because it’s against the Jets, we know we’ll get an aggressive game. That’s what we want, a good test.”'"
"'06-08-25,'0','The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which announced the voluntary recall along with Apple, said the company had reported nine incidents of batteries overheating, including two that resulted in minor burns and others that caused some property damage. The agency said no serious injuries or deaths were reported.Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., would not give any details about when it began receiving reports of problems or when it began to investigate. “We discovered that some Sony batteries in previous models of PowerPC-based iBooks and PowerBooks do not meet Apple’s standards for safety and performance,” said Katie Cotton, Apple’s vice president of corporate communications.As was the case with the Dell batteries, the problem is contamination by metal particles inside the lithium-ion battery cells. The microscopic particles are able to bridge a porous separator between the positively and negatively charged parts of the cell and cause a short circuit. This sets off a chemical chain reaction that can lead to the release of hot gases and liquids, smoke or fire.Sony said that it “anticipates no further recalls of battery packs using these particular battery cells.” It also said it had changed its manufacturing process to improve the safety of the cells. “We believe the issue has been addressed to the satisfaction of our customers,” the company said.Jonathan Hoopes, a securities analyst with ThinkEquity Partners, said he did not think the recalls would significantly hurt the two PC makers.“It will be a blemish on Apple’s brand as it was a blemish on Dell’s brand, but this is Sony’s problem,” he said.Apple’s recall could actually help Dell’s image, said Charles Smulders, managing vice president and a PC industry analyst at Gartner, a market research firm.“For Dell, having another vendor with a recall is good,” he said. “It shares the blame.”Sony supplies batteries, or the lithium-ion cells for them, to other laptop makers, but a company spokesman, Rick Clancy, said that because of the way those other notebooks are configured, the Sony batteries in them should not pose a fire hazard.Both Dell and Apple said they would continue to use Sony batteries in their laptops.Although market analysts say they do not think the recalls will hurt sales of laptop computers, which have been growing at an annual rate of about 45 percent this year, they say the industry is taking the risk of fires seriously. Computer makers fear that airlines or governments, for instance, may place limits on the use of laptops on planes. On Thursday, before Apple’s announcement, Japan’s trade ministry ordered Sony and Dell to report the findings of their investigations into the notebook fires.Earlier this week, the major notebook makers, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Lenovo, said they would form an industry group to try to set standards for lithium-ion batteries. Standards could reduce the complexity and improve the reliability of the safety systems that monitor the batteries inside the laptops, said Ted Schadler, the principal analyst for consumer technology at Forrester Research.Apple has recalled laptop batteries twice before: 28,000 batteries in August 2004 and 128,000 in May 2005. In those cases, the batteries were made by LG Chem of South Korea.An Apple Web site with information on the recall, support.apple.com/batteryprogram, was slowed by heavy traffic on Thursday afternoon after the announcement was made. At times it was difficult to reach. Those who succeeded in requesting a replacement were told they would get new batteries in four to six weeks.Owners of affected computers should remove the battery and use the AC adapter to power the computer until the replacement arrives, the safety commission advised.Shares in Apple rose 50 cents, to close at $67.81.Apple has had battery problems with its iPod music player, but none involved safety issues. Many of the batteries could not hold a charge after being used for a while.To cut down on customer complaints and settle a lawsuit, the company agreed to extend the warranty on some players, replace others and give customers vouchers that could be used to buy Apple products.'"
"'06-08-25,'0','The inquiry is likely to focus on whether Israel properly informed the United States about its use of the weapons and whether targets were strictly military. So far, the State Department is relying on reports from United Nations personnel and nongovernmental organizations in southern Lebanon, the officials said.David Siegel, a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy, said, “We have not been informed about any such inquiry, and when we are we would be happy to respond.”Officials were granted anonymity to discuss the investigation because it involves sensitive diplomatic issues and agreements that have been kept secret for years.The agreements that govern Israel’s use of American cluster munitions go back to the 1970’s, when the first sales of the weapons occurred, but the details of them have never been publicly confirmed. The first one was signed in 1976 and later reaffirmed in 1978 after an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. News accounts over the years have said that they require that the munitions be used only against organized Arab armies and clearly defined military targets under conditions similar to the Arab-Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973.A Congressional investigation after Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon found that Israel had used the weapons against civilian areas in violation of the agreements. In response, the Reagan administration imposed a six-year ban on further sales of cluster weapons to Israel.Israeli officials acknowledged soon after their offensive began last month that they were using cluster munitions against rocket sites and other military targets. While Hezbollah positions were frequently hidden in civilian areas, Israeli officials said their intention was to use cluster bombs in open terrain.Bush administration officials warned Israel to avoid civilian casualties, but they have lodged no public protests against its use of cluster weapons. American officials say it has not been not clear whether the weapons, which are also employed by the United States military, were being used against civilian areas and had been supplied by the United States. Israel also makes its own types of cluster weapons.But a report released Wednesday by the United Nations Mine Action Coordination Center, which has personnel in Lebanon searching for unexploded ordnance, said it had found unexploded bomblets, including hundreds of American types, in 249 locations south of the Litani River.The report said American munitions found included 559 M-42’s, an anti-personnel bomblet used in 105-millimeter artillery shells; 663 M-77’s, a submunition found in M-26 rockets; and 5 BLU-63’s, a bomblet found in the CBU-26 cluster bomb. Also found were 608 M-85’s, an Israeli-made submunition.The unexploded submunitions being found in Lebanon are probably only a fraction of the total number dropped. Cluster munitions can contain dozens or even hundreds of submunitions designed to explode as they scatter around a wide area. They are very effective against rocket-launcher units or ground troops.The Lebanese government has reported that the conflict killed 1,183 people and wounded 4,054, most of them civilians. The United Nations reported this week that the number of civilian casualties in Lebanon from cluster munitions, land mines and unexploded bombs stood at 30 injured and eight killed.Dozen of Israelis were killed and hundreds wounded in attacks by Hezbollah rockets, some of which were loaded with ball bearings to maximize their lethality.Officials say it is unlikely that Israel will be found to have violated a separate agreement, the Arms Export Control Act, which requires foreign governments that receive American weapons to use them for legitimate self-defense. Proving that Israel’s campaign against Hezbollah did not constitute self-defense would be difficult, especially in view of President Bush’s publicly announced support for Israel’s action after Hezbollah fighters attacked across the border, the officials said.Even if Israel is found to have violated the classified agreement covering cluster bombs, it is not clear what actions the United States might take.In 1982, delivery of cluster-bomb shells to Israel was suspended a month after Israel invaded Lebanon after the Reagan administration determined that Israel “may” have used them against civilian areas.But the decision to impose what amounted to a indefinite moratorium was made under pressure from Congress, which conducted a long investigation of the issue. Israel and the United States reaffirmed restrictions on the use of cluster munitions in 1988, and the Reagan administration lifted the moratorium.'"
"'06-08-25,'0','MONTGOMERY, Ala., Aug. 24 — When Patricia Todd won the Democratic primary runoff for a seat in the Alabama Legislature last month, the big news might have been her sexual orientation. With no Republican opponent, Ms. Todd seemed poised to become what political observers said would be the first openly gay officeholder in state history.But instead, it is the fact that she is white, in a majority black district in Birmingham, that has become the burning issue. One of the state’s most powerful Democrats, who had earlier urged voters not to support Ms. Todd because she is white, is backing a challenge to her nomination that could end her candidacy.On Thursday, a Democratic Party subcommittee heard a challenge to Ms. Todd’s candidacy on the ground that she had violated a rule that, by party officials’ own admission, has not been enforced in nearly 20 years. The subcommittee voted to disqualify both Ms. Todd and her runoff opponent, a black businesswoman named Gaynell Hendricks, because neither had complied with the rule.The full party committee, which will meet Saturday, can now either overturn the decision or uphold it and appoint a replacement candidate, and Ms. Hendricks would be eligible. But Ms. Todd’s campaign manager, Mark Kelly, said the dispute would almost certainly end up in court.The challenge was brought by Ms. Hendricks’s mother-in-law. But it was tacitly supported by Joe L. Reed, a longtime Democratic kingmaker and the party’s vice chairman of minority affairs. Mr. Reed had urged voters to support Ms. Hendricks, and at one point the Alabama Democratic Conference, a black political organization that he is chairman of, gave a check to cover the $3,000 fee needed to bring the challenge in case Ms. Hendricks missed the deadline. He also controlled the subcommittee; three of the five members were drawn from a pool of Mr. Reed’s appointees.'"
"'06-08-25,'0','The embattled securities class-action law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman was dealt another blow yesterday after a prominent trial lawyer, Patricia M.

Ms. Hynes did not return phone calls seeking comment.Milberg Weiss has struggled to keep lawyers, clients and crucial cases after a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted the firm and two of its name partners in May on criminal charges involving $11.3 million in illegal secret payments that were made to individuals who served as plaintiffs in more than 150 lawsuits over several years.Since the indictment, several lawyers have left Milberg Weiss, including four partners who will be joining the Dreier law firm in New York in early September. As lawyers in other cities have joined other firms or started their own, Milberg Weiss has shut offices in Boca Raton, Fla., and Washington and will soon shut one in Delaware.'"
"'06-08-25,'0','“The question is whether the state of human rights in the Philippines is sliding back to a time when political killings were a norm,” said Curt Goering, senior deputy executive director of Amnesty International USA.The government denies that it is involved, and President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo recently said she was creating a commission to investigate the violence.“The president has condemned these killings in the strongest terms and is determined to take all the necessary measures to protect human rights and uphold the rule of law,” said her spokesman, Ignacio Bunye.Amnesty International’s conclusion that the government is implicated is based in part on the similarity of the killings, often involving surveillance and death threats like those that have driven Ms. Perido into hiding. The fact that few arrests have been made also suggests government involvement or complicity, it said.This sense of fear has succeeded in choking off much of the work — particularly in rural areas like this one — of human rights advocates, farmers groups, labor organizers, church workers, activist lawyers and leftist local officials.“Before, we could mobilize more than 50 people to conduct fact-finding,” Ms. Perido said, describing her work in investigating and reporting on killings and other abuses. “Now in this area there are only four leaders available to do it.”On one recent mission here, 93 miles north of Manila, she was accompanied by two men who said they had also come out of hiding to visit the sites of recently reported abuses.“It is difficult now because, even if we are only asking for better prices for rice, we are accused of being communists,” said one of the men, Boy Facunla, 49, who heads a leftist farmers’ group. “For 20 months, I have not been home. There is a rumor that there is a standing order for me to be shot.”Modesto Reyes, 47, who was with him, said that he had once been an armed fighter in the Communist New People’s Army but that for years now he had worked above ground, particularly in organizing protest rallies.“They are two methods of struggling for the same goal,” he said. “We are different from them; we are legal organizers.”But in the eyes of the military, he said: “We are all connected. If you are a supporter of one group, now the impact on yourself is that you are a supporter of the armed group.”One hamlet they visited, Namulandayan, was the scene of a massacre in 1987 in which the military, frustrated in its pursuit of a unit of communist guerrillas, rounded up and killed 17 villagers, including 6 children. Many others were wounded.That massacre helped wreck a cease-fire with the communist insurgency that had been declared the previous year when Corazon C. Aquino was swept into the presidency on a wave of hope and reconciliation.Many in the military had opposed the cease-fire then, just as they have opposed efforts at reconciliation initiated by Mrs. Arroyo when she took office in 2001.She invited the leftists to form political parties and to bring their contest above ground into a legal arena. But it is these legal groups that now appear to be the targets of the killings.Like Mrs. Aquino, Mrs. Arroyo has found herself trapped by a debt to the military, which helped bring her to office and has supported her in the face of coup threats and coup attempts.In June she declared an “all-out war” on the insurgency, and she has praised military officers widely believed to be connected to the killings, who she said had “come to grips with the enemy.”There are still clashes with armed communist guerrillas here at the foot of the mountain range called the Cordillera. But what the villagers now say they fear are the killings and kidnappings that surround them.The site of the massacre is abandoned and overgrown with weeds and bushes, but some of the survivors still walk past to work in the rich green rice fields that surround it.After sundown, the little houses nearby are dark and silent. “The people say, ‘We are afraid,’ ” said the Rev. Arleen P. Tagasa, the parish priest of Lupao. “‘We try to listen to the sounds because maybe the military will come and abduct us.”Not long ago, a tricycle taxi driver who lived in Namulandayan, Elpidio Gante, 56, was shot and killed by unknown men for unknown reasons.He had not been publicly involved in leftist activities and his widow, Nievres Gante, said he had not received threats or warnings. One night he went out to work; in the morning she was told to collect his body.Just across a hedge lives his cousin, Jovita Lacasandile, 44, who was wounded in the massacre in 1987. Her husband and parents were killed. One younger sister lost a hand.She still weeps when she is reminded of that day. But now it is the killings by stealth that trouble her sleep.“We don’t know who did it,” she said of her cousin’s death. “Just like that, he is dead. We are all afraid here nowadays because we never know when we will hear that somebody else has been killed.”'"
"'06-08-25,'0','HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., Aug. 23 — For someone who was one of the Jets’ top receivers last season, Justin McCareins does not sound confident about where he stands this season.On Wednesday afternoon, after the Jets finished their final practice of training camp and prepared to meet the Giants in a preseason game Friday night at Giants Stadium, McCareins was asked if what he accomplished last season should count for something when he was evaluated by the new coach, Eric Mangini.“I don’t know,” said McCareins, a sixth-year player who averaged a team-best 16.6 yards a reception last season. “I’m not a coach. I don’t have an opinion just because it wouldn’t matter what I thought about that, anyway. I’m just looking to improve every chance I get out on the field to become the player that I want to be and that I know I can be. What the coaches and the bosses decide to do is up to them. I’ll leave it at that.”McCareins was second to Laveranues Coles on the Jets last season with 43 receptions. He had a team-high seven catches of 20 yards or more; the Jets had 24 such receptions over all.But that was last season under the old coaching staff. McCareins started this year’s training camp in Mangini’s doghouse and on the physically unable to perform list after failing a conditioning drill. He was relegated to the second-team offense in practice last week, and he has to be hearing footsteps even when there is no defensive back tracking him.'"
"'06-08-25,'0','Vernon M. Ingram, a molecular biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who discovered that a single genetic mutation caused the blood disease sickle cell anemia, died on Aug. 17 in Boston. He was 82.The cause was injuries stemming from a fall, according to M.I.T.A professor of biology, Dr. Ingram was best known for his discovery, in the early 1950’s, that a single amino acid substitution is responsible for the molecular abnormality that leads to sickle cell anemia. While studying the genetics of hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen in blood, he found that this single mutation caused production of abnormal variants of the protein.Today, many diseases, like hemophilia and cystic fibrosis, are known to result from alterations in a single gene.Graham C. Walker, another M.I.T. biology professor and a longtime colleague of Dr. Ingram, called the discovery “one of the absolutely seminal discoveries in the history of molecular biology.”In recent years, Dr. Ingram focused his research on neuroscience, especially Alzheimer’s disease.He and colleagues had been examining a group of compounds that in cell culture experiments appeared to reverse some of the early effects of Alzheimer’s that are caused by deposits of plaques that attack patients’ brains.Dr. Ingram was born in Breslau, Germany. He studied at Birkbeck College at the University of London, earning a bachelor’s degree in chemistry in 1945 and a doctorate in organic chemistry in 1949.'"
"'06-08-25,'0','It wasn’t until the stars’ Emancipation Proclamation in the mid-1940’s, when Olivia de Havilland challenged her studio contract in court and won, that the balance of power began to shift.In the early 50’s, the old studio system collapsed entirely under the double blows of declining audiences lost to television and an antitrust suit that forced film companies to divest themselves of the theaters they owned. A power vacuum opened, which the stars happily filled.The legendary agent Lew Wasserman engineered a profit participation deal for his client Jimmy Stewart in 1950 that gave him half of the studio’s take from his films; at the same time, stars like Burt Lancaster were forming their own production companies, trading their movies for financing. From the hapless film executives’ perspective, the inmates had finally taken over the asylum.The talent have been running the asylum ever since, and the studios have had little choice but to let them. With hundreds of millions of dollars now riding on each picture, the star has been the best way of shortening the odds against failure.Indeed, as Hollywood has relied increasingly on the first weekend grosses, stars have accrued even more power. Stars who can open pictures — that is, attract fans before even word-of-mouth has had a chance to operate — have become a precious commodity. This is how Mr. Cruise, maybe the best opener ever, became the highest-paid star in history.But the conventional wisdom that big stars make big profits for the studios has been under attack recently. Wracked by the growing uncertainty of the market as audiences pursued other entertainment options and by oscillating grosses that unaccountably rise and dip, studio heads have been flummoxed.Studios have, for years, thrown money at stars with salaries escalating to more than $20 million a picture — and that doesn’t even include stars’ participation in a movie’s gross, or cushy production deals, like Mr. Cruise’s, which was said to be costing Paramount $10 million a year.With all the money spent on stars, not to mention exorbitant production budgets, the profit margins for the studios have grown thinner and thinner. It was only a matter of time before executives would come to question whether this arrangement was worth it.For Mr. Cruise, it didn’t help that he exhibited his oddball behavior just when the economics of stardom seemed most uncertain. Sumner Redstone, the head of Paramount’s parent company, estimated that Mr. Cruise’s falling popularity cost Paramount up to $150 million on “Mission: Impossible III.” As Mr. Redstone saw it, Mr. Cruise overplayed his hand, both financially and personally.Still, this isn’t only a Tom Cruise problem. In disengaging from Mr. Cruise, Mr. Redstone issued a warning to other puffed-up stars with inflated salaries and demands. After decades of studios threatening to draw the line, Paramount actually had the chutzpah to do it. Everyone is now on notice: The moguls want their power back.But if this is the empire striking back, one wonders if it is a bold stroke or a foolhardy miscalculation.Paramount’s salvo against its biggest star may be an attempt to bring some financial sanity to the old asylum. But it’s also another sign of just how badly the film industry has lost its bearings in this new media environment, where the once-reliable teenage audience is suddenly less reliable; video games and the Internet are making the inroads into movies that TV once did; and DVD sales, which once seemed like the studios’ salvation, are plummeting.The stars, for their part, have helped create an untenable economic situation. But even though Mr. Redstone wants to bring them to heel, he is devaluing the movies’ greatest asset, and opening a breach the studios alone can’t fill. The fear in Hollywood is that Mr. Redstone may be smashing the star-driven model without putting anything in its place but financial responsibility, and audiences don’t line up to see financial responsibility.Of course, Hollywood is accustomed to prophecies of doom. The difference this time is that everyone — stars and executives alike — seems clueless. The asylum is out of control and no one knows what to do about it.'"
"'06-08-25,'0','AOL said yesterday that it would offer movies from four major Hollywood studios for downloading on its Internet video service.AOL, which is owned by Time Warner, said films from 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Universal Pictures and the Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Group would be available for download on AOL Video for $9.99 to $19.99 a movie.AOL Video started in August as a service for searching and downloading a wide range of video content from the Web.The service also allows users to buy or watch free thousands of television shows from any of 45 video-on-demand channels, including programs licensed from MTV, the Nickelodeon and Comedy Central networks and A&E Television Networks.Yesterday’s announcement came amid growing competition in the online video business, which includes the movie download sites CinemaNow and Movielink, as well as the online DVD rental company Netflix.Fred McIntyre, vice president of AOL Video, said the service’s strength was its search function and breadth of content. He did not say how many movie titles would be available for download.“Our focus,’’ he said in an interview, “is on providing a single source for users to be connected to all the video that’s available online.”'"
"'06-08-25,'0','The last thing this country needs as it heads into this election season is another attempt to push the intelligence agencies to hype their conclusions about the threat from a Middle Eastern state.That’s what happened in 2002, when the administration engineered a deeply flawed document on Iraq that reshaped intelligence to fit President Bush’s policy. And history appeared to be repeating itself this week, when the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, released a garishly illustrated and luridly written document that is ostensibly dedicated to “helping the American people understand” that Iran’s fundamentalist regime and its nuclear ambitions pose a strategic threat to the United States.It’s hard to imagine that Mr. Hoekstra believes there is someone left in this country who does not already know that. But the report obviously has different aims. It is partly a campaign document, a product of the Republican strategy of scaring Americans into allowing the G.O.P. to retain control of Congress this fall. It fits with the fearmongering we’ve heard lately — like President Bush’s attempt the other day to link the Iraq war to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.But even more worrisome, the report seems intended to signal the intelligence community that the Republican leadership wants scarier assessments that would justify a more confrontational approach to Tehran. It was not the work of any intelligence agency, or the full intelligence panel, or even the subcommittee that ostensibly drafted it. The Washington Post reported that it was written primarily by a former C.I.A. official known for his view that the assessments on Iran are not sufficiently dire.While the report contains no new information, it does dish up dire-sounding innuendo, mostly to leave the impression that Iran is developing nuclear weapons a lot faster than intelligence agencies have the guts to admit. It also tosses in a few conspiracy theories, like the unsupported assertion that Iran engineered the warfare between Israel and Hezbollah. And it complains that America’s spy agencies are too cautious, that they “shy away from provocative conclusions.”'"
"'06-08-25,'0','THE lights at Madison Square Garden were dim on Wednesday night. Mariah Carey wasn’t onstage yet. But her recorded voice was booming through the speakers, dispensing clichés to the cheering crowd.For instance: “Sometimes life can be kind of like a roller coaster.” And, from time to time we all get “a moment of peace.” Also, our lives are “part of God’s bigger plan.” And finally, inevitably, “Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.”At the time it seemed as if Ms. Carey was talking about the ups and downs or her life and career. Her recent years in the music-industry wilderness are by now a big part of the Myth of Mariah, even though in retrospect they don’t seem all that dire. “Glitter,” the movie and the album, were absolute bombs, but the semi-successful follow-up album, “Charmbracelet,” was pretty good, and it demonstrated that there would probably always be a million or so people willing to buy a pretty-good Mariah Carey album. Still, it was last year’s “Emancipation of Mimi” (Island Def Jam) that really put her back on top, and she’s clearly relieved. During Wednesday’s concert two of the most effusive dedications went to L. A. Reid and Doug Morris, the executives who helped make “Mimi” last year’s best-selling CD.How could we have known, at the beginning of a totally entertaining and slightly weird night, that Ms. Carey’s clichés would come true, right there onstage? The show included a few guest appearances (Jay-Z and Da Brat during “Heartbreaker”; Diddy during “Honey”), lots of ovations and all the costume changes you’d expect. But it also gave Ms. Carey a chance to demonstrate her singular talent for embellishment, vocal and otherwise. Give her a molehill, she’ll make you a mountain. Give her a chance for a concert that should be a victory lap, she’ll make it feel more like — yes — a roller coaster. There were plenty of not-quite-life-threatening ordeals that must have made Ms. Carey stronger.She chided DJ Clue, who had his own podium next to her band, when she mentioned his name and he didn’t respond with an appreciative scratch or shout-out. She saw an expression she didn’t like on the ever-smiling face of Trey Lorenz, her duet partner (for the Jackson 5 hit “I’ll Be There”), and wondered aloud whether he was in a bad mood. And before nearly every song, she fretted about the dire threat of throat-parchedness; luckily, her water bottle was usually in exactly the right place.Her concert, like the great “Mimi” album, emphasized club jams over ballads. Early on, a show-stopping rendition of “My All” came back to life as a thumping house track. And she often emphasized the extremes of her vocal range: the smoky low notes and the smoke-alarmy high ones.'"
"'06-08-25,'0','LibriVox celebrated its anniversary on Aug. 10, around the same time it surpassed the 100-book mark. It also offers more than 200 recordings of short stories, plays, speeches, poems and documents like the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence. By comparison the audiobook industry, which typically sells recordings for $15 to $30, released 3,430 titles, taking in $832 million, in 2004, the last year for which figures are available.LibriVox’s founder, Hugh McGuire, 32, a software developer and writer in Montreal, said there were another 100 works in development, all of which would be recorded, edited and uploaded by volunteers.“The principles of the project are to be totally noncommercial, totally ad free, totally volunteer and totally public domain,” he said. Readers can volunteer at the Web site, librivox.org.One of LibriVox’s colleagues in the free audiobook realm is Telltale Weekly (telltaleweekly.org), which sells recordings for 25 cents to $8, but makes them available at no charge through its Spoken Alexandria Project (spokenalex.org) after five years or 100,000 downloads, whichever comes first. It was founded in 2004 by Alex Wilson, a writer and actor in Chapel Hill, N.C., who performs many of the readings. Another service, LiteralSystems (literalsystems.org), has 51 works available for free download and emphasizes their professional quality.The audio format of choice for each service is MP3 (though Spoken Alexandria and LibriVox offer other options), which means the audiobooks can play on any computer and most digital music players. Unlike with commercial audiobooks, listeners are free to copy and share the recordings.All three services rely on Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.org), the online repository of works in the public domain, for texts. Listeners often can choose from several recordings of the same work; LibriVox, for example, offers three readings of the Gettysburg Address. Among the most recorded authors are Jane Austen, Mark Twain, Herman Melville, Jack London, L. Frank Baum, Lewis Carroll, William Shakespeare and Lucy Maud Montgomery (“Anne of Green Gables”).LibriVox’s volunteers, who record solo or in collaboration, are restricted in their material only to previously published works in the public domain in the United States. This open policy has let the personal preferences of readers shine through, Mr. McGuire said.“If someone turned up with a smut book from 1850, we would do it,” he said. “We did ‘Fanny Hill,’ which is an early erotic Victorian book. Everyone was laughing in the discussion forums about having to keep quiet while recording so their kids wouldn’t hear them.”Other LibriVoxers have proposed reading the Koran (some have already read chapters of the Bible), recording Supreme Court decisions and reciting pi to an unknown, but you can assume lengthy, number of digits. A multilingual recording of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights is underway, as is a full cast recording of “The Pirates of Penzance.”While some listeners object to the wide variety of recording quality, Mr. McGuire said, “our take on it is if you think a recording is done badly, then please do one and we’ll post it as well.”LibriVox has more than 1,800 registered volunteers, and its audience continues to grow.“Last week I listened to an early Agatha Christie novel as I shopped for groceries, chopped vegetables, sewed a hem or took my walk,” Arlene Goldbard, a New York writer and social activist, wrote on her blog after enjoying her first LibriVox recording in June.The other free audiobook services are more centralized in their administration, often with one person doing most of the work and recording (meaning listeners had better enjoy that person’s voice and narration style). They tend to select works with the best chance of gaining mass appeal, and put an emphasis on maintaining consistent production values.Warren Smith, the founder of LiteralSystems, searches out local actors and voice talent in Santa Fe, N.M., where he lives. He also actively seeks donations and sponsorships to finance his work and help pay performers.“I started with a MiniDisc recorder and now have a little 8-by-8-foot recording studio,” he said. “The end focus is matching commercial quality,” while keeping the recordings free.Over the last year Ms. Shallenberg has read more than 200 individual chapters and six novels for LibriVox, in addition to shorter works. She also turned her son Henry from an audiobook fan to a budding voice talent who has recorded some of Aesop’s fables.“I would be surprised if he didn’t keep doing recordings, because he loves audiobooks,” she said. “When you love something that much, you want to get involved.”'"
"'06-08-25,'0','Of course, Marbury had access to high-performance sneakers because he was a high-performance phenom. People were always providing him with sneakers. But that was not the norm.“Now, instead of spending $200 for a pair of sneakers, you can get 20 pairs of kicks,” he said. That actually adds up to $300, but you get the idea.I went to Steve & Barry’s at Manhattan Mall yesterday afternoon to see the shoe and pick up a pair. They were sold out, and had been for hours. The store opened at 9 a.m., but the lines had been forming at 7 the past week. The store manager was advising shoppers to return today. Outside the store, Marlene Alvarez was leaving with her sons, Harry and Oved, and planning to return today. Harry, the older son, was wearing his Uptowns ($80); Oved had on a pair of LeBrons ($70). They went to buy Marbury’s shoes.Alvin Wells of Brooklyn had come from the Broadway Mall in Hicksville, N.Y., on Long Island. “The concept is great,” he said. “It took a long time for somebody to step up and do that. The kids are out here, everybody’s struggling. You can save up a dollar a day as a kid and you can get a pair of sneakers.“A pair of Jordan’s are what, $160? Compare those with this shoe; they’re built the same, both made in China. I give him a lot of credit for this.”In addition to cost consciousness, Marbury said the idea of getting behind a low-priced shoe came out of conversations he had had with Isiah Thomas, the Knicks’ president and coach. Thomas got Marbury to think about doing something that mattered, creating a legacy in basketball outside of statistics. Marbury said that Thomas spoke with him about the civil rights movement that skipped over Marbury’s generation.“He was explaining to me how my generation never went through anything,” Marbury said. “There was a generation that went through things that we never even envisioned. For me to be able to talk with him, get insight on how things were back in the day, I got a picture of what he created for me to see. It made me feel like I want to put my mark on history as far as letting people know that I’m a part of something that I’m moving with. All this is brand new, this is revolutionary, the thing that we’re doing right now.”I doubt that Marbury’s $15 shoe will compel Reebok, Nike and Adidas to rethink their pricing. I read a comment by Bob Basché, the chairman of the sports marketing agency Millsport in Stamford, Conn., who told Brandweek magazine that this was a local story.“This will be profitable for Marbury and Steve & Barry’s, but it won’t impact the industry,” he said. “Marbury has a New York following but doesn’t command the attention of the entire basketball nation the way LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Michael Jordan do.”Andy Todd, the president of Steve & Barry’s, disagreed. “I would invite you or him to come to any of our stores, not just in New York, but in Detroit and Los Angeles, where they’re also sold out, and see if it’s changing the world,” he said in a telephone interview yesterday. “It’s become a movement. People have taken to this. And it’s not a New York story at all. This whole Starbury collection is about Steph’s vision to eliminate the pressure that parents and kids feel to spend top dollar on the latest sneakers and clothing.”The big challenge will come on the playground and in school when the children wearing sneakers that cost $75 to $200 tease those wearing Marbury’s $15 shoes.Todd said: “We’re dealing with an ingrained aspect of culture, and sometimes, that takes time to take hold, especially when you consider that this is word of mouth versus advertising. But the first thing people read was, it’s a $15 pair of shoes that Stephon Marbury’s going to wear on the court. That in and of itself gave it a level of credibility.”•Marbury has taken on a frequently exploitive sneaker culture that he has been significantly involved with. And while his $15 shoe may not cause much change, there’s an outside chance that he will compel the industry at least to put the sneaker on the other foot.'"
"'06-08-25,'0','The S.E.C. passed a rule in 2004 aimed at limiting such actions, and while that rule seems to have reduced the practice in most stocks, such short selling has become more common in the shares of other companies, among them Overstock’s. The S.E.C. is considering toughening the rule, and Mr. Byrne got Utah to pass a law providing penalties for brokers who do not fully disclose such transactions involving Utah-based companies, like Overstock. He hopes the United States Senate will take some action.When he announced disappointing second-quarter earnings a few weeks ago, Mr. Byrne introduced — while insisting he was not advocating — his latest idea for a lawsuit. He suggested investors could direct their brokers to transfer shares from the broker’s street name to an individual account at Depository Trust, where most shares are kept. That would, he said, keep the shares from being lent out, thus making life harder for short sellers.If brokers failed to do as they were told, he said, investors could consider legal action. He provided the e-mail address of Overstock’s lawyer, James W. Christian of Christian, Smith & Jewell in Houston.Some shareholders did contact him, Mr. Christian told me, and suits may be filed soon. “It is really a pretty simple action,” he said. “You agreed to sell me something. But you never bought the stock because you never got delivery” of the actual shares. “I want to rescind the transaction because you lied, and I want my money back.”If such suits worked, it would be a godsend to Overstock.com owners, whose investment has suffered since the shares peaked at $77 in late 2004. Shares closed yesterday at $18.05.To the bears, that fall reflects the rising losses Overstock has posted as it struggles to get its costs down and its technology up to par. To Mr. Christian, the answer is simpler: brokers “allowed counterfeit shares to be sold in substantial numbers” and that drove down the price.Mr. Byrne insists that the issue is stock manipulation. “I don’t care what our stock price is,” he told me. When I suggested shareholders paid him to care, he said his job was to run the business.And how is the business? It “came off the rails” last year, he conceded, blaming poor technology decisions. But now things are looking up. “I feel like a patient coming out of having his knee replaced,” he said, adding that he expected to be jogging later this year and sprinting in early 2007.The latest suit idea “sounds like a pretty far-fetched idea,” said John F. Olson, a securities lawyer at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who has no involvement in the Overstock legal world. “What duty has the broker breached? Unless the broker fails to execute an order, you have no loss that was caused by the broker.”Mr. Christian says the answer is simple: by allowing the conspiracy to take place, the brokers allowed the share price to be driven down, and then used margin calls to force some of his clients to sell and take losses. The fact that the clients still get the economic benefits of owning the shares, as they would have if delivery had been made, is irrelevant, in his view.When Mr. Byrne started his crusade, it was easy to dismiss him as just another corporate boss unhappy that short sellers had discerned that his stock was overhyped and overpriced. But by framing the argument as an attack on manipulating hedge funds, he has gained a surprising amount of political traction, even if his company’s performance has not been very impressive.Mr. Byrne is not especially comfortable with the idea that honest people can disagree. When I first wrote about him early last year, he speculated on his Web site about whether I was being paid off by short sellers. He concluded I probably was not, but he routinely asserts that other journalists take orders from his foes and, as he put it on his Web site a few weeks ago, “obediently stick to any Party Line they are instructed to parrot.”When I asked him this week if he had any regrets about his campaign, mentioning in particular his claim that an unnamed “Sith Lord” was behind the naked shorting conspiracy, he conceded he could have done a better job of choosing his terms.“A better metaphor would have been Al Qaeda, a loosely organized federation of people who share an ideology and operating procedures,” he said. “Other than that, my only regret is that I did not act earlier.”'"

"'06-08-26,'0','But Iran's public posture has all but guaranteed that the members of the United Nation's Security Council will have to at least address Iran's violations of the resolution setting August 31 as the deadline for suspending enrichment.Iranian's public confidence is based on three primary factors, political analysts here said: There is a strong belief that two of the council's permanent members, Russia and China, will support Iran's call for talks and oppose moving toward sanctions; that the United States is far too bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan to be willing to spark another conflict in the region; and the perceived victory of Hezbollah in its war with Israel has strengthened Iran's political capital in the region.""After the defeat of Israel by Hezbollah forces, China and Russia should not want to leave the side that won the war, which is the Islamic world,"" said Hossein Shariatmadari, who is the editor of the conservative daily newspaper Kayhan.Just four days earlier, Iranian officials had offered their response to a package of incentives that Western diplomats had hoped would encourage Tehran to voluntarily suspend uranium enrichment. And the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution threatening punitive actions if Iran would not stop, setting Aug. 31 as the deadline.Though Iran's response was accompanied by moderate comments from Iranian officials, it did not accept suspension. The 21-page document was provided to the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany at a meeting in Tehran. The Swiss ambassador accepted it on behalf of the United States, which does not have diplomatic relations with Iran.While the details of the response were not released, Mr. Shariatmadari, who is was appointed by Iran's supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that the package noted 50 ""ambiguities"" in the original incentives package that needed clarification. Those, he said, included questions as basic as ""Who is responsible for implementing the incentives,"" he said. ""The E.U., the U.S., the nuclear agency, who?""Soon after Iran gave its reply to the incentives package, Iran's public posture reverted back to confrontation. The deputy speaker of parliament, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, cautioned that too much pressure on Iran could lead to calls for a nuclear weapons program.""Our country is confronted with illogical countries who have nuclear weapons,"" he was quoted as saying in Saturday's edition of the reformist newspaper Shargh. ""If they put too much pressure, our people might ask the government to produce nuclear weapons as a deterrent instrument.""On Friday, a mid-level cleric, Ahmad Khatami, said during a Friday prayer ceremony that the West ought to be cautious in the way it addressed Iran.""You can not use the language of force against this nation,"" Mr. Khatami, in a speech broadcast around the nation from central Tehran. ""Do not test us as you have tested us before.""As is customary, Mr. Khatami stood with his right hand gripping the barrel of an automatic weapon as he addressed thousands of people gathered for the weekly prayer ceremony. ""You can not deal with a nation as great as the Iranian nation this way. It is a very stupid approach. Russia and China, we count on you to be careful not to fall into the trap American has set for you.""For Iran, the issue of its nuclear program is as much about domestic politics as it is about international relations.President Ahmadinejad was elected last year on a populist economic message, promising a redistribution of the nation's vast oil wealth and immediate economic improvements. Instead, while the economy remains gridlocked, inflation and unemployment high, Mr. Ahmadinejad has turned the nuclear issue into his raison d'etre. Focusing on national pride, the president and Ayatollah Khamenei have succeeded in winning public support for the nuclear program.While the depth of that support could be tested by sanctions, the president continue to appeal to pride as he opened the new heavy-water plant in Arak, south of Tehran.""Having nuclear technology and using it is a blessing and is the right of all nations, including Iran,"" President Ahmadinejad said in Arak. ""As the people's representative, I pursue whatever people want. Today they want to have nuclear technology and I pursue this demand and will not back down.""'"
"'06-08-26,'0','Prudential Financial, the life insurance company, may settle three-year-old investigations of improper mutual-fund trading as early as Monday.The agreement, led by the Justice Department, would allow Prudential to avoid criminal prosecution.A person who was briefed on the negotiations but who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the details of the agreement, which was first reported on the Web site of The Wall Street Journal.Prudential’s fines and restitution may be among the biggest payments made by firms implicated in fraudulent fund trading, the person said. Prudential has set aside at least $900 million for settlement and litigation costs since 2003.Prudential may be the first company in the industrywide investigation to settle under threat of federal criminal prosecution. Massachusetts officials sued the company over so-called market timing in 2003, saying it let brokers make excessive and illegal trades to benefit hedge-fund clients at the expense of long-term investors. Two former brokers pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 2005.Prudential’s settlement will resolve state investigations, as well as inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the person confirmed. Prudential sold the securities brokerage that was the focus of the investigation to the Wachovia Corporation five months before Massachusetts and the S.E.C. sued.Officials for Prudential, the United States attorney in Massachusetts and the S.E.C. declined to comment.'"

"'06-08-26,'0','The possibility of softening that stance to attract new members has been debated by church members for four years. Two years ago, the general assembly decided to let individual pastors determine whether remarried people could become members of congregations.“It can turn people away, and turn them off, when they’re told they are committing a sin,” said Sean McKinley, a spokesman for the Church of God of Prophecy, which is based in Cleveland, Tenn., and says it has 900,000 members around the world.While some Church of God of Prophecy clergy members believe the change is necessary for the church to minister effectively in a modern world, others believe it could compromise one of their most dearly held principles, that marriages should be monogamous and lifelong.Joyce C. Pelham, of Columbus, Ga., who has been a pastor in a Church of God of Prophecy congregation for 55 years, said she had allowed people in “double marriages” to attend services but not to become members.“If the church rules that we take them in, I’ll have to do that,” Ms. Pelham said in an interview before the vote. “But the blood will be on their hands, not mine, you know?”Now Ms. Pelham must wait at least two more years to find out if she has to accept remarried members.The general overseer of the church, Bishop Fred S. Fisher Sr., decided to table the issue until the next meeting of the general assembly, in 2008.“No, no groaning,” Bishop Fisher said as he informed the assembly yesterday. “The counselors have felt along with me that it would be improper to push this over.”Many who attended the general assembly meeting fought hard to get the church to end its condemnation of remarriage.“Over the years, we have put into hell people who wore pants,” said a woman who stepped up to the audience microphone and introduced herself as the pastor of a congregation in Texas. “We have put into hell people who wore jewelry and makeup. We need to understand that we have put God in a box, and we need to take God out of that box.”Another pastor, from California, said a couple in his congregation had left after he preached a sermon on the grave sin of remarriage after divorce.Still other clergy members, including some whose own family members have been involved in divorces, say compromise on the issue is unacceptable.“I’m afraid if we open the door, we no longer have a voice,” said Lester G. Weldon, 55, a district overseer for the church from Baxley, Ga. “The church has lost its voice, and in many cases has been silenced where many, many people are in that condition of divorce and we don’t have any voice.”Mr. Weldon said he believed that his daughter, who was recently divorced, had not tried hard enough to save her marriage because she believed that the church would change its position.Outside observers said the church’s lack of accord on the issue was not surprising.“They’re a very, very conservative organization,” said H. B. London, a vice president of Focus on the Family, a conservative Christian policy group in Colorado Springs that also takes a dim view of divorce. “The problem they face and that all of us face is that, in time, 50 percent of the nation’s population are going to be divorced, and how do we handle that.”Mr. London said he understood the concerns of what appeared to be a small but vocal minority in the church who fear that one such departure from their traditional values could lead to more.“I think anytime you begin to interpret the Scriptures according to a whim or popular opinion, then you do find yourself on a slippery slope,” Mr. London said. “Then you can contest anything in Scripture.”But Mr. London also said the issue was important.“I take my hat off to them for not ignoring it, to be honest,” he said.'"

"'06-08-26,'0','Three months into the administration of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the inflation rate has reached 70 percent a year, up from 32 percent last year. Wages are flat, banks are barely functioning and the consensus among many American and Iraqi officials is that inflation is most likely to accelerate.Violence, corruption and the fallout from decades of government control are kicking up the price of nearly everything, especially fuel, which in turn multiplies the production cost for goods.“It’s a very serious problem,” said Anthony H. Cordesman, a Middle East analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “You don’t have stable trucking; you don’t have stable distribution. You have a constant protection racket, with security forces who are involved in sectarian fighting often taking bribes to have things operate. All of that builds up pressure on prices.”Mr. Maliki’s office has responded with proposals to spur foreign investment and calls for public patience, even forgiveness. But billions in American aid has already been spent on Iraq with limited impact.Compared with security problems, which can be addressed to some extent by deploying more troops to the streets, the economy is harder to control, especially since most Iraqi commerce occurs beyond the reach of government policy.Fuel remains the country’s most visible example of economic dysfunction. A gallon of gasoline cost as little as 4 cents in November. Now, after the International Monetary Fund pushed the Oil Ministry to cut its subsidies, the official price is about 67 cents.The spike has come as a shock to Iraqis, who make only about $150 a month on average — if they have jobs. Estimates of unemployment range from 40 to 60 percent. And with black-market sellers commanding $3.19 a gallon because of shortages, up from about $1.25 a few months ago, the actual price most Iraqis pay is far higher than what is officially sanctioned.Filling up now requires several days’ pay, monastic patience or both.Three years after fuel shortages led to riots in Basra, tension is often palpable at the pumps. Lines stretch as far as the eye can see, and at least two shootings have been reported in Baghdad this month alone. Near a station downtown this week, bribes and line cutting appeared to be the norm. At one point a Mercedes and several police vehicles cut ahead of at least 50 cars while a policeman watched.“Why are you letting people come from outside?” shouted a man who was just a few cars from the station after seven hours of waiting.The station’s manager said the drivers given special treatment must have had a note showing that they were doctors, or attending a funeral. A few hundred yards back, by a beat-up station wagon, Abdul Rehman Qasim had a different theory: the drivers avoiding the wait possessed either money or power. He had neither.“I’m a poor guy,” he said. “So I leave some of my children here. They spend the night in the car.”“Under the government of Maliki, things are getting worse and worse,” he added. “Only God can save us.”In Iraq’s once-bustling markets, frustration is equally acute. Car bombers have regularly attacked commercial districts, and prices seem to be up at every stall. At markets in a middle-class Shiite area near downtown, chickpeas have doubled in price. Lamb now runs as high as $2.75 a pound, up from $1.50.Cucumbers, tomatoes and eggplant have all jumped too, while the price of the propane gas cylinders most families use for cooking has quintupled to more than $15.“We live hand to mouth,” said Mr. Dawood, a retired clerk for Pepsi.Veiled women shopping nearby agreed. “We’re tired, and the situation is horrible,” said Zakiya Abid Salman, 55, a widow carrying eggplants. “There are no jobs, and the prices are always rising.”Merchants said they had no choice but to increase prices because of the increased costs of doing business. And still, they said, their incomes have declined.Ali Fouad, 27, pushing live fish around a shallow tub of water, said the price of transporting his product from farms south of Baghdad has nearly tripled since last year. A few months ago he sold about 110 pounds of fish a day, earning roughly $50 after expenses. Since he had to raise prices about 60 percent, he said, he sells less and earns only $20 a day.“What’s our life today?” he asked. “We are working only for gas, ice and electricity. There is no savings.”Stanching inflation will not be easy. Experts here say they struggle just to collect the data necessary to diagnose the problem, while Iraq largely lacks the usual mechanisms for controlling prices.The Central Bank of Iraq is only three years old. Though the International Monetary Fund reports that officials have raised interest rates — and accelerated efforts to create a functioning market economy — its most recent study in July also concluded that “the banking system is largely inert.” As a result, the report said, the effectiveness of such measures would be “very limited.”“Increasing the interest rate for business loans and mortgages — if people aren’t taking out those loans, how much of an effect can you have?” said Edward W. Kloth, an economic adviser at the American Embassy here. “The tools that are available are very limited in this kind of a situation.”Ali al-Dabagh, a spokesman for Prime Minister Maliki, said in an interview that “the government is working hard to find solutions.” He blamed terrorists for undermining Iraq’s elected leaders, but he acknowledged that the country “needs an administrative revolution.”For the families trying to survive, time sometimes seems to be running out. Fathi Khalid, 43, a vegetable seller with a mostly empty stall, said obstacles seemed to multiply by the day. Sometimes roads are blocked so harvests never arrive. Sometimes he cannot afford to pay the right bribes. And week after week, his customers purchase less and less.“Most people buy half what they used to,” he said. “The vegetables sit here and rot.”'"
"'06-08-26,'0','A critical issue in the case was whether the Constitution’s ban on establishing religion meant that all sects must be treated equally, as lawyers for Champaign argued was the case in their schools — or whether it required strict neutrality between belief and unbelief, Mrs. McCollum’s contention. She won.“The First Amendment rests upon the premise that both religion and government can best work to achieve their lofty aims if each is left free from the other in its respective sphere,” Justice Black wrote.The case was also important because it extended the First Amendment’s protections to the states by using the due process clause of the much later 14th Amendment as justification. As such, all other cases that test Jefferson’s wall of “separation of church and state” — including school prayer, aid to parochial schools and sectarian religious displays on public property — descend from this case.The language used in comments immediately after the Supreme Court’s ruling would percolate in debates for decades. The Catholic bishops, for example, accused the court of making a religion of secularism.In 1952, the Supreme Court revisited the issue of religious instruction in Zorach v. Clauson. The 6-to-3 ruling in that case held that a New York program allowing religious education during the school day was permissible because it did not use public school facilities or public money.Vashti Ruth Cromwell was born in Lyons, N.Y., on Nov. 6, 1912, and grew up in Rochester. She was named for the queen of the Persian King Xerxes depicted in Esther 1 in the Bible who refuses to obey her husband’s order and is divorced for her spunk.Her father, Arthur G. Cromwell, was an architect who read the works of atheists like Spinoza and Thomas Paine, then read seven versions of the Bible. After letting the conflicting ideas germinate for years, he had become a vocal atheist by the time his two daughters were in college, James McCollum said.Mr. Cromwell was president of the Rochester Society of Free Thinkers and had persuaded the state education commissioner to end religious instruction in the schools of the one county in which it was permitted before his daughter filed suit to accomplish the same thing.Vashti Cromwell received a scholarship to Cornell, but the money ran out during the Depression and she transferred to the University of Illinois, where she majored in political science and took courses at the law school. At the university, she met John Paschal McCollum, a professor of vegetable crops in the horticultural department, and they married in 1933.After her children were older, Mrs. McCollum earned a master’s degree in mass communications at the university.She is survived by her sons James, of Emerson, Ark., Dannel, of Champaign, and Errol, of Moline, Ill.; her sister, Helen Curtis, who lives in a Rochester suburb; six grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.James McCollum, the oldest son, said that he at first had wanted to attend the religion classes, but that his mother objected. After a few months, he was allowed to go, but found the classes childish and “silly.” The next year, he said, he told his parents he did not wish to attend.His mother talked with the school system’s superintendent, but he said there was nothing he could do. She was careful to say that she was making no criticism of religion, The New York Daily News reported in 1945.She then sued with the help of a local Unitarian minister and financial support from a group of Jewish businessmen in Chicago. Her opponents, in addition to the City of Champaign, were church federations.A dramatic moment during the initial trial of the case came when Mrs. McCollum’s father said he did not believe in God, and a gasp went up from the crowd. Later, James McCollum said the same thing. Both “affirmed” that they would tell the truth instead of swearing by God. Mrs. McCollum called herself “a rationalist or an atheist.”Time magazine observed that the trial shared “features that made the Scopes ‘monkey trial’ a sideshow’’ of the 1920’s.In the three-year legal battle, Mrs. McCollum received physical threats and was fired from her job as a dance instructor at the university. At Halloween, a mob of trick-or-treaters pelted the McCollum family with rotten tomatoes and cabbages. The family cat was lynched.Mrs. McCollum wrote a book on the case, “One Woman’s Fight,” became a world traveler and served two terms as president of the American Humanist Association.“We don’t bother ourselves with the question of whether there is or isn’t a God,” she said in a speech in 1948.'"
"'06-08-26,'0','For at least a decade, China has provided a boost to a welcome tailwind for inflation-fighting central banks in Europe and the United States by consistently cutting prices on a wide variety of goods, helping counterbalance the upward drift of overall consumer price levels.At Jackson Hole, Wyo., the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, opened a conference of central bankers yesterday with a speech that noted how the emergence of China as an export powerhouse has altered the world economy in less than 30 years. [Page C3.]China’s role in global disinflation — as the phenomenon is known to economists and central bankers — is not going to disappear. But a few recent numbers, along with anecdotal evidence, suggest that China’s contribution to low prices globally may be ebbing.This spring, the European Central Bank vowed to step up research into what has been called the “China effect.” Top officials at the Federal Reserve have also begun speaking out about it. And the debate over how much China has contributed to taming global inflation is a central topic at the annual Jackson Hole gathering of the world’s leading central bankers and academic economists.In the United States, data shows that Chinese import prices, which have fallen since data collection began in 2003, are leveling off, as are prices from other low-cost emerging markets.The price of Chinese goods at the factory gates has leapt upward in the last four months, according to the purchasing managers’ survey taken by the London-based NTC Research. Its index was a tad below 50 — a level indicating stable prices — in March but now stands at 56, a steep increase by the standards of a survey that usually moves in fractional increments.For years now, China’s galloping economy has been sending ripples through the global economy — as Chinese demand has raised prices for critical commodities like oil and copper and Chinese buying of United States Treasury securities has helped keep interest rates low.And not all economists buy the overall notion that Chinese prices will soon pump up inflation rates in the industrialized world and force central bankers to press harder on the brakes.Skeptics about the “China effect” tend to focus on the ability of China and its customers to adapt.As Chinese costs increase, foreign investors can set up shop in places like India and Bangladesh, which lag behind China as manufacturing centers.Other companies will press into China’s vast interior to escape rising labor costs on the coast.“The global labor arbitrage is alive and well,” said Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. “It still pays very much to relocate production and employment to China to keep your labor costs down.”The cheap clothes and toys that consumers around the world have purchased with seeming abandon have tempered prices, even depressing them over the years. Now, as Chinese makers move to increase their prices in response to higher costs, some central bankers worry that this global salve will disappear.“Even in China, with its growing manufacturing base and large pool of labor, some indicators are showing upward pressures on export prices,” Mervyn A. King, the governor of the Bank of England, said in a recent speech. “And, in turn, that is raising our import prices, over and above the increases resulting from higher energy costs.”The prospect of higher prices for finished consumer goods has become an obsession of sorts in the supply-chain business, according to interviews with retailers, importers, independent consultants and trade associations in Europe and the United States.“We may well be reaching a situation where prices of both commodities and manufactured goods will go up,” said Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. “That’s not pleasant at all.”China’s natural development has brought it to this point, economists said. Cheap labor and easy access to a first-class port in Hong Kong allowed China to flood the world with inexpensive goods.But as labor shortages develop, Chinese workers are starting to demand more money, adding to cost pressures from more expensive commodities and creating the classic conditions for rising export prices.“Raw materials are going up; the price of oil is going up; wages are going up,” said Peter Keller, managing director of the Merton Company, a plastic toy manufacturer based in Hong Kong. “It is true that costs in China are rising and, where possible, cost increases are passed on.”Merton is facing rapid increases in wages at its plant in Guangdong Province, in China’s booming manufacturing heartland in the Pearl River Delta. On Sept. 1, the minimum wage is expected to increase by about 20 percent, to 780 yuan ($98) a month, in the province.Intense competition is still squeezing profit margins, but Mr. Keller estimated prices for products made under new contracts would be 5 percent to 10 percent higher as a result of the higher wages and raw material bills.The good news for consumers is that rising costs in China are not yet feeding into higher prices on store shelves, though they are probably chipping away at the profits of importers and retailers, economists said.H&M, the giant Swedish clothing retailer, finds itself grappling with how to keep prices down as its suppliers demand more, said Nils Vinge, its director of investor relations.Some strategies, like shifting production to low-wage Bangladesh or Turkey, with cheaper transport costs to Europe, can reduce the impact, though not forever.“In the long run, this makes its way to the consumer,” Mr. Vinge said. “In the short run, it does not.”Data suggests that Europe and the United States are, like H&M, somewhere between the short and long runs. Inflation has hovered slightly above 2 percent for most of this decade in the 12 nations that use the euro as currency, but has been rising lately.It was at an annual rate of 4.8 percent last month in the United States.In Britain, the Bank of England’s most recent inflation report notes that even after stripping out volatile energy and metal prices, inflation is running at an annual rate of 5 percent. It also highlighted a turnaround in prices of British imports since 2004.The European Central Bank pointed to a similar trend in the euro countries in its latest monthly report.The sensitivity to higher price levels has focused more scrutiny on China. Indeed, the European Central Bank also noted that low-cost countries like China helped reduce the inflation rate for imported goods by two percentage points yearly from 1996 to 2005 for the euro nations.Mr. Temple, the toy buyer, said he had managed to largely contain cost increases from China through a mix of tough negotiating and lower profits. But soon enough, the retailers he supplies, like W. H. Smith, Harrods and Selfridges, will find themselves under intense pressure to raise prices, he said.“These prices have to be passed down to the retail chain next year,” Mr. Temple said. “Prices have to go up.”'"
"'06-08-26,'0','At the moment, party rules do not specifically require committee chairmanships to be awarded on the basis of seniority. But in practice that is the way Democrats have done business, except in rare circumstances like in 1985 when Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin led a revolt against Representative Melvin Price of Illinois, the aging chairman of the Armed Services Committee.Under the direction of Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, chairman of the party caucus, a committee headed by Representative Michael E. Capuano of Massachusetts is giving the internal party handbook a thorough review. Lawmakers are studying whether changes are required in the seniority system and rules governing general committee seats and related issues like ethics and term limits.Democrats can only hope they have to deal with the infighting that would follow should they topple the Republicans. But Mr. Capuano, who heads the Democratic Committee on Organization, Study and Review, acknowledged that a takeover would confront them with thorny issues.“Nobody even wants to think of all the jockeying for committee assignments,” said Mr. Capuano, who has spent his summer poring over arcane party regulations.Since winning the majority in 1994, Republicans have not hesitated to pass over senior lawmakers for chairmanships in favor of members more in tune with the leadership’s ideology or more assertive in fund-raising than their rivals.Representative Joe L. Barton of Texas was handed the Energy and Commerce helm over more senior lawmakers, as was Representative Richard W. Pombo of California on the natural resources committee and Michael G. Oxley of Ohio on the Financial Services Committee.Representative Jerry Lewis of California was picked to head the Appropriations Committee in 2005 over a more senior opponent after a fierce fund-raising contest that saw Mr. Lewis dole out more than $1.3 million in the Republican campaign effort in 2004.Democrats anticipate they could face something of a generational clash in the event of a takeover. All of the lawmakers in line to lead major committees were in Congress before Republicans gained control in the 1994 elections, and some have bided their time in the minority for one more chance at the gavel.But most of the Democratic caucus has been elected since 1994, and there will be some Young Turks who will argue that the old-line Democrats had their chance and that power should be shared. Already there have been calls to retain the term limits that Republicans imposed on their committee chairmen.Party officials say they expect most of their senior representatives on major committees to prevail with little difficulty. They point to Mr. Rangel, a popular figure who has been traveling the country on behalf of House candidates, as one lawmaker who would be installed as chairman with enthusiasm.Other positions are more problematic. At the Intelligence Committee, Representative Alcee L. Hastings of Florida, who was removed from the federal bench in the 1980’s, is in line to take over, although that decision would be the responsibility of Ms. Pelosi and could prove explosive.And some Democrats are nervous about the prospect of a Judiciary Committee led by Mr. Conyers, who has raised the prospect of impeaching President Bush, a notion that Ms. Pelosi has sought to bat down.Senior party officials doubt that many — if any — of the Democratic chairmen in waiting would be leapfrogged if Democrats prevail in the November elections. But just mentioning the possibility can help motivate senior Democrats to work overtime in the critical remaining months of the campaigns to help cement their committee positions.“They are all conscientious, solid, hard-working members,” said former Representative Martin Frost, now a part-time political commentator. “The thing about these members that should frighten Republicans is that they will all know what to do the minute they take over.”There is no dispute that a Democratic majority would bring a shift in ideology at the helm of most major committees. The potential chairmen have generally been persistent critics of the administration and are champing at the bit to turn the Congressional spotlight on administration practices and Republican policy.And Republicans, trying to find a way to persuade unhappy conservatives not to stay home on Election Day, are working to drive that point home.“Our country can’t afford to let Nancy Pelosi, John Murtha and Barney Frank reverse the progress we’ve made,” Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois wrote in a recent appeal for contributions.'"
"'06-08-26,'0','DETROIT, Aug. 25 — Several hundred workers at an automotive parts factory in Ohio have saved their jobs by agreeing to cuts in their pay and a reduction in benefits.The company, Tower Automotive, based in Novi, Mich., is restructuring under bankruptcy protection. It said the concessions would allow it to continue operating the plant in Bluffton, Ohio, which had been scheduled to close. The company also agreed to withdraw its request that a judge void contracts with the United Automobile Workers and the United Steelworkers unions.“We’ve worked together with Tower to solve difficult issues with a goal of preserving U.S. manufacturing jobs,” said Bob King, a U.A.W. vice president, in a statement Friday announcing ratification of new labor agreements by workers in Bluffton and at a plant in Elkton, Mich. “Our goal now is to help this company emerge from bankruptcy and return as a strong player in the U.S. auto industry.”The agreements were an indication of the steps that unions must take — and now seem willing to accept, albeit reluctantly — as the auto industry tries to deal with financial losses by closing factories and shifting jobs overseas.The U.A.W., which has historically been strong enough to fend off contract proposals calling for concessions even as employers struggled, is preparing for what is expected to be a difficult round of negotiations with Detroit’s automakers when their current contracts expire next year.'"
"'06-08-26,'0','Speaking more like the Princeton economics professor he once was, the Fed chairman surveyed previous expansions of global activity from the Roman Empire to the opening of the Suez Canal and European colonialism.Those expansions shared many common themes with trends of today, he said, including the role of new technologies in opening up trade opportunities as well as similar social and political backlashes from groups whose lives were disrupted by new competition.But while other experts have often cited the rapid economic integration before World War I as a precedent, Mr. Bernanke argued that the process today was faster, broader and deeper than earlier waves of globalization.Though he did not mention the practical implications for monetary policy and central banking, other experts here are delivering papers that examine the role of Chinese goods in holding down global prices and that scrutinize major changes in global capital movements between rich and poor countries.One of the most startling changes, which has helped fuel American growth and kept interest rates low, is that the United States and other wealthy industrialized countries are attracting huge volumes of capital from poorer counties in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.“Today, the world’s largest economy, that of the United States, runs a current-account deficit, financed to a substantial extent by capital exports from emerging market nations,” Mr. Bernanke noted.Mr. Bernanke has previously argued that the United States’ huge indebtedness is merely the reverse side of a “global savings glut” caused by the fact that some other countries offer too few investment opportunities.Other analysts take a much darker view. Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University who has served as chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, warned in a paper here that the United States was becoming overly dependent on developing countries that might soon start using their excess savings for themselves.“Even if these favorable trends continue, there are massive budget problems that most of the developed world is going to face as its populations age,” Mr. Rogoff cautioned.The Fed and other central banks, he said, need to prepare for the “risk of an eventual slowing down or reversal” of the so-called savings glut.Mr. Bernanke steered clear of that issue. But he was blunt in declaring that the current pace of globalization, though part of a trend that is thousands of years old, is also something the world has never seen.“The scale and pace of the current episode is unprecedented,” he said. Though Columbus’s voyage to North America ultimately transformed the world, he noted, that change took centuries to occur. By contrast, he said, the emergence of China as an industrial dynamo and export powerhouse has altered the world economy and geopolitics in less than 30 years.The patterns of global trade and finance have changed as well, he said. The old distinction between core rich countries that exported manufactured goods and poorer periphery countries that exported natural resources has broken down.Production is becoming more geographically fragmented, he noted, citing chip makers like Advanced Micro Devices that do production in Texas and Germany and final processing in Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and China.If Mr. Bernanke had a message to political leaders, it was that they needed to acknowledge the downsides of globalization in terms of lost jobs, disrupted livelihoods and wrenching change.“The challenge for policy makers,’’ he said, “is to ensure that the benefits of global economic integration are sufficiently widely shared — for example, by helping displaced workers get the necessary training to take advantage of new opportunities — that a consensus for welfare-enhancing change can be obtained.”'"

The people confirming the test result were granted anonymity because antidoping rules require the results not be revealed until the B sample has been tested.Graham has had at least seven athletes serve doping suspensions. That prompted the United States Olympic Committee to bar him from its facilities, and several European meets have said they will not invite any athlete training with Graham. Nike added to that momentum with its move.“There is absolutely no basis for Nike to terminate Trevor’s contract,” Graham’s lawyer, Joseph Zeszotarski, said. “The contract cannot legally be terminated based upon innuendo and suspicion. We have contacted Nike regarding the matter and are awaiting their response. We hope to avoid having to take legal action but will do so if necessary.”Athletes’ contracts typically have clauses giving sponsors an out if a client fails a doping test, but Stoyer said the move to suspend Gatlin’s contract was “without precedent.”Gatlin reiterated yesterday that he did not knowingly use any performance-enhancing substance and would appeal his ban. “As an athlete it is frustrating for me to be on the sidelines, and have people drawing conclusions that I have cheated,” he said in a statement. “I have put my faith in a system that I believe will clear my name and that I believe will allow me to compete again.”Until last year, Nike also sponsored Marion Jones, whose A sample from this year’s national championships tested positive for the blood-boosting agent EPO. That contract was not renewed, and Jones had been competing without a sponsor.After the cyclist Floyd Landis’s positive test, which threatens his Tour de France title, his team sponsor immediately suspended him.“Brands do not want to be associated with controversy,” said Jeff Chown, president of Davie-Brown Talent, which signs celebrity spokesmen for corporations. “Steroids are top-of-mind in the sports industry right now. Nobody wants to be associated with it right now. I think a company like Nike is trying to build good will with the public by saying, ‘We’re against this.’ ”Chown said he had seen many companies steer clear of baseball players because of that sport’s problem with performance-enhancing drugs.“There’s too much risk in signing an athlete who might end up in the middle of a steroids scandal,” he said. “The risk is not worth the reward.”The rash of positive drug tests has done much to tarnish track and field’s image, but the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, said yesterday that he was not disturbed.“It proves that controls are working,” Rogge told The Associated Press at the meet in Brussels. “It is not only Jones and Gatlin but also Floyd Landis and many other cases. They allow us to eliminate the cheats.”Rogge said the United States Anti-Doping Agency should be praised. “It is a very positive turn in the tide in the battle against doping,” he said.'"
"'06-08-26,'0','Venus Williams has not competed in a tennis tournament since July 1 and, still trying to recover from a left wrist injury, she will not be coming to New York to play, either.Williams withdrew from the United States Open yesterday, and she would miss the event for the second time in four years. Although she was seeded 30th and seemed to have a favorable draw, Williams said she would not be healthy enough to play for a title she has won twice.“I have many great memories from competing at the U.S. Open and I regret that I will not be able to participate in 2006,” Williams said in a statement. “I will miss the excitement of competing in front of the New York fans at one of the premier sporting events in the world. I look forward to returning in 2007.”Williams has not played in a tournament since she was upset in the third round at Wimbledon by Jelena Jankovic.Last summer, Williams won Wimbledon, but lost in the quarterfinals of the Open to Kim Clijsters, the eventual champion.'"
"'06-08-26,'0','And John Neff, formerly of Vanguard, singles out Citigroup, D. R. Horton and Lyondell Chemical.As the magazine notes, “it’s unusual to hear some of the canniest investors all singing a version of the same tune.”OOPS As part of the 30th-anniversary issue of Registered Rep., the magazine that bills itself as the source for investment professionals, James J. Cramer, the financial celebrity, takes a look back on the online investing craze of the 1990’s and concludes that people like him “got it all wrong.”“We thought that the individual investor would storm the ramparts, manage the money himself and take over the world. I, in particular thought that we could turn Wall Street into a Home Depot where the do-it-yourselfers could roam free, taking care of their own money and building up colossal nest eggs.”Obviously, it didn’t work out that way.“We ended up costing people fortunes with articles, newscasts and advertising about how simple it was,” he said. “The best of us were naïve and the worst of us were self-serving and shameful.”Mr. Cramer believes that investors who were burned, and those who are new to the market, will learn from the mistakes of the past.“They are sober, they know our business and they actually enjoy the process” of researching and investing in stocks, he writes. But Mr. Cramer doesn’t suggest how those who were misled in the past can go about getting their money back.ERIN GO BLAH. It seemed like a good idea.“We are an Irish concept, and we are going everywhere but Ireland. That’s crazy,” Vince Runco, the president for worldwide franchising of Bennigan’s Grill and Tavern, told Chain Leader in explaining the company’s decision to try to establish a presence in Ireland.It has not gone exactly as planned, as David Farkas reports in an article which reminds us that always asking “is this a good idea,” should be required before setting off on a new venture.Tom Coleman, who owns the franchise rights for all of Ireland, acknowledges he couldn’t emulate the Bennigan’s restaurants elsewhere, saying “he’d be laughed out of business were he to plaster his restaurants with shillelaghs and shamrocks,” Mr. Farkas writes.So Mr. Coleman has changed the décor and has altered the standard menu, to the consternation of the parent company, to try to counter the belief that all American restaurants deep-fry their food, which doesn’t appeal to the Irish, one local expert told the magazine. In response, Mr. Coleman has altered his offerings to the point where “his menu is not a Bennigan’s menu,” Mr. Runco complains.The menu changes coupled with aggressive promotion — like offering a movie ticket with the dinner special — have increased revenue somewhat. But the biggest problem remains the most basic: Irish men and women looking to dine in an Irish restaurant in Ireland prefer a native one.FINAL TAKE In reporting on the Employee Benefit Research Institute’s 16th annual retirement confidence survey, Financial Planning notes “24 percent of workers were ‘very confident’ about their retirement prospects, but of that number, 22 percent were not currently saving for retirement, and 39 percent had less than $50,000 in savings.”There are two possible explanations: These people have trust funds or a winning lottery ticket, or they are going to be very surprised once they stop working.'"
"'06-08-26,'0','Robinson gained imps in five of the first seven sets, but led by only 176 imps to 151. Over the final 15 boards, though, the Meltzer team drew ever closer. With one board remaining, the diagramed deal, the Robinson lead was down to 3.In the other room, Bates (South) opened with a textbook weak two-spade bid. Boyd (West) doubled for takeout, Sontag (North) redoubled to show his strong hand, and Robinson (East) advanced with two no-trump, promising length in both minors. When West bid three diamonds, North doubled for penalties.Against three diamonds doubled, North led the spade ace, then shifted to the heart queen. Declarer (West) won with the ace, took his two top clubs, ruffed a heart on the board and discarded a spade on the club king. Now West ruffed a club with his diamond nine, but North over-ruffed with the queen, cashed his diamond ace and played another diamond. Declarer could win this trick and cross-ruff to score his last two trumps, but had to concede down one, plus 100 to Meltzer.In the given auction, Morse (South) started with a modern nonvulnerable three-spade opening, holding only an excellent six-card but having a side-suit singleton and a possible bolster in clubs. After Feldman (West) doubled for takeout, Wolff (North) passed, when he would have been better advised, like Sontag, to redouble. Then, if Bramley (East) had still bid four clubs, South could have doubled for penalties with his four trumps. But when North passed and East ran to four clubs, South had to pass. This returned to North. If he had doubled or passed, the contract could have been defeated by five (!) tricks for a Robinson win. But North tried four spades.The defense was perfect. West led his club ace and continued with the club queen. East overtook with the king to shift to his singleton heart. West won with his ace and led the heart five, his lowest card being a suit-preference signal requesting a club return. So East, after ruffing the heart, gave his partner a club ruff. The defense had taken the first five tricks for down two and a second plus 100 to Meltzer. That gave Meltzer 5 imps and victory by 193 imps to 191.In the 120-board semifinals, Meltzer plays against Russ Ekeblad, Fred Gitelman, Eric Greco, Geoff Hampson, Brad Moss and Ron Rubin. Jacobs faces Nick Nickell, Dick Freeman, Bob Hamman, Jeff Meckstroth, Eric Rodwell and Paul Soloway.

"'06-08-26,'0','“These open-space funds were not meant to be used for any kind of rehabilitation, repair or installation,” said Jesse Rosenblum, a longtime resident of Closter. “The purpose of that money is to buy land.”Mr. Rosenblum pointed to an abandoned gas station diagonally across the street from Borough Hall, on VerValen Street, as a prime piece of property the borough should consider acquiring.“They could turn that old gas station into a little park,” he said. “Land is a diminishing commodity. Let’s buy it whenever we can.”Erik Lenander, the borough administrator, said the Open Space, Recreation, Farm Land and Historic Preservation Trust Fund, created by referendum in 1999, was not solely intended for the purchase of new land and could indeed be used to maintain existing properties.“The vote taken in 1999 allows the borough council to make decisions on how the trust fund money is spent,” Mr. Lenander said. “There’s always going to be objections on anything you do, but you have to look at what is going to benefit the most amount of people.”Closter officials said that although the majority of residents were in favor of installing synthetic grass, some were concerned that a new field would prevent such activities as dog-walking and sledding, which can be done on the natural grass practice field, which has a small hill.“Of course, none of that is true,” Mr. Oettinger said. “There have also been rumors that we plan on fencing off the new field, but that is not true, either.”Steve Isaacson, a Closter resident, said officials “should be promoting nature and greenery, not ripping up nature and putting in artificial turf.”“And why are we using education money from our P.T.O. fund to serve a small special-interest group like the Junior Football League?” said Mr. Isaacson, who said he attends most of the council meetings and plans to voice his opinion next month at a public hearing on the open space issue.“Remember Joni Mitchell sang, ‘They paved paradise and put up a parking lot’? Well, Closter is paving paradise and putting up an AstroTurf field,” Mr. Isaacson said.But Mr. Oettinger insisted that it made little sense to resod the practice field at the middle school, which gets so torn up by athletic activity that children playing there return to class with muddy shoes, which angers custodians. The 50-year-old field has never been resodded, he said.“Resodding it would require putting in an irrigation system, and all of that would cost over $100,000,” Mr. Oettinger said. “After the first year or second year, the field would most likely need to be resodded again, which would cost another $75,000 just to get it back in shape. During that time, the field would have to be shut down for three or four months before we started playing on it again, and that wouldn’t make much sense.”'"
"'06-08-26,'0','So Mozart-lovers should be relieved to learn that now won out over never: the Mozart Festival will be held here Sept. 2 to 4 at the Chelsea Mansion, the 100-acre estate built by the great-great-grandson of Clement Moore, who penned “A Visit From St. Nicholas” (“ ’Twas the night before Christmas”).Like the festival, the mansion, built in 1926 and currently owned by Nassau County, has been out of the public eye and in need of refurbishment. Its 36 rooms — give or take a few, according to its curator, Michael Butkewicz — have been restored where possible and redecorated where necessary; the grounds and white brick facade have gotten a face-lift, and the moat is back in working order.Mr. Winkler, a stickler for details, tested the wobbly bridge that spans the moat. “It’s safe!” he proclaimed, wiping the pretest perspiration from his brow. Ever cross an authentic moat? Priceless.As cultural comebacks go, the Labor Day weekend event offers a double whammy: the mansion will also be open for tours throughout the music festival. An outdoor tent will accommodate 800, and Mr. Winkler estimates that the lawn can handle another 1,500 people.Besides the Chamber Players International, the soloists Anna Rabinova, on violin, and Tatiana Goncharova, a pianist and accompanist of Pinchas Zukerman, will perform. And yes, a Mozart impersonator — an actor from a Long Island-based theater company that recently staged “Amadeus” — will interact with the audience.“We will hope to do a civilized job of it,” Mr. Winkler said of the theatrics, which include a period-style Punch and Judy puppet show, carriage rides and Austrian food. “But you know, Mozart did have a promotional side. He was probably one of the first freelancers. Most of my composer heroes did their fair share of paperwork; doing administrative work is part of the career.”Mr. Winkler began his at age 6 as a violinist, played electrified wind instruments in rock bands while a teenager and studied composition for two years at the Cherubini Institute in Florence, Italy. The dissertation that earned him a doctorate in musical arts from Columbia University was composed of musical notes, not words. To make ends meet, he worked as a telemarketer and as a program evaluator at Empire State College, gigs that put him in contact with the Sea Cliff Players.The original Players performed their final Mozart Festival in 1997 and disbanded in 1998, leaving behind a bumper crop of bad vibes and a $150,000 debt for their board of directors to solve. Mr. Sucoff’s widow and Players collaborator, the pianist Barbara Speer, who was not on harmonious terms with the board, moved away. Mr. Winkler was hired as interim executive director in 1998: the mandate was to eradicate the debt or remain defunct. Not an option.“There’s already too much hip-hop in the world,” Mr. Winkler said. “People who feel that classical music is dead are always the ones who have never been to a performance. We want to change that. Mozart’s music knows no boundaries or barriers. You hear it in elevators and on answering machines.”And next weekend, you get to hear Mozart performed the chamber orchestra way outdoors on Long Island. Again.'"
"'06-08-26,'0','Nitrogen from the herbicides and pesticides used on lawns, in conjunction with nitrogen and bacteria leaching from houses’ septic systems, simply flow off into the bay, Mr. McAllister said. That causes blooms of algae whose decomposition consumes virtually all the oxygen in the water and kills off most shellfish, crabs and flounder, he said.Halfway up the Forge River, which with Baykeeper’s help was placed on the federal impaired waterways list in April, Mr. McAllister dropped a device into the water to measure dissolved oxygen. Below three parts per million, marine life becomes “severely stressed,” he said. The meter reading fell to 0.49 — less than half a part per million.Farther on, Mr. McAllister pointed out a private beach where the spartina grass had been removed along the edge; it was growing in thick clumps on the adjacent properties.“People have no idea what they’re doing,” he said. “They’re destabilizing the shoreline. And yet these are the same people who the day after a storm seek permits to build bulkheads to protect their property, which only makes things worse.”To help educate waterfront owners, Baykeeper plans a series of “bayscaping” seminars this winter, with practical help to follow in the spring. It will also landscape one private property free as a showcase, Mr. McAllister said.The group is also lobbying local governments to install so-called smart sponges in storm drains to filter out most nitrogen, grease and oils.But Mr. McAllister said the biggest issue was seeking a moratorium on residential development along area waterways. The Towns of Riverhead and Southampton are considering major residential developments along the Peconic River, which is already on the impaired waterways list, he said, and the Town of Brookhaven has received site plan approval for a 475-unit retirement community at the headwaters of the Forge River. The towns have resisted a moratorium.“We know the blueprint for change, yet people have the blinders on,” Mr. McAllister said.The news is not all bad, however.Suffolk County has undertaken a major scallop restocking program, and bay fishermen reported a 60,000-pound scallop harvest last year, up from almost nothing the year before, Mr. McAllister said. The county has also approved $400,000 to investigate the causes of recent algae blooms.“I applaud the politicians,” Mr. McAllister said. “But now they have to step up and make some tough decisions. Do they have the will to save our waters? Either way, it will be their testament.”'"

"'06-08-27,'0','NASA wants to resume space station construction after making only two shuttle test flights since the 2003 Columbia disaster to try out new safety modifications and procedures. The agency wants to fly three times before the end of the year to maintain a schedule to finish the station before the shuttle fleet retires in 2010.“We have two competing objectives. One, we want to get the vehicle ready to fly. The other objective is we want to get the vehicle ready to roll back. They are not compatible,” Mr. Gerstenmaier said at a news conference. “At some point in the sequence you have to give up one or the other.”On Saturday, NASA postponed Atlantis’s planned launching today by one day to examine the effects of a large lightning strike on the launching pad during a Friday storm. The shuttle itself was not hit, but engineers were concerned about potential damage from a surge of electricity around the shuttle and associated ground equipment.Today, managers pushed the next chance for a launch to Tuesday at 3:42 p.m. to give them more time to assess what impact, if any, the lightning might have had.Mr. Gerstenmaier said the shuttle and its external tank essentially had been cleared for flight, but engineers still were looking at data to see if explosive bolts connected to the craft’s large booster rocket might have been affected by a surge of current.If managers decide to move Atlantis back to the hanger building, technicians first have to drain onboard oxygen and hydrogen supplies that power the vehicle’s fuel cells and make other critical preparations. The entire rollback process from the launching pad to the safety of the hanger takes about 48 hours, officials said.Keeping Atlantis on the pad for a Tuesday launch attempt would make it difficult to get the shuttle back to the hanger before damaging tropical storm winds and rains arrive. The tight schedule requires managers to make a decision on what direction to take by early Monday morning, Mr. Gerstenmaier said.On its 11-day mission, Atlantis is to deliver a truss segment and new solar power array to the space station, a complex assembly task requiring three space walks to complete.'"
"'06-08-27,'0','Although she cruised to the final of this tournament as the defending champion, it was a physical test for Davenport, who was playing in her second tournament since March. She had been sidelined because of bulging disks in her back, then sustained a concussion in a fall at her home in June that forced her to withdraw from Wimbledon.Davenport returned to play in Los Angeles this month, but she lost her first match, a second-round meeting against Samantha Stosur of Australia.To reach the final here, Davenport played four matches in four days without dropping a set. She defeated the No. 1 player in the world, Amélie Mauresmo, in the quarterfinals.Davenport said she began feeling serious tightness in her right shoulder on Friday during her semifinal victory over Stosur.By the time she fell behind by 0-3 in the opening set Saturday, she said, she knew her day was about done.After losing the first set, Davenport left the court for about five minutes to receive treatment; she returned with tape on her shoulder. After Henin-Hardenne broke her first service game of the second set, Davenport retired.She said she felt as if her shoulder kept falling lower and lower. Because of the pain in her shoulder, Davenport said, she compensated by using other muscles, which led to pain in other areas.“With the U.S. Open less than 48 hours from beginning, this is not where I want to be,” said Davenport, the Open champion in 1998. “But I do think this is something, given rest, that will get better. So it’s pretty much just trying to manage it before my first match.”At the Open, players receive days off between matches, which could bode well for Davenport’s recovery.On Saturday, however, she appeared distraught after 26 minutes of play against Henin-Hardenne. When she was asked to say a few words to the crowd, she began to cry. Davenport said she felt bad that she could not give the fans a good showing in the final.'"
"'06-08-27,'0','Ms. Ersenoyeva’s mother said her daughter had not voluntarily married Mr. Basayev, who remained unapologetic and defiant after sending female suicide bombers to Moscow and onto passenger jets, and who had planned the lethal hostage sieges in a Russian theater and a public school. She agreed to marry him, her mother said, only because the separatists had threatened to kill her two brothers if she did not do as they said.“She was a smart girl, but she was used,” her mother, Rita Ersenoyava, said in an interview in the village of Stariye Atagi, south of here, from where she said her daughter was taken for conjugal visits with the terrorist leader. “Now she is gone. I have lost hope. I have lost a golden child.”Whatever the circumstances of Ms. Ersenoyeva’s marriage, whether she was Mr. Basayev’s occasional hostage or willing wife, her disappearance has offered fresh glimpses into two Chechen netherworlds: the secretive life of Mr. Basayev and the murky circumstances of abductions in the Caucasus, which have persisted even as the pace of combat in Chechnya has slowed.Ms. Ersenoyeva’s mother said her daughter was first taken to Mr. Basayev in late November, after Kheda Saidullayeva, the wife of the president of the separatists’ government-in-hiding, told her that she must marry a fighter. The name given was Ali-Khan Abu Yazidov.Ms. Ersenoyeva agreed. On Nov. 29, a driver, Kazbek, picked her up and drove her to a house in Grozny, the Chechen capital. She entered a room where she was told her fiancé would be waiting, and found Mr. Basayev, her mother said.“He told her: ‘Do not be afraid. I will not do anything bad to you if you do what I say. I do not need you to kill anyone. I need your brains and your head.’ ”Mr. Basayev already had had at least three wives, a Chechen woman who was killed in the 1990’s, an Abkhaz woman he met while fighting as a mercenary leader against Georgia and a Cossack he was said to have married on Valentine’s Day, 2005.He and Ms. Ersenoyeva were quickly married in an Islamic ceremony and spent three nights together, her mother said. When she left, her mother said, Mr. Basayev gave her tasks on the Internet, including downloading information from a separatist Web site.But those were details the mother found out later.When Ms. Ersenoyeva came home, her mother said, she said only that she had eloped and that her husband was away. Much of Chechen society is ordered around male-dominated rituals, and men kidnapping their brides is a tradition that persists.Over the next three months, her mother said, Kazbek came for Elina three more times. Then Ms. Ersenoyeva announced that her husband had left Russia to find work.Her mother said she learned the true identity of her son-in-law after he died. (Mr. Basayev was reported killed in July when a small convoy he was traveling in was torn apart by a massive explosion. Russia has said the blast was a special operation to kill him; the separatists claim that munitions the rebels were moving exploded by chance.)Ms. Ersenoyeva seemed relieved as she watched news of his death, the mother said, and a fuller story came out when officers from the F.S.B., Russia’s domestic successor to the K.G.B., visited the house and interviewed her, saying they had had her under surveillance and needed to close their case.But her problems continued. On Aug. 16, Ms. Ersenoyeva sent a note to human rights organizations, saying she and her family were being harassed by pro-Russian Chechen forces and that she was afraid, according to the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society, a private group.The next day, Ms. Ersenoyeva and her aunt were abducted by masked Chechen men as she commuted to work, according to human rights groups, her mother and the editor of the newspaper to which she contributed. The men put bags over their heads, forced them into cars and sped away.After a morning of being held in a basement, her aunt was released. Ms. Ersenoyeva was not. Her captors allowed her to make three phone calls in the first day, her mother said. She has not been heard from since, and no one has made any demands or ransom requests.Her mother has said she does not know who kidnapped her. She has carefully avoided blaming the pro-Kremlin Chechen forces, or kadyrovsty, as they are called, which can be dangerous here.Further details of her married life and corroboration that she was forced into the union cannot be readily confirmed. Kazbek, the driver, was arrested, the mother said. Abdul Khalim Saidulleyav, the separatist president, was killed in June; his wife has gone into hiding. Mr. Basayev is dead. The authorities have not commented on the case beyond saying that they were notified of the kidnapping.“We have information that allegedly a kidnapping happened, but we have no real information of it,” Nikolai V. Kalugin, one of Chechnya’s senior federal prosecutors, said in a telephone interview.Abductions have been a sinister part of life in Chechnya for more than a decade, and especially since the second war began in 1999. Human rights organizations say at least several thousand Chechens have disappeared in the second war, a slice of the population that has vanished with little trace.The causes, and the abductors, are many. Ransom kidnappings have long been a macabre business, practiced by separatists and pro-Kremlin Chechens alike. Human rights organizations and Chechen civilians say the kidnappings have also become insidiously institutional, an oft-used mechanism of state power.Suspected militants or their supporters, they say, are seized for interrogation and torture and are secretly killed. Other times, Chechen civilians say, relatives of suspected militants are seized to coerce militants to surrender or inform on their peers. People who have complained about government abuses have also disappeared.The disappearances have scarred Chechen society and infused it with grief; random interviews with Chechens often yield tales of missing brothers and fathers, men who disappeared while on the roads or from their beds, taken by masked men in the night.Russia has said it is trying to stop the abductions, and the number of kidnappings each year has declined, although it is still high. Last year, according to Memorial, a Russian human rights group, there were 316 cases, and 151 of the abductees were later released. Memorial reported 103 new cases through June 2006.But prosecutors have also said that examining cases has been complicated because sometimes people who have been reported as kidnapped have actually fled or joined the rebels, and use the reports of their abduction to cover illegal activity.In the case of Ms. Ersenoyeva, the authorities seem ambivalent. Mr. Kalugin, the senior prosecutor, said investigators did not begin to check into the reports of the abduction until Aug. 26, more than a week after it occurred.Center Demos and the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, two private groups who have been active in Chechnya, urged prosecutors to examine the case impartially, regardless of the link to Mr. Basayev.“We stress that family connections to rebels — be they ‘the terrorist No. 1’ or a common fighter — by no means justify abduction and an enforced disappearance of an individual,” the groups wrote in an open letter on Aug. 26.Timur Aliyev, editor of the Chechen Society newspaper, to which Ms. Ersenoyeva sometimes contributed articles about social problems, said he was astonished by the entire episode. He said she had given no sign of being a terrorist’s bride. She was a quiet and well-read young woman, he said, and her future seemed bright.But given the lawlessness here and her association with his newspaper, he said, the authorities, or the kidnappers, might move next against him or his newspaper. “I am in a light panic,” he said. “I do not know what will happen.”'"
"'06-08-27,'0','But Iran’s public posture has all but guaranteed that the members of the United Nations Security Council will have to at least address Iran’s violations of the resolution setting Aug. 31 as the deadline for suspending enrichment.Iran’s public confidence is based on three primary factors, political analysts here said: a strong belief that two of the council’s permanent members, Russia and China, will support Iran’s call for talks and oppose moving toward sanctions; the conclusion that the United States is far too bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan to be willing to engage in another conflict in the region; and the feeling that the perceived victory of Hezbollah in its war with Israel has strengthened Iran’s political capital in the region.“After the defeat of Israel by Hezbollah forces, China and Russia should not want to leave the side that won the war, which is the Islamic world,” said Hossein Shariatmadari, editor of the conservative daily newspaper Kayhan.On Tuesday, Iranian officials formally responded to a package of incentives that Western diplomats had hoped would encourage Tehran to voluntarily suspend uranium enrichment. Iran still faces an Aug. 31 deadline to comply with the Security Council resolution threatening punitive actions if Iran does not stop.Though Iran’s response was accompanied by moderate comments from Iranian officials, it did not accept suspension. The 21-page document was provided to the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany at a meeting in Tehran. The Swiss ambassador accepted it on behalf of the United States, which does not have diplomatic relations with Iran.While the details of the response were not released, Mr. Shariatmadari, who was appointed by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the package noted 50 “ambiguities” in the incentives package that needed clarification. Those, he said, included questions as basic as “Who is responsible for implementing the incentives,” he said. “The E.U., the U.S., the nuclear agency, who?”Soon after it gave its reply, Iran’s public posture reverted back to confrontation. The deputy speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, cautioned that too much pressure on Iran could lead to calls for a nuclear weapons program.“Our country is confronted with illogical countries who have nuclear weapons,” he was quoted as saying in Saturday’s edition of the reformist newspaper Shargh. “If they put too much pressure, our people might ask the government to produce nuclear weapons as a deterrent instrument.”On Friday, a midlevel cleric, Ahmad Khatami, said during a Friday Prayer ceremony that the West ought to be cautious in the way it addressed Iran.“You cannot use the language of force against this nation,” Mr. Khatami said in a speech broadcast around the nation from central Tehran. “Do not test us as you have tested us before.”As is customary, Mr. Khatami stood with his right hand gripping the barrel of an automatic weapon as he addressed thousands of people gathered for the ceremony. “You cannot deal with a nation as great as the Iranian nation this way. It is a very stupid approach. Russia and China, we count on you to be careful not to fall into the trap America has set for you.”For Iran, the issue of its nuclear program is as much about domestic politics as it is about international relations.President Ahmadinejad was elected last year on a populist economic message, promising a redistribution of the nation’s vast oil wealth and immediate economic improvements. Instead, while the economy remains gridlocked, inflation and unemployment high, Mr. Ahmadinejad has turned the nuclear issue into his raison d’être. Focusing on national pride, the president and Ayatollah Khamenei have succeeded in winning public support for the nuclear program.While the depth of that support could be tested by sanctions, the president continued to appeal to pride as he opened the heavy-water plant in Arak, south of Tehran.“Having nuclear technology and using it is a blessing and is the right of all nations, including Iran,” Mr. Ahmadinejad said. “As the people’s representative, I pursue whatever people want. Today they want to have nuclear technology and I pursue this demand and will not back down.”'"
"'06-08-27,'0','AMSTERDAM, Aug. 26 (Reuters) — Paul Fentener van Vlissingen, a Dutch billionaire whose family-owned enterprise grew under him into a global giant and who later spent millions on nature conservation and African wildlife parks, died on Monday. He was 65.The cause was pancreatic cancer, his company, SHV Holdings, said in a statement. He was chairman of the supervisory board of SHV, a Dutch privately held company active in energy, recycling and retailing.While he was chief executive of SHV from 1984 to 1997, annual sales increased to $20 billion and it became one of the Netherlands’ biggest employers.SHV is best known for its Makro superstores, the European branches of which were sold in 1997. It still owns close to 200 superstores in Asia and South America.Mr. van Vlissingen was the youngest of three brothers — heirs to a family fortune amassed since the 17th century.He set up the African Parks Conservation after a meeting with the former South African President Nelson Mandela, in an attempt to maintain and restore wildlife habitats by running them without subsidies on a sustainable basis.'"
"'06-08-27,'0','Earlier on Saturday, Khaled abu Hilal, a spokesman for the Palestinian Interior Ministry, said the Palestinian Authority was working through a third party that he declined to identify. But he said the authority had received word that both journalists were in good condition.Mr. Hilal stressed that the Palestinian Authority was only seeking the release of the two journalists, and was not conducting negotiations.“These are not negotiations,” Mr. Hilal said. “We are exerting serious efforts to get them released.”The Holy Jihad Brigades released a statement on Wednesday as well as a video of the two journalists, who appeared at ease as they spoke.The nature of the group remains a mystery, and it is unclear whether it is a real organization or just a small number of kidnappers, possibly acting on behalf of another group or faction. The United States government has rejected the group’s demands.In another development, the Fatah movement, led by the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Saturday endorsed a proposal for a national unity government with Hamas, which dominates the Palestinian cabinet and legislature. “A national unity government will strengthen our hand to face the Israeli occupation,” Nabil Shaath, a senior Fatah leader, said after three days of talks by Fatah’s Central Committee in Amman, Jordan, according to Reuters.Mr. Abbas and Hamas leaders already have agreed in principle on a government that would include both Hamas and Fatah, the two leading Palestinian groups. However, the two sides must still work out which party will control which ministries, a process that could involve protracted negotiations.Hamas won the Palestinian parliamentary elections in January. But faced with a Western aid embargo and political and military pressure from Israeli, the Hamas-led government has been unable to carry out even basic tasks, such as paying government employees. The hope is that a combined Fatah-Hamas government will ease the isolation of the Palestinian Authority.In violence on Saturday, Israeli soldiers shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian boy and wounded more than a dozen people in a clash in the West Bank town of Nablus, Palestinian medical workers and the Israeli military said. The military said the soldiers, on an arrest operation, fired on Palestinians who shot at them in addition to throwing stones and explosive devices.The soldiers surrounded an apartment building, and military bulldozers destroyed part of it. But the Israeli forces left without making any arrests, the military said.[An Israeli airstrike hit a Reuters vehicle in Gaza City on Saturday, wounding two Palestinian journalists as they covered a military incursion, the news agency reported, citing doctors and residents. One journalist, who worked for a local news organization, was seriously wounded. A cameraman working for Reuters was knocked unconscious in the airstrike, one of several in the area.[The Israeli Army said the vehicle was hit because it was acting suspiciously in an area of combat and had not been identified as belonging to the news media, Reuters reported. The missile struck the vehicle after dark. The armored car was clearly labeled as a news media vehicle, with signs on all sides, including the roof, the news agency said.]Israel said Saturday that it was pleased with a decision by European Union states to send nearly 7,000 peacekeepers to participate in a United Nations force in Lebanon. “It’s a positive move and an important step,” said Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which halted the recent fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, calls for up to 15,000 peacekeepers to join 15,000 Lebanese Army troops, with most of the force deployed in southern Lebanon.However, there are still points of disagreement. The United Nations resolution says Hezbollah should not be supplied with weapons, and Israel says it will not lift an air and sea embargo of Lebanon until there is a force in place to prevent arms smuggling to Hezbollah from Syria.“We’ve been saying from Day 1 that the cease-fire cannot be an excuse for Hezbollah to rearm,” Mr. Regev said. “One of the prime problems has been that the Syrians allow weapons to go to Hezbollah. If this is not addressed, it would make the arms embargo a joke.”The Lebanese government has not sought United Nations assistance in patrolling its border with Syria, and Syria strongly opposes an international force along the frontier.'"
"'06-08-27,'0','THIS week, Judge Peter Kelly of the New York State Supreme Court may incarcerate 1.4 million New Yorkers. Their crime? Being dogs.The Juniper Park Civic Association in Queens is taking the city to court over its 1959 leash law, which requires dogs in public places to be restrained by a leash of no more than six feet. In recent years, the law hasn’t been fully enforced. Instead, city park administrators have accommodated the recreational needs of dogs and their owners by instituting “courtesy hours,” usually between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m., during which dogs, under the voice command of humans, can be off-leash in designated areas of the parks. The crown jewel of the courtesy-hour system is Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, where one can see dozens of dogs frolicking on weekday mornings and several hundred on the weekend.But with 1.4 million dogs in the city, someone in some park at some time will be bitten, just as someone will be struck by a softball, hit by a cyclist or run over by a car. The association has argued that the public must be protected from these occasional bites by restraining dogs at all times. Their reasoning is hardly unique. Across America, more and more urban and suburban communities have instituted leash laws, not only to protect the public against dog bites, but also to protect against lawsuits.The upshot is that dogs lead ever more incarcerated lives at the end of a very short lead, and dog owners don’t get to play with them in the way dogs and people have interacted for thousands of years. This loss might be viewed as one of the tradeoffs that comes with living in an urbanized world — if, that is, leash laws actually worked as intended.But after nearly 50 years of watching them in operation, we can say that they’ve brought about the opposite of what we’ve hoped: dogs that are constantly leashed aren’t as well socialized as dogs that get to meet other dogs off-leash; they display more behavioral problems; and they’re often more aggressive. These are the very sorts of dogs that, spending their lives away from their own kind — often in a city apartment or suburban yard — bark their heads off at passers-by, make the mailman’s life hell and act aggressively toward other dogs and people.Yet, proponents of strong leash laws have a point: 4.7 million dog bites were reported by the Centers for Disease Control in 1994. However, the C.D.C. and its Canadian counterpart also note that the majority of these dog bites — 75 percent in the United States and 65 percent in Canada — didn’t happen to pedestrians who encountered an off-leash dog in a public place. Rather, most dog bites occurred within the home to a family member who knew the dog. In fact, only 1.1 percent of all dog bites surveyed in Canada occurred in public parks or sports and recreation areas. Data on emergency room visits in the United States also puts the danger of dog bites into perspective. Only 1.3 percent of all people admitted to emergency rooms in the United States are treated for dog bites. The chances of being bitten by a dog are about the same as being poisoned.'"
"'06-08-27,'0','Contourwear, a women’s clothing maker in Alameda, Calif., uses a Schoeller fabric with a NanoSphere coating for its Anywear pants ($156). Neide Cooley, of Breckenridge, Colo., wore a pair of these pants, she said, for “10 days straight all over Peru.” A serious adventure traveler, Ms. Cooley, who is retired, will soon take along her Anywear pants on a three-week horse-and-camel-riding trip to Mongolia with “a group of cowgirl friends,” she said. (They plan to ride the camels in the Gobi desert.) The pants, which come in brown, black, green and charcoal, have coin pockets at the hip and passport pockets hidden at both ankles.With a change of shoes, the pants, which are smartly tailored, will also do for dining out, said Hood Seely-Brown of Lincolnshire, Ill. She bought her Anywear pants nearby, at the golf pro shop at the Exmoor Country Club in Highland Park. After golfing, she said, “I change my shoes and I am good to go out to lunch.”These pants sounded too good to be true. How could a material that felt so normal, with no suggestion of sticky plastic wrap or crinkly laminates, also repel stains? In an informal test, a photographer poured white wine on the pants, first in dribbles, then in confident splashes. I saw that the wine rolled right off. (I tried red myself later, just to make sure.) There was a puddle on the floor, but almost nothing on the cloth — just some beading that wiped off with a tissue. There wasn’t any smell, either. I sniffed to make sure before folding them and mailing them back to the manufacturer.The coating also resists grime. That is part of the reason that Victorinox will be introducing a new line of high-end luggage treated with NanoSphere in September, said Laurie Gilner, president of Travel Gear, a division of the TRG Group, in St. Louis, which licenses the Victorinox brand for travel products.The line of suitcases, called Tourbach, is made of a tightly woven nylon from Schoeller that has many twists per inch. “The more you twist those fine pieces of nylon to form the yarn, the harder they are to separate,” said Aaron Gorga, lead designer for the luggage. The nanocoating adds another layer of protection. The suitcases come in many forms, including three black, wheeled uprights. (The 22-inch is $550, the 24-inch is $650 and the 27-inch is $845.)Some companies that use Schoeller fabrics order them nanocoated; others use their own fabrics, sending them to the company for the finish. The treatment adds approximately $1.50 to the cost of a square meter of fabric, depending on the weight and composition of the cloth, among other variables, said Sheree Halleran, a spokeswoman for Schoeller USA in Seattle.Cliff Goldman, president of Carnegie Fabrics, in Rockville Centre, N.Y., produces his own textiles for many types of upholstery, then has them finished by another company that offers nanocoatings, Nano-Tex, in Emeryville, Calif.David Offord, chief scientific officer of Nano-Tex, said his company coats a range of fabrics, from the linen in upholstery to the silk in ties. “Our specialty is attaching this chemistry to fiber surfaces so that they are durable for the life of the material,” said Dr. Offord, who is a chemist.In the past, he said, people used coatings that repelled some liquids and dirt, “but in a thick layer which would make the fabric stiff and wash away after repeated home laundries.” Instead of building up these thick layers, the company creates a shield of nanometer-sized “whiskers” that stand up perpendicularly to the surface of the fiber. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.) The tiny whiskers attract air and repel water, creating a cushion of air between the textile surface and the invading droplets.AS a result of this superhydrophobicity, or extreme water repellence, liquid on a slightly sloping surface slides off without leaving a trace. Ketchup, however, will need to be wiped off. And spilling several bottles all at once may require a bit of running water and a sponge.The effect is like the workings of the lotus in nature, which repels water and cleans itself amidst the mud, Dr. Offord said.Scotchgard, a pioneer in treating fabric to make it repel liquids, does not use nanoparticles in its coatings for clothing, but it does use them for other things, like face masks. The nanoparticles provide anti-fogging properties on the shield that covers the face, Colleen Harris, a spokeswoman for 3M, Scotchgard’s maker, said from St. Louis.Anti-fogging masks, cashmere that defies wine spills and high-performance sports fabrics are just a few recent benefits of a technology built on particles far too small to be seen by the naked eye. It’s turning out to be just as Richard P. Feynman, a winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, envisioned in a prescient lecture in 1959: “There’s plenty of room at the bottom,” he said, referring to the vast possibilities of engineering and technology at the nano-scale.'"

"'06-08-27,'0','Once a well-known figure in Los Angeles’s hippest music scenes — he was an underground radio D.J. in the 1960’s and a confidant of John Lennon’s — Mr. Mintz now scurries after Ms. Hilton as she sashays in and out of clubs, hair salons and restaurants. She tells him where she plans to go, and he shows up early, inserting his diminutive frame between the 25-year-old heiress and unwanted gawkers and cameramen, so that they do not scare or fluster her.And it is Mr. Mintz who speeds through the night when his biggest client, bitten by her pet monkey, awaits his counsel at a hospital, as occurred this month. They talk or e-mail up to a dozen times a day.“I speak to him more than anyone else in my life,” Ms. Hilton said in an interview.When asked about his improbable journey from Lennon to Hilton, Mr. Mintz explained that in his eyes he once represented an artist who stood for the dreams and values of a generation. And now he represents an heiress who, well, stands for the dreams and values of a generation.“Young people don’t believe in politicians,” he said. “They don’t believe in their leaders. They look to celebrities to represent them.”Far from seeing Ms. Hilton as a damage-control project — he took her on as a client well after her infamous sex tape — Mr. Mintz believes he is shaping her image as a multimedia star. “She created this brand,” he said, citing her line of perfume; her reality TV show, “The Simple Life”; and her first CD, “Paris,” made with the hit R & B producer Scott Storch and released last week.One reason Ms. Hilton trusts Mr. Mintz, she said, is that he understands that she’s playing a role: an heiress with an artificially breathy voice who desperately needs attention to survive. “He really gets me, the whole Paris thing,” she said. “He knows it’s all a game.”But to hear Mr. Mintz tell it, he has just about had it with the game — celebrities, nightclubs, paparazzi — which he finds demoralizing and embarrassing. “I’m at the end of the trail,” he said. “I’m done with it. If I’m still doing this 12 months from now, I will have failed.”He drew a distinction between Ms. Hilton, whom he adores, and the media maw that surrounds her, which he can’t stand. While he agreed to be interviewed, he did so reluctantly. His dream, he said, is to retire and raise thoroughbred horses. His intentions were news to Ms. Hilton, who responded to the idea with a shriek. “Noooo,” she screamed, “I trust him with my life.”Born in the Bronx, Mr. Mintz arrived in Los Angeles in 1963 and attended Los Angeles City College. In the late 60’s and 70’s he was a fixture on the rock scene, working as a radio D.J. and serving as host of a television show, “Headshop.” He interviewed Frank Zappa and Timothy Leary, John Lennon, who became a close friend, and Bob Dylan, who became a client. He accompanied Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young to Woodstock.His two-story house in Laurel Canyon, reached by a tram, overflowed with candles, and Mr. Mintz speaks of those years as his most cherished. He pays about $160 a month to keep his old Laurel Canyon phone number, though he lives in Beverly Hills, in a house filled with mementos, including books autographed by Leary and albums signed by Lennon, Gregg Allman and David Cassidy, whom Mr. Mintz accompanied on a European tour.By the late 70’s, he was burned out on broadcasting. He built on his music contacts to become a publicist. After Lennon’s murder in 1980 by Mark David Chapman, Mr. Mintz represented the estate, becoming an adviser and protector of Yoko Ono. In an e-mail message, she described Mr. Mintz as “a dear friend who went through the storms with me for the past 25 years.” He is working on projects with Sean Lennon, John and Yoko’s son.Today, Mr. Mintz is immersed in a very different world. He lives like a 23-year-old, sleeping until around noon, then spending the next hours working from one of the 17 telephones in his house. Most days he works until about 7, exercises in his downstairs gym and heads out into the night around 9. He said he drinks the equivalent of a bottle of wine a day (almost always chardonnay, which is why Ms. Hilton and her buddies call him Chardy).Mr. Mintz said he accompanies Ms. Hilton almost everywhere because she asks him to, surrounded as she almost always is by the news media. Some suspect he simply likes being part of the scene. Ken Baker, the West Coast executive editor of Us Weekly, attended a 24th birthday party for Ms. Hilton at her home last year. He remembered Mr. Mintz’s showing up at the party less as an adviser than as part of her clique. “He just fit in perfectly,” Mr. Baker, 36, said. “There I was standing in Paris’s living room, thinking I was too old for this. But Elliot blended right in.”Other high-level Hollywood publicists said they don’t understand why Mr. Mintz must accompany Ms. Hilton everywhere. None would allow their names to be used, but a number wondered whether the saturation coverage of Ms. Hilton’s every move detracts from her ability to promote her television show and her record.Mr. Mintz replied that it is because he devotes so much attention to clients that people like Ms. Hilton hire him. He said he has devoted similar time to many of the 40 clients he has had over the years. One of the latest, Christie Brinkley, was in the news this summer when her husband’s affair hit the tabloids.The interest in Ms. Hilton, Mr. Mintz said, is almost a force of nature. Every time she leaves her home, she is followed by a caravan of paparazzi, who record her shopping sprees and minor traffic-police brushes.It was a paparazzi encounter with Ms. Hilton that generated Mr. Mintz’s professional low point, a notorious rant outside Hyde by Brandon Davis, the grandson of the late billionaire Marvin Davis. Brandon Davis, who has known Ms. Hilton since they were children, was caught on videotape spouting obscenities about the actress Lindsay Lohan, who has been portrayed in the tabloids as a Hilton rival. Ms. Hilton, who was with him, can be seen on the tape, which was streamed over the Internet, laughing and almost egging him on.Later they emerged from the club, joined by Mr. Mintz. On the video Mr. Mintz nervously tries to steer Ms. Hilton away from her friend, with no luck. At one point, Mr. Davis clumsily grabs Mr. Mintz by the tie.The episode was “the longest walk of my professional media life,’’ Mr. Mintz said. “I never want to take that walk again. There were no winners.”In interviews on the phone, at the Polo Lounge and inside his Mulholland Drive home, Mr. Mintz repeated his desire to quit his business. “I derive no pleasure from this at all,” he said at the Polo Lounge, where the receptionist and waiters address him by name. “The only way I get through this experience is through meditation and chardonnay.”Yet, there are no signs of substantive steps to retire. While he talks of living on a ranch, he doesn’t own a horse or a place to stable one. Some who know him said they have heard his retirement talk for years. “I don’t think he will ever step down from where he is,” Ms. Ono said by e-mail. “Since John’s passing in 1980, he has been saying he wants to quit and watch the wheels in a horse farm. In his heart, he’s an L.A. cowboy.”Mr. Mintz said his plan is to ride out his current obligations, but not to take on any more clients. “I almost have a plea, a wish: Please don’t call,” he said of new business. “All that will do is imprison me more. In July 2007, if I’m not out of it, come back and talk to me about what went wrong.”But that’s almost a year away. For now, Mr. Mintz was off to Hyde, with its copper ceilings and wooden tables, where he would stay until last call.'"
"'06-08-27,'0','At full throttle, the four-speed automatic shifts so hard that you expect to see it in the rearview mirror, scattered about the pavement. Twin tailpipes emit a guttural roar pretty much constantly, but you can drown them out with the 508-watt Infinity stereo.There’s a deep air dam in the front, a hood scoop that wears a “Viper Powered” badge and a spoiler perched atop the tailgate.The tailgate spoiler gets my vote as the new reference to complete the phrase “As American as ...”We are a people who create downforce-producing aerodynamic devices for pickup trucks, because our pickup trucks go so fast that they’d otherwise fly right into the air like the magic car in “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.”You listening, Al Qaeda? You may as well just give up right now.From a practical standpoint, this thing is a tough proposition. On one hand, it has four practical doors, and it can tow up to 8,150 pounds. Wonderfully unburdened by a speed limiter, the two-door version does 150 miles an hour, and this one probably also approaches that distinctly untrucklike velocity. So it’s potentially useful if you like to tow boats down the autobahn.On the other hand, the sticker on my test truck totaled $57,460, which included a $1,595 navigation system and a $1,200 rear-seat DVD entertainment system, among other niceties. For that stack of cash, you could have a Hemi-powered regular-cab Ram 1500 and a Mercedes-Benz C230 sedan.Or — I just looked this up — you could buy 20 acres of ranch land in Montalba, Tex. But I have a feeling that if you’re really interested in buying a $57,000 pickup truck, you might already own Montalba, Tex.The SRT10’s ride-handling balance is tilted in favor of comfort, probably in deference to the fact that an object this immense is never going to give a Lotus a run for its money in the twisties, no matter how stiff the suspension, and like a classic muscle car it gets confused by corners.I’ll wager that if the truck had merely gargantuan wheels (say, 20-inchers), it would keep its tires in better contact with the pavement. As it is, the springs and dampers struggle to control the weight of the huge 22-inch wheels at each corner.Trying to make a suspension work properly with 22-inch wheels is like fashioning a yo-yo out of a bowling ball and some string. They do look nice, though.The interior is pretty much stock Dodge Ram, with the exception of heavily bolstered seats with suede inserts, a red starter button à la Viper, and a boy-racer oil temperature gauge that juts out of the left windshield pillar like some kind of growth. (Not only did it keep me up to the moment on the oil temp, it reminded me that I was overdue for my checkup at the dermatologist.)The navigation system worked fine, but unlike every other system I’ve seen — including this very unit in other Dodges — its display doesn’t automatically dim when the headlights are on. I didn’t notice this immediately in the brightly lighted city, but out in the sticks it occurred to me that the navi screen’s impression of Times Square was causing acute night blindness, which is a bad thing when you’re driving 65 miles an hour in a truck the size of Djibouti.Now, I know that thrifty fuel economy isn’t a priority here. I also know that your garden-variety 4x4 pickup will probably never see 20 m.p.g. But the Ram SRT10 rivals a torched oil well for sheer profligacy — and, oh yes, it demands premium.I managed mileage in the double digits only because I made a highway-heavy road trip. Around town, I was getting 7 or 8 m.p.g. With more than a quarter-tank of fuel remaining, I gassed up to the tune of $74.28. If I’d come anywhere close to running the 34-gallon tank dry, the big red truck would have had the dubious distinction of being my first $100 fill-up.One advantage of the Ram’s pavement-crushing weight and cinder-block aerodynamics is that those are two identifying characteristics of a truck, and trucks are not subject to the federal gas-guzzler tax. So while the Viper and its 20 m.p.g. highway rating get hit with the guzzler label, a Ram SRT10 with the same engine but much worse fuel economy does not. But nobody ever said life was fair for Viper owners.The Ram SRT10 Quad Cab may not make fiscal or ecological sense, but I appreciate the chutzpah it represents. Nobody else was making a four-door truck with 510 horsepower, so the Dodge people took it upon themselves to fill the void.Mission accomplished, it seems: after a three-year run, 2006 is the last year for the Viper-powered pickup. The SRT10 Quad Cab is the truck to end all trucks, including itself.'"
"'06-08-27,'0','Candice Millard, in her review of Aaron Sachs’s “Humboldt Current” (Aug. 13), mistakenly wrote that Alexander von Humboldt “felt a deep connection to the United States, where ... he spent five years, from 1799 until 1804, traveling through the country, and 30 years writing about it.” In fact, Humboldt and his companion Aimé Bonpland spent most of those years in Latin America and only six weeks in the United States.

"'06-08-27,'0','This summer, Harper’s Magazine has been serializing a novel for the first time in 50 years. A plot-driven satire about a manipulative doll-company millionairess who buys and renovates much of a small college town in upstate New York, John Robert Lennon’s “Happyland” lends itself to publication in installments. But why it’s appearing in Harper’s — and not in book form — is one of the more intriguing publishing stories of the season.The novel was originally under contract to W.W. Norton, but the publisher and author parted ways at the 11th hour, Lennon says, after Norton got cold feet about potential legal trouble. In outline, but not detail, the novel’s protagonist, Happy Masters, is strikingly similar to a real woman: Pleasant Rowland, the founder of the American Girl line of dolls, who has been financing the renovation of properties owned by her alma mater, Wells College, in Aurora, N.Y., in the Finger Lakes region. Since 2001, Rowland has converted two 19th-century houses into inns and opened three restaurants in the heart of the lakeside town, stirring up contention: some residents have been resistant to her zealous and unsolicited attention, others have welcomed the spruce-up. In Lennon’s zany, entertaining novel, the megalomaniacal Happy Masters goes even further, strong-arming the town mayor and the beleaguered president of the local all-female college, buying up businesses and even hiring someone to drop bricks off the roof of the college library, injuring two students, to prove she needs to build another.Novels are frequently based on real people, but it’s extremely rare for a publisher to drop one because of libel concerns. “I’ve never heard of a novel being pulled for fear of defamation claims,” said Paul Aiken, the executive director of the Authors Guild. He said a novelist could be sued if “the character is clearly based on a real person and the person is identifiable and people would believe that it’s factual.” But it’s difficult to prove libel in fiction, especially if the character in question is modeled on someone who could be considered a public figure, for whom the standards of defamation are higher. (For example, no libel lawsuits were filed over “The Devil Wears Prada,” Lauren Weisberger’s best-selling roman à clef about the Vogue editor Anna Wintour.) It’s also rare for a non-public figure to win a case involving defamation in fiction. In 2003, for instance, a court dismissed a suit filed against Random House and Joe Klein by a woman who claimed she might be identifiable in “Primary Colors,” Klein’s 1996 novel inspired by Bill Clinton’s first presidential campaign.As for “Happyland,” Lennon insisted that all the characters, including Happy Masters, are entirely fictional, though he added that “there’s no question it is inspired by the basic outline of some real events.” Lennon, who is 36 and lives in Ithaca, N.Y., said he became interested in Pleasant Rowland’s interventions in Aurora after he taught creative writing at Wells College for a semester in 2000. “The town was cute and dilapidated,” he said in a phone interview. “She was very aggressive in seeking to buy up property. Some got mad, others were willingly selling. Some friends said, ‘Oh, you should write a novel about this.’ I usually fly solo. I like making stuff up. But the basic concept seemed really appealing to me, making up my own people enmeshed in a similar situation.”Norton declined to specify why it dropped “Happyland.” But Lennon said the editing process had been going smoothly, and that legal questions emerged only after he submitted the final of multiple drafts. Since signing a contract with the publisher in June 2004, Lennon had been working with Robert Weil, a veteran editor known for line-editing as aggressively as he tries to drum up attention for his authors. “I’d worked with Bob before on ‘Mailman’” — Lennon’s well-received 2003 novel, also published by Norton — “and we had a really good editorial relationship,” he said. It was Weil, Lennon said, who suggested he cut a lot of subordinate characters and bring Happy Masters to the fore. “He wanted there to be more drama and a stronger narrative through line,” Lennon said. “I’d send them pages, he’d send them back for more tweaking. The whole issue of legal questions never came up.” (Weil declined to comment.)When Lennon handed in the final draft in mid-January 2005, “I wasn’t in touch with my editor anymore, I was in touch with a lawyer,” he said. “They were asking me to remove any reference to dolls or a doll company. I basically refused.” According to Lisa Bankoff, Lennon’s literary agent at International Creative Management, the publisher was worried that Pleasant Rowland “would possibly be litigious.” A spokeswoman for Norton, Louise Brockett, said only that “we resolved our differences with the author amicably, we wish him well, and it would be inappropriate for us to discuss our publishing decisions.” (After Norton backed out, Lennon’s British publisher, Granta, also dropped the book, Bankoff said. Libel law is much stricter in Britain than in the United States.)'"
"'06-08-27,'0','HOW TO GET THERETripoli is a 90-minute flight from Rome and a two-hour flight from Milan. Flights from the New York area through one of these cities start at about $1,400. If you’re already in Rome or Milan, a round-trip ticket will cost about $250.Until Libya establishes services in the United States, Americans must apply for visas through Libya’s offices in other countries. The nearest is in Canada, the Libyan People’s Bureau in Ottawa (613-216-0136, www.libya-canada.org). Libya only grants visas to tourists who arrange their travel with travel agents registered in Libya. Even then, Libya has recently denied entry to visa holders without warning or explanation.There are several good travel agencies in Libya, including Safari Tourism Services (218-21-3337-615, www.safari-tourism-services.com), Sea & Desert Tours (218-91-2163-500, www.sea-desert.net) and Sherwes Travel (218-21-4801-370; www.sherwestravel.com). They will accommodate a stay in Tripoli or a tour that includes the Sahara and Libya’s well-preserved Roman and Greek ruins of Leptis Magna and Sabratha.For the best local flavor, there are dozens of newly built, family-style hotels in the Kendi area, but you’ll have to contend with a bit of rubble and garbage in the streets. Still, they are safe, clean and cheap, running about $24 a night for a single. Among the friendliest is the Hotel Tebah (Razi Street, 218-21-3333-575; www.tebah-ly.com).If you want the atmosphere of a 1980’s spy movie, stay at the state-run Bab Al-Bahr (Sharia al-Corniche, 218-21-3350-676), five minutes from Green Square. The lobby portraits of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi preside over the whispered conversations of Texas oilmen and the hungry-looking undercover police officers assigned to watch them. The rooms are worn, in a Motel 6 kind of way, but start at about 60 dinars (about $48 at 1.24 dinars to the dollar.).The best fish in Tripoli is at the Hoffra Fish Market, a few miles east of town, where you can buy direct from the fishmongers and have one of a dozen cafes grill it for 5 dinars a person. Taxis will take you there and wait while you eat for about 20 dinars. The driver will often help you pick your fish. But don’t invite him to dinner; it would be considered rude.'"
"'06-08-27,'0','Is it worth it? Frank Bruni, the restaurant critic for The New York Times, gave Per Se his top rating, four stars, in 2004, noting that some dishes in the $210 tasting menus “instantaneously bring a crazy smile to your face and lodge in your memory for days and even weeks to come.” And more recently, Per Se got three stars, the top rating, from Michelin.Babbo, Mario Batali’s Italian spot in the West Village, received three stars from Mr. Bruni, who called it Mr. Batali’s “throne, from which he bestows his most lavish favors and intense flavors upon an appropriately grateful dining public.” Call (212) 777-0303 after 10 a.m. exactly a month before you intend to go to see if you agree.Le Bernardin, the four-star “high church of reverently prepared fish,” in Mr. Bruni’s estimation (Michelin also gave it three stars), has a slightly different system. The restaurant takes reservations up to two months ahead, starting on the first day of the month preceding the month you want to go. Confused? Put it this way: if your Oct. 28 lunch at Per Se is to be followed by an Oct. 28 dinner at Le Bernardin, you should call (212) 554-1515 on Sept. 1 (starting at 9 a.m.).Broadway is easier: just order at will from Ticketmaster.com or its competitors. Good orchestra seats and excellent mezzanine locations for even the most difficult shows are available this winter if not this fall.Among the fall’s possible hits, and a probable tough ticket, is “The Vertical Hour,” a new play starring Julianne Moore and directed by Sam Mendes. It is scheduled to open on Nov. 30 at the Music Box Theater, which is on the small side for Broadway, seating about 1,000. But the good news is this: tickets won’t go on sale until mid-September, so they’re not gone yet.Good weekend seats for “Mary Poppins” at the New Amsterdam Theater are already hard to come by, though the musical doesn’t even start previews until October. Friday night tickets seem to be the easiest: you can still find a few orchestra seats in October. But if good seats for a Saturday or Sunday matinee are what you had in mind, start thinking December, or early next year.Favorites running this summer at or near 100 percent ticket sales, like “Wicked” (the “Wizard of Oz” prequel) and “Jersey Boys” (the story of Franki Valli and the Four Seasons), are tough, too; for Saturday nights, it’s January for “Jersey Boys” and February for “Wicked.”Of course, if you’ve got the cash, you can skip all this rigmarole and buy what are now known as premium tickets. Click here, click there, drop $310 a seat, and you could be in second row center orchestra next weekend.If you swoon over classical music, your timing is excellent. The New York Philharmonic, whose home is Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center, puts all individual tickets for the 2006-7 season on sale today. Head to www.newyorkphilharmonic.org, the quicker the better.And chalk up another one to the power of television, because TV shows that tape or broadcast on weekends are probably the toughest tickets in town. To snag Conan O’Brien tickets for a Friday afternoon taping (note that “The Late Show With David Letterman” is not a weekend option: he tapes Monday through Thursday), you’ll have to be as fanatical as the Conan fanatics.Tickets for “Late Night With Conan O’Brien” are released only sporadically, so weave a call to (212) 664-3056 into your breakfast routine. If the recording says tickets will be released that day, start calling again around 9:30 a.m. Meanwhile, keep your redial finger in shape.If you’re hoping to be “live from New York” on “Saturday Night Live,” you have to understand what a tough ticket it is. First, the bad news: the 200 or so seats available to the public for each performance (about 100 each for the dress rehearsal and the broadcast) are doled out in a lottery that is open just one month a year. The good news: that month is now. You have through Aug. 31 to send an e-mail message to snltickets @nbcuni.com. If you win, you’ll be notified a few months ahead, giving you plenty of time to get that preshow reservation at Le Bernardin.In general, hotel reservations don’t require as much effort; usually just a couple weeks notice will get you a room at even the most celebrity-swarmed boutique hotels. There are exceptions: book the Maritime Hotel (www.themaritimehotel.com) in Manhattan at least a month beforehand; the more affordable rooms at the Hotel Gansevoort in the meatpacking district (www.hotelgansevoort.com), around $400 to $500 a night, can also be gone a month ahead.That wasn’t so hard, was it? And, so you know, a spokeswoman for the Marriott Marquis confirmed that it has not yet received any reservation requests for Dec. 31, 2999.'"
"'06-08-27,'0','They’ve taken kitschy photos beneath billboards of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the man Ronald Reagan once called “this mad dog of the Middle East.” They’ve wandered through the fragrant alleyways of Tripoli’s old city and haggled with its expert silversmiths. At night, they’ve smoked hookahs in Italianate courtyards near the harbor and eaten shaved ice alongside families escaping the heat of their homes.In May, the United States announced that it was restoring diplomatic relations with Libya, which means Libya’s capricious visa-approval process should become simpler, leading to what tourism officials hope will be an influx of American visitors.Thanks to a flood of new investment from the West, Tripoli is already remaking itself into a travel-friendly destination, as I found when I returned there this spring. Where visitors once had to choose from a handful of state-run hotels, there are now dozens of private places: from the family-run Tebah Hotel, with its chrome-trimmed lobby and collection of stuffed cats, to the over-the-top Corinthia Bab Africa Hotel, a $192 million showcase overlooking the sea, complete with spa, gym and fine restaurants.It’s no mystery why the Phoenicians picked this deep-water port 2,500 years ago as one of their primary trading posts on the North African coast. The water is Greek-island blue and placid. The marina’s docks are packed with bountiful fishing boats, sun-shriveled fisherman and boys who sell cups of espresso and cans of Pepsi wrapped in foil to keep them cold for 1 dinar (about $1.25) apiece. On the horizon sit massive idling oil tankers, whose deck lights form a faint string of jewels at night from one end of the Earth to the other.A busy roadway separates the sea from Green Square, a broad plaza from which the main shopping streets branch out, and a good place to start the day and watch the bustle unfold. But get ready for strangers to accost you. Chances are, you’ll be the only Westerner in sight, and your new friend will want to know if you’ve ever met Oprah, whom he watches on satellite TV, or if you know why “Friends” was canceled.Wandering down 1st September Street, named in honor of Colonel Qaddafi’s 1969 coup, you immediately grasp that the heart of Tripoli, a city of 1.7 million (roughly one-third of Libya’s population), beats at a colonial pace. It is very much the Havana of the Arab world, a time capsule thanks to years of severe sanctions.THE Italians, who ruled Libya as a colony from 1911 to 1947, built this section of the city in the 1920’s, with its filigreed iron balconies and broad marble courtyards, which are now filled with drying laundry, exposed wires and the shouts of uniformed schoolboys playing soccer. The Euro-clothing stores, with their soccer jerseys and Armani shoes, are nearly all aimed at men (most women wear the traditional hijab and shop for fabrics in the medina, or old city). Young guys in Diesel knockoffs slouch against the windows on the high narrow sidewalks and will offer warm hellos if greeted.While the city still runs on a bring-your-cash economy, A.T.M.’s are appearing in larger hotels and a few camera shops catering to tourists take credit cards. Of course, modernity is nowhere in sight once you cross Green Square and enter the medina. Its meandering souks offer everything from cheap luggage and Nike knockoffs to stuffed pythons and cheetah pelts to illegal ivory and handcrafted gold and silver arabesque jewelry sold by the gram.Since the entire city shuts down for about three hours around 1 p.m. so the locals can avoid the blistering heat with a shady nap at home, it’s a good idea to grab lunch in the medina. The best place to do that is al-Bouri, a rustic carpet-walled cafe a few yards north of the medina gate and through a warren of back alleys. You can get a full meal (spicy Libyan soup, couscous with lamb and grilled shilba, a type of seabream) for 5 dinars.There is little to do as the city sleeps, so you may want to catch a cab at Green Square (most rides around town are 2 to 3 dinars) back to your hotel for a little rest. Libyan drivers like to make up for the strict politics of their leader by ignoring traffic lights and swerving into approaching traffic if it means getting past a logjam of cars. So hang on to your lunch.And if you’re staying in the area of al-Kendi Street, a booming residential and retail district south of the square, where hotels are going up on nearly every block, don’t be alarmed by the rubble and garbage in the street. It’s all part of the chaos of progress — and the lack of any clear cleanup plan.The evenings in Tripoli are a bit of a bust if you’re looking for night life. Libya is one of the few dry countries left on the planet. The best bet is a leisurely dinner a few miles east of town, at the Hoffra (meaning hole) Fish Market. It is a slippery, slimy alley of fishmongers, who offer squid, shrimp, farouge (a local fish) and other things by the kilogram.One of several nearby cafes will cook whatever you buy for 5 dinars a person. You can follow that with a relaxing hookah and a cup of stiff and muddy Arabic coffee.If you happen to have taken the phone number of that stranger you met in the morning, however, and if he happened to invite you to the beach, you can find yourself swilling bootleg schnapps cooked on a stove-top pot as the stars twinkle extra brightly overhead. Of course, you’d also wake the next morning with a poisoned headache, sand fleas biting your face and the surreal scene outside your grass hut of teenage girls in black hijabs as they splash in the blinding surf atop inflated Donald Duck rafts.And sitting closer to you, your new friends would be smoking cigarettes and laughing, while the nice families stare and one new pal bellows, “Don’t worry, these are not terrorists.”HOW TO GET THERETripoli is a 90-minute flight from Rome and a two-hour flight from Milan.

A mixed plate of shrimp, fish and calamari is about 22 dinars. Add an extra 7 dinars for the salad buffet.Try Mat’am as-Safir (Sharia al-Baladiya, 218-21-4447-064) in the embassy district for a local dinner among arabesque tiles and rustic tables. A meal of couscous with lamb, spicy soup and a grilled fish is about 25 dinars.It’s best to get lost in this maze of shops, but be sure not to miss the Copper Souq, where sooty-faced men toil over fires, forging everything from serving platters (from 5 dinars to 100 dinar depending on size and intricacy) to the crescents that adorn the minarets of mosques.'"

"'06-08-28,'1','NEW YORK (AP) -- Be prepared to pay if your team makes it to the World Series. The price of regular box seats will be $250, according to notices some teams have started sending to their season ticket holders.That's up from $185 last year, a 35 percent hike that is the steepest in nearly a decade, since Major League Baseball doubled the price from $75 to $150 in 1998. The cost rose to $160 in 2000, $175 in 2001 and $185 in 2004, where it stayed last year.Premium seats, which include waiter service, cost even more.Baseball commissioner Bud Selig declined comment and Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.''The ticket prices are comparable to other major events,'' baseball spokesman Rich Levin said.Baseball's ticket-price range for the Series will start at a low of $75, a $10 increase from last year.While the top price has more than tripled since 1998, the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers -- which baseball often ties its minimum salary to -- has gone up 24.7 percent since then, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Still, World Series tickets cost far less than seats for the Super Bowl, where tickets were $600 apiece last year.

But he has argued that a government inquest would be faster and more efficient.Mr. Olmert and his government, elected only five months ago, are trying to respond to public unhappiness with the results of the war without losing control of any investigation. Aides to Mr. Olmert said he believes the war was positive for Israel and that ordinary Israelis will come to see that in time, and that a protest movement among reservists will peter out.Few Israelis have the appetite for a new election, and those on the left who are unhappy with Mr. Olmert and Defense Minister Amir Peretz, the head of the Labor Party, do not want to see the Israeli right benefit from new voting.A state commission of inquiry would have the power to subpoena witnesses and could demand resignations. Once announced, it would be out of the government’s control, with its members appointed by the head of the supreme court.In the West Bank today, Palestinian state workers held a strike and march in Ramallah and hospital workers in Nablus went out on strike over the government’s failure to pay their salaries.The civil servants’ union announced earlier that about 80,000 workers would launch an open-ended strike Sept. 2, the first day of the school year. The workers include 37,000 teachers and 25,000 health workers, the union said.The action is an indication that popular patience with Hamas may be running out, as the American and Israeli governments predicted when they announced a freeze on financial aid to the Palestinian state.The West has cut off most aid to Hamas because it has refused to recognize the right of Israel to exist, refused to forswear violence and refused to accept previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements.Efforts by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah to create a unity government with Hamas on the basis of a document written by prisoners have been stymied by Hamas’s insistence that it lead such a government. Nor has Mr. Abbas been willing to dissolve the Hamas government, as the Bush Administration has reportedly urged him to do.Four Palestinians were killed near Gaza City today. Palestinian security officials said the four were manning roadblocks in the area when they were hit by Israeli air-to-ground missile fire. The Israeli military said Israeli soldiers operating in the area killed three Palestinians in a firefight, but did not know of a fourth man killed.Hamas gunmen shot a motorist who refused to stop at a roadblock in southern gaza, witnesses said. The gunmen said they came under fire from the approaching car and returned fire. The shooting appeared to be another sign of tension between Hamas and Fatah.In another American effort to try to keep the Karni crossing between Gaza and Israel open more often than it is shut — invariably, the Israelis insist, because of security alerts — the American security coordinator for the Palestinians, Maj. Gen. Keith Dayton, proposed expanding Karni and putting some 90 international observers, themselves watched by Americans, on the Palestinian side of the crossing to assuage Israeli fears.He first proposed the idea, which would cost $19.2 million in all, with about half to be spent this year, to a donors’ group meeting on Aug. 8, a Western diplomat said. Palestinians have accepted the idea; the Israelis have not yet responded. The American Embassy said it would have no comment.Mr. Hamad said that his article, published in a newspaper normally associated with Fatah, was a personal comment. Despite the digs at Fatah, it was noteworthy for its criticism of the habit among Palestinians of blaming Israel and its long occupation of Palestinian lands for every ill — even after Israeli troops and settlers had left Gaza.“I’m not interested in discussing the ugliness and brutality of the occupation, because it is not a secret,” Mr. Hamad wrote. “Instead, I prefer self-criticism and self-evaluation. We’re used to blaming our mistakes on others.”Palestinian joy after the Israeli departure “made us forget the most important question — what is our next step?” he wrote.“When you walk in the streets of Gaza City,” Mr. Hamad continued, “you cannot but close your eyes because of what you see there: unimaginable chaos, careless policemen, young men carrying guns and strutting with pride, and families receiving condolences for their dead in the middle of the street.”He asked: “What is the relationship between the chaos, anarchy, lawlessness, indiscriminate murders, theft of land, family rivalries, transgression on public lands and unorganized traffic, and the occupation? We are still trapped by the mentality of conspiracy theories — one that has limited our capability to think.”He wrote that those who saw themselves as fighting Israel were working at cross-purposes: “It is strange that, when a big effort is taken to reopen Rafah crossing to ease the suffering of the people, you see others who go to shell rockets towards the crossing. Or when someone talks about cease-fire and its importance, you find those who go and shell more rockets. Of course, I do not deny that the occupation committed massacres that cannot be justified. But I support negotiations over what can be fixed.”Some Palestinians will agree with him and others disagree, Mr. Hamad wrote. “But running away from self-confrontation will only cause us more pain.”'"
"'06-08-28,'1','Every year brings new reasons to disparage the Emmys, and this year, they were new rules and a pre-Labor Day time slot. A change in the nominations process shut hit shows like “Lost” and “Desperate Housewives” out of the top categories. And to accommodate its fall football schedule, NBC had to move the awards show to the dog days of August.But low expectations have a bright spot: Conan O’Brien’s opening monologue had some funny moments, and a few of the better series won top awards. “The Office” won the Emmy for outstanding comedy, Jeremy Piven won best supporting actor in a comedy for “Entourage,” and Andre Braugher won the Emmy for lead actor in a mini-series or movie for “Thief.”And there was just enough low-key sizzle and lack of sentiment to keep the long night aloft. “Don’t thank your parents,” Mr. O’Brien told nominees at the start. “If you were raised in a nurturing environment, you wouldn’t be in show business.”There should be an annual award for most glaring omission in an acceptance speech. This year, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who won for leading actress in a sitcom, the “New Adventures of Old Christine,” won the amnesia award hands down, wracking her brain onstage to remember whom she had forgotten to thank, while the camera panned to her husband. It took several beats, and whispers from the audience, to jog her memory.The tribute to an ailing Dick Clark on the 50th anniversary of “American Bandstand” was more brisk than maudlin: the television impresario received a standing ovation when he appeared, his voice slurred, at the microphone and made a joke about being asked to take the stage when he had barely learned to walk again after his last stroke.'"
"'06-08-28,'1','At the very top of the income spectrum, many workers have continued to receive raises that outpace inflation, and the gains have been large enough to keep average income and consumer spending rising.In a speech on Friday, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, did not specifically discuss wages, but he warned that the unequal distribution of the economy’s spoils could derail the trade liberalization of recent decades. Because recent economic changes “threaten the livelihoods of some workers and the profits of some firms,” Mr. Bernanke said, policy makers must try “to ensure that the benefits of global economic integration are sufficiently widely shared.”Political analysts are divided over how much the wage trends will help Democrats this fall in their effort to take control of the House and, in a bigger stretch, the Senate. Some see parallels to watershed political years like 1980, 1992 and 1994, when wage growth fell behind inflation, party alignments shifted and dozens of incumbents were thrown out of office.“It’s a dangerous time for any party to have control of the federal government — the presidency, the Senate and the House,” said Charles Cook, who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter. “It all feeds into ‘it’s a time for a change’ sentiment. It’s a highly combustible mixture.”But others say that war in Iraq and terrorism, not the economy, will dominate the campaign and that Democrats have yet to offer an economic vision that appeals to voters.“National economic policies are more clearly in focus in presidential campaigns,” said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan’s consumer surveys. “When you’re electing your local House members, you don’t debate that on those issues as much.”Moreover, polls show that Americans are less dissatisfied with the economy than they were in the early 1980’s or early 90’s. Rising house and stock values have lifted the net worth of many families over the last few years, and interest rates remain fairly low.But polls show that Americans disapprove of President Bush’s handling of the economy by wide margins and that anxiety about the future is growing. Earlier this month, the University of Michigan reported that consumer confidence had fallen sharply in recent months, with people’s expectations for the future now as downbeat as they were in 1992 and 1993, when the job market had not yet recovered from a recession.“Some people who aren’t partisans say, ‘Yes, the economy’s pretty good, so why are people so agitated and anxious?’ ” said Frank Luntz, a Republican campaign consultant. “The answer is they don’t feel it in their weekly paychecks.”But Mr. Luntz predicted that the economic mood would not do significant damage to Republicans this fall because voters blamed corporate America, not the government, for their problems.Economists offer various reasons for the stagnation of wages. Although the economy continues to add jobs, global trade, immigration, layoffs and technology — as well as the insecurity caused by them — appear to have eroded workers’ bargaining power.Trade unions are much weaker than they once were, while the buying power of the minimum wage is at a 50-year low. And health care is far more expensive than it was a decade ago, causing companies to spend more on benefits at the expense of wages.Together, these forces have caused a growing share of the economy to go to companies instead of workers’ paychecks. In the first quarter of 2006, wages and salaries represented 45 percent of gross domestic product, down from almost 50 percent in the first quarter of 2001 and a record 53.6 percent in the first quarter of 1970, according to the Commerce Department. Each percentage point now equals about $132 billion.Total employee compensation — wages plus benefits — has fared a little better. Its share was briefly lower than its current level of 56.1 percent in the mid-1990’s and otherwise has not been so low since 1966.Over the last year, the value of employee benefits has risen only 3.4 percent, while inflation has exceeded 4 percent, according to the Labor Department.In Europe and Japan, the profit share of economic output is also at or near record levels, noted Larry Hatheway, chief economist for UBS Investment Bank, who said that this highlighted the pressures of globalization on wages. Many Americans, be they apparel workers or software programmers, are facing more comptition from China and India.In another recent report on the boom in profits, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote, “The most important contributor to higher profit margins over the past five years has been a decline in labor’s share of national income.” Low interest rates and the moderate cost of capital goods, like computers, have also played a role, though economists note that an economic slowdown could hurt profits in coming months.For most of the last century, wages and productivity — the key measure of the economy’s efficiency — have risen together, increasing rapidly through the 1950’s and 60’s and far more slowly in the 1970’s and 80’s.But in recent years, the productivity gains have continued while the pay increases have not kept up. Worker productivity rose 16.6 percent from 2000 to 2005, while total compensation for the median worker rose 7.2 percent, according to Labor Department statistics analyzed by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group. Benefits accounted for most of the increase.“If I had to sum it up,” said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the institute, “it comes down to bargaining power and the lack of ability of many in the work force to claim their fair share of growth.”Nominal wages have accelerated in the last year, but the spike in oil costs has eaten up the gains. Now the job market appears to be weakening, after a protracted series of interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.Unless these trends reverse, the current expansion may lack even an extended period of modest wage growth like one that occurred in the mid-1980’s.The most recent recession ended in late 2001. Hourly wages continued to rise in 2002 and peaked in early 2003, largely on the lingering strength of the 1990’s boom.Average family income, adjusted for inflation, has continued to advance at a good clip, a fact Mr. Bush has cited when speaking about the economy. But these gains are a result mainly of increases at the top of the income spectrum that pull up the overall numbers. Even for workers at the 90th percentile of earners — making about $80,000 a year — inflation has outpaced their pay increases over the last three years, according to the Labor Department.“There are two economies out there,” Mr. Cook, the political analyst, said. “One has been just white hot, going great guns. Those are the people who have benefited from globalization, technology, greater productivity and higher corporate earnings.“And then there’s the working stiffs,’’ he added, “who just don’t feel like they’re getting ahead despite the fact that they’re working very hard. And there are a lot more people in that group than the other group.”In 2004, the top 1 percent of earners — a group that includes many chief executives — received 11.2 percent of all wage income, up from 8.7 percent a decade earlier and less than 6 percent three decades ago, according to Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty, economists who analyzed the tax data.With the midterm campaign expected to heat up after Labor Day, Democrats are saying that they will help workers by making health care more affordable and lifting the minimum wage. Democrats have criticized Republicans for passing tax cuts mainly benefiting high-income families at a time when most families are failing to keep up.Republicans counter that the tax cuts passed during Mr. Bush’s first term helped lifted the economy out of recession. Unless the cuts are extended, a move many Democrats oppose, the economy will suffer, and so will wages, Republicans say.But in a sign that Republicans may be growing concerned about the public’s mood, the new Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., adopted a somewhat different tone from Mr. Bush in his first major speech, delivered early this month.“Many aren’t seeing significant increases in their take-home pay,” Mr. Paulson said. “Their increases in wages are being eaten up by high energy prices and rising health care costs, among others.”At the same time, he said that the Bush administration was not responsible for the situation, pointing out that inequality had been increasing for many years. “It is neither fair nor useful,” Mr. Paulson said, “to blame any political party.”'"
"'06-08-28,'1','Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has decided not to reappoint Stanley K. Schlein, a political power broker with ties to the Bronx Democratic organization that go back decades, as chairman of the New York City Civil Service Commission, where Mr. Schlein has held a seat since 1982.To fill Mr. Schlein’s seat, the mayor has nominated Simon P. Gourdine, a labor lawyer who has represented the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the professional basketball players’ union and the city over a lengthy career. If the City Council confirms Mr. Gourdine, the mayor intends to then name him chairman, officials said.Working mostly behind the scenes, Mr. Schlein, 58, has over three decades become one of the city’s most influential lawyers. In just the last two years, he helped the Yankees achieve their goal of starting a new stadium in the Bronx, was an election-law adviser to Fernando Ferrer during his unsuccessful challenge to Mr. Bloomberg last year, and represented Bronx politicians in talks over the city’s plans to build a water-filtration plant under Van Cortlandt Park. He was named chairman of the commission by Mayor Bloomberg.Mr. Schlein’s varied legal career, however, has not been unblemished. In February, state court officials barred him from accepting guardianships and other potentially lucrative judicial appointments, citing “conduct incompatible with the appointment and/or unsatisfactory performance.”In one case, Mr. Schlein was a guardian for an estate for which tax returns were not filed on time, and in another case, he was a guardian for someone whose property was foreclosed for back taxes, according to court records. Mr. Schlein has denied any impropriety.'"
"'06-08-28,'1','The goal this week is to see if sensors in the so-called kill vehicle can recognize an incoming warhead, not to actually hit it, General Obering said. A test in which the kill vehicle is supposed to hit the target warhead is planned for later this year, he said.But General Obering said that this week’s test was “about as realistic as you can get” because it employed a target that in its size and speed was representative of missiles that might be fired at the United States.In the last two flight tests, the system halted the firing sequence before the interceptor missile left its silo. General Obering said those setbacks were due to “minor glitches” in software and workmanship by contractors that had “nothing to do with the functionality of the system.”Even so, after the second failed test in February 2005, the system was taken down until December.On his tour of Fort Greely, a remote base 100 miles from Fairbanks, Mr. Rumsfeld climbed down a ladder into an underground silo containing one of the 10 54-foot-long interceptor missiles already deployed. Another of the three-stage missiles is scheduled to be put in the ground on Monday, officials said, and as many as 40 are supposed to be installed by next year. The other interceptor site is at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, where two interceptors are in silos.Once the sensors detect an incoming missile and the interceptor is launched, it flies 18,635 miles an hour until the kill vehicle separates from its missile and, if it works correctly, flies into the incoming one, destroying it.The Bush administration is also looking at locations for an interceptor site in Europe that would protect the United States and parts of Europe from missiles launched from the Middle East. The administration is seeking $126 million this year to build the site and the interceptors, which could be in place in four years if Congress provides the money, General Obering said.Later in the day, Mr. Rumsfeld met in Fairbanks with Sergei Ivanov, the defense minister of Russia, which has long been wary of the American antimissile system, fearing it could be expanded into a more robust shield that would threaten the strategic balance between the United States and Russia.Mr. Ivanov did not directly criticize the American system, but he called for “transparency” by the Bush administration, a term meant to convey Russia’s concern about any modifications to the system that could take its capabilities beyond stopping a small number of missiles.'"
"'06-08-28,'1','Board 118 was flat. Board 119 was also, but both Hamman-Soloway and Zia-Rosenberg missed a making four-spade contract. They had only 16 points opposite 3, but game required only to play A-J-9-8-5-3 opposite 7-6-4 for one loser. (The missing four trumps were divided 2-2.)On the final deal Zia opened one heart with a 4-5-2-2 11-count. Meckstroth overcalled one spade with a 5-2-3-3 11-count and 100 honors in spades. Eventually Rodwell played in three clubs, going down one. In the other room Soloway opened the 4-5-2-2 hand with two diamonds, Flannery, showing 4-5 in the majors. Hamman responded two spades with a 4-1-5-3 6-count. The contract looked all right until the trumps broke 5-0. Declarer went down three, and Jacobs gained 5 imps to win by 10 (203-193).At the other table Nickell opened the South hand with one heart, and Garner (West) passed, being dissuaded from acting by his singleton diamond. Freeman (North) responded one no-trump, forcing. South rebid two clubs; North jumped to three diamonds, inviting game with a decent six-card diamond suit; and South converted to three no-trump.Weinstein (East) led his spade four. Double dummy (looking at all of the cards), declarer can succeed by playing low from the board or winning with the ace, but North understandably played dummy’s queen. He was afraid that if he ducked the first trick, West would win and shift to a club from four or five to the ace-jack or king-jack. Now, though, West won with his spade king, cashed the club king and returned the spade jack. Declarer won with dummy’s ace and ran the diamonds, but he lost the rest of the tricks to finish down two.In this room Meckstroth (West) doubled the one-heart opening, risking an undesirable diamond advance by his partner. Zia (North) redoubled, Rodwell (East) bid one spade, and Rosenberg (South) passed. West cue-bid two hearts to show a strong spade raise, North continued with three diamonds to describe his hand, and South bid three no-trump.Played by South on this sequence, the contract was unbeatable. After West led the club ace, if he had shifted to a diamond, declarer would have won in his hand and played a high heart. If West ducks, the run of the diamonds would squeeze-endplay him in three suits.Seeing this, West continued with the club king and another club, hoping his partner had four low clubs or four diamonds to the jack. But South won with his club queen, led the heart queen, which held, and ran the diamonds to bring about this end position:On the final diamond, declarer discarded his heart ten, but West had no good pitch. If he threw a spade, declarer would play a spade to his ace. If West released the heart ace, South would take the heart king and spade ace. And if West jettisoned the club jack, declarer would call for a heart, throwing in West to lead away from his spade king. So three no-trump made with an overtrick, and Jacobs gained 13 imps, 3 more than its winning margin.The 120-board final between Ekeblad and Jacobs ends this evening. The play at both tables may be watched live at www.bridgebase.com.'"
"'06-08-28,'1','Mr. Girouard said he expected the pay service to appeal to larger organizations. He would not discuss any plans for pricing.Google’s software offerings beyond search are focused on communications and enabling workers to collaborate, but the company is testing spreadsheet software and a word-processing program called Writely that will soon be offered over the Web.When that happens, analysts say, the company will be in even more direct competition with the likes of Microsoft, which is moving to deliver more of its software to businesses over the Web. A number of smaller software companies already offer calendars, e-mail and other applications online.“I think it’s going to put Google head-to-head with Microsoft, especially when it comes to price-sensitive markets like small business and education,” said Matthew Brown, an analyst at Forrester Research in Boston.For small and medium-size businesses, the new Google services, called Google Apps for Your Domain, could produce huge savings in technology support costs, he said.As Google encroaches on the business software territory that Microsoft has traditionally dominated, Microsoft has responded by adding online Web services to its desktop software and beefing up its Web offerings, particularly in search services. Last year, Microsoft announced Office Live, a Web service aimed at helping businesses collaborate on spreadsheets and other documents.While each of the Google services has already been available to consumers, the package for businesses is aimed specifically at organizations that want to offer them in turn to their employees. Companies can use Google’s Gmail program, for example, to set up a corporate e-mail system with software for both the server computer and individual users.Providing technology to corporations and large organizations accounts for less than 2 percent of Google’s revenue, but the business is increasingly critical, Mr. Girouard said. Most of that involves selling “server appliances,” large computers that take on the job of conducting searches of large databases and company records.“We are a very small part of Google’s overall business, but we’re growing quickly,” he said.'"
"'06-08-28,'1','A group of creditors of Adelphia Communications asked a judge last week to liquidate the company and its affiliates, and thus speed payments to all creditors.Banks including Wachovia, PNC and Calyon, a unit of Crédit Agricole of France, asked Judge Robert E. Gerber of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan to convert the bankruptcy cases of Adelphia and some affiliates from a reorganization to a Chapter 7 liquidation.Under the plan, a court-appointed trustee would oversee the liquidation and develop a plan to distribute the proceeds to creditors.The move would hasten the end of the Adelphia case and allow stakeholders to be paid more quickly, the creditors said in a bankruptcy court filing on Friday. Adelphia’s pursuit of its own plan has been slowed by a dispute between creditor groups over how to distribute the proceeds of the company’s $17.6 billion asset sale to Time Warner and Comcast.“There is no just cause for continued delay to the distribution of cash,” Andrew Brozman, a lawyer for Calyon, said in court papers. “The distribution to creditors by a dispassionate Chapter 7 trustee will insure a quicker, more efficient and less costly alternative to the bottomless bog of the Adelphia cases.’’Adelphia filed for bankruptcy in June 2002. Its founder, John J. Rigas, and his son Timothy J. Rigas were both convicted in July 2004 of conspiracy and securities fraud.Adelphia has proposed several plans to repay creditors, all of which have received at least some opposition. It is scheduled to seek approval of the fifth version of its plan in October.'"

Naturally, being a democratic and progressive government, we want to encourage the spread of free software,” M. A. Baby, the state’s education minister, said by telephone.Microsoft was not being banned, he said, but the government was actively encouraging Kerala’s 12,500 schools to switch to the Linux operating system, available around the world free of charge.The news will further unsettle foreign investors in this state. Also this month, Kerala imposed a sweeping ban on the sale and production of Coke and Pepsi after an environmental watchdog based in Delhi said their soft drinks contained unhealthy levels of pesticides.

"'06-08-29,'1','She also said that the runway they chose did not have its lights on; the runway they were supposed to use did have lights along the sides, although the center lights were out because it had been repaved days earlier. One of the pilots remarked during the takeoff roll that the runway lights were out, Ms. Hersman said. That would be the first indication that the crew might have known something was wrong.As the experts tried to reconstruct what happened in the moments after Flight 5191 took off about 6:05 a.m., the victims’ families and friends struggled to comprehend their loss.The crash killed, among others, a Habitat for Humanity board member on his way to mark the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, a racehorse owner flying early so as not to miss his granddaughter’s fourth birthday party, and a small-town couple who married Saturday night and had arisen early Sunday to start their honeymoon.“I want to say that my heart is broken for everyone that was on that plane,’’ said Amy Clay, the wife of the pilot, Jeffrey Adam Clay, who died in the crash.Ms. Clay discounted the theory that the three-member crew may not have been well-rested, saying her 35-year-old husband, whom she described as meticulous, was in bed by 10 p.m. for the 6 a.m. flight.“He is a man who loves to balance his checkbook because he likes to hear the ‘ding’ that comes up on Quicken,” she said. “He built our daughters a playhouse in the backyard and landscaped it. So this was not a man who cut corners. He was very detail-oriented.”Ms. Clay described an agonizing wait after learning that one of the two pilots had survived the crash, only to find that it had not been her husband but his co-pilot, James M. Polehinke. Mr. Polehinke, pulled from the wreckage by a Lexington police officer, was the sole survivor and remained in critical condition.Keith Madison, a baseball coach at the University of Kentucky, fielded calls from young men numb with disbelief over the death of their former teammate Jonathan Hooker, 27, the groom in Saturday’s wedding. His bride, Scarlett Parsley, 23, was from the same town, London, Ky., and was attending graduate school to become a speech pathologist.The two were married on the grounds of a museum in bluegrass country. The bride arrived by carriage. “I’d never seen either one of them happier,” a bridesmaid, Katrina Slone, said.Another passenger, Jeff Williams, a horse trainer at River Downs in Cincinnati, had been on his way to Texas to pursue a job opportunity.Other passengers included Carole Bizzack, 64, who was to meet her sister for an Alaskan cruise, Larry Turner, 51, the director of the agricultural extension service at the University of Kentucky, and George Brunacini, 60, a prominent real estate developer who owned a horse that ran in last year’s Kentucky Derby. The Habitat for Humanity member, Patrick H. Smith, 58, was on his way to Gulfport, Miss., where he and his wife had helped raise money to build 13 houses for hurricane survivors.Safety experts suggested that an on-board warning system already in use in hundreds of airplanes could have prevented the crash. The system is not used in small commuter planes, its manufacturer said.The warning system announces, in a mechanical voice, which runway the plane has entered. If the runway is too short for the plane, the system announces how many feet of runway remain.“It doesn’t tell you what to do,’’ said Robert T. Francis, a former vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. “It just makes you aware of where you are and how much runway you have left.”The system has been bought by Alaska Airlines, Air France, FedEx, Lufthansa and Malaysia Airlines, but not by any commuter carriers, according to the manufacturer, Honeywell Aerospace. The “catalogue price” is $18,000 per plane, but many carriers pay less, a Honeywell spokesman, Bill Revis, said.Elsewhere in Kentucky on Monday, a small private plane with seven aboard crashed in a remote area.

Those recommendations included steps that the city’s construction unions adopted to increase the number of minorities and women in the unions’ apprenticeship programs.Mr. Doctoroff said it was too early to guess what steps the group on film and television production might suggest.The jobs range from entry-level production-assistant work — which can include tasks like running errands and making sure that residents do not wander onto a set in the street — to skilled occupations like camera operator, electrical and sound technician, and scenic, wardrobe and makeup specialist.Most of these jobs are unionized, and “the bulk are really good working-people’s jobs,” Mr. Doctoroff said. While wages vary according to the skills required and the individual’s experience, the State Labor Department has estimated that experienced sound engineering technicians who worked steadily last year earned more than $70,000, and camera operators nearly $50,000.Mr. Doctoroff said that given a lack of demographic data on the industry’s production ranks in the city, “I don’t think we know for sure” whether minority groups and women are seriously underrepresented. “But we believe we can do better,” he said, especially in relation to the higher-paying jobs in the industry.But Ms. James, whose district includes Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, said she had often heard “complaints that when you go to film locations, you see a paucity of women and people of color” in the production ranks.She said she and other council members had brought up the matter in 2004 at committee hearings on a bill, which later passed, to add city tax breaks to state tax incentives for movie and television companies to film in New York.Ms. James recalled that at the hearings, she asked the companies’ representatives “what statistics they had on the employment of people of color and women” in production jobs.“They said they didn’t know; that they don’t keep those numbers,” she recalled. Then early this year after hearings on another bill to extend the city tax incentives, she said, she expressed her concerns to Ms. Quinn, who then formed the task force.At the panel’s urging, Ms. James said, the city now gathers information on the demographics of production crews. The application for the program’s tax credit requires a company to provide the number of minorities and women employed on the production, she said. The information gathered, she said, will provide a database of such employment, and “we’ll be able to see changes from year to year.”Film and television production in the city provides work for 100,000 people and contributes $5 billion a year to the city’s economy, according to Katherine Oliver, commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. In January, the office began a program to train city residents for entry-level production-assistant jobs. Last year across the city, Mayor Bloomberg said recently, “the number of shooting days hit an all-time high of 31,570, a 35 percent increase over 2004 and double that of 2002.”A spokesman for the largest union representing the industry’s production workers — the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts — said that officials of the union were not available to provide their views on the administration’s plan. But Ms. James said that representatives of several New York-area union locals were members of the City Council’s task force.Sylvia Kinard-Thompson, a member of the board of the New York Production Alliance, which includes film companies and unions, said minorities and women “absolutely are” underrepresented in the production ranks. But she said she found the unions to be “pretty responsive” to recent calls for change.Ms. Kinard-Thompson said the underrepresentation was a legacy of “how the industry evolved,” with many people having had a leg up on finding their first jobs because their “grandfathers were in the union and their fathers were.” And on small productions that do not use union members, she said, “it’s still who you know” that often determines who works on a film.'"

"'06-08-29,'1','A New York State judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by the former chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard A. Grasso, against H. Carl McCall, a former Big Board director who once ran New York State’s finances.The lawsuit was part of the larger legal battle between the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, and Mr. Grasso. Mr. Spitzer has accused the former exchange chief of receiving excessive and unreasonable compensation during his time running what was then a nonprofit exchange.In his lawsuit, Mr. Grasso asserted that Mr. McCall, who was chairman of the compensation committee that approved a $190 million pay and retirement package, should be held responsible for some part of the compensation if the court deemed it unreasonable.But Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan dismissed Mr. Grasso’s suit, stating that he had failed “to establish any special duty owed him by Mr. McCall, or any specific misrepresentations made by McCall.”In his 11-page decision, Justice Ramos wrote that Mr. McCall’s only duty was to the board, not Mr. Grasso.'"

An S.& P. retail index advanced 1.1 percent.Traders said Wal-Mart’s sales forecast helped ease worries about the retail industry, which took a beating last week as investors worried that a housing slowdown would hurt consumer spending. Wal-Mart’s stock rose 1.3 percent, or 55 cents, to $44.43.Shares of eBay rose 1.9 percent, or 49 cents, to $25.79, and Google shares advanced 2.1 percent, or $7.69, to $380.95.

"'06-08-29,'1','Researchers have found that surgeons over age 60 perform some complicated procedures somewhat less well than younger surgeons do.But patients trying to settle on a surgeon would do better to look at how many procedures the surgeon performs than at the age, the study concluded. The more active an older surgeon is, the researchers found, the better the patients fare.The study, in the September issue of Annals of Surgery, looked at eight types of cardiovascular procedures done on more than 450,000 patients over one year.It found that for three of them — bypass surgery, complete or partial removal of the pancreas and surgery to improve blood flow in the carotid artery — older surgeons did less well. In the 30 days after surgery, their patients had somewhat higher mortality rates.Some of the explanation may lie with natural changes that come with age.“Compared with primary care,” the study said, the practice of surgery may present different challenges for the older physician. “Complex procedures are long and require considerable physical and mental stamina.”But the researchers, led by Dr. Jennifer F. Waljee of the University of Michigan Medical School, said the differences tended to disappear with the more procedures a surgeon did.The study may offer more guidance for doctors than for patients, at least in terms of how they manage their careers.'"
"'06-08-29,'1','Many young people are careful to use condoms with casual partners, but a new study suggests that they are less so with their main partner. The problem, the researchers found, is that it is common for many young people to be in what they consider a committed relationship but still have sex with other people.Given that, the researchers said, even if they are careful about using condoms with casual partners, they take chances when they have unprotected sex with the main partner. This is especially true because the people surveyed reported using a condom in only about half of their casual sexual encounters.“In some ways, it’s almost as if they have not really thought it through,” said the lead author of the study, Celia M. Lescano, a psychologist at the Bradley Hasbro Children’s Research Center in Providence, R.I., and an assistant professor at Brown Medical School. “Which is not surprising, given that sexual encounters, whether with a casual or a main partner, can be so spontaneous.”In fact, the researchers, who questioned more than 1,300 sexually active people ages 15 to 21 in three major cities about their sexual activity over the preceding 90 days, found that those with and without regular partners had on average the same amount of unprotected sex.That is because even though those who did not have a serious partner reported using condoms at a higher rate, this fact was still outweighed by the number of times they did not use them.“Perhaps adolescents overestimate the safety of using condoms ‘most of the time’ with a casual partner and underestimate the risk of unprotected sex with a ‘serious’ partner,” said the study, which appears in the September issue of The Journal of Adolescent Health.'"
"'06-08-29,'1','Or consider the amorous couple next door who seem to be replaying the raucous lovemaking scene between Madeline Kahn and Peter Boyle as the monster in Mel Brooks’s “Young Frankenstein.” You know, the noisy scene in bed that ends with Madeline Kahn’s hair turning white while she ecstatically warbles “O Sweet Mystery of Life?” I was kept awake till dawn once listening to a performance something like that in a South Beach hotel.We all have stories. “I was at a very elegant hotel in London recently, just fatigued like crazy, with a meeting the next morning, and I could hear the couple next door talking for hours, just as if I was in on the conversation,” said Rod Young, who travels 60 percent of his time as the chief executive of the Angeion Corporation, a maker of medical devices.Another time, he said, “a couple was in a full-blown extended argument in the next room about whether he should have ordered the creamy salad dressing. I almost got out of bed and knocked on the door and said, ‘Yes, the creamy was fine.’ ”Most noise violations occur through a combination of poor construction and some people’s ignorance that the sounds of even normal activities — including phone calls — carry through the walls in many hotels. “It’s not like you have a rock band beating on the walls all night,” Mr. Young said. He says he occasionally deals with the problem by “putting a pillow over my head.”It has been my experience recently that major hotel chains have done a lot to address the issue, but the problem is you cannot tell in advance where the clunkers are.The AmericInn chain, with more than 200 hotels in 23 states, has a definite advantage in its new campaign of promoting quiet rooms, for which it adopted the slogan, “Welcome to the end of the day.”Basically, you need to think of noise-proofing before the first backhoe shows up on a new property, says Arnold A. Angeloni, who became chief executive of the chain several years ago after many years of traveling on business.The company started in the 1980’s and grew through the 1990’s. “Right from the beginning, the company insisted on using masonry construction versus stick-built, even though it costs more initially,” Mr. Angeloni said.The new AmericInn promotion is specific about noise abatement. The hotels have masonry walls and floors, concrete block walls filled with foam, insulated windows and guest room doors with thresholds to cut down on hallway noise.In interviews, guests typically list clean rooms, security and location as their top priorities.“Those are table stakes,” Mr. Angeloni said. “If you don’t provide those things, you can’t exist.” But noise comes up next on the lists.On a recent stay with his wife at a competing chain hotel in Virginia, Mr. Angeloni said, he was awakened at an unholy hour by the alarm clock.“I was hitting all the buttons trying to make the thing go off, and finally my wife said, ‘Arnold, it’s in the next room,’ ” he said.'"

The latest rate is just above the eight-year low of 4 percent reached in May. In July, the total number of jobless fell to 2.68 million people, a drop of 210,000 from a year earlier and the eighth consecutive monthly decline. The number of employed rose by 110,000, to 64.21 million people, according to the report, which was released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. It was the 15th consecutive month of increases in the number of employed. The chief cabinet secretary, Shinzo Abe, above, said the improvement reflected government policies.

(BLOOMBERG NEWS)The European Union warned carmakers that it would introduce legislation to enforce cuts in carbon dioxide emissions if the industry did not work harder to meet voluntary pollution-cutting targets. The European Commission welcomed figures showing that European, Japanese and Korean producers had reduced CO2 emissions from new cars by an average of 12.4 percent from 1995 to 2004. But it said faster reductions were needed if the industry was to meet the voluntary targets of a 25 percent cut by 2008 for the Europeans and 2009 for the Asian manufacturers. “The situation is not satisfactory,” said the European Union’s industry commissioner, Günter Verheugen. “We expect that the industry sticks to its commitments.” Ivan Hodac, secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, said that the group would work with the European Union in developing further ideas for reducing pollution. (AP)Shares in EADS, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, rose 1.5 percent after a Russian business newspaper reported that a state bank in Moscow had been quietly buying stock in the company. Russian and European officials have floated the idea that Russia could become a member in the European airline consortium, the parent company of Airbus, the passenger plane maker. If confirmed, the stock purchase would represent another plunge by a Russian state-controlled business into the Western European market; Gazprom, the state natural gas monopoly, has purchased energy and pipeline companies in Europe. Russian government officials declined to comment on the report, which was published in Vedomosti, a Russian business daily. ANDREW E.

"'06-08-30,'1','Among the nation’s largest counties, Somerset in New Jersey ranked fourth in median household income ($88,532), and Morris, Nassau, Rockland and Suffolk were all among the top 10. The Bronx was third-lowest ($29,228) and remained the poorest urban county in the country. More than half of Bronx households headed by a woman and including young children live below the poverty level.No city in metropolitan New York made the nation’s top 10 in median income, but several were among its poorest. Newark, at $30,711, ranked seventh from the bottom, just below New Orleans, among the biggest cities. Buffalo was third from the bottom. Among America’s smaller cities, Camden, N.J., at $18,007, had the lowest median income in the nation and the highest proportion of poor people — 44 percent.At the same time, New Jersey’s median income was again the highest of any state’s. Maryland edged Connecticut for second place. New York ranked 15th.Since 2000, median income has declined in all three states. Only two counties in the metropolitan area — Cape May in New Jersey and Sullivan in New York — recorded significant gains. Across the country, only two states recorded significant gains.In 2005, according to the American Community Survey, the poverty rate was 13.8 percent in New York State, 8.3 percent in Connecticut and 8.7 percent in New Jersey. In the city, the overall poverty rate remained at just over 19 percent, but compared with a year earlier, it appeared to have increased among the elderly and decreased among children younger than 18. In Queens, poverty rates declined.Statewide, New York ranked 17th in the share of children who are poor (more than 19 percent), and was tied with Texas for 8th in the share of elderly who are poor (nearly 13 percent).In New York City, median household income — the middle number on the scale — remained about the same since 2004, at $43,434. But the mean, or average, income rose, suggesting greater gains among the well-to-do. Manhattanites recorded the biggest income gains. About 5 percent of households in the city reported incomes of $200,000 or more; 13 percent reported making less than $10,000.“With median income in New York City you have to be careful,” said Steve Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group. “We’ve been seeing big income gains in a few very wealthy industries, and a few studies have suggested that the gains are not coursing through the entire city economy.”Given the steady influx of poor immigrants, he expressed surprise that the poverty rate was unchanged.“The city has been a fairly good place for the foreign-born to come and improve their fortunes,” Mr. Malanga said. “However, even as they do that we have a steady stream of foreign-born who come here and begin their life in poverty — a constant replenishment of the ranks of impoverished foreigners.”He estimated that “about 30 percent basically live below the poverty level their first year in New York,” but that many “are finding their way out of poverty in 5 to 10 years.”But he added that the competition from immigrants for lower-paying jobs also meant “that people who are here without a high school diploma are finding it even more difficult to pull themselves out of poverty.”Mr. Bloomberg seemed to concur. “New York City is a city where more and more people want to come,” he said. “Some people that come, come with wealth. Some people that come, come with simply aspirations. And we are an immigrant community. We’re always going to have people coming in who have come here leaving everything back where they came from except what’s inside them. And that’s a way to start up the ladder.”The mayor, whose commission on reducing poverty is expected to report next month, said: “You cannot go and make real progress if you just worry about opinion and say, ‘I’ve got to do everything for everybody.’ That’s just not possible. What we’re trying to do is to focus on groups.”Mark Levitan, senior policy analyst for the Community Service Society, a liberal research and advocacy group, said the new figures were “telling us that we have growing inequality — income is rising in the middle of the distribution, but it’s not trickling down. We’ve gone from a jobless recovery to a recovery where wage increases can’t match the rate of inflation.”Mining the Current Population Survey, Dr. Levitan said he found that the poverty rate among households with children headed by a woman, which had declined from 56 percent a decade ago to 39 percent in 2001, had risen again to 49 percent — an increase not evident from the American Community Survey figures.What he could conclude with absolute certainty, he said, was that the poverty rate is “stagnant overall.”Trudi Renwick, senior economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal watchdog group, agreed. “It’s flat, or down only very slightly in the city, despite tremendous economic growth,” she said.“We have a picture — and you can place all kinds of value judgments on it — of stability with a lot of these numbers,” said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the Department of City Planning’s population division. “That can be seen as encouraging, and discouraging.”Yesterday’s release of the American Community Survey, an annual version of the census long-form questionnaire, also plumbed employment patterns.It found that in New York, women earned 79.4 percent of what men did, above the national average and slightly higher than in New Jersey and Connecticut.New York is tied with Colorado for first in the highest proportion of people working in the information industry (3.5 percent). Connecticut ranks first in the proportion of people in management, business and finance (16.3 percent).'"

Frenkel, who is a lawyer at Shulman, Rogers, Gandal, Pordy & Ecker in Rockville, Md., and is a former S.E.C. attorney in the enforcement division, said, “If the Justice Department issues a subpoena, then it is one of the investigations that the government as a whole views as potentially more serious, and it also is the case that it is more likely to result in criminal charges.”A spokeswomen for Barnes & Noble, Mary Ellen Keating, declined to comment beyond the filing.'"
"'06-08-30,'1','Johnson & Johnson won an antitrust lawsuit yesterday that had accused the company of illegally using its sutures monopoly to increase sales of other surgical products.A federal jury in Santa Ana, Calif., rejected claims by the Applied Medical Resources Corporation that the Ethicon unit of Johnson & Johnson had blocked competition in the market for trocars, instruments used in so-called keyhole surgery. Applied Medical, which is closely held, sued in 2003 for $54 million in damages, which could have been tripled under antitrust laws.Applied Medical, based in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif., said Ethicon had taken away its sales by offering discounts on sutures to hospitals that also bought the company’s trocars and clip appliers.Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., argued that the bundling contracts did not unfairly exclude other suppliers and were requested by hospitals that sought lower prices.The jury of six women and three men deliberated for 2½ days before reaching a decision. James Quinn, a lawyer for Johnson & Johnson, declined to comment after the verdict was read. Karen Gibbs, general counsel for Applied Medical, had no immediate comment.'"

Google also has a feature that lets users search for songs and links them to online music stores, including the Apple iTunes site.'"
"'06-08-30,'1','A spokesman for the Justice Department, Bryan Sierra, declined to comment. A spokesman for the trading commission, Dennis Holden, declined to confirm whether the agency had subpoenaed BP.BP’s troubles have led to heightened scrutiny over its practices and safety record at a time when high oil and gasoline prices have pushed energy companies into the limelight.More than any other oil company, BP, based in London, has nurtured an image of environmental responsibility, which risks being tarnished by missteps in the United States. The company has acknowledged the problem and last month appointed a new manager for its American operations, Robert A. Malone.BP is the largest oil and natural gas producer in America.Turning up the political heat on the company, lawmakers in Congress are asking BP executives to appear before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce next week to answer questions about the Alaska spill. Representative Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who is the committee’s chairman, said in an Aug. 11 letter to BP’s chief executive, Lord Browne, that the Alaska shutdown was a result of “chronic neglect.’’Separately, a judge in Texas has ordered Lord Browne to be available for questioning about the explosion at the BP refinery. BP said it would appeal that ruling, arguing that Lord Browne had “no unique knowledge” in the case.In the most embarrassing, and costly, mishap to date, BP was forced to temporarily shut Alaska’s biggest oil field, Prudhoe Bay, after detecting heavy corrosion and a small leak in a critical pipeline. The emergency announcement earlier this month caught oil markets by surprise and drove global prices to nearly $77 a barrel. Oil prices have since retreated to below $70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.The Prudhoe Bay field produces 400,000 barrels a day, or 8 percent of American crude oil, and is the largest field in North America.But a few days later, BP said it would avert a total shutdown by keeping one side of the oil field open while it replaced 16 miles of corroded or damaged pipeline. The company is now producing about 150,000 barrels of oil and natural gas a day from the western side of the field, but aims to reach about 200,000 barrels a day until repairs are completed.An analyst at A. G. Edwards, Bruce Lanni, said BP was being made a target by investigators, in part because its recent problems had made the company a very public entity.“Obviously because of the number of incidents that BP has had recently and how visible they have been,” Mr. Lanni said, “the company has become a focal point of a number of investigations. Their visibility has increased as a result of this.”He added, “but these problems are not just endemic to BP, they affect the entire industry.”BP has faced inquiries over its trading practices in the past. Its trading desk, which last year accounted for 13 percent of its $22 billion in profits, has a reputation for its aggressive tactics. In June, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused BP of trying to corner the propane market.In 2003, the company was fined $2.5 million by the New York Mercantile Exchange to resolve charges of oil trading violations in 2001 and 2002. While it settled the charge, BP neither admitted nor denied breaking the exchange’s rules.BP also agreed that year to pay $3 million as part of a settlement to claims that it had profited from false trades in the power market during the California energy crisis of 2000 and 2001.'"

"'06-08-31,'0','""Tonight has been another example of moments you're not guaranteed in life,"" Agassi said.Baghdatis' very first serve of the second-round encounter was a fault, eliciting hoots from the stands. Moments later, a fan in the upper deck yelled: ""Andre, this is your house! And it's all of us against him!""As if there were any doubt. Agassi is, after all, an American at the American Grand Slam, one of the most popular players in recent tennis history -- and everyone knows each match here could be his last as a pro. That final part is also why Agassi went to the hospital this week for the latest in a series of shots to dull pain from a troublesome sciatic nerve; he could barely stand after his first-round victory over Andrei Pavel.Against Baghdatis, Agassi missed consecutive backhands to get broken in the fifth set's opening game. Agassi wiped sweat from his brow, shook his head and trudged slowly toward the sideline. Was the end near? But with the lead -- and momentum -- finally on Baghdatis' side, it was youngster who asked for a medical timeout so he could get his strained left thigh massaged.Agassi took a seat and sighed, while the crowd chanted, ""Let's go, Andre!"" And there was nothing wrong with Agassi's back when he stretched for a low volley at a sharp angle to break right back in the next game. Agassi shook his fist and clenched his teeth, still spry after all these years.He had appeared to be in control after the first two sets since he had won all 58 matches at the Open with that size lead. And Agassi was up 4-0 in the fourth set, before winners began to come more frequently from the racket of Baghdatis, who knew his role going in, saying: ""Sure, I'm the bad guy for tonight.""Now comes this third-round matchup: Agassi vs. Becker. A classic right? Well, not quite. It's Benjamin Becker (no relation to Boris), a 25-year-old qualifier from Germany who's ranked 112th and has won zero tour titles. Becker knocked off No. 30 Sebastien Grosjean in straight sets.Get past that, and Agassi could face Andy Roddick in the round of 16.'"

According to Gazprom’s press secretary, Mr. Usmanov’s investment is a private affair, with no connection to the gas giant. A source close to the newspaper’s previous owner, however, says that Mr. Usmanov may soon sell his stocks to a state structure like Gazprom Media. Another source close to Gazprom said that the company may explore the possibility of buying Kommersant in the near future.SECURING MOSCOW’S SCHOOLS: Moscow’s schools will have heightened security when classes resume on Sept. 1 to guard against possible terrorist attacks on the second anniversary of the Beslan school siege. The city has assigned more than 15,000 law enforcement officers and soldiers specifically to guard local schools, and will remove trashcans, cars and construction materials from school vicinities. For the rest of the year, however, the government will provide security for only about nine percent of the city’s schools, leaving parents to pay for guards and other security measures for the remainder.RUSSIA’S MISSING PERSON PUZZLE: Following International Missing Persons Day on Aug. 30, the newspaper highlights the disparity between official and unofficial statistics on Russia’s missing persons. According to the human rights organization, Memorial, there have been about 5,000 people kidnapped in the North Caucasus region alone in the last 7 years, out of which 85 percent have not returned. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, however, says that the number of missing persons in the region is one of the lowest in the county. A ministry spokesman also said that there have been only a handful of kidnappings in all of Russia.LUGAR BLASTS RUSSIA: Richard Lugar, chairman of the Senate International Affairs Committee in the United States, accused Russia on Tuesday of using energy resources for political purposes, comparing the country to Iran and Venezuela. The newspaper says that Senator Lugar’s “diatribe’’ came in response to Russia’s conception of energy security proposed at the G-8 summit last July in St. Petersburg. The senator’s criticism may signify that the United States now considers Russia a threat to energy security, the newspaper says.CABINET STRIPS YUSHCHENKO’S POWERS: Ukraine’s cabinet ministers have resolved to limit the powers of President Viktor A. Yushchenko in what the newspaper calls the first serious conflict between the president and the new prime minister, Viktor F. Yanukovich. Mr. Yushchenko’s representative to Parliament, however, says that the Constitution and not the cabinet ministers determines presidential powers. With his new authority matching that of the Queen of England, the newspaper says, Mr. Yushchenko will lose his chance at victory in the next presidential elections.BAD ALCOHOL POISONS: Mass poisonings by poor quality alcohol were reported throughout Russia Wednesday. About 100 people were affected in Tver and Voronezh regions alone, 6 of whom have died. Experts began warning about the dangers of substandard alcohol immediately after Russia’s food oversight agency declared war on Moldovan and Georgian wine, which resulted in the elimination of all quality alcohol in Russian stores.TWO NATIONAL BOLSHEVIK ORGANIZATIONS: The newspaper suspects that two unidentified youths who threw money at the leader of the National Bolshevik Party, Eduard Limonov, during a press conference on Wednesday, are members of the newly-formed National Bolshevik Front. Information on the organization, which intends to purify the National Bolshevik ideology of Mr. Limonov and his supporters, appeared in the newspaper on Tuesday.

"'06-08-31,'0','“If our manufacturers leave, whether for North Carolina or China, and they take their greenhouse gases with them, we might not have solved the problem but exacerbated it instead,” said Allan Zaremberg, the president of the state’s Chamber of Commerce.Since taking office in 2003, Mr. Schwarzenegger, who is seeking reelection in November, has supported efforts to fight climate change, most recently by signing an agreement with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain to do cooperative research on new clean-energy technologies.The governor said Wednesday that the deal struck with Democrats would make “California a world leader in the effort to reduce carbon emissions.”“The success of our system will be an example for other states and nations to follow as the fight against climate change continues,” Mr. Schwarzenegger added.The Assembly speaker, Fabian Núñez, who sponsored the bill along with Assemblywoman Fran Pavley, said at a news conference here, “We feel that California has always been a leader in protecting the environment.”“We now have moved it to the next level,’’ said Mr. Núñez, a Los Angeles Democrat. “We’d all like to see California one day be carbon free.”The state’s action, he said, could set off a “bottom-up” movement for curbs of heat-trapping gases in states around the country.That has been the goal of national environmental groups like Environmental Defense and the Natural Resources Defense Council, which helped sponsor the California legislation. It has also been the goal of Ms. Pavley, a Democrat from Agoura Hills and the author, in 2002, of a groundbreaking law reducing tailpipe emissions of heat-trapping gases.Already, the governors of New York, New Jersey, Delaware and four New England states have signed an agreement to curb power-plant emissions, cutting them by 10 percent by 2019. That would amount to about 24 million tons, said Dale Bryk of the New York office of the Natural Resources Defense Council, about one-seventh of the total envisioned in the California legislation, which will be an estimated 174 million tons.Ms. Bryk added that Massachusetts and New Hampshire had enacted some emissions curbs, but that the number of power plants involved was minuscule compared with the California effort.A recent poll of Californians by the Public Policy Institute of California showed nearly four of five respondents said urgent action on climate change was needed.Aside from its long coastline, which could be vulnerable to sea-level rises due to global warming, the state depends on the Sierra Nevada snow pack for much of its water.A study in 2004 by the National Academy of Science showed that unchecked global warming would cut the size of the snow pack by at least 29 percent by the end of the century. It also predicted a doubling in the number of heat waves, like the record-breaking one in July that killed 139 people statewide.The deal on Wednesday on the emissions legislation nearly foundered at least three times in the past week as Mr. Schwarzenegger’s negotiators reached seeming impasses with the Legislature over important issues: whether the bill would require the creation of market mechanisms like emissions credits to help industries meet the new standards; how broad to make exemptions during emergencies like the state’s electricity crisis six years ago, and how to administer and enforce the law.In the end, after three weeks filled with late-night sessions, according to legislative staffers who were not authorized to speak for attribution, Mr. Núñez met with Mr. Schwarzenegger on Wednesday morning and said that the Assembly and the Senate had agreed on final language and intended to enact the legislation with or without his consent.That left the governor to decide whether the final language fell so far short of his wishes that he could take the political risk during an election year of vetoing a signature piece of environmental legislation whose aims he had supported.In the end, the governor and the legislative leaders, including the Senate president, Don Perata, Democrat of Oakland, announced their agreement.Ralph Cavanagh, the co-director of the energy program of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a telephone interview: “This is not an act of altruism. This is an act of enlightened self-interest. By accelerating the effort to reduce global warming pollution, California will benefit its own economy and environment and in so doing will set the best possible example for other states and nations.”Business leaders had been divided on the climate-change measure, with leading venture capitalists from Silicon Valley openly stumping for passage, saying the measure will create new industries and new jobs. The state’s Chamber of Commerce led the opposition, saying that the measure would prompt an exodus of industry to other states without emission controls, while California would be hamstrung in trying to attract out-of-state businesses.The bill gives the California Air Resources Board, which enforces the state’s air pollution controls, the lead authority for generally establishing how much industry groups contribute to global warming pollution, for assigning emission targets, and for setting noncompliance penalties. It sets out a two-year time frame, until 2009, to establish how the system will operate and then allows three years, until 2012, for the industries to start their cutbacks.Peter Darbee, the chairman and chief executive of Pacific Gas and Electric, broke with his industry as PG&E became the first and possibly only major utility in the state to support the legislation, called the Global Warming Solutions Act.“The issue of climate change is important and needs to be dealt with,” Mr. Darbee said. “We need a pragmatic and practical result. Since the bill has a market-based program, it will work efficiently and effectively for businesses.”A safety-valve provision that, in an emergency, could give companies a year’s hiatus in complying with their mandates, was also key, he said.Wednesday’s announcement is significant for Mr. Schwarzenegger’s re-election campaign, potentially vaulting the governor beyond his Democratic challenger’s reach.Mr. Schwarzenegger, whose popularity plummeted after a group of polarizing ballot initiatives failed at the polls last year, has been steadily pedaling to the left for months, supporting legislation to increase the state’s minimum wage, to make some prescription drugs more accessible and to improve the state’s environment by adding thousands of subsidized solar roofs over the next decade.His strategy seems to be to appeal to the sensibilities of voters that have long driven the state’s politics and to distance himself openly from President Bush. Recent polls suggest that Mr. Schwarzenegger enjoys a wide lead.'"
"'06-08-31,'0','There are many possibilities for a complementary strategy between their companies. This week, for example, Google announced that it was beginning to weave together a number of services that could be a Web-based competitor to Microsoft Office. And Mr. Jobs has skillfully driven a wedge into the dominant PC computing standard established by Microsoft’s Windows software and Intel’s hardware — the so-called Wintel alliance — by recently adopting Intel’s processor for Apple’s Macintosh computers.Mr. Schmidt’s appointment set off chatter about linking the Google search engine to iTunes, Apple’s online music service — reinforcing Apple’s pre-eminence in a category where Microsoft is seeking a grip.That would also have broader implications for the entertainment industry, an industry repeatedly put on the defensive by both Apple and Google.“The studios, and for that matter, all the copyright owners, don’t want to see only one place become their sole retail outlet — whether it is Google or Apple or Sony,” said William Randolph Hearst III, a veteran Silicon Valley executive and investor.At Apple and at Pixar, the digital movie studio that flourished under him, Mr. Jobs has forced the recording industry and Hollywood to follow his lead in selling products in the digital world. His alliance with the Walt Disney Company — whose board he joined this year after Disney bought Pixar for $7.4 billion — has given him added leverage.Now, by moving Apple a step closer to Google, with its command over online advertising, Mr. Jobs may be positioning Apple to play an even more influential role in the converging worlds of media and computing.“Clearly what Disney was for Pixar, Google could be for Apple,” said Tony Perkins, an entrepreneur and editor of AlwaysOn Network, a Web site for Silicon Valley insiders.Mr. Jobs and Mr. Schmidt refused to comment on the appointment, announced Tuesday, beyond prepared statements that they were looking forward to working together.The appointment is Mr. Schmidt’s first move to broaden his role since coming to Google. Earlier in his career, Mr. Schmidt was a prominent Democrat and outspoken on the industry’s political agenda, but he abandoned that role when he joined Google. Now it appears that he is beginning to play on a broader stage again.“Eric has clearly arrived as one of Silicon Valley’s new power brokers,” said William N. Joy, a partner at a leading venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and co-founder of Sun Microsystems, where Mr. Schmidt was long an executive.Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Jobs have their roots in Silicon Valley’s second generation, the engineers and innovators who came after the early era of semiconductor pioneering. Their acquaintance dates from the early 1990’s, when Mr. Schmidt, heading software at Sun, approached Mr. Jobs, then running Next Computer, about technical cooperation between the companies.While Mr. Schmidt’s credentials include a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, his early outlook on the industry was shaped when he worked at the Palo Alto Research Center, the legendary Xerox outpost known as PARC, where the first personal computers and modern networks were created in the 1970’s.In contrast, Mr. Jobs, a college dropout, started out as a brash hobbyist who in the mid-70’s foresaw a market for the cobbled-together computer that his friend Stephen Wozniak had built to show off at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto. The result was Apple, which they founded in 1977. PARC was also a touchstone for Mr. Jobs, whose visit there in the late 70’s exposed him to the graphical user interface and the computer mouse, two concepts he eventually brought to market with the Lisa and then the Macintosh.Both men experienced long periods of relative adversity outside of the limelight of computing. Mr. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 by his handpicked chief executive, John Sculley. He then founded Next, which he ran without great success until he sold it to Apple in 1996 and rejoined the Apple fold.Mr. Schmidt left his position at Sun Microsystems in 1997 to take over as chief executive at Novell, a network computing pioneer that, like Apple, had been a victim of Microsoft’s rise to dominance in desktop computing. After four years of trying to turn the struggling company around, he left to become chief executive at Google, where his experience was meant to offer balance to the two young founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page.Now Mr. Schmidt will bring his experience into play at Apple, in part helping Mr. Jobs add to the independence of his board while the company investigates possible irregularities in stock option grants to Mr. Jobs and other Apple executives.Executives who know the two men say they have not been close in the past, but are part of a tightly knit fraternity that draws their companies together at the executive level. Former Vice President Al Gore is a special adviser to Google and also holds a seat on Apple’s board. Another link between the companies is William V. Campbell, chairman of Intuit, the financial software company whose Quicken and TurboTax products have prevailed against Microsoft’s challenge.Mr. Campbell was an early and close behind-the-scenes consultant at Google and is a former Apple executive and current board member. He has long been a confidant of Mr. Jobs, and visited with him while Mr. Jobs was recovering from cancer surgery two years ago.While Google’s and Apple’s strategies are aligned in many ways, there are also potential areas of conflict. Both companies are rumored to be developing hand-held devices known as smart phones that would potentially compete. If the two companies do cross paths, it will be part of a local tradition.“It’s part of the classic yin-yang competition in Silicon Valley, where innovators cross-fertilize each other’s thinking and then go out and clash in the marketplace,” said Paul Freiberger, a Silicon Valley historian.'"
"'06-08-31,'0','Perhaps they had somewhere better to be. It was, after all, Roddick’s 24th birthday.“Is it his birthday?” Sharapova said after her match. “I had no idea.”She left the grounds of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center before Roddick’s match ended, but not before responding to a direct question about whether she and Roddick were dating.“You know what, I really don’t talk about my personal life,” she said. “When two tennis players know each other and are friends, and are known around the world, people are going to talk. That’s exactly what’s happening.”Rodapova is far harder to photograph than, say, Brangelina. If they are not the It couple of tennis, then they are certainly the most intriguing “just friends” pair. They have reportedly been sighted in Manhattan Beach, Calif., and at the W Hotel in Midtown before the Open.“We are not dating,” Roddick said. “I’ve said it a million times already, but you guys refuse to write it. We’re friendly. We’re in the same places. I think she’s a great girl. We’ll talk. You know, that’s about it.”Their denials aside, there was a palpable buzz in the stadium last night. That is because their games are surging at the same time.Although they have only one major championship each to go with their endorsements, they have won this summer, Roddick in Cincinnati and Sharapova in Los Angeles.Last year, Roddick spoiled his 23rd birthday by losing in straight sets in the first round. This year’s birthday was much more enjoyable, even if it was a bit of a distraction while he was trying to prepare.“I’m getting candy sent to my room, my mom calling,” he said. “It’s so tough.”He still managed 40 winners and kept Pless off balance with vicious kick serves. He was only following the example set in Sharapova’s match.She walked on court carrying a black patent leather purse and wore dangly earrings. Once she took off her collared wrap, her long blond pony tail rested perfectly in the shapely cutout in the back of her dress.Nobody told Krajicek, who was making her Open debut, that this would be a formal affair. She wore white.Sharapova was completely in her element, so much so she served Krajicek everything but a cosmopolitan. It is easy to forget that Sharapova, at 19, cannot legally drink alcohol.Nor, of course, can Krajicek, who at 17 is the same age Sharapova was when she won Wimbledon in 2004. Coached by her father, Petr, who also coached her half brother, Richard, to a Wimbledon championship in 1996, Krajicek has made progress this season. She climbed the rankings to 36 in the world and won a tournament in the Netherlands.But the 6-foot-2 Sharapova is head and shoulders above her.“She’s got a good game,” Krajicek said of Sharapova, “and you’re waiting to see what she’s going to do.”So is the rest of the tennis world.Sharapova is ranked No. 4 in the world and, in fashion and in ferocity, had no equal last night. She served 10 aces, hitting all but six first serves in play. She rifled 15 forehand winners, barely breaking a sweat.But for all of Sharapova’s long-legged grace, her demure image dissolved with each guttural shriek. It was a jarring juxtaposition that does not bother her at all.Sharapova is focused on one goal, even though she will not explicitly state that she can win the Open.“I’m healthy; that’s the most important thing,” she said. “I haven’t felt healthy coming into a Grand Slam in a while. And I’ve gotten some good matches under my belt. I got a title a couple weeks ago. That’s definitely a confidence booster.”She certainly looked confident in a dress that fit her Holly Golightly mood.“I’m in a phase; I’m watching all of her movies,” Sharapova said of Hepburn. “ ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s,’ ‘Roman Holiday.’ It’s classy, elegant. I love the neck of it. That was kind of my input towards the design.”Fashion ruled the day, from Bethanie Mattek’s shocking pink outfit, sheer and sleeveless, to Serena Williams’s Asian-themed dress in purple, red and bronze.

"'06-08-31,'0','The Altria Group, the cigarette and food producer, raised its quarterly dividend yesterday by 6 cents, or 7.5 percent, to 86 cents a share, less than some analysts had expected.But the company made no formal comments about an expected spinoff of its Kraft Foods unit.Some analysts had expected Altria to announce a spinoff after its board meeting today, though many others said a plan would not be announced until later in the year.An Altria spokeswoman, Lisa Gonzalez, said, “The board is not going to act prematurely, and any potential restructuring will proceed on our own timeline.” She would not comment on any board deliberations about a spinoff.The dividend increase is the 39th time in 37 years that Altria, the parent of Philip Morris, has increased its dividend. A dividend increase at the August board meeting has become an annual event for the company, so the market had expected the move. But some analysts had expected Altria to raise the dividend by about 10 percent. Altria said the new dividend was payable Oct. 10 to shareholders of record Sept. 15.'"
"'06-08-31,'0','Derrick Blaylock has emerged as Martin’s replacement, but the Jets have made two trades to bolster the position. The first fell through when Lee Suggs, acquired from Cleveland, failed his physical. The second, with San Francisco, resulted in the acquisition of Kevan Barlow, a big running back who was unimpressive in his preseason debut with the Jets.Pennington, who has twice had rotator-cuff surgery, is hardly a sure thing. Although the job as starting quarterback appeared to be Pennington’s to lose, Mangini did not appoint him until Tuesday. Pennington did not lead the Jets to a touchdown in two preseason games and will not play Friday against Philadelphia. The Jets have as many special-teams touchdowns — two — as rushing and passing touchdowns, combined, in three preseason games.Brad Smith, a rookie wide receiver, scored the Jets’ only preseason rushing touchdown on a reverse. He picked up 61 yards on that play, accounting for a big chunk of the team’s 334 total rushing yards.Because Martin will not be around, Pennington will carry a heavier load. Opposing defenses know that, and the Jets expect to be blitzed often. Houston, for one, says he believes he is getting better at picking up a blitz.“I’ve had some problems with pass protection,” Houston said. “That was the biggest thing for me coming into camp, anyway.”Barlow, whom the Jets acquired from the 49ers on Aug. 20, is 6 feet 1 inch and 230 pounds. Like Martin, Barlow attended the University of Pittsburgh. “As far as I’m concerned, he has amazing ability,” Martin said Tuesday. “He’s bigger and stronger than most backs.”But Barlow has played in only one preseason game with the Jets, managing 11 yards on 3 carries and losing a fumble.Martin will miss at least the first six weeks of the season. As he continues working out, he said, he will tutor the running backs who take his place.“You can affect players, people and an environment in more ways than one,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean being on the field all the time. For 11 years, that’s the way it’s been for me. I feel as though I’ve always been an influence off the field also, but that’s more into play right now.”Brooks Bollinger “has a really good chance” to start the Jets’ final preseason game Friday night, Eric Mangini said Wednesday. That was news to Bollinger, who, when asked when he found out he would be starting, said, “I haven’t found anything out.” Bollinger is competing with the rookie Kellen Clemens and the veteran Patrick Ramsey for the backup job behind Chad Pennington.

"'06-08-31,'0','Next year it will go from 21.6 miles per gallon to 22.2, and then it will climb a half-mile per gallon for the next four years.The environmental credits that the carmakers can apply for are capped at 1.2 miles per gallon per fleet. Last year’s energy bill, which supported the production of alternative fuels like ethanol, held in place the cap on credits until at least 2010, said Peter Feather, the fuel economy division chief at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates the program.Of the 18 flexible-fuel vehicles General Motors is offering for the 2006 and 2007 model years, only 2 are sedans: the Chevy Impala and the Monte Carlo. The rest are pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.DaimlerChrysler, after offering two sedans and only four light trucks in 2006, has said it will make only one sedan, the Chrysler Sebring, and nine light trucks for 2007. Only Ford has the opposite mix, producing one dual-fuel truck (the F-150 pickup) and three dual-fuel sedans in its 2006 and 2007 models.As a result, environmentalists contend that the overall efforts by car manufacturers to promote E-85 are somewhat hypocritical.“Ethanol should be saving us twice as much oil as it is today because we are letting really big, inefficient flex-fuel vehicles on the road,” said Nathanael Greene, senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a supporter of both ethanol and E-85. “There is still no incentive for the auto industry to actually get consumers to use this fuel.”“The credits are a motivating factor” in building more trucks in the flexible-fuel category, Mark Kemmer, a General Motors spokesman, said. But he said the carmaker was building the vehicles that were most popular with farmers and others in the Midwest, where most of the E-85 fuel is available.Converting a vehicle to dual-fuel use costs manufacturers at most a few hundred dollars more per car, former and current G.M. officials say. The conversion entails upgrading components, like fuel tanks, hoses and fuel injectors, to withstand the corrosive nature of ethanol. It also requires upgrading computer capacity and more engineering and validation work by lab technicians.Susan Cischke, vice president for environmental and energy engineering at Ford, said: “It’s double the work. We have to certify for gasoline and for flexible fuel.”But it is less work than another alternative. It costs an extra $3,000 to $4,000 to manufacture hybrid vehicles that run on electric motors powered by a mix of batteries and a gasoline engine, Mr. Feather said.'"
"'06-08-31,'0','Diplomatically, Sudan has taken a hard line, refusing to allow any international peacekeepers other than the small and relatively powerless African Union force already in place.The United Nations Security Council plans to vote Thursday on a resolution that would replace the 7,000 African Union troops with some 21,000 United Nations troops and police officers, but the resolution specifies that the troops will not deploy without the consent of the Sudanese government.A visit to Khartoum this week by Jendayi E. Frazer, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, failed to produce an agreement, potentially leaving the people of Darfur without any international peacekeepers to protect them. The African Union force has only enough money to keep going until Sept. 30, when its mandate officially ends. As it is now, its troops have not been paid, in some cases for months. It is perpetually running short of fuel, food and equipment, and its suppliers, who also have waited months for payment, are reluctant to make new deliveries. Helicopter flights that deliver all but the most essential goods — food and medicine for the troops — have been canceled.Beyond that, the force is finding itself increasingly drawn into the battle between the government and the rebels. An attack on a fuel convoy earlier this month was suspected to be the work of rebels. Two Rwandan soldiers were killed in an intense firefight that lasted hours. Rebel leaders deny that they were involved in the ambush, but nevertheless say that the African Union is biased because it brokered a peace agreement that they reject.Most ominous is the looming confrontation between government troops and rebel holdouts, which is set to take place on a battlefield that is home to a quarter of a million people, and could easily set off a chain of battles across Darfur. “It would be catastrophic,” said another senior aid official with a different agency, asking not to be identified for fear of retribution from the Sudanese government. “In terms of loss of life it could dwarf the killings in 2003 and 2004.”In that period alone, at least 180,000 people died from attacks on villages by government forces and their allied Arab militias, known as the janjaweed, and in battles with non-Arab rebel groups seeking greater power in the region. The violence brought on widespread hunger and disease, often the most lethal killers here.El Fasher was once a sleepy state capital in an impoverished, backward part of Sudan. Now it is a garrison town swarming with government troops in crisp new uniforms, driving shiny trucks mounted with 50-millimeter guns. The trucks are so new that their spare tires still bear the white and blue marks from the factory along the grooves of their deep treads.The government has made no secret of its intentions — it submitted a plan to the Security Council earlier this month stating its plan to use 10,500 of its own troops to crush the rebellion, a move that would violate the peace agreement it just signed, according to General Ihekire.In an interview in Khartoum last week, Lam Akol, the foreign minister, said the government was simply trying to secure peace.“We have the duty to secure our territory,” he said. “We have signed a peace agreement, and if the holdouts don’t want to join it then what can we do? How else can we return the region to normal life?”The rebel movements that refused to sign the Darfur peace agreement have massed in a vast swath of territory north of here, gaining strength and flexing their muscle in attacks on government troops and its allies, as well as on the African Union force.In an interview deep in the territory they hold, commanders of the new rebel alliance, the National Redemption Front, said they were ready for a fight.“Our capabilities are unlimited, on the air and on the ground, to repel them,” said Jarnabi Abdul Kareem, a top rebel commander.In Umm Sidir, more than 100 rebel soldiers preened with their Kalashnikov rifles for visiting journalists. Many seemed barely in their teens, with amulets encasing Koranic verses slung across their narrow, boyish chests. Their battered pickup trucks were mounted with heavy weaponry — gleaming anti-aircraft guns and shoulder-fired missiles. The splintering and reforming of the rebel groups since the peace agreement was evident in their makeshift logos. On one truck, the initials had been changed so many times that the jumble of abbreviations — SLA, JEM, NFR, G-19 — had become a collection of illegible smears.Seated in a circle under a thorny tree, leaders of the front, joined in collective hatred for the signers of the peace agreement, said they came back to the battlefield reluctantly.“We are holding arms in our left hand but an olive branch in our right,” said Abubakar Hamid Nour, a commander of the Justice and Equality Movement, an Islamist group that has joined with a faction of the Sudan Liberation Army to fight against the government and the rebel faction that signed the agreement.“But the government selected the way of force, the way of arms,” he continued. “The government has dispersed our people, burned 4,000 villages, raped the women of Darfur. This peace agreement will never answer to the people of Darfur who carried arms to win their rights.”The battles over this patch of earth have already exacted a terrible toll.On the outskirts of Hashaba, people displaced by the fighting as far back as 2003 have settled, their camps becoming semipermanent villages. There are few men here — just a handful among dozens of drawn-faced women and wiry children with ochre-tinted hair, a telltale sign of malnourishment.“We used to get food here, but no one comes anymore,” said Aisha Adbul Rahman. In her hut were the ingredients for that night’s dinner — a calabash of brown, silted water and half a bowl of millet.In Hashaba, at a clinic run by the International Rescue Committee, an aid organization, Dr. Hassan Ibrahim Isaac said he wrote prescriptions for the banal sicknesses that killed here — malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia. But these bits of paper are like scrip at a bankrupt company’s store. The clinic’s pharmacy ran out of antibiotics and antimalarial drugs long ago.“I still come because I don’t want people to give up hope,” Dr. Isaac said. “But now fewer people come. They know I have nothing to give them.”This is the planting season, when rains coax skeins of green from the dun-colored earth. Once-bleak hills bristle with grassy stubble. Wadis, seasonal rivers, snake across the landscape like aortas, veins and capillaries. But they bleed into empty fields across much of Northern Darfur — violence has kept many villagers from their fields. And so the earth foretells more hunger when harvest time comes.Military officials for the African Union said the government troops could build up along an axis between El Fasher and the towns of Mellit and Kutum, using Antonov bombers and attack helicopters to wipe out as many rebels as they can, then force the rest to flee north. Another possibility is that the government will attack from the south, and airlift troops to swoop down from the north as well.Already, bombing attacks on Kulkul have pushed rebels north to Umm Sidir and beyond, African Union military commanders said.Open armed conflict on a vast scale seems so likely, and the hope of a United Nations peacekeeping force arriving to ease the tensions so distant, that a joke has been making the rounds of military and aid officials here: The most important peacekeeper in Darfur right now is the rain.It turns the rough, dusty tracks that crisscross the arid plains and mountains into impassable bogs, and swells once-dry riverbeds into rivers easily capable of carrying off a Toyota Land Cruiser, the military vehicle of choice.But the rains end in the next couple of weeks.'"
"'06-08-31,'0','The United States was fine once it prevented Dirk Nowitzki from scoring — and started hitting some shots of its own.Carmelo Anthony scored 10 of his 19 points in the third quarter, when the United States took control with its pressure defense, and the American team went on to beat Germany, 85-65, in the quarterfinals of the FIBA world championship yesterday in Saitama, Japan.The United States overcame its worst offensive performance of the tournament with one of its best defensive efforts, limiting Germany to 26 points in the second half and forcing Nowitzki to miss 9 of his 12 shots.“Dirk is unstoppable, so we tried to send in as many defenders as possible,” LeBron James said. “You’ve just got to contain a guy like that and hope he misses some shots. He only had 12 attempts, so we know we did a good job.”James added 13 points for the United States, which broke away from a 1-point halftime lead by using a flurry of steals and blocks to outscore Germany, 16-2, over a nearly six-minute span in the third quarter.'"

(BLOOMBERG NEWS)The Sears Holdings Corporation said it had extended until Sept. 29 its offer of 892 million Canadian dollars ($775 million) to buy the rest of Sears Canada as it appealed a regulatory decision that stalled the deal. Sears Holdings said the Ontario Divisional Court would hear arguments on Sept. 18. The Ontario Securities Commission ruled earlier this month that Sears Holdings must exclude votes held by a number of minority shareholders from its calculation of how many Sears Canada shareholders were voting in favor of its buyout offer. The commission said Sears Holdings gave better terms to these shareholders in return for their support and failed to disclose the arrangements. (REUTERS)South Korea posted a current-account deficit for the first time in three months in July as labor strikes at Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors damped exports and costlier oil raised the import bill. The country had a current-account shortfall of $212.1 million in July, compared with a $1.4 billion surplus a year earlier, the Bank of Korea said in Seoul. June’s surplus was revised to $940.5 million, from $1.1 billion previously. Rising fuel costs may stoke inflation and cool growth in a nation that imports almost all its oil. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)'"
"'06-08-31,'0','A Bronx man has been charged with impersonating a federal agent after he told police officers who stopped his van outside Kennedy Airport that he was an immigration agent, prosecutors said yesterday. The man, Stephan M. Kishore, 20, of Croes Avenue, is charged with criminal impersonation, fraud and other offenses, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Brown said Mr. Kishore displayed a federal immigration badge to Port Authority police officers after they pulled his minivan over for a traffic infraction on the Van Wyck Expressway on Monday afternoon. The back of the badge was marked “not for official use,” prosecutors said.

"'06-08-31,'0','ACCORDING to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the United States has engaged in more multinational operations since the end of the cold war than it did in the preceding 90 years. Relying on one’s partners to fight wars makes sense. After all, it is better to fight with your friends at your side than alone, right?When waged for the wrong reasons, coalition warfare is more costly and less effective than fighting alone. Coalition warfare requires a high degree of joint planning, consultation and cooperation. The presumption is that this loss of autonomy is more than compensated by having coalition partners provide additional troops on the ground and share the burden of fighting.Are these in fact the reasons the United States has been using coalition warfare to prosecute wars in the contemporary era? Not exactly. Rather, the United States has used its partners to garner legitimacy for its foreign policy objectives.This partnership has come at a price. At President Bush’s request, in May 2005 Congress created a $200 million Coalition Solidarity Fund that supports coalition partners in Afghanistan and Iraq. For example, Estonia received $2.5 million in Coalition Solidarity Fund money to support its troops — about 40 in Iraq and 80 in Afghanistan. Albania, with its 120 or so troops in Iraq and 35 or so in Afghanistan, received $6 million, as did the Czech Republic, which has roughly 100 troops in Iraq and 60 in Afghanistan. (The Czechs are expected to withdraw their troops from Iraq by the end of the year while sending approximately 100 new troops to Afghanistan.)Last year, the United States paid to airlift Poland’s 2,400 troops to Iraq, built their camps and provided equipment. Poland also received $57 million in solidarity funds, although this has not stopped it from drawing down its troops in Iraq. (While Poland recently added 50 troops to its force of 100 in Afghanistan, it may completely withdraw its military from Iraq in 2007.) Mongolia’s contribution of roughly 180 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan earned the country its first presidential visit and a possible free trade agreement.'"
