"'10-03-01,'1','Dr. Gilgore, who was trained in endocrinology, worked at Pfizer for 23 years. From 1971 to 1986 he was president of its largest division, pharmaceuticals.“He truly understood the science, but not just that,” said Peter C. Brandt, who was given an internship that led to his own 28-year career at Pfizer, where he became president of domestic pharmaceuticals. Dr. Gilgore, he added, also understood “how clinical physicians would use the product, what would pique their interest.”In 1986, Searle, maker of NutraSweet, lured Dr. Gilgore for its top job and a new challenge: revitalizing a company after the reign of Donald H. Rumsfeld, who had led Searle the previous eight years. Monsanto paid $2.7 billion for the trimmed-down Searle, then hired Dr. Gilgore. His office moved from 42nd Street in Manhattan to Skokie, Ill.“He was a brilliant scientist and a marketing genius,” said Dr. Edward D. Corboy Jr., a colleague and researcher at Searle. “But also, he realized that running a drug company was more than just making money.”After the Monsanto sale, Dr. Gilgore increased research and made the company strong enough to be an attractive takeover candidate some years later for his old employers at Pfizer.At Searle, Dr. Gilgore settled most of the hundreds of personal-injury lawsuits filed against the company over Copper 7, once the most popular intrauterine device in the United States.“He inherited the problem; he didn’t create it,” said Michael R. Sonnenreich, a prominent lawyer retained by Dr. Gilgore at Searle. “He was smart enough to settle and move on.”Dr. Gilgore was particularly proud of a 1988 program offering free heart drugs to people who could not afford them, and he challenged other companies to follow suit.At the same time, he fought against price control efforts in Congress. Dr. Gilgore was chairman of the trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in 1994 and 1995. He told The Chicago Tribune that he had met with Senator Edward M. Kennedy to say price controls would end most drug research in America — and was promptly escorted out of the office by the senator.In an interview at the time, Dr. Gilgore said: “The fact of the matter is, prices in the United States are higher than in the United Kingdom or France or Germany or Italy or Spain. We cannot deny that they are higher. But you cannot fuel the research engine that discovers and develops new drugs on the profits that you make in countries outside the U.S.”Five years after Dr. Gilgore retired in 1995, Searle merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn, and three years later Pfizer bought Pharmacia for $60 billion.In later years, he maintained his interest in opera and art. The Gilgores’ son Laurence is conductor of the Connecticut Grand Opera. Another son, Lance, is a lawyer in Washington for the Japanese drug company Daiichi Sankyo. The third, Lloyd, is a psychologist in Doylestown, Pa. Dr. Gilgore is also survived by his wife, five grandchildren and a brother, Dr. Gary S. Gilgore, of Naples, Fla.In Florida, the Gilgores established a private museum of 19th-century Italian paintings and sculptures that have been exhibited at museums in Philadelphia, Chicago and Italy.“Our art collection grew out of our love of opera,” Mrs. Gilgore said. “We realized those painters and sculptors lived at the same time as our favorite composers, when Puccini was conducting, Toscanini was conducting and the great opera singer Caruso was singing.”'"
"'10-03-01,'1','Hunter Mahan came from four strokes back to win the Phoenix Open by a shot over Rickie Fowler on Sunday in a 1-2 finish for former Oklahoma State players.“It’s always a little better to lose to a Cowboy,” Fowler said.The 27-year-old Mahan made an eagle and two birdies in a late four-hole stretch to finish at 16-under 268. Mahan, whose first victory came at the 2007 Travelers Championship, closed with consecutive rounds of six-under 65.Fowler, a 21-year-old rookie, had a final-round 68 for his second runner-up finish this year.Y. E. Yang of South Korea also shot a 65 to finish at 14 under. He led until his tee shot went in the water at No. 17.Mathew Goggin, Chris Couch and Charles Howell III tied for fourth at 13 under.The third-round leader, Brandt Snedeker, struggled with a 78 and finished nine shots back.Yang, whose P.G.A. Championship victory last year made him the first Asian-born golfer to win a major, eagled No. 10 and then reeled off four consecutive birdies to take the lead at 15 under. Trouble came, though, with a bogey at No. 17, where his tee shot bounced into the water. Yang’s 25-foot putt for par stopped an inch short of the cup and left him at 14 under.'"
"'10-03-01,'1','But for Microsoft, a lot is at stake. Its share in the smartphone software market fell to 8.7 percent last year from 11.8 percent, according to the research firm Gartner. Sales of smartphones running other software platforms are surging. By 2012, analysts expect more smartphones than PCs will be sold.To create Windows Phone 7, Microsoft overhauled its phone software division two years ago. Underperformers in the group were sent to work elsewhere in the company, while some of Microsoft’s top talents were brought to the phone business.In addition, Microsoft hired people from companies like Nike and Procter & Gamble who could bring different perspectives.Microsoft pulled Mr. Myerson away from his work on Exchange, the company’s corporate e-mail and communications software. Mr. Myerson said he chose to take on “an impossible mission” rather than continuing to work on a sure winner.“I had about a day to think about it, and it was pretty clear to me that this was the right thing for the company,” he said.As Mr. Myerson put it, Microsoft had to bring more talented “plumbers and painters” to the mobile software group. This meant finding people who could design on schedule and others who could add some sizzle to its software, long criticized as dated and painfully tough to use.“This is a people business,” Mr. Myerson said. “We are managing artists. We are not pouring steel.”One of the top “painters” at the company is Joe Belfiore, who has shepherded projects like Windows XP, Windows Media Center and the Zune. Mr. Belfiore is portrayed by his co-workers as a user interface whiz.When Microsoft provided the first look at Windows Phone 7 Series in February at a mobile phone industry conference in Barcelona, Spain, Microsoft’s chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, ceded the spotlight to Mr. Belfiore for the grand unveiling.In an interview after the news conference, Mr. Belfiore remained in a state of agitated excitement. He checked the Internet for immediate feedback and talked in sweeping terms about “trying to move beyond the PC metaphor of icons on a desktop.”Instead of icons, Microsoft has “tiles,” which are actively updated and bigger than normal icons. The People tile, for example, houses a person’s contacts and will update on its own to show new photos that the contacts have posted to Facebook.Mr. Belfiore also extolled the virtues of “hubs,” which combine similar themed functions in one place. The Pictures hub, for instance, brings in photos from social networking sites, those taken with the phone and those uploaded from a computer.While the tile and hub features give Microsoft’s software a unique feel, they failed to impress some at the Barcelona event.“There was no ‘wow’ effect,” said Bjorn Behrendt, the chief executive of Hiogi, a mobile technology start-up. “It didn’t strike me as being innovative.”The biggest compliments for the software came from business professionals who were impressed with the interfaces that Microsoft built to link to its corporate software products like Outlook, Office and SharePoint.“I think they have taken the smartphone an extra step that Apple can’t,” said Dave Elmendorf, a director at the BT Group.With Windows Phone, Microsoft is also taking a more active role in handset designs.In the past, the company followed its PC model and simply offered its mobile software to handset makers, which would do as they saw fit with the product. As a result, Windows phones often lacked the polish and performance of more integrated devices.This time around, Microsoft worked closely with the chip maker Qualcomm. In addition, Microsoft is requiring phone makers to keep basic elements of its user interface, including a physical button to start Web searches on Bing.“The biggest strategic decision we had to make was taking accountability for the user experience,” Mr. Myerson said. Microsoft’s hands-on approach has prompted pushback from some handset makers, including Acer.“It is very difficult to do customization, and, in our opinion, customization is what you need when you think about mobile phones,” said Gianfranco Lanci, chief of Acer, a PC maker and an aspiring smartphone player.'"
"'10-03-01,'1','Merck of Germany said on Sunday that it had agreed to buy Millipore, an American provider of purifiers and filters for biotechnology laboratories, for about $7.2 billion, including debt.With the Millipore acquisition, Merck will become the latest health care company to strike a deal during a period of industrywide consolidation. The takeover will give the German drug maker a big presence in products for the biotechnology industry.Under the terms of the deal, Merck will pay $107 a share in cash, a 13 percent premium to Millipore’s closing price of $94.41 on Friday.“This transaction is very attractive to shareholders, customers and employees of both companies,” Karl-Ludwig Kley, Merck’s chairman, said in a statement. “This is a combination with an excellent strategic fit.”Millipore shares have risen more than 34 percent since last week, when news reports said that it had received a $6 billion bid from another company, Thermo Fisher Scientific. Millipore later confirmed that was considering selling itself.Millipore, based in Billerica, Mass., had $1.7 billion in sales last year. It has about 6,000 employees in more than 30 countries.The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year.Merck plans to pay for the deal with a mix of cash on hand and loans from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas and Commerzbank, though it expects to issue bonds to replace some of the bank financing.'"
"'10-03-01,'1','To hear Canadians tell it, the hockey gold medal has come home, where it belongs.Canada did not win as many medals as it had hoped at these Olympics, which closed on Sunday night, but it won more golds (14) than any country in history. The last, an emphatic exclamation point on the 2010 Vancouver Games, will be collectively cherished more than any other.This, after all, is a country whose $5 bill has a scene of children playing hockey on a pond, with a quotation from the short story “The Hockey Sweater,” by Roch Carrier:“The winters of my childhood were long, long seasons. We lived in three places — the school, the church and the skating rink — but our real life was on the skating rink.”Hockey, the Canadian poet Richard Harrison once said, “is the national id.”Father Dion did not blanch at the suggestion that hockey is religion in Canada. Rather, he detailed the natural congruencies: both are ingrained from a young age, passed among generations, studied and practiced reverently and — in the case of the Catholic parish, at least — have a box where sinners sit in penance.At the last Mass on Sunday before the puck dropped, Father Dion offered a prayer — a request, really — for the Canadians: “To be humble when and if they win. And to be gracious if they don’t.”As overtime began in what might now be the biggest game ever in Canada, a crowd smothered a block of Robson Street and squinted through the pale sunlight at a small video screen. The action was barely discernible and the mood was nervous. Someone began singing the national anthem.In a moment, everyone was singing “O Canada.” And when Sidney Crosby scored the winning goal, the singing turned to cheers and tears and hugs. Dozens of Canadian flags were raised in the air, many hung from the working end of a hockey stick.The collective psyche was on full display inside Canada Hockey Place, bathed mostly in red-clad fans who cheered wildly for the home team, never more than when the gold medals were placed around the necks of the players, particularly Crosby, the 22-year-old superstar who solidified his status as the latest Canadian hockey legend.It was seen on the painted, tear-streaked faces of fans as they spilled into the streets from bars and homes, desperate to share the experience. Cars quickly carried reveling reinforcements from the far-flung suburbs. Even the police, anxious about how the celebrations would end as the day turned to night, zipped up Pender Street with their horns blaring, a driver’s fist pumping out the window.Across the continent, about 3,000 miles away, friends of Crosby’s gathered to watch the game in his hometown, Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia. Paul Mason, one of Crosby’s youth coaches, wore one red sock and one white one as he watched with family and about 40 friends.“It means so much,” Mr. Mason said. “It’s why we wake up at 4:30 in the morning to practice, and why we stay up every Saturday night watching ‘Hockey Night in Canada.’ ”Sunday’s game was probably the most-watched television program in Canada’s history, the type of cultural touchstone that people will remember, years from now, as much for what happened as for where they were when it did.There was no immediate declaration of a Canadian national holiday or even a day off from school or work. A victory parade is implausible, as the National Hockey League, where all of Sunday’s players earn lucrative livings, resumes its schedule with a game on Monday and a full slate on Tuesday.Fans needed no prompting to celebrate other than the sight of Crosby tossing his stick, flinging his gloves, raising his arms and receiving the hugs of teammates.In many ways, these were the Olympics where Canadians, who consider themselves an understated lot, burst out of their modesty to become a unified, full-throated fan base. For two weeks during the Olympics, the streets of Vancouver were filled deep into the nights with people wearing “Canada” on their sleeves — and their chests, their faces and any other space that they could fill with expressions of national pride.A Team Canada replica jersey practically became a national uniform. The national anthem became a party theme song among the generally convivial, noodle-legged celebrants. Fans draped themselves in the maple-leafed national flag.Such brash enthusiasm surprised even the Canadians.“The States are the chest thumpers, right?” said Darren Loudfoot, visiting from Calgary. “Now it’s everywhere here.”The Canadians won the gold medal at the 2002 Salt Lake Games, where a Canadian ice maker surreptitiously hid a loonie — the Canadian dollar coin — in the hockey rink’s ice for luck. That victory over the United States ended a 50-year gold medal drought for Canada, which once dominated world competition.Slowly losing its grip on a sport considered part of the nation’s identity has been difficult for Canadians. That Sunday’s victory came against the United States, relatively indifferent to the sport despite being home to 24 of the 30 N.H.L. franchises and increasingly rivaling Canada’s talent base of players, made it all the more satisfying. A common sign during the Olympics read: Hockey Is Canada’s Game.“Hockey is a medium for Canadians to think about who they are,” said Andrew C. Holman, editor of “Canada’s Game: Hockey’s Identity,” released last year.And Canadians, weary of being considered an outpost of the British crown or a conquered territory of American pop culture, see hockey as a way to define themselves on their terms.“As important as baseball is to American culture, it isn’t anywhere near the cultural significance of hockey to Canadians,” Mr. Holman said.After the game, the Canada Hockey Place crowd serenaded the gold medal winners with an uncommonly emotional rendition of “O Canada.” Near the Vancouver waterfront, giant air horns blew the first four notes of the song, just as they had for each of Canada’s gold medals throughout the Games.But it was obvious that this celebratory note was different.“From the time we’re little, we’re put on skates or given a stick,” Mr. Mason, Crosby’s former coach, said from Nova Scotia. “That’s who we are. Hockey is who we are.”'"
"'10-03-01,'1','I suspect that even Republicans, in their hearts, understand the need for real reform. But their strategy of opposing anything the Obama administration proposes, coupled with the lure of financial-industry dollars — back in December top Republican leaders huddled with bank lobbyists to coordinate their campaigns against reform — has trumped all other considerations.That said, some Republicans might, just possibly, be persuaded to sign on to a much-weakened version of reform — in particular, one that eliminates a key plank of the Obama administration’s proposals, the creation of a strong, independent agency protecting consumers. Should Democrats accept such a watered-down reform?There are times when even a highly imperfect reform is much better than nothing; this is very much the case for health care. But financial reform is different. An imperfect health care bill can be revised in the light of experience, and if Democrats pass the current plan there will be steady pressure to make it better. A weak financial reform, by contrast, wouldn’t be tested until the next big crisis. All it would do is create a false sense of security and a fig leaf for politicians opposed to any serious action — then fail in the clinch.Better, then, to take a stand, and put the enemies of reform on the spot. And by all means let’s highlight the dispute over a proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency.There’s no question that consumers need much better protection. The late Edward Gramlich — a official who tried in vain to get to act against predatory lending — summarized the case perfectly back in 2007: “Why are the most risky products sold to the least sophisticated borrowers? The question answers itself — the least sophisticated borrowers are probably duped into taking these products.”Is it important that this protection be provided by an independent agency? It must be, or lobbyists wouldn’t be campaigning so hard to prevent that agency’s creation.And it’s not hard to see why. Some have argued that the job of protecting consumers can and should be done either by the Fed or — as in one compromise that at this point seems unlikely — by a unit within the . But remember, not that long ago Mr. Greenspan was Fed chairman and John Snow was Treasury secretary. Case closed. The only way consumers will be protected under future antiregulation administrations — and believe me, given the power of the financial lobby, there will be such administrations — is if there’s an agency whose whole reason for being is to police bank abuses.In summary, then, it’s time to draw a line in the sand. No reform, coupled with a campaign to name and shame the people responsible, is better than a cosmetic reform that just covers up failure to act.'"
"'10-03-01,'1','The lobbying effort has been so fierce that the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, called a meeting on Thursday with representatives of the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Bankers Association and six other groups, at which he warned that failure to pass a regulatory overhaul could destabilize the markets.Mr. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, met on Saturday and Sunday with a banking committee member, Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, in hopes of coming up with a “consensus package” that would have at least some Republican support, Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for Mr. Dodd, said. He was not available to comment on his plan, she said.While Mr. Dodd has indicated a willingness to give ground on several aspects of the consumer proposal, those concessions have not been enough to gain the backing of Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the committee.The concessions are documented in a two-page summary of Mr. Dodd’s latest consumer proposal, which was provided to reporters on Friday without Mr. Dodd’s permission.Rather than a stand-alone agency, Mr. Dodd proposed creating a Bureau of Financial Protection within the Treasury Department. The bureau would have an independent director, appointed by the president, and a budget financed by fees from large banks and other lenders.Opponents of the consumer agency say that it would interfere with the duty of regulators to ensure the “safety and soundness” of banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions.To address those concerns, the Dodd proposal would require the bureau to consult with other regulators before issuing rules, and to make public any objections raised by those regulators, along with an explanation of how the bureau addressed the concerns or why it went ahead anyway.The other regulators also could appeal the bureau’s proposed rules to a new interagency council, led by the Treasury secretary, whose job would be to detect risks to the financial system. The council could veto the rule or send it back to the bureau to be rewritten.Heather Booth, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of groups that support the consumer agency, said that true independence would mean that the agency was “not subject to veto by the regulators whose failures got us into trouble in the first place.”The Dodd proposal would also give the new bureau fewer enforcement powers than consumer advocates had hoped for. The bureau would be able to examine banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets, but smaller banks would be largely exempt unless investigators found that their regulators were not “acting properly.”Consumer advocates have voiced particular alarm at unfair practices by companies not covered by banking rules, like mortgage servicers, credit counseling agencies, debt collectors and payday lenders.Under the Dodd proposal, the bureau would have enforcement authority over nonbank mortgage companies, but would have to petition another body, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, for authority over other nonbank financial companies.“This clearly is a reduction in the enforcement powers in the House bill, and that provision had already been weakened from the administration’s proposal,” Michael D. Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending, said.Mr. Calhoun said that federal supervision should go beyond banks, adding that other financial companies were “increasingly thwarting state regulation by going to the Internet to offer their services.” He added: “The only way you can have effective regulation there is to regulate the products, not the providers of the products.”Another concern of consumer advocates is the extent to which states could set tougher standards on consumer financial products than the ones set by federal regulators. The Dodd proposal mirrors the House language, which some advocates had hoped to modify to give states more leeway to adopt stricter standards.So far, the Obama administration has affirmed its support for a consumer agency but deferred to Mr. Dodd to work out the details.Camden R. Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, was part of the meeting with Mr. Geithner on Thursday. “It was clearly an appeal to the major financial trade groups to get behind a bill and work toward the resolution of the differences that remain,” Mr. Fine said.He went on: “One of the big points he made was on consumer protection, and that there were certain principles that would have to be present to be acceptable to the administration.”Mr. Fine said the latest Dodd proposal was “better than having a separate freestanding agency,” but he added: “We have grave concerns about this entity being housed in Treasury. Treasury is, after all, a political arm of any administration.”Lauren K. Saunders, a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center, said advocates feared that in the effort to reach a compromise, the agency’s power would be so watered down as to be ineffectual. “We’re completely outgunned,” she said. “Despite the millions of consumers who are affected, the money and the resources of the banking industry clearly overwhelm us. Even in this crisis, it’s hard for our voice to be heard.”'"
"'10-03-01,'1','You don’t see much stage-diving at Carnegie Hall, but a stage-dive was exactly what the shirtless Iggy Pop did as he started “I Wanna Be Your Dog” on Friday night. Backed by the Patti Smith Band and the Scorchio String Quartet, he was headlining the 20th annual benefit concert for Tibet House US, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving Tibetan culture. And if “I Wanna Be Your Dog” seemed like a punky, unruly song for a concert that always starts with the sacred chanting of Tibetan Buddhist monks, Mr. Pop pointed out what “d-o-g” spells backward.The annual Tibet House benefit, which is timed to coincide with Tibet’s lunar New Year, has become a New York City kind of ritual: a polycultural miscellany, lofty and boisterous. After the saffron-robed monks (from Drepung Gomang Monastery in India) chanted, with the bottomless growl and overtones of throat-singing, Robert Thurman, the Columbia University professor of Buddhist studies and president of Tibet House, provided the philosophical overview. He described art as a nirvanalike “vision of bliss” that reveals oneness.Then came the musicians, chosen by the composer Philip Glass, whose contacts span classical, rock and world music. Patti Smith has been the benefit’s other mainstay, and by the time she closed out the concert with her fist-pumping “People Have the Power,” people were dancing in the aisles. Many had left their seats earlier, when Gogol Bordello plunged into its Gypsy-punk rave-ups.The benefit ended up as a rock concert, but one with sober underpinnings. Mr. Thurman pointed out that in Asian astrology this is a year of the Iron Tiger, adding that it can be “a rough year, so be careful.” In the last Iron Tiger year, 1950, China invaded Tibet, driving much of its Buddhist culture into exile.At the benefit songwriters chose lyrics that touched on faith, freedom and the power of love. A grinning Ms. Smith started her set with the O’Jays hit “Love Train” and went on to sing about oblivion and transcendence in “Beneath the Southern Cross,” with its mantralike drone, and about divinity and desire in “Gloria,” dancing across the stage as its two chords accelerated. Gogol Bordello, led by the Ukrainian-born New Yorker Eugene Hutz, played a hard-strumming, foot-stamping, quick-fingered set that had girls squealing but that also included an ironically jaunty song about surviving ethnic cleansing.Regina Spektor, whose piano playing invoked Russian Romanticism, sang about fears in “Après Moi” and “The Sword and the Pen” — which wonders, “What if nothing is safe?” — and about human conceptions of God in “Laughing With.” Pierce Turner, a piano-playing Irish songwriter with tinges of opera and Joni Mitchell, sang his “Yogi With a Broken Heart,” joined by Mr. Glass on keyboard.'"

"'10-03-01,'1','The soprano Renée Fleming, below, has ventured beyond her standard operatic domain before. But even admirers who have followed her forays into jazz (as on her 2005 CD “Haunted Heart”) or heard her sing in an invented Elvish tongue for Howard Shore’s “Lord of the Rings” film scores may not have anticipated “Dark Hope,” a coming CD from Decca on which Ms. Fleming will perform songs by Leonard Cohen, Peter Gabriel, Arcade Fire and Death Cab for Cutie. The project was the brainchild of Peter Mensch and Cliff Burnstein from the management firm Q Prime, whose roster includes Metallica, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Josh Groban.

"'10-03-01,'1','With no structure in place for dealing with a threatened default within the 16-nation euro zone, officials are making up the rules as they go. That means politics, as much as economics, is determining the outcome of the worst crisis in the decade-long lifespan of the euro, whose value fell to $1.36 on Friday from $1.51 in late November.European officials say the purchase of Greek bonds by government-owned lenders like Germany’s KfW Bankengruppe — backed by German government guarantees — will probably be part of any solution and has been under discussion for three weeks.Other alternatives, including involving more countries in the euro zone, are also being discussed. France’s state-owned bank, Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, may be involved, a Greek newspaper reported Saturday, while France’s finance minister, Christine Lagarde, told Europe 1 radio on Sunday that there were “a certain number of proposals in the euro zone, involving either private partners or public partners or both.”In preparation for the bond deal, Deutsche Bank’s chief executive, Josef Ackerman, met Friday in Athens with Greece’s prime minister, George Papandreou. On Monday, Olli Rehn, the European Union’s commissioner for monetary affairs, will be in Athens for several days of meetings and to give a Brussels imprimatur to the latest package of tax reforms and public spending cuts that Mr. Papandreou is expected to present to Parliament on Tuesday or Wednesday.Only then is the bond deal expected to go through, bankers say — with the hope that the show of European support will allow Greece to sell its paper beneath the 7 percent rate that investors are now demanding.Much of the demand is expected to be met by German and French government-owned banks, which already own significant amounts of Greek debt, as well as government-controlled institutions in Greece like Hellenic Postbank and the Agricultural Bank of Greece.“The focus is on Olli Rehn and the announcement of the austerity measures,” said Anthimos Thomopoulos, the chief financial officer of the National Bank of Greece, who added that he had not been informed of the timing of the deal. “If there is a bond deal, it will be after the austerity measures.”Bankers say it is important that the Greeks not buy more than 30 percent of the deal to show markets that more discriminating outside investors also support it.For months, Greek banks have been among the largest buyers of Greek debt — Greek sovereign bonds are 16 percent of the National Bank of Greece’s assets, for example — because they could use these securities as collateral at the European Bank for desperately needed funds.But Greece can no longer pass on its debt to compliant domestic banks. It will need to win back longer-term investors like pension funds and insurance companies that have retreated to the sidelines recently as the value of their bond holdings has fallen.To a large extent, political intrigue has overshadowed the offering. Germany is reluctant to sanction any bailout knowing that, as the euro zone’s biggest economy, it will bear the brunt. But France and Germany also believe that any recourse by Greece to the International Monetary Fund would damage the euro’s prestige and highlight their inability to sort out internal problems.“The Germans will not put a euro on the table until there is a credible austerity package,” said a European official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue.Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform, said that France and Germany recognized that some form of bailout was inevitable. But, he said, for a bailout to be sold to a skeptical German public, the Greeks first “have to be seen to be suffering.”The Greeks have already agreed to freeze wages, cut bonuses, crack down on taxes and push back the retirement age to 63 from 61 by 2015. European Union officials have made clear that they do not think these will reduce the budget deficit to 8.7 percent from 12.7 percent this year as planned.Additional measures will probably include an increase of two percentage points in the 19 percent value-added tax, higher fuel prices and the possible abolition of one of two additional months of pay received by public sector workers and by employees of many private companies.'"

"'10-03-02,'1','Insurance is supposed to be about protecting against risk. Try telling that to Prudential of Britain, whose audacious $35.5 billion offer for the Asian life insurance business of the American International Group is reminiscent of pre-crisis mega-deals. The takeover will more than double the size of Prudential and make it the most comprehensive pan-Asian insurer. Transformational indeed, but Prudential will have to convince investors that it has not stretched too far.It can argue that there’s a good growth story. Crunched together, the two insurers would have leading positions in the main Asian markets. The value of Prudential’s new business in the region has increased by almost 30 percent a year for the last decade, six times its rate of growth elsewhere.Prudential is buying the A.I.G. unit, American International Assurance, after two years of hard times for its rival in Asia that were attributable partly to associations with A.I.A.’s troubled parent. The United States government, A.I.G.’s controlling shareholder, is keen on a quick exit. Simply removing A.I.A. from A.I.G. might restore customer confidence — and growth. At 1.7 times embedded value, a common insurance valuation metric, A.I.A. looks comparatively inexpensive.Still, some perspective is useful. Buying A.I.A. will involve heroic contortions. Financing the deal will require raising $20 billion, equivalent to Prudential’s preannouncement market value, by using a rights issue. It will also give shares and other instruments to A.I.G. that will leave it with an 11 percent stake in Prudential.Doubling its base of sales agents could prove problematic, too. Prudential and A.I.A. have been rivals in Asia and routinely spent lavishly to poach staff. Many A.I.A. agents were expecting shares in a now moot initial stock offering. Rivals will be licking their chops at the prospect of nabbing A.I.A. agents and clients.'"
"'10-03-02,'1','Still, landing a multiyear deal from a national brand is not the only way for an athlete to cash in on his or her fame. Some athletes give motivational speeches and write books. Others endorse less visible products like vitamins, sports equipment or medical causes. Athletes in events like the snowboarding halfpipe may win deals from video-game makers.Here is a partial list of the athletes who marketing experts say could win endorsement deals and who may resurface before 2014.¶Steven Holcomb: The pilot of USA-1’s four-man bobsled crew who helped the United States win a gold medal in the event for the first time in 62 years. Burly and affable, Holcomb looks as if he has spent some time on a barstool, which makes him a strong candidate for a beer commercial, marketers say. He has an inspiring story, having nearly gone blind after battling keratoconus, a degenerative eye disease. The downside, marketers say, is that he was part of a four-man team and bobsledding is an obscure sport.¶Evan Lysacek: The first American male figure skater to win a gold medal since Brian Boitano in 1988. Lysacek, 24, edged out Russia’s Yevgeny Plushenko, the defending Olympic champion, who later took shots at Lysacek, a story line that marketers could mine. He also has sex appeal, said Bob Dorfman, the executive creative director at Baker Street Advertising, which makes him a candidate for advertisements including colognes, shampoos and “any product served over ice.”¶Julia Mancuso: She won two silver medals in Alpine skiing, yet lived in the shadow of Vonn. She created a stir when she said the intense interest in Vonn was hurting the team. The drama that followed — Is Julia friends with Lindsey? — thrust her into the spotlight and, marketers say, could help her land a deal with a national brand.¶J.R. Celski: He surprised many observers by winning a bronze medal in short-track speedskating after slicing open his leg late last year. Celski had the advantage of racing alongside Ohno in several events, increasing his exposure. Alas, with speedskaters, “it’s Apolo all the time,” said Matt Delzell, a group account director at Davie Brown Entertainment, which represents companies in celebrity endorsement negotiations.¶Rachael Flatt and Mirai Nagasu: Neither teenager won a medal in figure skating, but both planted the seeds for future exposure at the 2014 Winter Games. Flatt, in particular, won kudos for doing her homework during the Olympics, music to every teacher’s ears.¶Johnny Spillane: The American won two individual silver medals in the Nordic combined, which includes ski jumping and cross-country skiing, including the first medal for the United States in the event. Given the sport’s obscurity, he may not win an endorsement deal from a national brand. But he could garner interest from smaller companies. “If an athlete wins a medal in a less significant event like Nordic combined, it’s going to be harder to get on Leno or Regis,” said Peter Carlisle, the managing director for Olympics and Action Sports at Octagon. “But there are regional and local deals. It’s about reasonable expectations.”'"
"'10-03-02,'1','Over the past nine months, the Columbia-Greene Humane Society and Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, with the help of rescue groups and horse lovers from across the nation, found homes for 96 of those horses.It was expensive — the agency spent $82,000 treating, feeding and finding homes for the horses. And they could not save them all. Six horses were too sick to recover and were euthanized.But the rescue did raise awareness of the plight of aging racehorses, especially in New York. In the days since, new retirement centers like Old Friends at Cabin Creek Farm outside Saratoga Springs, N.Y., have sprung up. In addition, the state’s thoroughbred racing constituencies have paid closer attention to the problem.“When the Paragallo thing blew up, everyone who had a stake in New York racing knew that we had to take care of this problem — what to do with our aging horses,” said Diana Pikulski, executive director of the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation.The responses have ranged from increased fund-raising and tighter regulations to banning inhumane horsemen from the sport. Last December, for example, the New York Racing Association said it would bar any owners or trainers from competing at its racetracks if any of their horses were sold for slaughter.It also urged horsemen who are part of what is widely considered the premier racing circuit in the nation to support rescue and adoption efforts and to find humane ways of dealing with horses that are unable to continue racing.The arrest of Paragallo, who has been a fixture in New York racing, starting 4,686 runners and earning $20.6 million in purses, has also changed the way the state’s breeding fund is administered.While Paragallo owns half of Unbridled’s Song, one of the most successful sires in thoroughbred racing, who commands a $100,000 stud fee, he was also very active in the New York State breeding program.In 2009, the state’s Thoroughbred Breeding and Development Fund gave out $6.3 million in breeder awards and another $2.4 million in stallion awards. Over the past six years, Paragallo had collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fund.The New York State Racing and Wagering Board forced Paragallo to surrender his agent’s license shortly after he was arraigned; his daughters Kristen and Jennifer gave up their owners’ licenses, and most of the family racing stock has been sold.The agency’s chairman, John D. Sabini, is also the chairman of the Thoroughbred Breeding and Development Fund. He implemented more stringent inspection standards for the 400 farms participating in the program to ensure abusive breeders did not go unnoticed.“There is a much tighter evaluation program now in effect as a direct result of what happened at Center Brook Farm,” Sabini said. “Now, instead of being just census takers, our inspectors are making real assessments about the health of the horses.”'"
"'10-03-02,'1','CHMI, Russia — They have a simple way of putting it in this village six miles from the Georgian border: The road is life.When Georgia and Russia were trading partners, Chmi grew fat off traffic, and its families were in endless cheerful transit back and forth over the mountains. When the countries became enemies, the road closed, and Chmi starved. Weddings and funerals came and went a half-hour’s drive away, and relatives wept to each other over the phone, as if separated by an ocean.On Monday, when Moscow and Tbilisi officially reopened the single land route between Russia and Georgia, it was hard to know which version of the future to expect. By early evening, no vehicles had crossed the border, said guards on the Russian side.Officials told Interfax that the new checkpoint could accommodate 7,000 travelers and 900 vehicles a day, reviving a trade route that was severed when Georgia and Russia went to war for a few days in August 2008. The route is especially vital to Armenia, Russia’s closest ally in the Caucasus.But citizens of Russia and Georgia were bitterly disappointed, as one after another was turned back at the border. To visit each other, Georgians and Russians still need visas, available only at the Swiss Embassies in Moscow and Tbilisi, or, in the case of Russians, at the Tbilisi airport. Sonya Zhaikulova, 41, a nurse who lives in the Uzbek city of Adijon, had spent five days on trains, carrying only a small duffel bag, in hopes of seeing her sister, only to learn that no one is allowed to cross the border on foot.She was near tears on Monday, saying she had spent all her money on the journey and had no place to stay.'"
"'10-03-02,'1','Carriers have been lobbying against proposals to increase these fees. One proposal would raise the maximum passenger facility charge that airports can collect to $7 from the current $4.50 per flight segment (still on the table). Another would increase the $2.50 federal security fee (budgeted to go up by $1 a flight in 2012). And a third would raise by 50 cents the $5 animal and plant health inspection fee paid by passengers arriving in the United States (an idea withdrawn last year). Although some of these taxes have risen in the last decade, it is tough to calculate precisely how much the overall tax burden has changed. Airline representatives say taxes and fees account for 25 percent of a domestic ticket price, but according to two professors who have examined millions of ticket records from 1993 to 2008, the effective tax rate has increased to 16 percent from 11 percent of the average domestic fare in that time.“What’s happened is airfares have become cheaper, so proportionately taxes have gone up,” said Joakim Karlsson, a professor of aviation policy at Daniel Webster College, who heads the project with Amedeo R. Odoni, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In fact, their analysis found that the total tax on a domestic ticket has been relatively constant since 1993: about $52, adjusted for inflation.But averages can be misleading because some taxes are a percentage of the base fare, which varies widely, and some are based on the number of flight segments, so passengers with connections pay more than those who fly nonstop.International travelers are even more likely to feel the tax collectors’ pinch, as governments around the world have increased passenger fees to pay for security, airport improvements, customs inspections, tourism promotions and environmental concerns — though critics say many of these taxes end up in general treasury accounts.Exhibit A in that regard is Britain’s Air Passenger Duty, which went up last year and is scheduled to increase again this fall. This fee varies based on the passenger’s class of service and destination; from London to New York, it is £45 in economy class and £90 in premium cabins, and will rise to £60 ($137) and £120 ($183), respectively, on Nov. 1.“The Air Passenger Duty is supposedly an environmental tax, but all these taxes go into the treasury,” said Brian Pearce, chief economist for the International Air Transport Association, adding that France’s solidarity tax — 1 euro to 40 euros a passenger — meets a similarly murky end.“We fear there are going to be more taxes coming down the road as governments look to reduce budget deficits,” he said. “It’s contagious.”The United States is not immune to the bug. Congress just passed legislation that will charge foreigners, from about three dozen countries, who do not need visas $10 to enter the United States. The money will be used to promote travel to America, an idea that has been criticized abroad.Kenneth J. Button, a professor of transportation policy at George Mason University, said airlines are vulnerable conduits for these types of taxes because air travel was once considered a luxury, creating the perception that passengers have deep pockets. And putting the fees on airline tickets, he said, makes them easier to collect.Professor Button, who has done consulting work for the Air Transport Association, said the problem with many of these taxes is that there is little accountability on how the money is used, with airports, the T.S.A. and the F.A.A. all subject to criticism over wasteful or ineffective spending.“I would argue these taxes are too high simply because there’s no incentive for providers to keep their costs low,” Professor Button said.But airport representatives counter that the $4.50 limit on the passenger facility charge has not increased since 2001 and that the money is used to build new runways, improve terminals, reduce noise and other projects — all of which go through a review process that includes the airlines.“Ninety-five percent of the requests that go to the F.A.A. are done with the approval of the airlines,” said Jane Calderwood, vice president for government and political affairs at the Airports Council International-North America, which supports increasing the cap on the facility charge to $7.50 and indexing it for inflation.Another objection to the current tax structure, raised by the National Business Travel Association, is that taxes and fees paid on nonrefundable tickets are not always refunded if a ticket is not used.The group has asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate this issue, arguing that the government and airport authorities should refund the fees if a trip is canceled.“Who’s responsible for getting those taxes back?” said Shane Downey, the business travel association’s director for public policy. “There’s talk that there’s quite a lot of money being lost.”'"
"'10-03-02,'1','The public events, which start on Monday, include screenings of Oscar-winning films with New York themes as well as exhibits of Academy Awards and film posters. The week is to culminate with an “Oscar Night and the City” viewing party on Sunday, at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, where paying guests can watch the ABC broadcast of the show.Although “the Oscars are the Super Bowl for entertainment,” says Karen Sortito, senior vice president for entertainment at NYC & Company, “I realized I couldn’t find” much of a presence for the Academy Awards in “one of the greatest cities in the world that contributes so much to the movies.”That just would not do for Ms. Sortito, who returned to New York in 2007 after almost two decades in Los Angeles working for movie studios and companies like MGM, Paramount, Spyglass Entertainment and 20th Century Fox.“It shouldn’t be that it’s all about L.A.,” Ms. Sortito says. “A lot of the filmmakers are here; a lot of the writers are here.”Her next step was to reach out to the academy, which is known for how carefully, even zealously, it protects its rights to the awards.Until now, Ms. Sortito says, “New York has never done an official Oscar party,” and her intent was to put one on that “would invite New Yorkers to enjoy the evening” who are “from the inside and outside — insiders from the industry and those who really love film.”After all, she declares, “the greatest stories that end up on screen are New York stories.”That is the message conveyed by the campaign, which is being created internally by NYC & Company. Print advertisements, signs and posters present familiar quotations from five movies with New York settings.These are the quotes:¶“Fasten your seat belts. It’s going to be a bumpy night” — from “All About Eve.”¶“Leave the gun. Take the cannoli” — from “The Godfather.”¶“You talkin’ to me? You talkin’ to me?” — from “Taxi Driver.”¶“I’ll have what she’s having” — from “When Harry Met Sally.”¶“When I first saw you, I thought you were handsome. Then, of course, you spoke” — from “As Good As It Gets.”The campaign’s homage to famous movie phrases is reminiscent of a campaign sponsored by the academy in 2007, which sought to encourage viewers to watch the Oscars show that year.That campaign, from the Los Angeles office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, featured lines of movie dialogue that have entered the vernacular. The seat belts line from “All About Eve” was included in the 2007 campaign, too, along with phrases like “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn,” from “Gone With the Wind“; “All right, Mr. DeMille, I’m ready for my close-up,” from “Sunset Boulevard”; and “E.T. phone home,” from “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.”The print ads for the NYC & Company campaign are running in Time Out New York magazine. The signs and posters are being seen outdoors, on bus shelters, phone kiosks, street pole banners, newsstands and taxicab tops.There are also elements of the campaign in social media like Facebook and Twitter and at the Official N.Y.C. Information Center in Times Square. Other aspects include an event guide, to be distributed at the information center, hotels, restaurants and shops; special programming on WNYC-TV, Channel 25; and spots on screens in taxis.The event is also getting its own section on the NYC & Company Web site,.The budget for the campaign is estimated at $200,000. That amount is relatively low because the signs and posters on which the ads will appear are among the inventory that the City of New York gets as part of its long-term contract with the outdoor-advertising company Cemusa.NYC & Company has signed three companies to be sponsors of the week: AMC, the cable channel that devotes most of its schedule to movies; On Location Tours, which offers tours of New York movie and television sites; and Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, which has numerous lodging locations in the city.Tickets to the viewing party at Alice Tully Hall will cost $150 and $225 each. The proceeds are to go to the NYC & Company Cultural Foundation.The viewing party is part of an initiative the academy calls its Oscars Night America Celebration, which consists of viewing parties held around the country by local organizations with the academy’s blessings (plus Oscar posters and the rights to use the image of the Academy Award in invitations, signs, banners and other materials.)“There will be parties in 51 cities this year,” says Randy Haberkamp, director for special projects at the academy in Beverly Hills, Calif.“We’ve been doing this program for several years without having one in New York City,” he adds, because “we felt if we were going to do something other than our member party, it would need to be distinctive.”“A little party at a Holiday Inn would not get the attention, have the same flair,” Mr. Haberkamp says. He hastens to add there would be nothing wrong with such a soiree, just that an event pairing New York City and the academy needed to have a significance worthy of the “symbiotic relationship between Hollywood and New York.”What the academy likes about the plans from NYC & Company, Mr. Haberkamp says, is that they have been “expanded beyond a party” into “a cultural outreach.”“We’ve been approached by many groups in New York City in the past,” he adds, but the academy “never felt it was the right combination of elements” until now.Of the 10 movies up for Best Picture on Sunday, one has a strong New York connection. “Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire” takes place in Harlem in the 1980s.If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.'"
"'10-03-02,'1','Wall Street reached a milestone on Monday that had eluded it for some time: two major stock indexes crossed into positive territory for the year.After spending weeks in a seesaw pattern, the Nasdaq composite index and Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended the day slightly above their Dec. 31 levels. That gave hope to investors seeking to re-establish an upward momentum for the markets.The indexes had spent much of 2010 searching for direction. At the start of the new year, the energy of last year’s rally seemed poised to endure. Then came a debt crisis in Greece, resurrecting concerns about the global recovery. Soon, the market was rubbing against its lowest levels in months.On Monday, hints that France and Germany would play a central role in a bailout for Greece helped push the two indexes over the flat line for the year, as investors became more confident that a crisis would be averted.The S.& P. 500 climbed 11.22 points, or 1.02 percent, to 1,115.71 — 0.05 percent higher for the year. The Nasdaq surged 35.31 points, or 1.58 percent, to 2,273.57 — 0.19 percent higher for 2010.'"
"'10-03-02,'1','Up to a quarter of all women suffer from depression during pregnancy, and many are reluctant to take antidepressants. Now a new study suggests that acupuncture may provide some relief during pregnancy, even though it has not been found to be effective against depression in general.The Stanford University study recruited 150 depressed women who were 12 to 30 weeks pregnant, and randomly assigned 52 to receive acupuncture specifically designed for depressive symptoms, 49 to regular acupuncture and 49 to Swedish massage.Each woman received 12 sessions of 25 minutes each; those given acupuncture did not know which type they were getting. (In the depression-specific treatment, needles are inserted at body points that are said to correspond to symptoms like anxiety, withdrawal and apathy.)After eight weeks, almost two-thirds of the women who had depression-specific acupuncture experienced a reduction in at least 50 percent of their symptoms, compared with just under half of the women treated with either massage or regular acupuncture.The findings appear in the March issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology. The lead author, Rachel Manber, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford, said the results suggested that some symptoms of depression during pregnancy might be related to physical discomfort that is alleviated by acupuncture. Still, the results were striking, she said.'"

"'10-03-03,'0','“We’ve been surprised, too, that the city economy hasn’t been hit harder than it has, given that Wall Street was at the center of the financial crisis and panic,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for . “Of course, there have been lots of layoffs on Wall Street, but not nearly as significant as in past recessions.”Mr. Zandi said he expected the job losses in the metropolitan area to end within a couple of months and to amount to less than 4 percent of the region’s total employment at the peak of the last boom. By contrast, the nation lost more than 6 percent of its jobs over the last two years.City officials agree. Mayor and his lieutenants have been telling audiences that the recession will cost the city 100,000 fewer jobs than they had forecast a year ago.They have also pointed to other signs that the city weathered the crisis better than the nation. Tourism fell off only slightly last year and declined much less than in some other big cities, like . Housing prices have declined less than in most other regions. Office vacancy rates, though they have doubled in the last year, are still lower than in most other large American cities.But the key indicator, economists said, is the number of jobs lost. “The job statistics are the most timely, accurate barometer of how the economy is doing broadly at a local or regional level,” Mr. Zandi said. “If you pick almost any economic statistic — income, house prices, construction activity — it would tell the same story: New York has gotten hit, but it hasn’t gotten creamed.”And the city appears poised to track the national recovery more closely than in the last two recessions, when the city kept losing jobs for 12 to 18 months after the nation began to recover, said Ken McCarthy, managing director of New York-area research for Cushman & Wakefield. “If there’s any lag at all,” he said, “it’s going to be three to six months.”Why has New York fared much better than many feared?Economists say the hundreds of billions in and aid the federal government pumped into the city’s banks fueled a quick reversal of Wall Street’s fortunes. That turnaround saved thousands of high-paying jobs and the controversial bonuses that go with them, averting a sharper drop in collections and consumer spending that would have brought more layoffs.“A lot of us had expected there would be 60,000 or 70,000 jobs lost directly in the financial services sector,” said James Parrott, an economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute.“Then there would have been a spillover effect,” he said, referring to the widely accepted idea that each job on Wall Street supports two others in and around the city.Instead, employment in financial companies in the city has declined by only about 30,000 jobs, and some big banks have been hiring again. Some analysts say they think that some of the biggest banks in New York, like and , have emerged in stronger relative positions than they held two years ago.“To some degree, the city’s financial services sector has been strengthened by the crisis,” Mr. Zandi said.“A lot of financial institutions in a lot of other parts of the country have evaporated,” he said, leaving the big New York banks to fill some of the lending void.Through the infusions of capital into its banks, New York has been the biggest beneficiary of the federal assistance of the last two years, Mr. Zandi and other economists said.“One could argue that no city in America got as much government help as ,” Mr. Zandi said.received $45 billion in aid. JPMorgan Chase borrowed $25 billion; Goldman Sachs and got $10 billion each. But each gained far more from the Federal Reserve’s policy of holding interest rates at very low levels all last year, helping them to amass record annual profits.The bailout “didn’t prevent substantial losses,” Mr. Parrott said, “but they would have been greater without it.”For a change, New Yorkers have no reason to complain about sending far more of their tax dollars to than they get back, Mr. Parrott said. He said it was possible that New York recovered all of the surplus in its balance of payments to the federal government over the years.Whether or not that is true, economists agree that the course of this recession was radically altered by the federal aid the banks received. Few are ready to say that the recession is over in the city, but they expect the recovery, slow and halting as it may be, to begin soon.“I think it’s too soon to say, Was that all?” said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city’s Independent Budget Office. But she said people would look back on the recession that began two years ago and see that “it wasn’t as sharp a as some people had anticipated.”Ms. Lowenstein, whose agency was updating its forecast of the city’s financial condition for release this week, said she did not foresee the overall job loss being significantly larger than the 157,000 jobs in its last forecast. But she and other economists said they expected the city’s employment decline to be revised this month to be slightly larger than the current official estimate.'"
"'10-03-03,'0','“If you really want a fiscal problem, look at the U.K.,” said Mark Schofield, a fixed-income strategist at Citigroup. “In Europe, the average deficit is about 6 percent of G.D.P. and in the U.K. it’s 12 percent. It is only just beginning.”Since the Labour government’s intense fiscal intervention in 2008 and 2009, yields on British government debt have soared to among the highest in Europe. And on a broader scale, which includes the borrowing of households and companies, the overall level of debt in Britain is the second-largest in the world, after Japan’s, at 380 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, according to a recent report by the consulting company McKinsey.In recent weeks, the focus has been on debt scofflaws in Europe like Greece, Portugal and Spain, countries where borrowing costs have shot up in line with their growing deficits as investors demanded higher rates to compensate them for the added risk of lending the governments money.But the recent plunge in the value of the pound below $1.50 and the gradual move upward of Britain’s benchmark 10-year borrowing rate on gilts to above 4 percent suggest that investors are now getting ready to reassess the country’s fiscal condition.Britain is not in the 16-nation euro zone and, unlike Greece and other struggling countries that use the currency, it retains control over its monetary policy. As a result, it has benefited so far from a huge bond-buying program undertaken by the Bank of England — proportionally, the largest in the world — that has kept mortgage rates and gilt yields at unusually low levels.That means the government and its citizens have been able to continue to borrow at interest rates that do not reflect their true financial situation.Indeed, the increase in private and government debt here contrasts sharply with the deleveraging that has been going on in the United States.British household debt is now 170 percent of overall annual income, compared with 130 percent in the United States. In an echo of the United States’ rush into subprime mortgages with low teaser rates, millions of homeowners in Britain have piled into variable-rate mortgages that are linked to the rock-bottom base rate.As for the British government, it has been able to finance a budget deficit of 12.5 percent of G.D.P. — equal to Greece’s — at an interest rate more than two full percentage points lower only because the Bank of England bought the majority of the bonds it issued last year.“It’s not just ‘basket cases’ like Greece that can be considered candidates for sovereign crises,” said Simon White of Variant Perception, a research house in London that caters to hedge funds and wealthy individuals. “Gilts and sterling will continue to come under pressure as scrutiny of the U.K. fiscal situation intensifies.”Adding to this concern is the precarious condition of the British consumer. As interest rates have hit new lows, the popularity of variable-rate loans has grown. At the end of December, 40 percent of new mortgages were tracking the government’s base rate.Despite comments from Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, that he might restart his quantitative easing program in light of current economic weakness, the view among investors is growing that interest rates here will rise further, along with higher inflation and Britain’s increased risk profile.In a speech this year, Andrew Haldane, the executive director of financial stability at the Bank of England, warned about how vulnerable Britain was to a rate increase, pointing out that an increase of one percentage point would cause debt service costs relative to income to double, to 13 percent.“This is a ticking time bomb,” said Nick Hopkinson of Property Portfolio Rescue, a company that assists overleveraged homeowners. “There are over 400,000 people who are in arrears with their mortgage rates the cheapest they have ever been. When rates increase, a lot of people will be tipped over the edge.”As a result, those counting on the British consumer to take up the slack from any scaling back of government borrowing could be in for a shock. Consider Sheridan King, a sales manager who is struggling to pay off his £32,000 ($47,075) in nonmortgage debt. Far from thinking about going shopping, his first priority is keeping clear of his creditors.And even though his variable mortgage of about £100,000 carries a very low rate, interest costs are already chewing up a substantial portion of his pay, and he is deeply worried about the future.“If rates go up, it will be a very dangerous situation for me,” Mr. King said. “It might lead me to consider bankruptcy.”For the time being, at least, the British government faces no such threat.Despite its borrowing and spending excesses, Britain still maintains a triple-A credit rating and much of its debt is long term. But with 29 percent of British bonds held by foreigners, Britain, like Greece, remains highly vulnerable to the vicissitudes of outside investors.Since early this year, foreign holdings of British bonds have fallen from 35 percent, a trend that has tracked the pound’s decline and contributed to the increase in the yield on its 10-year gilts.As to which political party he thinks is best placed to handle these challenges, Mr. King takes a skeptical view. “We are just struggling to get by with all this debt,” he said. “It’s time the government got its house in order.”'"

"'10-03-03,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — Apple has relied on slick applications, and even slicker advertisements, to promote the iPhone and maintain its advantage over rivals like Google in the battle to rule the next generation of smartphones.But the fight may come down to something more provincial: who has the best lawyers.On Tuesday, Apple sued HTC, the Taiwanese company that is the largest maker of smartphones running Google’s Android operating system, including the Nexus One, designed and sold by Google.In the lawsuit, filed with the office of the United States International Trade Commission and the United States District Court in Delaware, Apple said that HTC phones running Android violated 20 of its patents, including those relating to the iPhone’s ability to recognize the touch of multiple fingers on its screen at once.Since last fall, Google has been gradually adding multitouch capabilities to phones running Android through software updates.Though the lawsuit singles out HTC, many patent lawyers and analysts say they believe Apple’s target is Google and the Android operating system, which the company gives away to cellphone manufacturers.“We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we can do something about it. We’ve decided to do something about it,” said Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, in a statement. “We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours.”Apple and Google, once close allies, are now fighting for control of the market for smartphones, seen as the most important computing platform of the next decade. The battle has become emotional since last year, when HTC, Motorola and other phone makers began selling Android-based phones that offered a credible alternative to the iPhone.In that time, the two companies have competed to acquire several start-ups, and Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, left Apple’s board.The lawsuit “is the opening shot in a war,” said Kevin Rivette, a patent lawyer and former vice president for intellectual property strategy at I.B.M. “Apple is island-hopping, attacking first the Asian companies. Then it can go after Motorola, gradually whittling away at Google’s base. They want to break the Android tsunami.”In a statement, HTC said that it “values patent rights and their enforcement but is also committed to defending its own technology innovations.” The company said it had not yet had an opportunity to review Apple’s claims.HTC said Wednesday in Taipai that it did not believe the lawsuit posed a short-term material impact to its business or that it would affect its forecast for the first quarter of this year.Google said in a statement: “We are not a party to this lawsuit. However, we stand behind our Android operating system and the partners who have helped us to develop it.”The iPhone, introduced in 2007, was the first cellphone that largely did away with physical controls, turning the entire device into a finger-activated screen. Apple had to invent new visual cues and software tricks so users could operate such a device, and the result was a product that wowed customers and seemed unique in the marketplace.Now the iPhone looks less special. Other companies have sought to duplicate the technology, and similar touch-screen phones are available from Samsung, the BlackBerry maker Research In Motion and Google’s various partners, including HTC.In the high-tech world, with start-ups and individual inventors claiming innovations, patents can be easily invalidated by courts, and many companies have tried to avoid expensive and time-consuming legal battles.The wireless communications business has defied that trend somewhat. Broadcom and Qualcomm, two mobile component makers, sued each other for years over rights to wireless technology before settling last year. In October, Nokia sued Apple, claiming the iPhone infringed on 10 of its patents, and Apple countersued.Now Apple, with its patent portfolio relating to multitouch controls and other ways these complex phones operate, apparently believes it has the legal leverage to slow down Google and the spread of Android.Aside from multitouch, Apple says HTC also violated patents relating to how iPhone users can wake up their phones by swiping a finger over the image of a lock, and how users scroll through a list or document by dragging a finger down the screen.As with all patent cases, a decision or settlement could hinge on whether lawyers for HTC — and perhaps Google, if they decide to help — can find “prior art” that demonstrates Apple’s innovations were not all that novel.Such a task may not be that difficult. Palm sold touch-based mobile phones for years before the introduction of the iPhone, and is believed to have a large portfolio of patents. Synaptics, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is also a major owner of intellectual property related to touch screens.These companies, and others, may now become valuable acquisition targets as the big players look to improve their position in the coming legal battles and the inevitable countersuits.“Companies have been working on this for some time,” said Mark A. Lemley, a law professor at Stanford who also represents Google in some unrelated matters. “Now, it’s fair to say the Apple technology works better than prior generations of technology, so there may well be inventions there.”Greg Aharonian, who runs the Internet Patent News Service, a site devoted to intellectual property news, said he believed that at least some of Apple’s patents would be found to be invalid. But he said the company’s goal might be to buy itself some time in the marketplace.'"
"'10-03-03,'0','“We’re still pinching ourselves,” Mr. Moore, 33, a self-described cartoon geek with a goatee and rectangular glasses, said in an interview in New York last week. He began working on “The Secret of Kells” while studying animation in college, driven by an interest in history and particularly in the ornate graphic style of the real Book of Kells.To make the movie, he formed a company with a few college friends. “We wanted to do something in this kind of Gaelic tradition,” he said, “and we knew that a lot of people liked Celtic design, because you see it in people’s tattoos and in Irish pubs — it’s everywhere.” Drawn first by the visuals, he developed the story while researching the Book of Kells, which is housed at Trinity College in Dublin, taking as much from history (down to the character of a mischievous cat) as possible.Production began in 2005 and eventually included 200 people across five countries; to cut costs, the animation was done in batches in France, Belgium, Brazil and Hungary. His pan-European partners include Didier Brunner and Viviane Vanfleteren, who produced “The Triplets of Belleville” — the sales boost it got from its Oscar nomination in 2004 helped finance “The Secret of Kells” — and Fabrice Ziolkowski, a French writer who helped develop the screenplay.Distributed by Disney and marketed as a kiddie adventure, the film opened in Ireland on St. Patrick’s Day last year, but was not a runaway success. When its original United States distributor went bust, it was sold to Mr. Beckman of GKIDS, who had been following it in his role as the founder of the New York International Children’s Film Festival. “The Secret of Kells” is GKIDS’ first foray into full-scale distribution, so when the French sales agent, Hengameh Panahi, suggested that they submit it for Oscar consideration, Mr. Beckman readily agreed.The film arrived with strong buzz from animation fans, earned when it won the top audience prize at the Edinburgh Film Festival in July, the first animated film to do so, and helped by Mr. Moore’s blog, theblogofkells.blogspot.com, on which he has chronicled its production since 2005. To capitalize on that, GKIDS set up screenings at animation schools and organized Facebook and Twitter campaigns.GKIDS was aided by a “superfan,” Jamie Bolio, an animator who had fallen in love with the film at Edinburgh. The company essentially enabled her to be a citizen publicist, allowing her to post on “The Secret of Kells” Facebook page and giving her 200 DVDs to distribute to the Los Angeles cartooning industry.When it was time for the film’s qualifying theatrical run, GKIDS booked a theater in Burbank near many animation studios. Mr. Moore did one Q&A for a roomful of about 60 people, which included some top designers and executives — and academy voters — in the field. The support for “The Secret of Kells” became clear when it was nominated for an Annie, an industry award, among the few independent films ever to do so.“We realized there was a sort of self-reflexive story in there about a kid who wanted to be an artist and was trying to preserve something that’s quite difficult in difficult times, so we sort of felt, O.K., that kind of mirrors what we’re trying to do” with the hand-drawn animation, Mr. Moore said.He said he hoped the attention from the Oscar race would propel the film to greater success at home. “It’s that usual thing in Ireland,” he said, “the Irish people are taking an interest now because everyone else likes it.” As Kilkenny’s Oscar nominee, he is beginning to see some celebrity perks; a local optician sponsored him, he said, by giving him a free pair of glasses. (“I picked out the most expensive ones,” Mr. Moore said proudly. They’re Armani.)Mr. Moore and Mr. Beckman both said they didn’t believe “The Secret of Kells” had a chance of winning an Oscar. But in their case just being nominated really does pay dividends: in audience awareness, DVD sales and future financing. Mr. Moore added that he hoped he could attract other people to create an indie animation scene in Ireland.“I have an ambition to keep making movies like this,” he said. “We’re trying to establish a tradition.”'"
"'10-03-03,'0','Ms. Rosenthal said she expected the new distribution venture — which has backing from the investor Jonathan Tisch, a member of the Tribeca Enterprises board, and his Walnut Hill Media group — to release 10 films a year. It will focus on video-on-demand distribution, but sometimes, at least, it will include a theatrical release in commercial theaters.Five of the new venture’s first releases, Ms. Rosenthal said, are to be distributed simultaneously with their showings at the Tribeca Film Festival, which runs from April 21 to May 2. Those include “Climate of Change,” a documentary about environmental activism narrated by Tilda Swinton, and “Road, Movie,” a film by the director Dev Benegal that tells the story of a road trip in India.Ms. Rosenthal founded the Tribeca festival with her husband, Craig Hatkoff, and her business partner, Robert DeNiro, in 2002, to help revive Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 terror attacks.She has talked for years about turning the festival into a platform for the distribution of at least some of the thousands of independent films produced each year. But she and her partners only recently struck deals with cable and telecom operators like Comcast, Cablevision and Verizon FiOS to distribute movies on a pay-per-view basis to about 40 million households. Those films will be available for a period of at least 60 days, Ms. Rosenthal said.Separately, the Tribeca festival is expected to make a number of feature films, shorts and filmmaker events available to 5,000 purchasers of an online premium pass that will cost $45.Geoff Gilmore, who was the director of the Sundance festival before joining Tribeca Enterprises as its chief creative officer last year, said that such efforts were needed to keep film festivals from losing their appeal at a time when independent movie-making has been troubled by the collapse of traditional financiers and distributors like Miramax Films and Warner Independent Pictures.“Festivals don’t have the kind of promotional force they might have had a decade ago,” Mr. Gilmore said.He acknowledged that it would take time to find a balance between the commercial purpose of Tribeca Film and the curatorial function of the festival, but described such accommodations as necessary.“It has to do with the changing nature of what a festival does,” he added.At the Sundance festival in January, YouTube introduced a movie rental option that offered five films, including “One Too Many Mornings” and “Bass Ackwards,” as soon as they had festival premieres. Sundance has also made films available via cable and satellite on-demand services through a program called Sundance Selects.Cablevision’s Rainbow Media, which owns the Sundance Channel and IFC, has aggressively promoted on-demand arrangements that have increasingly supplanted a theatrical release for less expensive films.Ms. Rosenthal said that Tribeca had not yet decided how its films would be handled theatrically, though she said the company’s emphasis would be digital media, including DVDs.Reached by telephone this week, John Sloss, a lawyer and filmmaker representative who helped to found FilmBuff through his interest in Cinetic Rights Management, said he welcomed the proliferation of on-demand services.“I think it’s a good thing all the way around,” Mr. Sloss said. He noted that FilmBuff, which operates both online and through cable operators, was intended to offer both old and new films, while avoiding association with any one festival or library.“Trusted filters are going to become more and more critical,” he said.'"

"'10-03-03,'0','Reassurances that Greece would take further steps to trim its deficit helped prop up financial markets on Tuesday. But the day’s gains largely evaporated in the afternoon as concern over unemployment and a possible increase in interest rates resurfaced.Much attention was focused on the Dow Jones industrial average, which seemed poised on Tuesday to push above the break-even point for the year — a milestone that could inspire further upward momentum. But by the end of trade, it was 22.07 points below that level, eking out a 0.02 percent gain.Shares climbed for much of the day after Greek officials signaled they would meet on Wednesday to map out another set of deficit-cutting measures, which might include increases in the value-added tax and the fuel tax, as well as a new tax on luxury goods. The plan, which could save $4.8 billion, was seen on Wall Street as another indication that a broader debt crisis in Europe would be contained.But in the final hours of trading, angst seeped into the market after the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Thomas M.

"'10-03-04,'1','FRANKFURT — The European Central Bank is likely to outline additional steps on Thursday to siphon off more of the huge amounts of cash it provided to banks during the financial crisis, while carefully trying to avoid upsetting the still-fragile system and economic recovery.The central bank may be ready to return to competitive bidding to set the interest rate on three-month loans, which would raise costs for banks in the 16 countries that use the euro. But it is expected to continue providing unlimited financing on a shorter-term basis, given the anxiety over Greek debt and signs that some institutions are still dependent on central bank support.The Bank of England, which is also holding its monthly policy-setting meeting Thursday, is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5 percent for a 12th consecutive month, as signs of an economic recovery in Britain remain weak. The bank decided last month to halt its program to buy debt but said it would resume if the economy weakened.In the euro area, the central bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, and the bank’s governing council are engaged in a delicate maneuver to reduce the cash they began providing in October 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers brought interbank lending practically to a standstill.While lending between banks has rebounded, Greece’s deficit crisis continues to unsettle securities markets, economic growth remains uncertain and several banks still have government support. Recent spikes in short-term lending by the central bank have been seen as a sign that some institutions are still reluctant or unable to obtain credit.'"
"'10-03-04,'1','Originally a lawyer, Mr. Cross made his reputation in business by buying faltering periodicals and making them highly profitable. In 1983, for instance, he and two partners bought Investment Dealers’ Digest, then a money-losing financial weekly, for $800,000. In 1986, in a widely reported transaction, they sold the publication for about $40 million.With his brothers, Warren and Gorham, Mr. Cross started Warren, Gorham & Lamont, a publisher of professional journals about banking, real estate and other fields, in 1975. The company was sold in 1980 for about $60 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.Theodore Cross’s other business ventures included the JPT Publishing Group, a professional publisher he helped found in 1987.In later years, Mr. Cross released two lavish books of photographs, “Birds of the Sea, Shore, and Tundra” (Grove/Atlantic, 1989) and “Waterbirds,” published last year by W.W. Norton & Company.Reviewing “Waterbirds,” Natural History magazine called it “extraordinary,” adding: “The color photographs, so richly detailed that you can see texture in each feather, convey deep empathy with the natural world. The birds preen, strut, and pose — as if the photographer were not just watching from a distance, but sharing intimate moments with good friends.”Theodore Lamont Cross II was born on Feb. 12, 1924, in Newton, Mass. After serving as a naval officer in the Pacific in World War II, he received a bachelor’s degree in English from Amherst College in 1946. In 1950, he earned a law degree from Harvard, where he was an editor of The Harvard Law Review.As a young lawyer, Mr. Cross became general counsel for the Sheraton Corporation of America, the hotel chain. In the early 1960s, Sheraton sent him to San Francisco to put an end to a sit-in over racially discriminatory hiring practices at one of its hotels. The task made him uneasy.“It seemed to me that I was working on the wrong side for the wrong people,” Mr. Cross told Fortune magazine in 1987.He took a leave of absence and became involved in civil rights work, participating in the second of the three historic voting rights marches that began in Selma, Ala., in 1965. A lifelong Democrat, Mr. Cross later advised the Johnson and Nixon administrations on economic development opportunities for black Americans.In his 50s, Mr. Cross became ardently interested in birds. Over the next three decades, he traveled with his camera to Siberia, South America and many other places in search of elusive quarry.In 2004, he founded Birders United to Defeat Bush, a Florida organization that invoked President George W. Bush’s environmental record to marshal support for Senator John Kerry in that year’s presidential election.Mr. Cross’s first marriage, to Sheilah Ross, ended in divorce. Besides his wife, Mary, whom he married in 1974, he is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Amanda Cross and Lisa Pownall-Gray; his brother Gorham; a sister, Margaret Bean; three stepdaughters, Stuart Warner, Ann Anderson and Polly Warner; three grandchildren; and eight step-grandchildren.For all his accomplishments, it was for a single omission that Mr. Cross said he wished to be remembered. As he told The St. Petersburg Times last month, he wanted his epitaph to read thus:'"
"'10-03-04,'1','Canada’s Parliament, temporarily shut down two months ago by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, resumed work on Wednesday. Mr. Harper had said he wanted to “recalibrate” his government’s economic agenda. But opposition parties charged that Mr. Harper shut down the legislature to avoid uncomfortable questions about Canada’s treatment of Afghan detainees and to concentrate on gaining favorable publicity for the Winter Olympics that ended in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Sunday. The shutdown killed all legislation making its way through the parliamentary process. The new session began with Governor General Michaëlle Jean reading a speech outlining the government’s broad legislative agenda, which includes spending cuts.'"
"'10-03-04,'1','Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat on the Banking Committee, has proposed an 18-month study of the brokerage and investment advisory industries, an effort that would replace Senator Dodd’s provision.Imposing a fiduciary requirement could have an impact on investment firms’ profits. Guy Moszkowski, a securities industry analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said that the impact of a fiduciary standard was hard to determine because it would depend on how tightly the rules were interpreted. But he said it could cost a firm like Morgan Stanley Smith Barney as much as $300 million, or about 6 to 7 percent of this year’s expected earnings, if the rules were tightly defined. “It’s very nebulous, but I think that is a reasonable estimate,” he added.In a research report about Morgan Stanley last year, Mr. Moszkowski wrote, “Financial advisers will be expected to take into account not just whether a product or investment is suitable for the client, but whether it is priced favorably relative to available alternatives, even though this could compromise the revenue the financial adviser and company could realize.”Technically speaking, most brokers (including those who sell variable annuities or the 529 college savings plans) are now only required to steer their clients to “suitable” products — based on a customer’s financial situation, goals and stomach for risk.But Marcus Harris, a financial planner who left Smith Barney 10 months ago to join an independent firm in Hunt Valley, Md., said the current rules leave room for abuse. “Under suitability, advisers would willy-nilly buy and sell investments that were the flavor of the month and make some infinitesimal case that they were somehow appropriate without worrying,” he said.Kristofer Harrison, who spent a couple of years at Smith Barney before leaving to work as an independent financial planner in Clarks Summit, Pa., said the fact that brokers were paid for investments — but not advice — also fostered the sales mentality.“The difficulty I had in the brokerage industry” he said, “is that you don’t get paid for the delivery of financial advice absent the sale of a financial product. That is not to say the advice I rendered was not of professional quality, but in the end, I always had the sales pitch in the back of my mind.”Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Harris and Mr. Harrison all said they had decided to become independent because they felt constrained by their firms’ emphasis on profit-making and their inability to provide comprehensive advice.A current branch manager of a major brokerage firm who did not want to be identified because he did not have his employer’s permission to speak to the media, confirmed that “you are rewarded for producing more fees and commissions.” While he said that “at the end of the day, I think that the clients’ interests are placed first and foremost by most advisers,” he added that “we are faced with ethical choices all day long.”Brokers are typically paid a percentage of fees and commissions they generate. The more productive advisers at banks and big brokerage firms could collect 50 percent of the fees and commissions they generate, said Douglas Dannemiller, a senior analyst at Aite Group, a financial services research group.The firms may also make money through other arrangements, including what is known as revenue sharing, where mutual fund managers may, for instance, agree to share a portion of their revenue with the brokerage firm. By doing this, the funds may land on the brokerage firm’s list of “preferred” funds. Some brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney disclose their revenue sharing information on their Web sites, or at the point of sale. Edward Jones discloses it as well, as the result of a settlement of a class-action lawsuit. UBS and Wells Fargo Advisors declined to comment on whether it discloses this information.Unlike fiduciaries, brokers do not have to disclose how they are paid upfront or whether they are have incentives to push one investment over another. “The way the federal securities law regulates brokers, it does not require the delivery of information other than at the time of the transaction,” said Mercer E. Bullard, an associate professor at the University of Mississippi School of Law who serves on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s investment advisory committee.The legislative language on fiduciary responsibility was one part of the financial overhaul bill aimed at protecting consumers’ interests. Another part, setting up an independent consumer protection agency, may also be watered down.The study proposal by Senator Johnson may be included in the actual bill, which means it would not be subject to debate. And consumer advocates contended that the study would stop regulators from making any incremental consumer-friendly changes until the study was completed. The study would also require the S.E.C. to go over territory already covered in a 228-page study, conducted by the RAND Corporation in 2008 at a cost of about $875,000, the advocates said.“In my opinion, the Johnson study is a stalling tactic that will either substantially delay or totally prevent a strong fiduciary standard from being applied,” said Kristina Fausti, a former S.E.C. lawyer who specialized in broker-dealer regulation.“The S.E.C. has been studying issues related to investment-adviser and broker-dealer regulation and overall market conditions for over 10 years,” she said. “It’s puzzling to me why you would ask an agency to conduct a study when it is already an expert in the regulatory issues being discussed.”Even after the study was completed, legislation would still need to be passed to give the S.E.C. authority to create a fiduciary standard for brokers who provide advice. “As we all know, the appetite for doing this in one or two years is certainly not going to be what it is today,” said Knut Rostad, chairman of the Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, a group of investment professionals advocating the standard. His group circulated an analysis that tried to illustrate where answers to the study’s questions could be found.'"

The association said Wednesday that Mr. Wildmon’s resignation followed months of hospitalization, including treatment for encephalitis and cancer of his left eye. Mr. Wildmon, 72, said his son Tim was expected to lead the ministry, which was founded in Tupelo in 1977 as the National Federation for Decency. The name was changed in 1988. Mr. Wildmon built the organization into a ministry with a $20 million annual budget that owns 180 radio stations and a monthly magazine and has a large Internet following.'"
"'10-03-04,'1','American and NATO officials suspect that retired officers like Colonel Imam have served as a quasi-official bridge to Taliban leaders and their rank and file as well as other militant groups.Now retired, Colonel Imam (his real name is Brig. Sultan Amir) lives in the garrison town of Rawalpindi, just yards from the Pakistani Army headquarters.In the interviews, Colonel Imam denied any continued link to the Taliban. But he admitted that some “freelancers” — meaning former Pakistani military or intelligence officials — might still be assisting the insurgents.If Colonel Imam personifies the double edge of Pakistan’s policy toward the Taliban, he also embodies the deep connection Pakistan has to the Afghan insurgents, and possibly the key to controlling them.Once a promising protégé for the United States, he underwent Special Forces training at Fort Bragg, N.C., in 1974, learning in particular the use of explosives, and he went on to do a master parachutist course with the 82nd Airborne Division.On his return to Pakistan, he taught insurgent tactics to the first Afghan students who fled the country’s Communist revolution in 1978, among them future resistance leaders Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Ahmed Shah Masood. He then worked closely with the C.I.A. to train and support thousands of guerrilla fighters for the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Army throughout the 1980s.Once the Soviets were pushed out, the Taliban emerged and Colonel Imam, then serving as a Pakistani consular official in Afghanistan, provided critical support to their bid to rule the country, Western officials said.By his own account, he was so close to the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, that he visited him in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks, and left only when the American bombing campaign began later in 2001. He says he has not returned since. His parting advice to Mullah Omar, he said, was to fight on, but stick to guerrilla tactics.Today, Colonel Imam speaks highly of the Americans he worked with. But he predicts failure for the United States in Afghanistan. While his views are clearly colored by his ardor for the Taliban cause, they also carry the weight of someone who knows his subject well.The Taliban cannot be defeated, he said, and they will not be weakened by the recent capture of senior commanders, including the No.2, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.The Taliban movement is so devolved, he said, that commanders on the ground make most of their own decisions and can raise money and arrange for weapons supplies themselves.“The Taliban cannot be forced out, you cannot subjugate them,” he said. “But they can tire the Americans. In another three to four years, the Americans will be tired.”He criticized President Obama’s decision last year to send more American troops into Afghanistan. “They are doing what you should never do in military strategy, reinforcing the error,” he said.“They will have more convoys, more planes, more supply convoys, and the insurgents will have a bigger target,” he added. “The insurgents are very happy.”The plan by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander of American forces in Afghanistan, to win over the Afghan people while pressing the Taliban militarily could have worked in 2003 or 2004, when the Taliban were weak and had less support, but now the Taliban had a presence in virtually every province, he said.He also said the idea of paying members of the Taliban to change sides would not work and only bogus figures would come forward. “It is shameful for a superpower to bribe,” he said.Meanwhile, he has nothing but praise for Mullah Omar, who is suspected of hiding in Pakistan today. Of all the thousands of men he trained, he said, religious students like Mullah Omar were the most “formidable” opponents because of their commitment.The Taliban had been tainted in recent years by bad characters joining the movement and committing crimes, and Mullah Omar was now cracking down on them, he said.He pointedly criticized the Pakistani Taliban who turned to fight the Pakistani Army in Swat last year and unleashed a wave of bombings in Pakistan’s cities. They were “troublemakers” that should be “neutralized,” he said.Yet for Afghanistan, the solution was to negotiate with the Taliban leadership, he said. Mullah Omar wants peace and is capable of compromise, he said.He was also the only leader who could keep Al Qaeda out of Afghanistan or in abeyance, including Osama bin Laden, he said. Mullah Omar’s popular support was such that Mr. bin Laden would have to listen, he said.Mullah Omar had refused to hand over Mr. bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, in 2001 because he calculated that if he did, it would be only the first of many demands placed on him, he said.'"
"'10-03-04,'1','One of the gloves, though, apparently is on its way back to Hockey Canada in Calgary, Alberta. An employee of Canada Hockey Place called late Sunday and said she had it and had been keeping it safe after she found it stuck in the netting over the end glass where Crosby threw it.“We have a couple leads on the stick, but we’re still looking for the other glove,” Salmond said. “We’re confident we’re going to get them back and people are going to do the right thing and Sidney is going to get his stick and glove back.”When the celebration began, Olympic volunteers picked up the discarded items left on the ice and threw some of them in a pile behind the doors where the Zamboni was parked, Salmond said.“Lots of people had access to that area,” Salmond said, “from volunteers, to arena and Olympic employees.”He added: “I don’t have an answer to the puck. We didn’t have it and I don’t know if it’s missing or someone else has it.”Salmond said that while the players’ equipment was Hockey Canada’s responsibility, the puck was the responsibility of either the International Hockey Federation or the International Olympic Committee.Phil Pritchard, the curator for the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, was at the game and spoke with the players to see what items they would donate.Thirty-five minutes after the game, he said, Salmond told him that Crosby’s stick and gloves were missing.“I was just thinking, ‘Hopefully, they’re misplaced,’ ” said Pritchard, who is known as the Keeper of the Cup because he travels everywhere with the Stanley Cup during the off-season when players are allowed to spend time with it.Pritchard did get Crosby to donate his pants. Jarome Iginla, who passed the puck to Crosby, donated his stick.The Hall of Fame also received the net into which Crosby scored.“That means a great deal to us because it means a great deal to Canadians to see Paul Henderson’s stick, so anything we can get from the gold medal game is important in the same way,” said Kelly Masse, the Hall’s spokeswoman.That would be the stick Paul Henderson used to score the winning goal in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union, perhaps the biggest previous hockey moment in Canadian hockey lore.Crosby’s equipment, and especially the puck, would have considerable value. “From tens of thousands of dollars for the stick and puck, to six figures for the puck,” said Chris Ivey, the director of sports auctions for Heritage Auction Galleries of Dallas.“This is the biggest current hockey star on the planet playing for Canada in Canada making the game-winning shot in the Olympics,” Ivey said. “It would be very sought after.”'"
"'10-03-04,'1','In Detroit, Granderson was teammates with an excellent No. 2 hitter, Placido Polanco, who now plays for Philadelphia. Granderson said Polanco was an excellent situational hitter who made contact against tough pitchers, rarely struck out and advanced runners for the hitters behind him.“I think that would be the goal of a really good 2 hitter,” said Granderson, who has not started at that spot since the final day of the 2007 season. “I’m not going to be happy or mad because no matter what the situation happens to be lineup-wise, I’ve got to go ahead and get my job done at my position.”A batting order that begins with Derek Jeter and Johnson would seem to create more run-scoring opportunities for sluggers like Mark Teixeira and Alex Rodriguez, though it is possible that Girardi will decide to mix and match.With Paul Maholm starting but pitching only one inning for Pittsburgh, Girardi wanted to ensure that Granderson, who hit .183 last season against left-handed pitching, would get an at-bat against a lefty. He did, and grounded out. That at-bat, as well as every one he gets against lefties in the coming days, will serve as the foundation during his sessions with the hitting coach Kevin Long.“My main thing today was to get some timing,” Granderson said. “It’s really hard to have a feel right now of what we’ve done and been working on this spring and see how it’s going to translate. No one up there today felt good.”It may make sense to have Johnson hit second against left-handers; his .883 on-base plus slugging percentage against lefties last season was the eighth highest among qualifying left-handed hitters. But Granderson could emerge as a catalyst against right-handers. His power is comparable to, if not better than, Damon’s, and his speed reduces the likelihood of a double play.“You’d like to have it fairly uniform, but I’m not married to it,” Girardi said. “You have to let your team dictate what happens.”That is what happened last season, when Girardi in late March made the surprise move of flipping Jeter and Damon in the batting order. The Yankees went on to lead the majors in runs scored (915) and O.P.S.(.839). Girardi will experiment with several lineup permutations over the course of the spring, just as he will shuffle Granderson and Brett Gardner between left and center field to determine the best fit.“I always feel comfortable on defense,” said Gardner, who played left Wednesday and made a superb catch on the warning track in the fifth inning. “It doesn’t matter where it’s at.”Unless Joba Chamberlain and Phil Hughes falter, one of them will be the fifth starter. But the three outside candidates — Chad Gaudin, Sergio Mitre and Alfredo Aceves — all impressed Joe Girardi on Wednesday, combining to allow one hit and no walks over six scoreless innings. ... The Yankees, who led the majors with 28 victories in their final at-bat last season, edged the Pirates on a three-run homer by Colin Curtis in the bottom of the ninth. Curtis emerged unscathed from the traditional shaving-cream pie in his face because A. J. Burnett, the team’s head pie crafter, had already left with many of the regulars. Girardi said Burnett got pied Tuesday by Kevin Long after winning the IndyCar competition at a local arcade. ... Chamberlain, who had flulike symptoms Tuesday, threw his scheduled bullpen session Wednesday and is on track to pitch Friday against the Tampa Bay Rays. ... George Steinbrenner watched the game from his box.'"
"'10-03-04,'1','A hard snow was falling, but the party, which was also the site of a silent auction for Housing Works, was packed. In less time than it took to check one’s soggy cloth coat beside the 6-foot-2-inch ball-and-claw French-inspired tub near the entrance ($10,000 to $14,000), there were black-clad waiter-actors offering tiny prosciutto popovers with Gruyère cheese and truffles and prosecco cocktails, with an aesthetically exquisite wedge of lime.But our intent was an audience with the creator, so one of 500 or so press people escorted us to Ms. Sallick, 70, who was standing with her husband, Robert, 73, not far from a shower installation. A down-to-earth woman with short gray hair, Ms. Sallick was in high spirits, happily recounting the early days when the salesmen called her “honey” and She’d tell them their relationship was not so advanced that She could be thus addressed. Ms. Sallick also said that She had indeed given Herself the title of Evangelist of the beautiful bathroom because when She and her husband started Waterworks, nobody cared about the bathroom. Yes, She said, with her husband throwing in the occasional pragmatic one-liner, it took time, in the 1970s, to bring the public beyond those awful colored fixtures.Why did they sell the company?“We could get a lot of money,” Mr. Sallick said.What are the bathrooms like at their house in Connecticut?Of course. How big?“They’re small. One is 3 by 6, one is 5 by 8.”“Five and a half by 8 1/2,” Mr. Sallick said, with a precision honed by a career in the plumbing business.Told that the Waterworks tubs and fixtures still seem too big for New York City bathrooms, Ms. Sallick took this reporter to the lower level of the showroom and made an introduction, although She had to check with a passing salesperson along the way to find out the price.“Her name is Minna,” She said of a deep white tub that sells for $1,700. “A 5-feet-by-30-inch cast-iron tub. Nineteen inches deep. It will fit into a New York City bathroom.”Her name? Ms. Sallick refers to a bathtub as female? Can bathtubs ever be male?Then it was back upstairs, past the big French tub at the entrance, whose name turned out to be Candide. Which prompted another question: Candide’s starting price is $10,000. Why are these things so expensive?“Good things usually are,” Ms. Sallick said. “They’re hand-finished, lots of quality. When you find cheap things, there’s always something missing.”Yeah, but there’s an extension mirror on the Waterworks Web site for $1,800.Yes, Ms. Sallick said. She had noticed that, too.She’ll look into it?Yes, She said, She would look into it. And off She disappeared into the blinding white.'"
"'10-03-04,'1','CARACAS, Venezuela (Reuters) — President Hugo Chávez said Wednesday that his administration did not support terrorist groups, in his first response to a Spanish judge who accused Venezuela of having links with Basque separatists and a rebel group in Colombia.Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero of Spain had asked Venezuela to explain itself after the judge said Monday that Venezuelan soldiers and a man accused of being a Basque separatist working for the Caracas government had facilitated a meeting between the separatists and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Both organizations are considered terrorist groups by European governments.“This is a government that does not and will not support terrorist groups — we are of peace, of friendship,” Mr. Chávez said in a televised speech.“Zapatero, I have nothing to explain, friend, nothing,” Mr. Chávez said. “If you want explanations, then ask that irresponsible judge in your country.”In his 11 years in office, Mr. Chávez has been dogged by accusations that his government lends support to groups like the FARC or Hezbollah, in southern Lebanon.'"
"'10-03-04,'1','Dalbir Singh did not know where to go on Wednesday when he arrived at the corner of East 72nd Street and Third Avenue, seeking one of the Taxi and Limousine Commission’s new share-a-cab stands.“I asked the T.L.C. officer, ‘Where is the taxi stand here?’ ” Mr. Singh said later, crossing Central Park in a yellow cab. “He said, ‘I don’t know, I’m looking for it too.’ ”Grand social experiments are not easy to pull off. So when the commission decided to test whether New Yorkers — a fairly cranky bunch — would be willing to share a taxi ride, a hitch or two was to be expected.The program allows up to four passengers to share cabs, car pool style, from designated stands along three set routes in Manhattan, for $4 each.But the problem on this cold, wet Wednesday morning, the first day of the experiment, was that virtually no riders showed up. The stands, marked by small yellow signs, were without cabbies and passengers alike. According to the authorities, only six shared trips took place.Gloria Park, from the Upper East Side, rode in one of them. “People are hesitant, and don’t want to share,” Ms. Park said as her taxi zipped down Lexington Avenue. (She had arrived at the Third Avenue stand seeking a ride; a reporter offered to join her.)'"
"'10-03-04,'1','A Cleveland-area small-business council is trying to shore up its 17,000 member businesses with a program that encourages consumers to patronize locally owned enterprises instead of big-box chains or Internet sites.Last year, the Council of Smaller Enterprises began a Web site called “I Buy NEO” — that’s Northeast Ohio — where consumers can search for discounts and bargains at participating local businesses. So far, about 300 businesses as diverse as art galleries and home-improvement stores have signed up to offer rebates or discounts. About 11,000 cards, which cost $10, have been sold. “When a resident buys locally,” said Dan Roman, the council’s director, “independent studies have found 68 cents of each dollar stays in the community.” The current average for the region is 43 cents.There is no charge for small businesses to join, and about two dozen companies have been signing up each month. Even though the program’s $150,000 budget for marketing, Web development, printing and postage is modest, Mr. Roman says, sales activity tied to the loyalty cards has increased 40 percent over the last six months.Last June, the Michigan Small Business and Technology Center began to train laid-off workers to start new ventures.So far, 527 people have taken the course, which the center offers in partnership with the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. To date, 160 people in the Michigan program have introduced new business ventures, and more than 125 owners of existing businesses have enrolled in separate courses to bolster their chances of surviving. Another 1,000 would-be entrepreneurs are expected to complete the program this year.The unemployed workers, many laid off from the auto industry, come to the program with an idea for a small business and must search for capital on their own. The program, said a spokeswoman, Jennifer Deamud, “preps the company for a loan and makes connections for the owner.”Of course, the training is no guarantee of success. Only about half of the enterprises are likely to survive beyond three years, according to the Kauffman Foundation, which has been offering training since March 2009, in New York City, Philadelphia, Kansas, Missouri, Colorado and Minnesota.When Tracy Pospeshil, 37, of Fenton, Mich., lost his job at an automotive supply company, he enrolled in Michigan’s program and started a new business last spring selling engine-warming heaters for trucks and buses. He says he’s on track to make a mid-five-figure income by this summer.Connecticut is using state money to set up a matching grants pilot program to help its small manufacturers — many of them in the aerospace industry — aim at the growing medical products market. The state budgeted $250,000 and is accepting applications for grants of $5,000 to $25,000, said Deborah Santy, director of the Connecticut Small Business Innovation and Research Office.Firms applying must provide at least three years of financial information, be located in Connecticut and be registered as a manufacturing company and keep their manufacturing in the state. Ms. Santy said she had received more than 60 applications for the program so far. Kristen Muschett, chief executive of aerospace test-equipment maker Habco, said the $35,000 matching grant was helping her explore the feasibility of manufacturing and marketing a new machine that helps stroke victims and other neurologically impaired patients learn to walk again.Last year, North Carolina began a $600,000 pilot program called BizBoost to help the Charlotte area rebound from the big-bank layoffs. The program has provided financial guidance to 158 small businesses, typically with 10 or fewer employees, since last fall.In January, Gov. Beverly Perdue announced the program would be expanded to the entire state, with $2.4 million in state and federal funds that will be used to add additional experts, including accountants and managers with small-business experience. The goal is to help small businesses with the nitty-gritty of managing cash flow and lining up financing. “We are helping businesses manage their customer base, restructure their debt and position themselves to grow,” said George McAllister, regional director of the North Carolina Small Business and Technology Development Center.Still, Mr. McAllister conceded, it is hard to measure the program’s success. One client, John Meeks, owner of AppleBlossom Insulators, said his insulation business got help from a BizBoost expert who did a financial analysis of his books, developed cash-flow projections, helped him ready his finances to seek an angel investor and helped him produce a 5 percent increase in revenue in a tough year.In Missouri, Charlie A. Dooley, chief executive of St. Louis County, had heard complaints from owners who could not get bank loans, so he decided to spearhead a new small-business loan program called Boost. The program is administered by the St. Louis County Economic Council and uses county funds and a $5 million line of credit from PNC Bank, a Pittsburgh-based financial institution that had recently bought a St. Louis bank.The program is aimed at owners who want to purchase land, machinery, equipment or buildings but do not have adequate income or net worth to qualify for conventional bank loans. The maximum loan is $500,000, and in the few weeks since Boost was announced, Mr. Dooley said, more than 100 owners have applied.The county also started a business-plan competition featuring $100,000 in cash prizes and in-kind professional services. The competition, with money provided by the St. Louis-based financial services firm, Edward Jones, will announce its winners in June. So far, it has received applications from more than two dozen hopefuls, including would-be microbrewers and laid-off scientists.Last year, Florida introduced a state-financed program to help businesses keep their employees by expanding their customer base. The GrowFL program helps established companies identify new markets, research industry developments and maximize their use of social media. The program has a team of business analysts whose assistance is free to companies with at least $1 million in annual sales and 10 or more employees.So far, the program, operated by the Florida Economic Gardening Institute, has enrolled 13 companies, including a Jacksonville industrial pump manufacturer that is trying to locate new customers after sales declines forced it to lay off workers. Another 72 established companies are in the pipeline for help. Gov. Charlie Crist has asked the legislature to add $3 million to the program’s $1.5 million budget.'"

"'10-03-04,'1','Under normal circumstances, Wednesday would be one of the biggest unofficial national holidays in Canada. It’s the N.H.L. trade deadline (officially: 3 p.m., Toronto Maple Leafs time), which normally captivates a country thoroughly dedicated to having fun on all that ice. But this year is not normal.First, Canada turned the rest of 2010 into an unofficial national holiday in honor of the Olympic hockey gold medal. Second, N.H.L. teams spoiled all the fun by making the big-name trades in January and early February, so long ago that it seems Ilya Kovalchuk has been a Devil since birth. So, we have a deadline day with the biggest name on the move so far being Alexei Ponikarovsky, and by biggest name, we mean longest.Still, if you’re bored, or enthralled by the debate over whether Tomas Kaberle should waive his no-trade clause, plenty of news media are geared to tracking all the moves. The NHL.com trade tracker is neat and tidy, TSN.ca’s Jay Onrait has a live blog and Yahoo.com’s Puck Daddy blog guru, Greg Wyshynski, is rating the trades by Milburys, in honor of the spectacularly horrible trade history of the former Islanders general manager Mike Milbury. If you appreciate a sense of humor borne of the torture of being a Maple Leafs fan, you can follow along on the Down Goes Brown blog.People in the know are still expecting a lot of moves, if not many attention-grabbing ones. CBSSports.com’s Wes Goldstein thinks many will be on defense. One of the bigger deals in the works could be engineered by whoever has Sidney Crosby’s stick and gloves from the Olympic gold medal game, which are mysteriously missing and have not yet turned up on eBay.Of course, Crosby’s return to N.H.L. action was big news Tuesday night, although many believe Ryan Miller, the Buffalo and United States goalie, actually got the bigger reception with a standing ovation in Pittsburgh.'"

"'10-03-05,'1','But Mr. Wen’s address also referred to problems in China’s booming economy that some experts say could hamstring future growth if they are not addressed quickly.He pledged to clamp down on speculative real-estate purchases, which some analysts say are creating a bubble in China’s housing market. He also said the state would take measures to rein in an explosive rise in urban land prices. He warned that some Chinese industries, fed a diet of easy money and loose regulation, had developed serious overcapacity problems.And even as he committed to expand the nation’s money supply by 17 percent this year, increasing lending by 7.5 trillion renminbi, or $1.1 trillion, Mr. Wen warned that “latent risks in the banking and public finance sectors are increasing.”More skeptical economists have contended that China’s flood of lending during the recession will create a mountain of bad debt that will hamper future growth.Mr. Wen said the government would run a budget deficit of $154 billion in 2010, which is in line with economists’ expectations. As a share of gross domestic product, the projected deficit is unchanged from last year.Over all, spending will rise about 11.4 percent this year, half of the increase in spending during the recession last year.Beyond economics, Mr. Wen’s speech laid out a familiar blueprint for raising China from a developing nation into the top ranks of the developed world. Last year, he said, the government’s stimulus measures helped increase auto sales by 46.2 percent, housing by 42.1 percent, as measured in square meters, and retail sales of consumer goods by 16 percent.He recited a series of often-staggering numbers to highlight the country’s rapid development: 800,000 older homes were renovated in 2009; 165,000 miles of power lines were upgraded; 3,450 miles of new rail lines were laid; 2,900 miles of new freeway were opened; 35 airports were either built or renovated.Mr. Wen said that the government had drastically increased spending on low-income housing, pensions, education and health care, and that the increases would continue this year. The government will take new steps to recruit top-level educators to China, to improve teacher training and to direct talented teachers to impoverished rural areas, he said.Mr. Wen also said that China would pour money into strategic industries, increasing research and development and infrastructure spending to “capture the economic, scientific and technological high ground.” Among the areas he singled out were biomedicine, energy conservation, information technology and high-end manufacturing.In a bow to China’s status as the world’s single-largest polluter, Mr. Wen also pledged to increase environmental protection measures, planting nearly 23,000 square miles of new forests, expanding sewage treatment and clean drinking-water programs, and retrofitting coal-burning power plants with advanced machinery to cut emissions.'"

"'10-03-05,'1','Robert T. McCall, an artist whose fervor for space exploration found expression in his six-story-tall mural at the National Air and Space Museum and two postage stamps canceled on the Moon, died on Feb. 26 in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 90.The cause was heart failure, his wife, Louise, said.Mr. McCall eagerly translated his youthful enthusiasm for drawing knights in shining armor on spirited steeds into paintings of intrepid astronauts in gleaming space vehicles, both real and imagined. When NASA in 1962 hit on the idea of enlisting artists to promote its mission, Mr. McCall was one of the first three chosen.He went on to create hundreds of vivid paintings, from representations of gleaming spaceships to futuristic dream cities where shopping centers float in space. His most famous image may be the gargantuan mural, showing events from the creation of the universe to men walking on the Moon, on the south lobby wall of the National Air and Space Museum on the National Mall in Washington. More than 10 million people a year pass it.Or it might be his painting showing a space vehicle darting from the bay of a wheel-shaped space station, which was used in a poster for Stanley Kubrick’s landmark 1968 film, “2001: A Space Odyssey.”Then there are the mission patches he made for astronauts, including one for the last men to walk on the Moon; the many paintings that hang in military buildings from the Pentagon to the Air Force Academy; and the enormous mural at the Johnson Space Center in Houston showing the progression of the American space program, from the first Mercury missions to the space shuttle.He also designed more than a dozen stamps for the United States Postal Service, and a set was ceremoniously canceled on the lunar surface by David Scott, commander of the Apollo 15 mission.'"

"'10-03-05,'1','At one recent meeting, about 50 men and women sat on benches and listened to Beth Richie, professor of criminal justice and African-American studies at the university, speak about her book, “Compelled to Crime: The Gender Entrapment of Battered Black Women.” The discussion explored why some black men beat women.Fallon Wilson, 27, who said she saw violence against women within her family, told the group that she believed there were multiple, intersecting reasons, including the devaluation of women.“I think it goes back to how we construct traditional masculinity,” said Ms. Wilson, who researches gender-based violence at the University of Chicago.Ayesha Truman, 37, a teacher at Hinsdale South High School, said she was disturbed by the way some male students treated female classmates, and she pointed to negative messages about women in music and on television.“How do we break the cycle?” Ms. Truman asked.Mr. Gibson and four other barbers cut hair during the discussion. The male customers listened quietly.Mr. Gibson said the barber shop was a natural place to hold community discussions, whether formally organized or otherwise.“It’s a big melting pot,” said Dwayne Rushing, 32, who lives in St. Charles and works in Chicago. One of his sons, Nicholas, got his first haircut from Mr. Gibson when he was a year old.“It brings in a lot of people with different socio-economic backgrounds and lifestyles,” Mr. Rushing said of the barber shop. “You get some fairly well-off people and some very poor people. I wouldn’t say anybody discounts your opinion one way or another depending on where you are in your life. When you’re in a barber shop, your opinion counts.”On a recent Saturday, a barber, Jeff Williams, 50, flicked a toothpick from either side of his mouth, cutting a customer’s hair and singing along with “Serpentine Fire” by Earth, Wind and Fire. “Gonna tell a story, morning glory.”Aniyah Rushing, 6, wore a pink sweater with her jeans tucked into her boots, and danced around the center of the shop.Gloria Hooker, a minister in a red sweater and a lifelong resident of the West Side, who was waiting for her hair to dry, chatted and let out belly laughs between sips of Pepsi.“There are still good people here who still want to have a beautiful spot for their children and children’s children,” she said.Mr. Gibson keeps close a reminder of why it is important to address community issues. A plastic heart-shaped pin with his cousin’s name sits in a drawer beside his chair. In 2008, the cousin, Ryan McDonald, 22, was shot to death on the sidewalk about three miles from the barber shop.“A lot of times, we stand too divided because we do have our opinions,” Mr. Gibson said. “We have older folks that say young folks don’t know nothing. We have younger folks that say old folks think they know everything.“I don’t blame any one person for that. If we had a place or a situation where I can hear you, you can hear me, I can hear your opinions, we can disagree without being disagreeable, eventually we will have every question answered.”'"
"'10-03-05,'1','Nicholas D. Kristof’s Feb. 25 column, “Do Toxins Cause Autism?,” raises some important health issues, most of which have been under study by industry, government and academia for many years.As Mr. Kristof indicates in the example of seeking the cause of autism, answers are not easy, and quick answers can sometimes do more harm than good — as when parents stopped vaccinating their children because of a study in Britain that mistakenly linked vaccinations to autism.But one thing is crystal clear: the American Chemistry Council and our member companies agree with Mr. Kristof about the need for updated chemical regulation at the federal level. The council has been a leader in the push toward modernizing the primary law that regulates chemicals, the Toxic Substances Control Act. The law has worked well in the past, but more can be done.Now is the time to harness the technological and scientific advances since the law’s inception in 1976 and move forward with a modernized chemical regulatory system that is protective of human health and the environment, while fostering innovation and protecting the hundreds and thousands of American jobs.The American Chemistry Council and our member companies believe that Americans deserve to have the utmost confidence in the safety of the products on our shelves. We will continue to work with all stakeholders and Congress to achieve this goal.'"
"'10-03-05,'1','The relative performance of acquirers and targets is also a factor in the latest flurry of high-premium deal-making. Consider Air Products’ hostile offer for its rival Airgas. During the post-crisis year of 2009, the predator’s share price surged more than 60 percent. But the stock of Airgas, which in previous years had consistently outperformed, did not rebound so smartly. In 2009, Airgas shares rose by only about a quarter, one argument the company is using to justify its rejection of Air Products’ advances.To be sure, executives on the hunt for acquisitions can be tempted to pony up too much in the way of premiums. Indeed, for Air Products to snag Airgas, it will need to pay more than is justified by the net present value of future cost savings. But that’s not always the story. Especially after a steep stock market slide and rapid recovery, historical context can matter at least as much as the headline premium.The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is the world’s second-biggest by market capitalization. Call it the China factor. Yet as the mainland’s own exchanges get bigger, Hong Kong can’t count on winning prize listings forever. It’s time for a Plan B.Hong Kong has long been the destination for public offerings of China’s state-owned companies, because mainland rivals were deemed too small. But now, China wants to develop an international financial center on the mainland. Even Hong Kong stalwarts, like the lenders HSBC and Standard Chartered, plan to issue shares over the border. The next big bank to list, Agricultural Bank of China, may eschew Hong Kong altogether.Hong Kong can’t get away from its Chinese roots. Efforts at diversification from Chinese public offerings have had little success. In 2009, mainland enterprises still accounted for more than 82 percent of all public offering money raised. The failure of the American International Group’s Asian life insurer, A.I.A., to go through with a planned listing may cut Hong Kong’s pipeline in half.Charles Li, the exchange’s new chief executive — and a mainlander — says the exchange seeks to position itself against competition from London, New York and Shanghai by doing things that others can’t do. One way would be to focus less on initial public offerings and more on other businesses, like derivatives. As China’s own capital market deepens, the need for more sophisticated products will increase.The real gold mine, though, could be for Hong Kong to focus on becoming China’s offshore renminbi capital. China is keen to push the renminbi internationalization agenda, but progress has been slow, mainly because of a lack of products for investment. Trading renminbi bonds offshore could be a good start. Stocks priced in renminbi could follow.Hong Kong would need Beijing’s approval, and might have to accept a future without blockbuster public offerings. But better a partner than a rival.'"
"'10-03-05,'1','Unpaid mortgages represent only part of the problem. Renters who fall behind are served “unlawful detainer” papers, forcing them to move. Although it is not known exactly how many face this fate in the Bay Area, County Process Service Inc. of San Jose reported serving as many as 200 such cases per month.“It was real bad there for a while,” said Scott Soto, who owns the company and has been a process server for 30 years.Mr. Soto said his business had served fewer evictions in recent months, but his is just one of dozens of such businesses in the Bay Area.Ms. Parker said unemployment was to blame in many of the cases she had handled.“It’s not really their fault,” she said of the people she had helped evict. “They’re losing their jobs.”Ms. Parker, 52, is ebullient and petite. At just 5-foot-2, she moves with a deliberate trot and dons black leather boots while on the job to appear slightly taller. “Then I’m 5-feet-5 and more threatening,” she said, laughing.The daughter of Harry J. Parker, a former Santa Clara prosecutor, Ms. Parker grew up surrounded by courts and lawyers. She went to work for her father as a legal secretary, and did her first process-serving case 30 years ago. “I like the action,” she said. “I don’t like being chained to a desk.” She has done the job on and off since then.She admitted it could be treacherous. “I’ve walked into a situation where I was threatened with a shotgun,” she said. “I’ve had some bottles and stuff thrown at me. But I’m not afraid of people, and I’m not afraid of guns.”She recently served papers on an elderly woman in Redwood City, arriving to find her on her deathbed, surrounded by grieving family members. The latter went into a rage, and the sheriff’s department was called to keep the peace.Such anger is rare, Ms. Parker said, and her colleagues in the profession agreed. Most people are gracious, even facing homelessness — like two young men she served in an impoverished block of East Oakland. “They said, ‘Thank you, ma’am.’ ”She empathizes with those she must confront, in part, because she was once one of them.It was four and half years ago when she fell behind on rent because of medical bills for a pet. “The eviction was very traumatic; I never thought it could happen to me,” she said.But it is the quiet dignity and spirit of community that most impresses her these days when witnessing families in tough times, especially those with the least. “People who are more poverty-stricken will help each other out,” she said.Ms. Parker estimates she has driven 80,000 miles in recent years handling cases, but for the moment she has taken herself out of the chase, living with her elderly mother outside Fresno in order to save money. Work slowed this winter, as it typically does every winter, and she found herself too close to the financial edge again.You see, there is a harsh truth of doing this unpleasant work: it does not pay well. Ms. Parker gets just $15 for some assignments. If she fails to find someone, she goes unpaid.No one can accuse her of profiting from all the misery.'"
"'10-03-05,'1','No member of the euro zone has had to borrow from the I.M.F. since the official use of the common currency began in 1999, and no major industrialized country in Europe has done so since Britain in 1976.But from Greece’s perspective, the I.M.F. would force the government to swallow nearly the same bitter medicine that Germany, France and others have required — but at least Athens would receive guaranteed financial aid from the I.M.F. in return.In addition, it is not clear that Germany and other European governments seeking to contain the crisis have the resources or expertise to monitor Greece and other profligate euro members for the many years that it will take for the troubles to blow over. And if Greece has to refinance more and more of its debt in the coming months, the crisis could intensify.“It’s a black eye for the euro zone if one of their members has to turn to the I.M.F. for support,” Randall W. Stone, a political scientist at the University of Rochester, said. “That’s embarrassing. On the other hand, it’s potentially more damaging to create a precedent for the rich European countries to bail out the poorer ones when they get into financial trouble.”Greece’s game of brinkmanship may well bring the I.M.F. to its doorstep. “I think the I.M.F. is going to get called in before the end of the day,” Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and former I.M.F. chief economist, said in a phone interview from Germany. “Greece’s austerity plan is like a New Year’s resolution. It’s not going to be easy to enforce.”For Greek leaders facing wide civil unrest, including the unions’ occupation of the country’s finance ministry on Thursday, the threat of turning to the I.M.F. can serve useful ends.“People like to blame the I.M.F. for the policies they impose, but in many cases these are policies the governments know they have to push through,” said James Raymond Vreeland, a political scientist at Georgetown University. “They use the leverage of the I.M.F. so it’s a little more politically palatable.”But even setting aside the symbolic implications, some experts believe that an I.M.F. bailout would deeply rattle the markets.Despite the reassuring bond sale on Thursday, investors could quickly drive up Greece’s borrowing costs if they come to believe an I.M.F. intervention is likely, said Michael L. Mussa, a former I.M.F. research director who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.“The market is expecting other Europeans to do something,” Mr. Mussa said. “If that expectation is disappointed, I don’t see how they’re going to resolve the crisis.”The biggest challenge is in Germany, which has historically tended to enforce fiscal and economic rectitude on its neighbors. Many German taxpayers are vehemently opposed to paying for the profligacy of their free-spending neighbors in Greece and other southern European countries that let their deficits soar sky-high instead of taming them when times were good.At the same time, German banks also underwrite much of the Continent’s debt and exert considerable influence in domestic politics, according to Mark S. Copelovitch, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Germany “doesn’t want its banking sector to go under because Greece has defaulted,” he said.Yet nightly broadcasts of widespread strikes in Greece, and accusations by some in Athens that Germany owes Greece for inadequate reparations paid out after the Second World War, have some Germans thinking that intervention by the I.M.F. may be worth the trouble.“In Germany, the public might favor an I.M.F. intervention if it reduced Greece’s reliance on German funds,” said Justin Vaïsse, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.European power struggles are also at stake. Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former I.M.F. chief economist, said that Germany has long sought to have a German lead the European Central Bank, and an I.M.F. intervention could be seen as tarnishing Germany’s credibility.Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, views Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the I.M.F. leader and a former French finance minister, as a political rival, and would be loath to give him a perceived victory.For weeks, the I.M.F. has tried to say as little as possible about Greece other than to state that it stands ready to help. Mr. Stone said that strategy seems the wisest for now. “The only thing worse than announcing an I.M.F. program is announcing that maybe you’re going to have one,” he said.'"
"'10-03-05,'1','Mr. Rangel, the dean of New York’s Congressional delegation, stepped down on Wednesday as Republicans prepared to force a vote to oust him from his chairmanship. Last week, the ethics committee admonished Mr. Rangel for violating House gift rules by accepting two trips to seminars in the Caribbean that were sponsored by corporations.House leaders predicted that Mr. Levin, who referred to himself as “acting chairman,” would provide a steady hand, in contrast to Mr. Stark, who is known for occasional verbal outbursts, like one in October 2007, when he accused President George W. Bush of sending soldiers “to Iraq to get their heads blown off for the president’s amusement.”The panel has jurisdiction over taxes, health care, trade and other issues central to the economy.“I am collegial and can be tough,” Mr. Levin said. “I don’t think they are inconsistent.”Mr. Rangel is generally considered a pro-trade Democrat. Mr. Levin’s positions are more nuanced.I. M. Destler, an expert on trade politics at the University of Maryland, said: “Mr. Levin is assertive, combative and tough-talking on trade. He highlights problems with other countries’ policies. But he probably has a more pro-trade voting record than most Democrats in the House.”Mr. Levin said he refused to be described as either a free trader or a protectionist. “I totally reject the polarization in trade,” he added. “I’ll sum up my position: to expand trade and to shape its course to maximize the benefits and to minimize the detriments.”He said he was deeply concerned about trade barriers that made it hard for Ford to sell autos and for Whirlpool to sell basic refrigerators in South Korea.“As a matter of practice and principle,” Mr. Levin said, “trade agreements have to have a two-way street, reciprocity.”“I know that globalization is here to stay,” Mr. Levin said. But, he added, he has insisted on “fully enforceable labor and environmental standards,” like those included in a United States trade agreement with Peru.Mr. Levin said he had also pushed for greater protection of workers’ rights in trade pacts with Panama and Colombia, personally negotiating with officials from both countries to make sure the issue was addressed.Mr. Levin and Mr. Rangel are friends, and Mr. Levin expressed mixed emotions about the events that led to his ascent to one of the most influential positions in Congress. But he also voiced confidence. “I believe I can do the job,” he said. “I believe I can work well with people and I can make the tough decisions.”Mr. Levin was handed the gavel at a tough time for the committee and for House Democrats generally, as they begin a final push to adopt health care legislation amid relentless criticism by Republicans, in a midterm election year. Mr. Levin himself is facing a primary challenge.Mr. Rangel offered praise for his successor. “It’s the best thing for the country, the Congress and the committee under the circumstances,” Mr. Rangel said. “I love him. He is good. He is thorough.”Mr. Levin also received a congratulatory telephone call from the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, Alan R. Mulally.Mr. Levin, who is known as Sandy, said he had inherited a commitment to social justice from his parents. “Michigan was where the middle class first blossomed,” he said. “In my district, I can knock on doors and see the embodiment of the progress we’ve made in this country for working families. It was the auto industry that provided people with the means to have a decent salary, a house, health insurance and a pension. We have to preserve that progress and help it expand.”Mr. Levin’s younger brother, Carl, is Michigan’s senior senator and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The two are close, and often play squash, competing fiercely.Senator Levin, in an interview, called his brother “an absolute expert at reaching out to people and building consensus.” But he also acknowledged the rivalry.“He is as nice a guy as you could ever meet,” Senator Levin said. “On the athletic courts, he is not so mild-mannered.”'"
"'10-03-05,'1','Two people are believed to have fallen overboard in Jamaica Bay on Thursday morning when a 10-foot-long boat overturned near the eastern end of Far Rockaway, Queens, the authorities said.Students from Beach Channel High School apparently saw the boat capsize north of the Rockaway peninsula about 10 a.m., they said.The students dialed 911, and two responding Coast Guard rescue boats found the boat, which was white and green with a flat bottom. But the emergency responders were unable to immediately locate any people, said Petty Officer Third Class Barbara L. Patton, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. A daylong search by the Coast Guard, assisted at times by the Police and Fire Departments, turned up nothing. The search was ended at 6 p.m.Petty Officer Patton said the water temperature was 40 degrees when the boat capsized.“The conditions of the sea, at the time, were two-foot chop with winds from the north-northwest, at 12 miles per hour,” she said.Fire Department workers and a Police Department helicopter crew took part in the search, according to the Coast Guard.'"
"'10-03-05,'1','One Oscar category to keep an eye on this year is animation. Though Pixar's ""Up"" is the obvious front-runner, there will be a lot of people rooting for ""The Secret of Kells."" The movie, an independent film by Tomm Moore, is a hand-drawn labor of love made for only about $8 million. Mr. Moore grew up and still lives in Kilkenny, Ireland, a one-cathedral town of a few thousand people about an hour and a half south of Dublin. ""If,"" writes Melena Ryzik, ""artistically, 'The Secret of Kells' is a throwback to the era of animation before computer-generated imagery, its promotion is pure digital age, forgoing the pricey ads and flashy parties that Academy Award campaigns are traditionally built on in favor of cheaper social media and savvy targeted marketing. It was a lark, and it worked."" The movie, which opens today in New York, follows the adventures of a boy — a young monk in training — as he works with an illuminator to finish the Book of Kells, the Latin manuscript transcribed by Celtic monks around A.D. 800 and considered an Irish national treasure. ""Rich with pagan myth and Jungian symbolism, the movie is lavishly illustrated to mimic the perspectiveless style of pre-Renaissance art: it's not exactly lightweight fare."" It is also Mr. Moore's first feature.'"
"'10-03-05,'1','A spokesman for Basic Food Flavors did not return a call seeking comment.The recall demonstrates the risks of the nation’s increasingly industrialized food supply chain. Specialized food plants may supply scores of customers involved in the production of thousands of products. Contamination at any one of these specialized plants can reverberate through nearly every aisle in the grocery store.“Many of these recent recalls,” said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, “show that an error in a single ingredient plant — whether peanut butter, spices or flavor enhancers — can cause repercussions throughout the food chain.”The Basic Food Flavors recall also demonstrates the increasing sophistication of the nation’s food safety alert system, although officials and advocates said that more improvements were needed. The food agency learned of the Las Vegas contamination because of legislation passed by Congress in 2007 that required food manufacturers to alert the government when they find salmonella or other contaminants in ingredients from suppliers.But the mandate took years to go into effect because the F.D.A. could not get its database off the ground. The delay may have contributed to more than 500 illnesses and at least eight deaths last year that were linked to contaminated peanut butter from the Peanut Corporation of America. At least one company that interacted with Peanut Corporation was aware of sanitation problems at the company’s plants but never alerted federal officials.In September, the agency activated its contamination database. As a result, when one of Basic Food Flavors’ customers found salmonella in a batch of hydrolyzed vegetable protein, it was required to alert the F.D.A.The alert presented the agency with a new problem: what to do with a contaminated flavoring ingredient. Because this ingredient is often added before products are cooked, there is a good chance that the vast majority of products containing it are safe.But nobody really knows, and because the agency has been getting contamination alerts from manufacturers for only a few months, it has yet to work out precisely how to handle them. Officials said that as they examine the issue, there may be more recalls. Officials are particularly concerned about products that were never cooked after the raw flavoring was added.“We are taking a risk-based approach to this and making sure the products out there for consumers are safe,” said Jenny Scott, a senior F.D.A. food adviser.Even tiny amounts of salmonella can lead to grave illnesses in vulnerable people like the elderly or children.Agency officials emphasized that the recalls also demonstrated the need for food-safety legislation that has been stalled in the Senate for months because of the health care debate. The legislation would require food manufacturers to create precise plans for ensuring the safety of their products, and it would give the agency more money and power to force potentially dangerous foods off the market.The proposed legislation, which has already passed the House, would help ensure that contamination episodes never take place at all, Dr. Margaret Hamburg, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in a conference call with reporters.Erik D. Olson, director of food and consumer product safety at the Pew Health Group, said it was telling that the food agency could give consumers so little information about just how widely the recall would eventually reach.“This is just another indication of how broken down this system is,” Mr. Olson said.'"
"'10-03-05,'1','MIAMI — More than 80 people have been arrested in connection with a language school here that the government says was a front for the sale of fraudulent applications for student visas, immigration authorities said Thursday.Two of those arrested, Lydia Menocal and Ofelia Macia, ran the school, the Florida Language Institute in Miami, the authorities said, and were masterminds behind the scheme, which helped residents of more than a dozen countries enter the United States fraudulently.The visa recipients, officials of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said, rarely, if ever, attended classes at the school, which Ms. Menocal owns. Indeed, fewer than 5 percent of the students attended class, investigators found.In announcing the arrests, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Jeffrey Sloman, noted that several Sept. 11 hijackers “were foreign nationals who abused the student visa program to enter and stay in the United States illegally.”According to the indictment, the language school first received approval from the Department of Homeland Security and then issued the requisite federal forms to the prospective students so they could apply for and receive student visas. Ms. Menocal swore on the forms that the students would attend classes.In all, 81 students were arrested, but one was released.'"
"'10-03-05,'1','WASHINGTON — Coal-country lawmakers moved Thursday to impose a two-year moratorium on potential federal regulation of carbon dioxide and other climate-altering gases.Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, said the Environmental Protection Agency should refrain from issuing any new rules on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other major stationary sources for two years to allow Congress to pass comprehensive legislation on energy and climate change.Representatives Alan B. Mollohan and Nick J. Rahall II of West Virginia and Rick Boucher of Virginia, also Democrats, introduced a similar bill in the House.The moves are the latest effort by members of both parties in Congress to slow or halt carbon regulation by the administration. Separate bills are before both houses that would essentially prevent the E.P.A. from issuing any greenhouse gas regulations.Lisa P. Jackson, the agency’s administrator, wrote Mr. Rockefeller and seven other Democratic senators last week outlining her timetable for such regulation. She said that limits on carbon dioxide pollution from vehicles would be issued this year under an agreement negotiated last year with major automakers.'"
"'10-03-05,'1','Only a handful of designers in the world have the creative vision and authority to push fashion in new and often challenging directions. One is Nicolas Ghesquiere at Balenciaga, who on Thursday showed a ready-to-wear collection that looked far beyond fall 2010.But another was Alexander McQueen, whose death has left a huge creative void. The problem for fashion in the age of instant access to images is simple: Without extremely willful individuals exerting their imaginations, experimenting with new materials and shapes, the industry as a whole will seem weak to the people who follow it. There must be something exceptional, almost violently strong and not immediately accessible, if fashion is to be a force.This was brought home during the Balenciaga show, which used materials that were difficult to identify. Some appeared to be coated in a plastic, others resembled packing materials. Jackets printed with words in primary colors could have come from posters you see in the streets. Mr. Ghesquiere said his aim was “to ennoble everyday objects.”Although the silhouette was essentially a square on stilts — square-cut jackets with skinny pants or minis — there were shapes within shapes, and squares formed by the overlapping panels of jackets. Puffy white jackets that resembled down vests were incorporated into what appeared to be zippered jumpsuits. The tops of shoes suggested ski bindings, their heels a stack of boxes.The number of materials, the textures, really strained at times. Perhaps that’s a risk Mr. Ghesquiere thought he had to take. I couldn’t help but think of the many futuristic shapes in the recent Central Saint Martins graduation show, in London. Some of those ideas looked newer. Still, Balenciaga was interesting stuff.Balmain is straight, expensive formula. Christophe Decarnin used velvet brocades and lots of gold lace and leather this season, with Annie Oakley fringe along sleeves. I admit I’m a sucker for a black pantsuit with gold pinstripes that twinkle like the Eiffel Tower.In his own quiet way, Dries Van Noten is a showman. He has staged shows in the Palais Royal, under rococo ceilings, in the open air, and once turned a banquet table into a runway. The guests simply pushed back their chairs and watched.'"
"'10-03-05,'1','Thousands of processed food products - from chilis to hot dogs to dips - contain an ingredient that federal food regulators say was contaminated with salmonella, although so far only a few dozen have been recalled because most were cooked before being sold.Basic Food Flavors of Las Vegas, Nev., sold its hydrolyzed vegetable protein to food manufacturers across the country. But one of the company’s customers found salmonella in supplies sent from Basic Food Flavors, and the customer alerted the Food and Drug Administration, which inspected the Las Vegas plant.The inspection uncovered salmonella contamination in the company’s processing equipment, leading Basic Flavors to recall all its hydrolyzed vegetable protein made since Sept. 17, 2009.Food makers who used the product often cooked it again, killing the salmonella. And Health officials have yet to identify anyone who has been sickened by the contaminant. But the nation’s disease tracking system is poor, so the lack of evidence of a contamination does not mean that no one has been sickened by the contaminated products.“This situation clearly underscores the need for new food safety legislation to equip F.D.A. with the tools we need to prevent contamination,” said Dr. Jeff Farrar, F.D.A.’s associate commissioner for food safety.Congress is presently considering legislation that would give the F.D.A. more money to inspect food facilities and greater power to force manufacturers to recall foods suspected of being contaminated.'"
"'10-03-05,'1','“They can’t work the nights they’re working and give you the best they can give you,” UConn Coach Jim Calhoun said on Feb. 12, two days after the Syracuse game, which UConn lost.Calhoun, who had just returned from a medical leave of absence, added: “I don’t know how you can be good if you work 15 out of 16, or 8 out of 9. It’s difficult sometimes playing Saturday-Monday as a coach, and I’m not running, theoretically, three or four miles.”He also said, “It’s a problem that appears to be getting worse.”Rick Stansbury, the Mississippi State coach, agreed. “If they are working that kind of schedule with the travel involved, absolutely they are working too much,” he said. “You can’t be at your best physically or mentally to react if you are calling that many games. I’m for those guys making all the money they can make, it’s a tough job, but don’t do it at the expense of the game.”Cahill could not be reached for comment, but Bryan Kersey, who officiates games in the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big East, the Southern Conference and the Atlantic 10, said he was dismayed by the criticism of referees. By this week he had worked 80 games this season, but said he limited his travel to one-hour flights, worked out every day at his hotel and slept at least eight hours a night.“If Coach Calhoun knew how much rest we are getting and how many DVDs we look at, plus the N.C.A.A. plays and Big East plays and A.C.C. plays we are sent to review, he might think different,” said Kersey, 47, a referee for 24 years and the son of the N.B.A. referee Jess Kersey. “We watch a lot of film of ourselves to improve.”Referees, Kersey said, stay in full-service hotels with spas and do not drive long distances to games. The idea that officials are exhausted on the road and make bad calls is not true, he said.“Conferences have told us we can’t be out of position, we have to be in shape to be in the right spot on the floor,” Kersey said. “You get tired of eating wedge salads, of eating Cobb salads and eating lettuce, but that’s exactly what we do to stay in shape.“We ice when we’re supposed to ice; we heat when we’re supposed to heat. We sit in whirlpools all the time.”Still, there is some sentiment among conference officials who assign games, critique referees and staff the N.C.A.A. tournament that some officials might be working too much.“Jim Calhoun is probably not wrong,” said John Clougherty, the supervisor of officials for the A.C.C. “It has been an ongoing problem for 20 years. I worked too much and I knew when I was tired, but you accept a lot of games and you work those games. They are independent contractors. I can’t tell them how many times to work.”Clougherty also said that although coaches sometimes complained, they recognized the overall quality of the officiating. “These coaches like a comfort level when you put a Johnny Cahill, a Les Jones, an Eddie Corbett out on the floor,” he said. “They may have seen them the night before in a Big East game, but in their gut they are glad they are there.”So when is it midnight for an official, that line where they have worked too many games and are indeed tired?“When you get above 80 games, then you are getting to a point where I’m not sure you are getting enough rest and you have injuries and you might not be mentally sharp,” said John W. Adams, the N.C.A.A.’s coordinator of officials for men’s basketball. “For me, it’s a physical and mental challenge to be at the top of your game given the travel schedules some of these guys try and follow.”Adams said that 15 to 20 of the top officials were working too much, not the majority in Division I. There were 19 referees, as of Feb. 28, who had called 70 games or more, according to StatSheet.com, with a week to go in the regular season.“They have a limited window, just like pro athletes, to make a lot of money,” Adams said. “If you’re 55 years old and trying to do this 90 times a year, it seems to me to be quite a bit of stress, and wear and tear on your body. Their mental acuity has to suffer.“I will say this. I saw Johnny Cahill work a game at Notre Dame, and it might have been his fifth day in a row of work, and he was fantastic.”Gerald Boudreaux, the supervisor of officials for the Southeastern Conference, who officiated in five Final Fours, said he had made it known to officials who call SEC games that he did not want them working too much.“I don’t have any legal grounds to enforce, but I can make it known to those who work on our staff what I feel is desirable,” Boudreaux said. “I don’t feel the games are being compromised. If I see a veteran guy who is not working well, I will cut him back.”Kersey said missed calls were not the result of fatigue, but of something much harder to analyze.“We’re going to miss calls in every single game, but it’s not because we’re tired,” he said. “It’s because we’re human.”'"
"'10-03-05,'1','“We’re not saying we shouldn’t reduce the prison population, but we’re saying you have to be very careful, and they’re making mistakes left, right and sideways,” said Jessica R. Cooper, the Oakland County prosecutor in Michigan, where the state prison population shrank by 3,200 inmates last year and where the parole rate is the highest in 16 years.“You cannot measure those mistakes in terms of money,” Ms. Cooper said.The changes in Michigan have been among the most pronounced, and they provide a glimpse into difficulties in about half the states, which have tinkered with parole, early release programs and sentencing laws or are considering doing so.The authorities in some places say their changes are driven less by money than by the need to fix systems that are not working, and that such efforts were under way, in some cases, before the recession.“We can live in fear and make bad policy based on fear,” said Patricia L. Caruso, director of the Michigan Department of Corrections, “or we can have some backbone and make policy based on what really helps our communities.”Still, she said, the possibility that someone may reoffend always looms.“I worry about it,” Ms. Caruso said. “I say a rosary every day.”Gov. of Michigan, a Democrat, has approved 133 commutations (more than some of her predecessors), expanded the state’s parole board to 15 members (allowing more cases to be considered), and recently proposed a budget that presumes 7,500 fewer prisoners next year for savings of more than $130 million.But local prosecutors across the state are challenging at least 20 of the parole decisions, and Ms. Cooper has assigned two lawyers, full time, to review possible parolees from her county.Among the 13,541 inmates released on parole in Michigan in 2009 was Scott W. Hankins, who had twice been convicted in sex cases and who had been accused by prosecutors of molesting other girls he had met at church, some of whom were developmentally disabled. The youngest girl, prosecutors say, was 7.Mr. Hankins was most recently convicted in 2003 of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for touching a girl who, believing that his children would be present, had gone camping with him. He spent almost seven years behind bars until his release in November, meeting the minimum requirement of the range set by the sentencing judge. But the parole board’s decision to release him came well before the maximum of 30 years.Psychologists who analyzed Mr. Hankins in 2009 said he met the criteria for pedophilia, court records say. He had a stellar attendance and homework record in prison treatment for sex offenders, but his responses, according to the ’ report, indicated “that his insight into his actions is still in the development stage” and that he did not fully recognize how much he had hurt his victims.“I loved them all — I would never harm them,” the report quoted Mr. Hankins as saying. “I never harmed any of them physically. I was just an overly affectionate person and got carried away.”All of that, Ms. Cooper said, made the notion of his release reckless and frightening — a leap too far, even in the most difficult of recessions. So Ms. Cooper appealed his release, a situation that Michigan corrections officials said was extremely rare.It is one of five such appeals Ms. Cooper has filed so far, several of them involving sex offenders. One of them is Daniel E. Fletcher, who was convicted of third-degree criminal sexual conduct in 2007. Prosecutors asserted in court documents that if Mr. Fletcher were to be released, “the safety of the public will be threatened, and defendant’s criminal ways will continue.”Ms. Cooper said she had to file a lawsuit against the state simply to learn the names of the thousands being considered for parole.“If they’re saying to us this is so safe and reasonable, why not allow prosecutors to help cull the list?” she said. “We’re all law enforcement. The fact that they kept it away from us is an indication that they know they’re letting out people they shouldn’t let out.”In one measure of how tangled the fight in Michigan has become, Mike Cox, the attorney general and a Republican candidate for governor, whose job includes defending the State Department of Corrections and its Parole and Commutation Board in their parole decisions, has also filed separate amicus briefs in eight of the cases, including Mr. Hankins’s, opposing parole.Administration officials defend the choices not just as sensible budget decisions, but also as intelligent policy for a state that found itself, in 2007, in the unwanted position of having the fifth-largest prison system in the country, behind far more populous states.Meanwhile, the state has vastly expanded its program for prisoners returning to the outside world, officials said, directing millions of dollars toward helping those on parole stay out of trouble. The rate of parole violations, too, has dropped, they say.Corrections officials challenged the notion that local prosecutors had been kept from learning the names of those being considered for parole. Prosecutors are routinely informed of those soon to be granted parole, but corrections officials simply had no list of all those eligible, said Russ Marlan, a department spokesman. These releases are not early per se, corrections officials say, but within the parameters of Michigan’s indeterminate sentences, which define minimums and maximums.The prosecutors who accepted Mr. Hankins’s 2003 plea agreement, for example — in which he pleaded guilty to a single count of criminal sexual conduct while counts involving two others (including the 7-year-old) were dismissed — always knew it was conceivable that he would get out in just under seven years, corrections officials said.Mr. Hankins, 53, was released on parole in November under strict rules. He moved to a community facility and wore a tether tracking his movement. He was barred from living with anyone 17 or younger, being near playgrounds, using the Internet or going to a topless bar.On Dec. 30, Ms. Cooper’s appeal led a judge to send Mr. Hankins back to prison; a hearing on his case is scheduled for Wednesday.“He wasn’t causing any problem,” said Michael J. McCarthy, Mr. Hankins’s lawyer. “He was trying to find a job.”'"

"'10-03-06,'0','But there’s a problem: labor productivity figures, which are calculated by the Labor Department, count only worker hours in America, even though American-owned factories and labs have been steadily transplanted overseas, and foreign workers have contributed significantly to the final products counted in productivity measures.The result is an apparent drop in the number of worker hours required to produce goods — and thus increased productivity. But actually, the total number of worker hours does not necessarily change.This oversight is no secret: as Labor Department officials acknowledged at a 2004 conference, their statistical methods deem any reduction in the work that goes into creating a specific unit of output, whatever the cause, to be a productivity gain.This continuing mismeasurement leads economists and all those who rely on them to assume that recorded productivity gains always signify greater efficiency, rather than simple offshoring-generated cost cuts — leaving the rest of us scratching our heads over stagnating wages.Of course, just because productivity is mismeasured doesn’t mean that genuine innovations can’t improve living standards. It does mean, however, that Americans are flying blind when it comes to their economy’s strengths and weaknesses, and consequently drawing the wrong policy lessons.Above all, if offshoring has been driving much of our supposed productivity gains, then the case for complete free trade begins to erode. If often such policies simply increase corporate profits at the expense of American workers, with no gains in true productivity, then they don’t necessarily strengthen the national economy.In this regard, the case for free trade as a stimulus for innovation weakens, too. Because productivity gains in part reflect job offshoring, not just the benefits of technology or better business practices, then the American economy has been much less innovative than widely assumed.How can we actually increase innovation and real productivity? Manufacturing, long slighted by free-market extremists, needs to be promoted, not pushed offshore, since it has historically accounted for the bulk of research and development spending and employs the bulk of American science and technology workers — who in turn spur further innovation and real productivity.Promoting manufacturing will require major changes in tax and trade policies that currently foster offshoring, including implementing provisions to punish currency manipulation by countries like China and help American producers harmed by discriminatory foreign value-added tax systems. It also means revitalizing government and corporate research and development, which has languished since its heyday in the 1960s.Much of government policy and business strategy rides on false assumptions about innovation, and although the Obama administration acknowledges the problem, it has done nothing to correct it. With the economy still in need of government life support and the future of American manufacturing in doubt, relying on faulty productivity data is a formula for disaster.'"

"'10-03-07,'0','WASHINGTON — To bolster the case for a far-reaching overhaul of the health care system, the Obama administration is seizing on a new analysis by Goldman Sachs , the New York investment bank, recommending that investors buy shares in two big insurance companies, the UnitedHealth Group and Cigna , because insurance rates are up sharply and competition is down.White House officials on Saturday said that the Goldman Sachs analysis would be a “centerpiece” of their closing argument in the push for major health care legislation. The president and Democratic Congressional leaders are hoping to win passage of the legislation before the Easter recess. Republicans remain fiercely opposed to the bill.The Goldman Sachs analysis shows that while insurers can be aggressive in raising prices, they also walk away from clients because competition in the industry is so weak, the White House said. And officials will point to a finding that rate increases ran as high as 50 percent, with most in “the low- to mid-teens” — far higher than overall inflation.The analysis could be a powerful weapon for the White House because it offers evidence that an overhaul of the health care system is needed not only to help cover the millions of uninsured but to prevent soaring health care expenses from undermining the coverage that the majority of Americans already have through employers.Republicans, however, could also point to the analysis as bolstering their contention that Democrats should be focused more on controlling costs and less on broadly expanding coverage to the uninsured.The research brief is largely based on a recent conference call with Steve Lewis, an industry expert with Willis, a major insurance broker.In the call, Mr. Lewis noted that “price competition is down from a year ago” and explained that his clients — mostly midsize employers seeking to buy health coverage for their employees — were facing a tough market, in which insurance carriers are increasingly willing to abandon existing customers to improve their profit margins.“We feel this is the most challenging environment for us and our clients in my 20 years in the business,” Mr. Lewis said, according to a transcript included in the Goldman brief. “Not only is price competition down from a year ago,” he added, “but trend or (health care) inflation is also up and appears to be rising. The incumbent carriers seem more willing than ever to walk away from existing business resulting in some carrier changes.”The report also indicated that employers are reducing benefit levels, in some cases by adding deductibles for prescription drug coverage in addition to co-payments, and raising other out-of-pocket costs for employees as a way of lowering the cost of insurance without increasing annual premiums and employee contributions to them.Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, is expected to discuss the Goldman analysis on two Sunday television talk shows, “Meet the Press” on NBC and “This Week” on ABC.In his call with Goldman, Mr. Lewis said beneficiaries were feeling the brunt of the changes to existing policies. “Visually to employees, they’re fairly significant,” he said.But the report also sounded cautionary notes that the administration will probably not want to highlight.Asked by Goldman analysts about the effort to pass major health care legislation, Mr. Lewis said many employers experiencing increases in their insurance costs were nonetheless apprehensive about the president’s proposal.“They’re very mixed in their reaction, quite candidly consistent with what we’re seeing in the polling numbers by party lines,” Mr. Lewis said. “I think most people would acknowledge that there’s a need for health care reform; employers continue to be very frustrated. So when they look at what the Obama administration and the Democratic majority state as their goals to increase access and lower cost and rail at what may be termed oligopolistic behavior of carriers in certain markets, I think employers really buy in to that message and have much of that frustration and anger at our lack of solutions.”And yet, he said, there is little enthusiastic support from employers for the Democrats’ proposals.“Many of them still view the legislation and the partisanship coming out of Washington as possibly the medicine worse than the disease,” he said. “So many employer groups that we’re talking to feel like it would be a shame to lose an opportunity to do something with respect to health care reform. But many are starting to feel like maybe nothing is better than something in this current environment.”'"

As Ms. Morgenson notes, and as New York urged in 2008, the only practical, effective solution is a holistic one that only the federal government can provide. Credit default swaps must all be traded on an exchange, with transparency and strong reserve requirements.There are two benefits to reserve requirements. One, they ensure that the seller of the swap can pay up on its promise. Two, since they will increase the price of swaps, they will tend to limit their use to situations where they serve a real economic purpose.We cannot afford any more disruption in the financial markets. It’s long past due that Washington act on credit default swaps.The writer is the insurance superintendent of New York State.'"
"'10-03-07,'0','“People get all worked up about the carp when the large-scale stuff is just not getting attention,” said George A. Ranney Jr., chief executive of Chicago Metropolis 2020, a business group that advocates for regional transportation planning. “The issue is, can we build a consensus on something bigger than just stopping that fish?”In a 2005 report, Chicago Metropolis 2020 called for building major terminals where freight could be transferred easily among different modes of transportation, like rail cars, trucks and river barges. The terminals would allow shippers to load their goods onto the most efficient means of transport. Construction of five such terminals in key locations on the outskirts of Chicago, along with other efficiencies and infrastructure improvements, could save $5 billion a year in trucking costs alone, the report said.The report has drawn little attention, but proposals for intermodal transit facilities and other far-reaching measures are beginning to emerge now that Congress, the Obama administration and state governments are trying to find ways to contain the carp.“The real debate needs to be on how to separate the Illinois waterways from the Great Lakes in ways that benefit the entire region,” said Joel Brammeier, president of the Alliance for the Great Lakes, an environmental group.Creating a permanent, ecological barrier between Lake Michigan and Illinois waterways would require, at a minimum, building a water treatment facility that would eliminate the possibility that any aquatic creature could move between the lake and Mississippi River watersheds. Backers of such a project liken its potential ecological impact to the reversal of the Chicago River’s flow nearly a century ago. That historic engineering feat kept the city’s waste out of the lake while this one would keep out marauding fish.The water treatment plant would be part of a larger transportation complex that would enable shipments to move efficiently and quickly up and down the Illinois River and other waterways. The complex might include cranes capable of hoisting boats from the water, railroad sidings and truck bays — and possibly massive conveyor belts to move cargo or even boats.While the federal government would most likely cover at least part of the construction cost, private industry has already demonstrated a capacity to build such facilities without massive government aid. The railroad company Union Pacific is building a $370 million intermodal facility on 3,900 acres outside Peoria that is set to open this year.The debate over how best to stop the carp has intensified along with the invasive fish’s seemingly irresistible progress toward Lake Michigan. Illinois has battled other Great Lakes states in a war of words about the costs and risks associated with Asian carp. When a Michigan-sponsored study that was released last month claimed that the closing of two key locks leading into Lake Michigan would cost the Illinois economy only $70 million, the Illinois Chamber of Commerce began a new research effort intended to counter what it saw as an outrageously low estimate.The Michigan study, by Prof. John Taylor of Wayne State University, is “so far removed from science I don’t know how to comment” on it, said James Farrell, executive director of the Illinois Chamber.Professor Taylor has defended his study, which makes a case that the Illinois waterway running into Lake Michigan is hardly the vital economic lifeline that the Illinois Chamber and other defenders insist it is. Using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers data, he showed that the O’Brien Lock, the key barge channel into Lake Michigan, saw barge traffic drop by half from 1994 to 2008, to 7,063 total barges. In addition, trips by tour boats and other recreational and commercial vessels, which principally use the Chicago Lock near Navy Pier, fell 39 percent during the period, to 34,249 total trips, Professor Taylor wrote.The alternative to permanent separation — temporary and stopgap measures — has its costs, too.Despite electronic barriers and other efforts to contain the carp, a recent University of Notre Dame study found traces of carp DNA in Calumet Harbor, near Navy Pier and at the Wilmette pumping station.Because two electronic barriers have not completely stopped the advance of the carp, the Obama administration set aside $78.5 million this year for building a third electronic barrier.The Corps of Engineers’ proposal to close two key locks intermittently this summer, one near Navy Pier and the other near Calumet Harbor, could cost shipping, recreation, tourism and other companies millions of dollars.Ozinga Brothers, a concrete producer based in Evanston, ships the equivalent of 100,000 truckloads of material by barge from downstate into Chicago each year, the company said. If a lock closing forced the company to ship by truck, freight costs would jump as much as 40 percent, said Aaron Ozinga, president of the company’s material handling division.At Shoreline Sightseeing, whose tour boats ply waters from the Chicago River into Lake Michigan, uncertainties about the lock at Navy Pier are causing difficulty at the worst time — when the company typically is hiring 40 captains and more than 250 crew members even as its cash flow is at its ebb tide. This year, hiring plans may have to be delayed.“One of the big unknowns is whether this is a temporary, one-season thing, a one-month thing, or a bigger-picture thing that could be even more devastating,” said Chip Collopy, president of Shoreline Sightseeing.A permanent separation of Lake Michigan from the rivers and canals that connect it with the Mississippi would not cause significant dislocation of commercial waterway traffic, according to data from the Waterways Council, which lobbies on behalf of inland shippers.The two systems are already essentially separate commercial entities.In 2005, some 7,568 kilotons shipped through the O’Brien Lock, in the Cal-Sag Channel on the far South Side, which is the key transit point for cargo traffic between the lake and the Illinois waterway system. That amounted to less than 1 percent of the tonnage through all Illinois locks that year.Indeed, most of the river and canal traffic in Illinois originates below the O’Brien Lock and involves grains, ore and other commodities that do not travel through the Great Lakes.Jeffrey Adkisson, executive vice president of the Grain & Feed Association of Illinois, said the debate over proposals to stop the Asian carp had prompted less alarm among the group’s members than he had expected.“Our members are largely going down the river to the gulf,” Mr. Adkisson said.Within weeks, the Army Corps is expected to propose a solution for containing the carp.Henry Henderson, director of the Midwest Program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, is pushing for a permanent solution.“We think the longer-term, permanent solutions can actually enhance the transport and movement of goods throughout the region,” Mr. Henderson said.'"

Business owners, many of whom complained to aldermen about the zoning department's enforcement effort, will not have to make improvements or pay fines while the proposal is under consideration, Mr. Schulter said.Norma Reyes, commissioner of the city's Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection, and Patricia Scudiero, commissioner of the Department of Zoning and Land Use Planning, have agreed to the year moratorium, Mr. Schulter said.Alderman Tom Allen (38th) said city inspectors should focus on safety, adding, ""I don't consider not having a tree or an ornamental fence a heinous offense.""'"
"'10-03-07,'0','This time, the best answer isn’t found in traditional economics but rather in American culture: a long-standing feeling that owning homes in healthy communities is connected to individual liberties that embody our national identity. Historically, homeownership has been associated with freedom, while renting — often in tenements or mill villages — has been linked to the oppression of a landlord.In his classic 1985 book, “Crabgrass Frontier,” Kenneth T. Jackson of Columbia University delineated the complex train of thought that over the last two centuries has produced the American belief that homeownership encourages pride and good citizenship and, ultimately, preservation of liberty. These attitudes are enduring.Back in 1899, in “The Theory of the Leisure Class,” Thorstein Veblen described homeownership, particularly of large and expensive dwellings, as “conspicuous consumption.” By that, he meant that it was undertaken substantially for the purpose of impressing others by showing the amount of money one can afford to waste on space one doesn’t need.What is specifically American here — though it’s increasingly seen in other countries, too — may be the modern sense of equal citizenship, engendered by the illusion that we can sustain conspicuous housing consumption even among a majority of the people.In short, this all has a great deal to do with culture, and little to do with financial wisdom. After all, financial theory suggests that people should not own their own homes, at least not in the way that many do today. A cardinal tenet is that people should diversify — meaning they shouldn’t put nearly all of their financial eggs in one basket, which is what homeownership now means for so many people.American mortgage institutions encourage people to take a leveraged position in the real estate market, which is quite risky because home prices can and do decline, as we have learned so painfully. Leverage a risky investment 10 to 1 and you can expect trouble — and we have plenty of it today. More than 16 million homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, according to Mark Zandi of Economy.com.If we choose to keep subsidizing individual homeownership, we must also commit to adding safeguards so that homeowners are less financially vulnerable. Of course, that will require some creative finance.But first, we should rethink the idea of renting, which could be a viable option for many more Americans and needn’t endanger the traditional values of individual liberty and good citizenship.Switzerland, for example, is a country with strong patriotism, a fighting spirit of national defense, a commitment to freedom and tolerance, and a low crime rate. Yet its homeownership rate is just 34.6 percent, versus 66.2 percent for the United States, according to the two countries’ 2000 censuses.Swiss national identity doesn’t depend on homeownership. Instead, Riccarda Torriani, a historian at the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, links the country’s sense of identity to such things as its system of direct democracy, which enforces popular participation in government; the idea that its citizens are frontier people (living in or near the rugged Alps); and a history of collective courage in defense of freedom, even when outnumbered.BUT America isn’t Switzerland. Our values and habits of thought are very different. Moreover, our homes are largely scattered in vast suburbs, often with distinct features. If many of these homes needed to be converted to rental units, home prices might well drop.A stock of apartment buildings in central cities, of course, makes rental management much easier. This is true in Switzerland, as well as in American cities like New York, which aren’t typical of the rest of the United States. We need to consider a gradual transition toward new kinds of housing finance institutions — entities that may lead us to a different kind of housing, yet preserve our core values. Although such innovation isn’t likely to end subsidies, it should refocus them on enhancing the qualities of life that we really value.We need to invent financial institutions that take into account the kinds of communities we want to build. And we need to base this innovation on an approach to economics that captures the richness of human experience — and not on efficient-market economics, which disregards human psychology and assumes that our basic institutions are already perfect.'"
"'10-03-07,'0','The St. Louis Rams signed the free agent A .J. Feeley as part of what could be a shakeup at the quarterback position. Terms of the deal announced Saturday were not disclosed, but news media reports said Feeley received a two-year contract. Feeley, 32, was a backup for Carolina in 2009. In 10 seasons he has completed 372 of 665 passes for 4,070 yards and 27 touchdowns, with 29 interceptions. The quarterback situation in St. Louis is unsettled. The Rams may not retain Marc Bulger and are said to be considering Oklahoma’s Sam Bradford and Notre Dame’s Jimmy Clausen with the No. 1 overall pick in the April draft.'"
"'10-03-07,'0','AS more details surface about how derivatives helped Greece and perhaps other countries mask their debt loads, let’s not forget that the wonders of these complex products aren’t on display only overseas. Across our very own country, municipalities, school districts, sewer systems and other tax-exempt debt issuers are ensnared in the derivatives mess.Like the credit default swaps that hid Greece’s obligations, the instruments weighing on our municipalities were brought to us by the creative minds of Wall Street. The rocket scientists crafting the products got backup from swap advisers, a group of conflicted promoters who consulted municipalities and other issuers. Both of these camps peddled swaps as a way for tax-exempt debt issuers to reduce their financing costs.Now, however, the promised benefits of these swaps have mutated into enormous, and sometimes smothering, expenses. Making matters worse, issuers who want out of the arrangements — swap contracts typically run for 30 years — must pay up in order to escape.That’s right. Issuers are essentially paying twice for flawed deals that bestowed great riches on the bankers and advisers who sold them. Taxpayers should be outraged, but to be angry you have to be informed — and few taxpayers may even know that the complicated arrangements exist.Here’s how municipal swaps worked (in theory): Say an issuer needed to raise money and prevailing rates for fixed-rate debt were 5 percent. A swap allowed issuers to reduce the interest rate they paid on their debt to, say, 4.5 percent, while still paying what was effectively a fixed rate.Nothing wrong with that, right?Sales presentations for these instruments, no surprise, accentuated the positives in them. “Derivative products are unique in the history of financial innovation,” gushed a pitch from Citigroup in November 2007 about a deal entered into by the Florida Keys Aqueduct Authority. Another selling point: “Swaps have become widely accepted by the rating agencies as an appropriate financial tool.” And, the presentation said, they can be easily unwound (for a fee, of course).But these arrangements were riddled with risks, as issuers are finding out. The swaps were structured to generate a stream of income to the issuer — like your hometown — that was tethered to a variable interest rate. Variable rates can rise or fall wildly if economic circumstances change. Banks that executed the swaps received fixed payments from the issuers.The contracts, however, assumed that economic and financial circumstances would be relatively stable and that interest rates used in the deals would stay in a narrow range. The exact opposite occurred: the financial system went into a tailspin two years ago, and rates plummeted. The auction-rate securities market, used by issuers to set their interest payments to bondholders, froze up. As a result, these rates rose.For municipalities, that meant they were stuck with contracts that forced them to pay out a much higher interest rate than they were receiving in return. Sure, the rate plunge was unforeseen, but it was not an impossibility. And the impact of such a possible decline was rarely highlighted in sales presentations, municipal experts say.Another aspect to these swaps’ designs made them especially ill-suited for municipal issuers. Almost all tax-exempt debt is structured so that after 10 years, it can be called or retired by the city, school district or highway authority that floated it. But by locking in the swap for 30 years, the municipality or school district is essentially giving up the option to call its debt and issue lower-cost bonds, without penalty, if interest rates have declined.Imagine a homeowner who has a mortgage allowing her to refinance without a penalty if interest rates drop, as many do. Then she inexplicably agrees to give up that opportunity and not be compensated for doing so. Well, some towns did exactly that when they signed derivatives contracts that locked them in for 30 years.Then there are the counterparty risks associated with municipal swaps. If the banks in the midst of these deals falter, the municipality is at peril, because getting out of a contract with a failed bank is also costly. For example, closing out swaps in which Lehman Brothers was the counterparty cost various New York State debt issuers $12 million, according to state filings.Termination fees also kick in when a municipal issuer wants out of its swap agreement. They can be significant.'"
"'10-03-07,'0','“The Obama White House has lost the narrative in the way that the Obama campaign never did,” said James Morone, a political scientist at Brown University. “They essentially took the president’s great strength as a messenger and failed to use it smartly.”Mr. Axelrod said he accepts some blame for what he called “communication failures,” though he acknowledges bafflement that the administration’s efforts to stimulate the economy in a crisis, overhaul health care and prosecute two wars have been so routinely framed by opponents as the handiwork of a big-government, soft-on-terrorism, politics-of-the-past ideologue.“For me, the question is, why haven’t we broken through more than we have?” Mr. Axelrod said. “Why haven’t we broken through?”That question has dogged Mr. Axelrod in recent months and has preoccupied Mr. Obama’s inner circle, fueling speculation that the vaunted “No Drama Obama” team might be fracturing. Not surprisingly, the White House has no patience for this.“You guys want to fit people into boxes and categories that are just not accurate,” Mr. Emanuel said.Mr. Axelrod would not discuss what counsel he offered to Mr. Obama, though he denies any “fissure with my buddy Rahm” and any charge that he is too infatuated with the president to recognize the political risks of his ambitious agenda.“Believe me, if we were charting this administration as a political exercise, the first thing we would have done would not have been a massive recovery act, stabilizing the banks and helping to keep the auto companies from collapsing,” he said. “Those would not even be the first hundred things he would want to do.”But Mr. Axelrod argued that the president, confronted with “breathtaking challenges,” did not have the luxury of moving more slowly or methodically.In an interview in his office, Mr. Axelrod was often defiant, saying he did not give a “flying” expletive “about what the peanut gallery thinks” and did not live for the approval “of the political community.” He denounced the “rampant lack of responsibility” of people in Washington who refuse to solve problems, and cited the difficulty of trying to communicate through what he calls “the dirty filter” of a city suffused with the “every day is Election Day sort of mentality.”When asked how he would assess his performance, Mr. Axelrod shrugged. “I’m not going to judge myself on that score,” he said. But then he shot back: “Have I succeeded in reversing a 30-year trend of skepticism and cynicism about government? I confess that I have not. Maybe next year.”The criticism of the administration’s communication strategy — leveled by impatient Democrats, gleeful Republicans, bloggers and cable chatterers — clearly stings Mr. Axelrod, as well as the circle of family, friends and fans he has acquired over three decades in politics as a consultant and, before that, a reporter for The Chicago Tribune.“Every time I hear that the White House is getting the message wrong, it breaks my heart,” said Mr. Axelrod’s sister, Joan, an educational therapist in Boston.Ms. Axelrod says that while her brother is devoted to Mr. Obama, he is not a sycophant. She paused when asked whether he admired the president too much. “He is very, very loyal, sometimes to a fault,” she said.Added Mr. Gibbs: “The list of people who have to deliver bad news to the president is very small, and David is first on that list. I’m probably second.”Mr. Axelrod’s friends worry about the toll of his job — citing his diet (cold-cut-enriched), his weight (20 pounds heavier than at the start of the presidential campaign), sleep deprivation (five fitful hours a night), separation from family (most back home in Chicago) and the fact that at 55, he is considerably older than many of the wunderkind workaholics of the West Wing. He wakes at 6 in his rented condominium just blocks from the White House and typically returns around 11.Unlike other presidential alter egos, Mr. Axelrod is not viewed as a surrogate “brain” (like Karl Rove), a suspicious outsider (like Dick Morris in the Clinton White House) or a co-president (James Baker in the first Bush White House). Sometimes portrayed as a bare-knuckled Chicago operative, he is also a bantering walrus of a man in mustard-stained sleeves who describes himself as a “kibbitzer,” not a “policy guy.”Sitting at his desk next door to the Oval Office last week, he was tearing into a five-inch corned beef sandwich on rye with a Flintstone-size turkey drumstick waiting on deck. “I am the poster child for the president’s obesity program,” he said.A few minutes later, Mr. Obama walked in unannounced, scattering two aides like startled pigeons. “Hey,” Mr. Axelrod said by way of greeting (no “sir” or “Mr. President.”) Mr. Obama surveyed the spread on Mr. Axelrod’s desk with a slight smirk.“What is this, King Arthur’s court?” he asked, then pulled Mr. Axelrod aside to talk about a health care speech he was about to deliver.Mr. Axelrod is often at the president’s side; he sits in on policy and national security meetings and is routinely the last person he talks to before making a decision. He directs the administration’s external presentation, overseeing polls, focus groups and speeches and appearing on the Sunday shows. Mr. Emanuel describes Mr. Axelrod as “an integrator of the three P’s” — press, policy and politics — “and how they make a whole.”White House officials describe Mr. Axelrod’s focus as big themes rather than day-to-day sound bites. There has been no shortage of Democrats willing to second-guess his messaging approach.“They made a big mistake right out of the box with the Inaugural Address,” said former Senator Bob Kerrey, adding that a president pledging bipartisanship should not have disparaged the previous administration in his speech, as many listeners believed Mr. Obama did.Chris Lehane, a former top aide to Vice President Al Gore, says the administration should tell a clearer story. “They have been enormously capable in dealing with the day-to-day challenges of the government,” Mr. Lehane said. “But they don’t seem to get the credit they deserve for that because they’ve communicated no overarching big idea or philosophical framework of where they want to take the country.”Others question what happened to the Mr. Axelrod who so effectively marketed Mr. Obama, the candidate, as a change agent. He and some defenders, though, say that trying to explain a president who is dealing with a fusillade of difficult governing issues is far different.“In a campaign, you’re not held to the same standard of actually doing what you say you’re going to do,” said Anita Dunn, a former White House communications director and Obama campaign adviser. Mr. Axelrod can still sound like the self-described idealist who developed Mr. Obama’s campaign message, expressing impatience with what he calls “the gritty pragmatist school that says you have just got to accept the system” in Washington. “I’m not surprised that there are people who never liked us in the first place trying to have a big ‘I told you so’ about how you really can’t change the system,” he said.Mr. Axelrod has never lived in Washington before and has come to loathe what he calls “the palace intrigue pathology of Washington.”“I know I’m not cut out for this town,” though he has respect for the people who work there, said Mr. Axelrod, who tries to spend one week a month with his wife, Susan, who lives in Chicago, as do two of his three children.Mr. Axelrod is tired, but he says that is nothing new. “I have dealt with a lot of ‘real stuff’ in my life,” he said, referring to his daughter’s long struggle with epilepsy, his father’s suicide and his wife’s bout with breast cancer. “The disapprobation of some folks in Washington doesn’t seem very meaningful.”His friends still worry. “I think he’s getting close to a burnout kind of thing,” said Sam Smith, a former Chicago Tribune sports writer, basing this not on anything Mr. Axelrod told him. Mr. Smith added that he speaks only sporadically to his friend these days, mainly about sports, and that Mr. Axelrod has always driven himself exceedingly hard.As Mr. Obama began his term, Mr. Axelrod told him he would stay at the White House for a finite period — believed to be about two years — and that time frame remains unchanged. “I’ve learned more things in the last year than I will ever learn in my life,” he said. “It’s just something you can’t do forever, or it will kill you.”'"
"'10-03-07,'0','On another street in the commercial district, Dieuvenson Semervil, 12, scavenged for padlocks in a collapsed hardware store. Before the quake, Dieuvenson said, he dreamed of becoming a mechanic. A body decomposed next to him to as he picked through the rubble. Near the ruins of the partly destroyed Lycée Alexandre Pétion, one of the city’s public schools, Samanta Louis, 11, swept the sidewalk, work she said helped support her nine siblings and parents who lived in the tent camp of Champs de Mars. A former student at the Lycée, Jean Pierre Lestin, 15, scavenged brick from a collapsed wall to sell. “I would like to be an engineer someday,” he said.Children staying in the camps face trials beyond laboring in the streets. Health workers in the camps are reporting a rising number of young rape victims, including girls as young as 12. Alison Thompson, an Australian nurse and documentary director who volunteers at a tent clinic on the grounds of the Pétionville Club, said she had cared for a 14-year-old girl who was raped recently in the camp.“The entire structure of the lives of these children has been upended, and now they’re dealing with the predators living next to them,” Ms. Thompson said.The government here has recognized the urgency of reopening schools to provide some structure to those picking up the pieces of their lives. But its efforts to do so have faltered. Officials declared schools open in unaffected areas as of Feb. 1; some students have trickled into those schools, but many have not, say education specialists.Here in the capital, symbols of the devastated education system lie scattered throughout the city. Metal scavengers are still picking through the wrecked Collège du Canapé-Vert, where as many as 300 students studying to become teachers died in the earthquake.Foreign aid groups here say that Haiti differs from other poor nations recently struck by natural disasters, like Pakistan and Bangladesh, in that the quake gutted the education system of the capital in a highly centralized country. In New Orleans, more than half of the public schools remained shut a year after Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, said Marcelo Cabral, an education specialist with the Inter-American Development Bank.Haiti’s education system was already dysfunctional before the earthquake. Only about 20 percent of schools were public, with the rest highly expensive for the poor. Even in public schools, poor families struggled to pay for uniforms, textbooks and supplies. While other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean spend about 5 percent of their gross domestic product on education, Haiti was spending just 2 percent, according to the Inter-American Development Bank.“The quality of education was very low, with about a third of teachers having nine years of education at best,” Mr. Cabral said in an interview here, after a recent meeting with Haitian officials in an attempt to come up with a plan to reopen schools. Mr. Cabral said the Inter-American Development Bank estimated that Haiti needed $2 billion over the next five years to rebuild its education system.Children make up about 45 percent of Haiti’s population, and they are flooding the camps. Hundreds of children milled about the latrines of a camp at the prime minister’s office complex one day at the end of last month. “I have nothing to do,” said Belle-Fleur Merline, 11, who lives at the camp with her father and two siblings.Placid Francoise, 17, said she had hoped to become a nurse before the earthquake destroyed her family’s home and forced them into a camp in front of the ruins of the presidential palace. Her mother, a street vendor, had used her meager savings to pay Ms. Francoise’s tuition at the Frères Monfort school.Now Ms. Francoise lives in a one-room shack with more than a dozen relatives. She said she had no idea when she would return to school. “I work for my mother each day now, so that we may eat,” she said, pointing to the bags of charcoal they sell in front of their hovel.Some educators and relief officials are not waiting for the government to act, deciding to open their own schools on a piecemeal basis in some camps.Alzire Rocourt, a headmaster at a private school here before the earthquake, opened a school last month under tents donated by the Israeli Army in the sprawling Pétionville Club camp. She teaches reading, math and geography. The students play volleyball on the dirt outside during recess. And they sing, with vigor, Creole folk songs.“Renmen yon ak lot,” they ended. “It means, ‘Loving each other,’ ” Ms. Rocourt said.She smiled, too, until she recalled how much more needed to be done. Of the more than 25,000 children living in the Pétionville camp, just 260 are in her school.'"
"'10-03-07,'0','His wife, Kate (Karen Ziemba), is the closest thing to a villain in the play. But there is every reason to sympathize with her. She and Greg have moved from the suburbs into Manhattan now that their children are grown and out of the house. She has taken up teaching, and it is going well. Kate loves this new calm, orderly existence; the shakiness of Greg’s Wall Street career is upset enough, without adding a frenzied, flawed animal to the mix.Ms. Ziemba, a Broadway musical veteran and a Tony Award winner, fits right into this nonmusical comedy. But there is one priceless musical moment. As Kate boards a plane, Greg lingers at the airport after seeing her off. While Sylvia waits at home alone, she begins singing “Every time we say goodbye, I die a little.” Then the humans join in, each in his or her separate loneliness. Ms. Ziemba’s voice, naturally, outshines the others — but not enough to kill the delicately balanced humor and poignancy of the moment.Let’s remember who gave Sylvia life: A. R. Gurney, the chronicler of sophisticated upper-middle-class angst, author of plays like “The Cocktail Party,” “The Dining Room,”“Love Letters”and “Mrs. Farnsworth,” is a man gifted with uncommon insight into human motivations and frailties. So when he turns his gift to the analysis of what a dog might really be thinking and really want, it should not be surprising that the results are so rich. (Gurneyish touch: There is talk about the dog putting Greg and Kate’s marriage at risk.)Sylvia does speak, of course. “Listen, it’s a tough world out there, lady,” she says when Kate proposes sending her to the pound. Then she explains the awful meaning of the “time limit” that pounds and shelters impose.Not having seen the play before, I had assumed that only the audience would hear and understand Sylvia’s words. But Greg and Kate do understand, whether literally or emotionally, and respond.The difference between “Sylvia” and other popular dog tales of recent years, like “My Dog Skip”and “Marley and Me,”is that those focus on what a relationship with a dog means to us. “Sylvia” concentrates just as much on what our actions and feelings mean to dogs. And though people with crying tendencies will cry at the end, there is nothing sentimental about it.Considerable credit for this goes to Eric Ting’s bouncy but deliberately hard-edged direction. Frank J. Alberino’s set is understated and gracefully clever. Jacob Ming-Trent plays three roles expertly. One is male, one is female, and one is a therapist we’re not sure about (“I let my patients select my gender”).So much of Sylvia’s dialogue is a revelation, but the tricks-and-treats scene stands out. Sylvia does a trick. Greg praises her and pops a treat into her mouth.Then he gives the command for a second trick. Sylvia replies, “I’m still eating.”'"
"'10-03-07,'0','Last month, Bread Stuy, a coffee house on Lewis Avenue in Brooklyn, was padlocked by marshals because it owed back taxes; neighbors helped pay off a $10,000 penalty so it could reopen.When the Pink Teacup, a soul-food fixture in the West Village for more than 50 years (“Take two pork chops at the Pink Teacup and call me in the morning,” the Newsday critic Sylvia Carter once advised) was collapsing late last year, its fans raised money through social media. Then the filmmaker Lawrence Page agreed to buy it, and he plans to reopen it this spring.In Rockefeller Center, Jerry’s Barber Shop was about to close last month after 31 years when a customer — David Rubin, a real estate lawyer — volunteered to negotiate a better rent.At the other end of the economic food chain, shares were sold last year to rescue the chronically in-hock Vox Pop Cafe, a coffeehouse-art gallery-bookshop on Cortelyou Road in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, making it into a collective.Thanks to taxpayer-financed bailouts, big banks and insurance companies were spared the harshest judgment of the marketplace over the last 18 months, exempted under the doctrine of “too big to fail.”On that scorecard, places like Bread Stuy and Vox Pop and Ray’s would be doomed. Banks in; egg creams out. But when someone has been running a little business for 37 years, as Mr. Alvarez has, he can build up a big head of social momentum.One recent blustery night, Maria Musial stood behind the counter at Ray’s, where she has worked since arriving from Elk, Poland, in the early 1980s.“When I came, he was nearly the only store on the block,” Ms. Musial said. “The squat people was here. Now it’s young customers, new people.”In rallying people, some of Mr. Alvarez’s supporters have blamed his landlord, but the store’s problems are far more complicated than his monthly rent of $3,500.“The landlord is not trying to throw him out,” said Bob Arihood, a resident of the area who has been working for the last year to untangle Mr. Alvarez’s chaotic financial life and who writes a blog called Neither More Nor Less. “Ray’s on a month-to-month arrangement. The landlord could have thrown him out any time he fell behind, but he doesn’t want to do that.”Although he is 77 and paid Social Security taxes for decades, Mr. Alvarez has not yet drawn any benefits, because, he said, he immigrated from Turkey under a different name.“They told him to go to a hearing,” Mr. Arihood said. “Ray didn’t go.” Mr. Alvarez said that students from Cardozo Law School were working on that problem. Then he recited an impressive catalog of debts. “The workers’ comp insurance is the worst,” he said, displaying a bill for $84,000 in back premiums.Another pressing matter is the vat of boiling oil that he uses to fry potatoes, his best-selling product. The shop has no grease hood and an inadequate exhaust system. “The insurance company wants to cancel the policy,” said Barbara Chupa, the building manager. “But I’ve heard that Ray has someone willing to do the labor to put it in.”The equipment, Mr. Alvarez said, would cost about $20,000.His friends see injustice, not debt, and will fight. As the menu for the new delivery project says: “How could we sit idly while Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks slowly killed everything we cherished about our community?”And there is a matter of loyalty to someone who was willing to cut kids a break on a plate of fries, said Arianna Gil: “He’s an icon of our childhood.”'"
"'10-03-07,'0','I followed René up the mountain past small pastures and little homesteads nestled in leafy trees. At about 3,600 feet, we took a left onto a gravel driveway canopied by old-growth forest. A stream crossed the driveway at a ford, and we splashed through it.Larry's unassuming rancher is surrounded by bedded plantings. He's built fences of driftwood and strung bottles along them. Arrayed about the property are benches he's cut from entire trees. One of them overlooks his two little ponds — one for swimming, one for fish (his teenage son Wesley announced there were twenty-six of them). Up the hill, rows of Christmas trees awaited harvest. He took us into the woods, to a spot on a creek where magnolias grew like mangroves and a small, beautiful waterfall rushed. We talked about recipes for the perfect margarita.Larry has tricked out a little wooden barn with a gigantic Peavey PA system, a bar, and a lava lamp. He opened the freezer door and said, ""Sheeat! Look in here, there's a jar of water that doesn't freeze!""A neighbor showed up with some shucked oysters from her home in South Carolina.We listened to Steve Earle, Ralph Stanley, and AC/DC and poured moonshine over the oysters and shot them with Tabasco.Larry mentioned a friend with stovetop still, and praised the famous Smoky Mountain charred.I sipped Larry's good corn whiskey — and that's what it was, there was no doubt about it — and smiled at them and told them this was perfect. A late summer day spent high in the Smokies drinking good white lightning is pretty satisfying.It was on this trip that I went in search of famed moonshiner Popcorn Sutton.Popcorn Sutton has made a career out of moonshine, but not, or not wholly, in the usual way. Rather than rely upon actually selling jugs of the stuff, he authored the perpetually out-of-print and consistently in demand book Me and My Likker and set out on a mission of bizarre celebrity. He spent a lot of time driving around in a Model A Ford and being interviewed for local news footage about the ""old ways.""On Willie Nelson's Web site, you can see Willie with his arm around Popcorn. Willie is dressed nonchalantly in black — hoodie, trousers, sneakers, t-shirt, cowboy hat. Popcorn, in contrast, is attired in his usual costume: overalls, a flannel shirt, and a greasy leather fedora. He's hunched, his wild beard radiating down to his chest from drawn cheeks. He can't be an inch over 5 feet 6, and I'd be amazed to learn that he weighs more than two cases of beer. He is somewhere between 45 and 105 years old — apparently it's a bad idea to ask him. He looks as if he clips Snuffy Smith cartoons to his bathroom mirror.Lana Nelson (Willie's daughter) captioned the photo: ""Somewhere in the Great Smoky Mountains near Cherokee, N.C., world renowned moonshiner and literary giant, Popcorn Sutton, visits Dr. Booger Nelson [Willie's nickname is Booger Red] at a top-secret, undisclosed location. Popcorn brews corn liquor for thousands of thirsty customers in the dry county, and received a standing ovation when Dad introduced him at the sold-out Harrah's concert.""Popcorn never figured out how to monetize his celebrity. He gets hauled up on stage and smiles out into an exultant crowd, but he doesn't get any more bills to stuff in his mattress. He has sold at least one Model A, and he doesn't have the few thousand dollars it would take to get another print run of his book, although the thing is practically a home run, guaranteed to sell out while still warm from the printing press.I had figured that his moonshine was all postmodernism, more about performance and presentation than liquor. Certainly, he doesn't actually make liquor for thousands of thirsty customers. He speaks at folk-life festivals. I thought of him as the Andy Warhol of hooch. Just another example of how something that had once been purely American and real had transformed, for purposes of display, into something else.The truth turned out to be much weirder.Authenticity is evasive and hard to understand in America. Why were there half a dozen honky-tonk beer joints in New York City at the turn of the century? I don't know what to make of the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, or the French Quarter in New Orleans. For that matter, I don't know what to make of my own town, in which the historical review board insists that the houses continue to be built as if it were the middle of the nineteenth century, to maintain an authentic cohesion, without stopping to consider that nothing is more artificial than building nineteenth-century houses in the twenty-first century.It's a slippery thing. There is no denying that the French Quarter really is the French Quarter or that Fisherman's Wharf is built on the quays. These places have found themselves, due to the pressures of commerce or culture, in a state of aggravated self-consciousness compelled to emulate and replicate their salient features until artifice overtakes authenticity.This shift happens to people, too. My suspicions about Popcorn's artifice were only further underscored by one of the two places he lives, a vacation hub called Maggie Valley, his perfect correlative.West of Lake Junaluska in North Carolina, I drove Route 19 between Hard Ridge and Utah Mountain. The asphalt rolled flat for a short stretch between the many hills and became Soco Road. I drove through miles of restaurants, bars, hotels, and gift shops. Maggie Valley, according to the 2000 census, is a town of 607 people. On the five-mile stretch of Soco Road, I counted about thirty restaurants.Today every slope is a housing development — for vacationers, I assume — named, as is the mode for developments, for the very things the bulldozers took from the landscape: Walnut Hills, the Meadows, Wild Acres. The one I explored was a cluster of gray, particleboard-paneled houses stacked like playing cards.Whatever Maggie Valley once was, it no longer is.The town has commodified itself, just as Popcorn has. I got the feeling that everything I touched, everything I saw, was being done for the benefit of tourists. That feeling is enhanced by the breathtaking tally of the roadside gift shops. Finally, at the edge of town, a gigantic sign in yellow and black announced that I'd found the most photographed vista of the Smokies.Certainly, this place was perfect for books about backwoods distilling, for stoneware jugs, for metamoonshine.But there was one last contradiction: Popcorn had been busted.The headline had read, ""Fire Call Leads to Moonshine Bust: Firefighters Responding to a Cocke County Fire on Tuesday Discovered Much More than They Expected.""On property belonging to Marvin ""Popcorn"" Sutton, they found everything needed to make moonshine, as well as dozens of jugs of the finished product. Three large stills were in operation, and a building on the property was on fire.Sutton now faces two charges stemming from Tuesday's bust. Before his arrest, Sutton had gained a certain notoriety for his popular books and videos teaching others how to make moonshine.According to one of Popcorn Sutton's videos, he's gotten in trouble for moonshining before — in 1974, and again in 1998.He's expected to appear before a judge on these most recent charges on May 9.Popcorn's shack in Maggie Valley is at the top of a hill, and at the bottom of that hill is the Misty Mountain Ranch, a bed-and-breakfast with a few cabins arrayed around a gravel parking lot. Karen and Peter, originally from Chicago, own the place. They, being garrulous and good-natured folks, befriended Popcorn, and he eventually became a mascot for the B&B. They bought one of his Model A's and dropped it in the yard, where it sits with a copper still bolted onto the back and some stickers, one of which reads DON'T LET THE TRUTH GET IN THE WAY OF A GOOD STORY.It was here that I lurked and waited for Popcorn, and things got strange.""Oh, I wish you'd called ahead,"" said Karen, ""but it's okay, he's coming here today, anyway. Do you have his cell phone number?""When the local news did a segment on him, the whole thing was framed by the idea that Maggie Valley is a beautiful place where people can see life ""the way it used to be."" The local news writers held that the more folks wanted to see the old ways, the more they crowded them out. The old culture died. What's left of the old ways, they claimed, throbs in Popcorn's breast. This sort of thing suits Popcorn fine; it's exactly the line he sells about himself.I hadn't begun by looking for inconsistencies, but once I started paying attention — once, in other words, someone offered up a self-proclaimed mountain man's cell phone number — they began to leap out at me like mice from a kitchen drawer.I went back and watched the clip of that local news report again. The camera is on Popcorn in his cabin, ostensibly a mountain shack, heated by just a woodstove. He says, ""I can cook right here on top of it just as good as you can on an electric stove, downtown."" In the left margin of the screen there is an electric stove.That's not fair — perhaps it's gas.Karen told me that Popcorn was not well, he'd fallen off of his front porch and hurt his back. He was seeing a chiropractor, and that was making it worse. ""He's taking codeine,"" she said, ""but maybe he'll want to meet you.""I gave Karen $35 for Popcorn's DVD, mendaciously and manipulatively titled This Is the Last Dam Run of Likker I'll Ever Make, and put it on back in my cabin.The documentary is fun: Popcorn drives around in his old Ford, looks for a good spot, and rambles on about himself.Popcorn finds a stream with good water and shows the camera some ""water weeds,"" which he claims prove the water will make good liquor. He's 10 yards ahead of the camera, and he climbs over a rock or two to come back toward the cameraman. He bitches about how hard of a job it is. It's rough stuff, in rough country, and he's old and tired.The camera follows him as he walks, and we see that the car is on the side of the road, which is maybe 10 yards away — quite a hike.I wandered back up to the house, fed the ducks, and drank a beer with my hosts until a gold Toyota pulled down the driveway. It was Popcorn. He was too tired to talk, in too much pain, and too foggy from the codeine.That was the end of me and Popcorn, but it wasn't the end of Popcorn's story. After the fire at his home led to being busted, he proceeded to sell moonshine to a federal undercover agent, who ramped him up until they were dealing in volume. Popcorn sold him 300 gallons, and promised him another 500. The feds raided him, and found ""three large stills with capacities up to 1,000 gallons, over 850 gallons of moonshine, and hundreds of gallons of mash, materials and ingredients used to manufacture moonshine, and firearms and ammunition."" He pled guilty, and received his sentence on January 26, 2009. He got eighteen months in the federal penitentiary.On March 16, a few days before he was to report to prison, Popcorn hooked a pipe up from the exhaust of his Ford Fairlane — his three-jug car, he called it, because he'd traded three jugs of liquor for it — and asphyxiated himself.'"
"'10-03-07,'0','For the most part, quiet still reigns along the cobblestone streets, save for trucks from the massive plant on the waterfront or from the Damascus Bakery, which episodically infuses the area with the singular aroma of baking pita. These are reminders that industry still has a presence, as it did back when the neighborhood was a bedroom community for workers at the Navy Yard next door and in Dumbo’s factories and warehouses.Of all the issues raised by the waterfront area’s increasing popularity, it is the truck traffic that takes precedence — especially its effects on the cobblestones, said Robert Perris, the district manager of the local Community Board 2. “It shows how much people are invested in the architectural character of the neighborhood,” he said, “as well as how sort of sleepy it is.”In the last year or so, the Vinegar Hill House on Hudson Avenue, a restaurant that opened in late 2008, has focused a spotlight on the neighborhood. The last place to eat on the street was a diner that closed in the 1970s, Mr. Evans-Cato said. The restaurant’s fare is creative and seasonal — right now, braised wild boar shank and ravioli are on offer — and the owners, Sam Buffa and Jean Adamson, are both locals. In addition to approving critics, the place has garnered its share of regulars, happy for a nearby place to dine well.“We figured that we would be busy enough, but we didn’t expect this,” said Mr. Buffa, who also lives above his business, having vacated a carriage house on the property to make room for storage and office space. “We get people who drive from the Upper West Side. I can’t tell you how many times people just had no clue this was here.”The neighborhood was named not for any unusual wellspring of vinegar but for a 1798 battle of the Irish Rebellion (one historical theory has it that the name was chosen to attract Irish immigrants). It takes up all of 9 or 10 blocks, and residents most likely number no more than a few hundred.They have something of a love-hate relationship with their neighbors in Dumbo, appreciating the many services and stores now ensconced next door, but disturbed by increasing traffic, by the shadows of new condo towers and, it must be said, by unwelcome evidence that Dumboites are walking their dogs in Vinegar Hill.“As Dumbo changes, we change,” said Mr. Meshberg, the neighborhood association head. “The more people moving into Dumbo, the more parking gets screwed up over here.”Hudson Avenue is the area’s focal point, even with just the one public establishment in the Vinegar Hill House. The road is lined with pre-Civil War row houses. Around the corner on Evans Street, visitors encounter an even older structure: the Commandant’s Mansion, an 1806 estate overlooking the East River from behind an imposing gate. (It remains inhabited today, actually, though not by a commandant.)Moving west from Hudson Avenue toward Dumbo, sturdy-looking old town houses, with fine examples on both Gold and Front Streets, are interspersed with the occasional warehouse or factory. Vinegar Hill’s new market-rate condo developments include one at 100 Gold Street, next door to the Dorje Ling Buddhist Center, with its bright yellow facade. And on York Street, across from the towers of a public project called the Farragut Houses, further housing construction is in its early stages.Vinegar Hill may soon have stores to call its own, as the city is seeking a developer for a retail complex in the Navy Yard. The businesses would take the place of Admiral’s Row, a much-loved but decrepit group of row houses; many preservation groups have cried foul.Buyers expecting Dumbo-like prices may be pleasantly surprised; values generally soften as one heads east from the Manhattan Bridge and south toward the Farragut Houses. A $445,000 studio in Vinegar Hill, for example, might go for $550,000 at the J Condominium a few blocks away in Dumbo, said M. Monica Novo, a senior vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman.Prices have come down since 2006 and 2007, but percentages are hard to calculate because of the low inventory of properties. Town houses don’t often come on the market, but when they do they are significantly more affordable than comparable properties in nearby Brooklyn Heights or Fort Greene. Often, they also need work; prices start at about $1.1 million but can reach $2 million for a house in pristine shape, according to Steven Gerber, a senior vice president at the Corcoran Group.“It’s not going to be a Brooklyn Heights number” in price, Mr. Gerber said, “but if it does have a view and it’s nicely done on the inside, that’s not uncommon.”In terms of new and conversion properties that have sprung up, prices per square foot are staying in the $600 and $700 range, according to David Behin, a partner at the Developers Group. At 100 Gold Street, a 10-unit development, three units are now in contract, and prices for studios, one- and two-bedrooms range from $445,000 to $885,000.Renters can opt for market-rate buildings like 99 Gold Street, where the Core Group Marketing is listing units from studios to two-bedrooms for $2,650 to $4,900 a month. Older units in town houses are seldom available. When they are, said Mr. Evans-Cato, a longtime renter, one-bedroom units start between $1,000 and $1,500.Vinegar Hill is home to one school, Public School 307 on York Street. In 2009, 61.2 percent of third, fourth and fifth graders met standards in English, 78.3 percent in mathematics.Junior high students can be zoned for the Dr. Susan S. McKinney Secondary School of the Arts, on Park Avenue in the upper part of Fort Greene near the Navy Yard. In 2009, 62.9 percent of students met standards in math, 54.4 percent in English.One high school nearby is the Freedom Academy, on Nassau Street close to the Manhattan Bridge, where SAT averages last year were 413 in reading, 388 in math and 408 in writing, versus 480, 500 and 470 statewide.WHAT TO DOOutside of warm evenings at the Vinegar Hill House and community meetings of the neighborhood group, the neighborhood seems almost purposefully quiet. But busier areas aren’t far away. Dumbo, Brooklyn Heights and Fort Greene all offer plenty of shopping and dining. The growing green spaces of Brooklyn Bridge Park are nearby, and a stroll across one of the bridges is always an option.Most residences in the neighborhood are no more than a 10-minute walk from the York Street subway station, the first stop into Brooklyn on the F line. The trip to Midtown takes 15 to 20 minutes.Part of the original Dutch town of Breuckelen, Vinegar Hill was farmland until its purchase in 1784 by the Sands brothers, merchants and traders for whom a local street is named. They called the area Olympia, hoping to attract summer visitors from ; it was later known as part of Irishtown. The present name wasn’t in the picture until the land was bought by John Jackson, a shipbuilder, who sold part of it to the federal government for use as a navy yard. Vinegar Hill soon grew into a small village of laborers and those who catered to them. (In 1822, nearly a quarter of all residents listed their occupations as tavern proprietors.)'"
"'10-03-07,'0','Mr. McDonagh began with the image of a man shooting a gun into a closet, where the audience could hear the sound of someone struggling inside: Gun? Check. Explosion? Check. Blood? Probably. Following this gambit is a series of familiar McDonagh elements: airborne body parts, unexpectedly sensitive killers and a propulsive, outlandish plot. And once he finished a draft, he realized that he couldn’t just stick it in a drawer. “I was going to do a Salinger and disappear,” he said. “Then I thought, I want to have some fun.”Sitting in the theater district restaurant Angus McIndoe, Mr. McDonagh appeared boyishly handsome with a can’t-help-myself grin that accompanies the most recklessly candid sense of humor to be found in a Broadway playwright. After a few drinks he mused merrily about what would happen if the elderly woman sitting at a nearby table pulled out a firearm and started shooting. If this reporter was killed, he said, he would volunteer to finish the article. “He was having fun when his face got shot off” is how his tribute would go.As for dying, the worst way, he said with the sureness of a man who had given the question serious consideration, is to be tortured to death. The best? Eaten by a lion. Wouldn’t that actually involve terrible pain and suffering? “Sure, at the time,” he said matter-of-factly. “Fifty years down the line it would be amazing, especially for a playwright. They would always remember you.”Mr. McDonagh said that working in film had made him more ruthless in editing (“A Behanding” is 90 minutes) and increasingly determined to show, not tell. “There’s nothing that you can’t show onstage,” he said.“Movies do that, they tell you,” he added, shaking his head. “Why can’t you do that? Just stop being so lazy. What century is this?”He is also dreaming of America more than ever, in his work and life. He has little positive to say about his home city, London, which he calls “the rudest place.” As for its theater scene, putting it in the context of soccer, he compares the British stage to “Greek second division.” In his formulation, New York is the World Cup.That sound you hear is teacups crashing. Mr. McDonagh plans to move to New York and hopes to develop a partnership with the Atlantic Theater Company, where “Behanding” was originally going to be produced.“I could knock a play out for them every year and have a slot in the season” he said, adding that some of them would be good, others wouldn’t. Flashing his devilish smile, he said, “I should probably tell them this first.”The Atlantic’s artistic director, Neil Pepe, sounded open to the idea. “If he can knock them out,” he wrote in an e-mail message, “I’ll put them on.”Not only is “Behanding” Mr. McDonagh’s first world premiere in New York, it’s also his first play set in the United States. He has always had a complicated relationship with his cultural identity. His previous plays portray a brutal, utterly unromantic small-town Ireland, and while he is considered one of the most important living Irish playwrights, he was actually born in London and has lived there his entire life.In an interview four years ago Conor McPherson, a Dublin writer of similar stature, questioned how Irish he really was. “More like stage Irish,” he told me.Mr. McDonagh responded to this comment with a flash of anger, disregarding a pledge he had made minutes before to give up harshly judging other living writers in the press, firing off one of those hilariously belligerent rants that his characters are known for and that can’t possibly be printed here. Translated from the profane to the mundane, he said he was going to beat up Mr. McPherson next time he saw him.“That’s on the record,” he said, pointing at my recorder. “Seriously, that’s a ludicrous thing to say. Dublin people think they are the center of the world and the center of Ireland. And they don’t realize that people have to leave Ireland to get work, and they look down on people who do. It strikes me as an odd thing — that someone who grew up in one town thinks they know everything about a nation and a diaspora.”Then that sly smile returned as he realized that he had just started a public spat with a Tony Award-winning playwright. Mr. McDonagh paused, looked down at his drink and tried again: “I quietly take issue with him.”'"
"'10-03-07,'0','As we prowled around this Flintstones-like world, my photographer colleague wandered off alone. Suddenly I heard a burst of agitated voices, followed by the sight of the photographer, his three cameras dangling from his neck, racing down an alley with a half-dozen Dogon men close behind. He had ventured into a temple used for animal sacrifice, and his presence, as the Dogons saw it, had grievously polluted the site. Only the slaughter of three goats and a prayer by the hogon, or head priest, could purify the temple. After a tense negotiation, we handed over $50 — to pay for the goats — and fled, putting a premature end to our visit.Almost 15 years later, I found myself back in Mali, and scheduled a four-day trek in Dogon country with David. We would spend our days hiking on trails that wound through Dogon cliffside villages, and spend our nights in rudimentary lodges set up for a growing number of Western tourists. After driving in a Toyota four-by-four for eight hours through the eastern desert from the Niger border town of Gao, we came abruptly upon a series of sandstone mesas towering over the plain — a landscape reminiscent, in its stark beauty, of Utah’s Monument Valley.The first night, we lodged at the base of the village of Yendouma, staying in what passed for a Dogon hotel: five windowless, dirt-floored chambers with sand-filled mattresses and a single 40-watt bulb powered by a solar panel. Yendouma followed the general design of all the cliffside villages in the region — a jumble of houses and granaries, flat clay roofs side by side with cone-shaped roofs of straw. At the top of the village were the Tellem caves that served as burial places. “Picking one’s way along narrow streets of light and shade, between the truncated pyramids, prisms, cones or cylinders of the granaries and houses,” Griaule wrote, “one felt like a dwarf lost in a maze.”Inside the maze, every structure, every scratching on a wall, was replete with symbolism. At the center of the village stood the dwelling of the hogon, who is believed to be able to bring rain and good fortune. A two-story mud palace perforated with a dozen apertures, each the length and width of a person, the structure looked like a giant toaster lying on its side. The openings, David explained, are for the spirits of village ancestors so that they can go in and out with ease; the authentic ostrich eggs mounted atop the turrets represent the life force conferred by the creator god, Amma.Even more intriguing, I found, were the Dogons’ ubiquitous granaries — windowless storage bins topped by witch’s-hat roofs: the interiors are divided into eight tiny cubicles, each one representing a different organ of the human body, and the interior and outer walls symbolize the human skeleton. The force of death, too, is never far from sight in the Dogon world, where health clinics are few and far between and most sick people rely on the monkey paws, beads and other talismans of the village medicine man. We saw the widow’s house, a crude hut built on the village outskirts where a widow must dwell, with her sisters, for three weeks after her husband’s death; and a smoothened boulder, where the departed soul is given offerings for a year after death — the one we saw was sprinkled with millet flakes.The following day, David and I set off from Yendouma. We began a long climb to the top of the escarpment, arriving at last at a monolithic sandstone plateau offering panoramic views of the acacia-speckled emptiness of the Sahel. David led me down a series of log ladders deep into one crevice, where the daylight barely penetrated. We squeezed through the chasm in a twilight for several minutes, and when we emerged, we found ourselves at the top of another village, this one called Youga Dogouru.This was one of the Dogon tribe’s most sacred villages — the site of a festival in honor of one of the main gods of the Dogon pantheon that takes place once every 60 years. At the top of the village a huge sandstone overhang loomed; beneath it was a series of abandoned, ancient cliff dwellings — more remnants of the Tellem culture — that looked uncannily like those of the Anasazi of New Mexico.Traveling with David reminded me of just how leisurely the pace of life in rural Africa can be. David had just returned from three months outside the region, and so every encounter — with a blind man who negotiated his way down the cliffside footpath with ease, with a migrant Dogon worker who had just returned from three years in Ghana — required a ritualistic greeting that went on for many minutes. Translated, it went something like this: “How are you?” “Good.” “How’s the family?” “Good.” “How’s the village?” “Good.” “How’s the journey?” “Good.” “How’s the work?” “Good.” Eventually the speakers exchanged roles, and the entire exchange would be repeated. A satisfied “aaahhh” from each side signaled that the conversation was over. At first impatient, I eventually came to savor these elaborate exchanges as a mark of civility.For all its timeless serenity, Dogon country is hardly a paradise. Poverty is pervasive, health care nearly nonexistent, illiteracy rampant. In recent years, David said, the influx of foreigners and news from the outside world has spread discontent — and stirred a political consciousness. “They want better health care, potable water and schools,” he told me over a lunch of couscous and goat stew at a makeshift cliffside restaurant. “Only one of every three villages has a school.”Our final stop before heading back to Bamako, the Mali capital, was the village of Amani at the base of the cliffs, famed for its crocodiles that dwell in a green, brackish pond — the residue of an ancient lake. Dogon priests make daily offerings here: live chickens, slabs of beef, sometimes even a goat. When we arrived, dozens of reptiles lay dozing on a sandbank, which was surrounded by a flimsy wooden fence. Cows grazed dangerously close by.Moments later, five Dogon boys ran toward the sleeping reptiles, sending them into the water with a huge clattering of scales and tails and a giant splash — and earning a reprimand from a village priest. The reptiles were sacred, David explained, and must be treated with respect. “The people here feel protected by their crocodiles,” he added.In this harsh environment, the rituals and talismans of daily life seem to offer the Dogons a measure of solace and certainty.'"

"'10-03-08,'0','The department enforces civil rights laws in schools and universities by responding to specific complaints from parents, students and others, but also by scrutinizing its own vast bodies of data on the nation’s school and university systems, looking for signs of possible discrimination. A school seen to be expelling Latino students in numbers far out of proportion to their share of the student population, for instance, might become a candidate for compliance review, officials said.As it seeks to combat discrimination in schools and universities more aggressively, the administration will be acting in an area in which some Supreme Court rulings in recent years have brought more ambiguity. Federal policy for decades had aimed at compelling school districts to end racial inequality, for instance.But in examining longstanding desegregation efforts in the Seattle and Jefferson County, Ky., schools in 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that school authorities could not seek to achieve or maintain integration through measures that take explicit account of a student’s race, a decision that seemed to reverse the thrust of four decades of federal policy.Some civil rights advocates said they had hoped the administration would move more quickly last year to ramp up the activity of the Office for Civil Rights, the department’s second-largest, with 600 employees.“This whole area has been a dead zone for years, and people were worried that new actions were too slow in coming,” said William L. Taylor, chairman of the Citizens’ Commission on Civil Rights, a Washington group that monitors federal policy and practices. “There had been strong hopes that they would move more quickly. This sounds like positive movement, which we’ve all been asking for.”Russlyn H. Ali, assistant secretary of education for civil rights, said in an interview that the department would begin 38 compliance reviews before the current fiscal year ended on Oct. 1. That number compares with 29 such reviews carried out last year, 42 in 2008, 23 in 2007 and nine in 2006, she said.“But the big difference is not in the number of the reviews we intend to carry out, but in their complexity and depth,” Ms. Ali said. “Most of the reviews in the recent past have looked at procedures.”In cases analyzing potential sex discrimination, for instance, federal investigators would often check to see if schools and universities had grievance procedures in place, and if so, take no enforcement action, she said.“Now we’ll not simply see whether there is a program in place, but also examine whether that program is working effectively,” she said.The department plans to begin a major investigation on Wednesday in one of the nation’s largest urban school districts, Ms. Ali said. She declined to identify it because, she said, department officials were still notifying Congress and others of the plans.The compliance reviews typically involve visits to the school district or university by federal officials based in one or more of the department’s 12 regional offices.The department intends to send letters offering guidance to virtually all of the nation’s 15,000 school districts and several thousand institutions of post-secondary education, officials said.The letters will focus on 17 areas of civil rights concern, including possible racial discrimination in student assignments and admissions, in the meting out of discipline, and in access to resources, including qualified teachers. Other areas include possible sex and gender bias in athletics programs, as well as sexual harassment and violence. Other letters will remind districts and colleges of their responsibilities under federal law with regard to disabled students.'"
"'10-03-08,'0','The Davis Cup run for the United States is over in the first round.Novak Djokovic withstood 24 aces and outlasted John Isner, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-4, on Sunday in Belgrade, Serbia, giving the Serbs an insurmountable 3-1 lead against an American team looking for its 33rd Davis Cup title. In the second reverse singles, Sam Querrey beat Viktor Troicki, 7-5, 6-2, to make the final score 3-2.It was the first time since 2005 the Americans were eliminated in the first round. Serbia, which advanced in the World Group for the first time, will next play its bitter Balkan rival Croatia in the quarterfinals in July.Djokovic, ranked No. 2, needed 4 hours 16 minutes to outlast the 20th-ranked Isner, who was making his Davis Cup debut. The United States played without both Andy Roddick and James Blake for the first time since 2000.Struggling to contain Isner’s booming serve, Djokovic smashed his racket in the second set and drew a ball violation penalty in the fourth-set tie breaker. Djokovic then wasted three match points while leading, 5-3, in the fifth set before converting his sixth match point when Isner netted a forehand.“I knew I had to play my best tennis to have a chance against Djokovic,” Isner said. “He returns the serve real well, and my hat is off to him for the victory.”ARGENTINA PREVAILS David Nalbandian sent Argentina into the Davis Cup quarterfinals by defeating Sweden’s Andreas Vinciguerra, 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, in Stockholm for a 3-2 series victory.

"'10-03-08,'0','EVERYONE knows that an easy way to save money on medicines is to buy generics rather than brand-name drugs. Makers of generics estimate that over the past decade they have saved the American health care system about $734 billion. Yet, we continue to spend more on drugs — in part because of the increasing use of so-called biologic medicines, which cost, on average, 22 times as much as ordinary drugs. In 2008, 28 percent of sales from the pharmaceutical industry’s top 100 products came from biologics; by 2014, that share is expected to rise to 50 percent.Biologic drugs can be more expensive to manufacture; they are grown inside living cells rather than put together chemically, as conventional drugs are. But this does not fully account for their high prices. Another important factor is that they very rarely face competition from generic copies.Congress has an opportunity to change this by including in health care reform incentives for generic drug makers to compete in the biologics marketplace. But unfortunately, both the House and the Senate versions of health care reform contain provisions that would discourage the development and significantly delay the approval of generic biologics.The proposals before Congress would protect biologic medicines for 12 years after their approval by the Food and Drug Administration — that would be seven more years of market exclusivity than conventional drugs have. This extra protection for biologics would add billions of dollars to future health care costs.Biologics, which include not only medicines like the breast cancer drug Herceptin and the arthritis drug Humira but also vaccines like the one that prevents HPV and cervical cancer, account for one in four new products approved by the F.D.A. For all their promise, biologics impose a heavy financial burden. A breast cancer patient’s annual cost for Herceptin is $37,000. People with rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn’s disease spend $50,000 a year on Humira. And those who take Cerezyme to treat Gaucher disease, a rare inherited enzyme deficiency, spend a staggering $200,000 a year.'"
"'10-03-08,'0','A hugely cynical Republican Party memo on the care and feeding of big donors disdains them as “ego-driven” check writers who can be bought by access to power and vanity tchotchkes. The memo, obtained by Politico.com, is exceptional for its candor about the crassness of the multibillion-dollar politicking industry.That industry is on the verge of a great leap forward in this year’s Congressional elections, thanks to the Supreme Court ruling that freed corporate executives and union bosses to spend whatever they want on their own commercials touting candidates who toe their lines or, more likely, attacking those who don’t.Congress must quickly pass the remedial Schumer-Van Hollen bill to rein in at least some of the damage. It would ban expenditures by government contractors and foreign-controlled companies and require public disclosure of the money and business interests behind corporate and union ads. Congress must also revive public financing as a feasible alternative to big-money federal elections. President Obama reversed his promise and rejected public financing in 2008, arguing that the public subsidy lagged far behind modern campaign budgets. But he also vowed to repair and update the system once he made it to the White House. We’re waiting.On Capitol Hill, where quid pro quo is the name of the game, the public option is just as needed. Senator Richard Durbin has introduced a measure to extend a federal four-to-one match to qualifying Congressional candidates who pledge to only accept donations of $100 or less and abide by spending limits and transparency rules.Now, 80 percent of donations in Congressional campaigns come from 1 percent of the population, according to the nonprofit group Americans for Campaign Reform.Senator Scott Brown, the Republican newly arrived from Massachusetts, promised to study Mr. Durbin’s bill. “There’s a way that we can work to get big money and corporations out of politics and, obviously, adhere to the Constitution as well,” said Senator Brown. This was an extraordinary observation from a politician whose campaign was buoyed by $14 million in last-minute donations, mostly from out of state. We hope he meant it.'"
"'10-03-08,'0','The N.F.L.’s plunge into the great unknown of a season without a salary cap yielded some unexpected results in the first three days of free agency — anybody heard from Jerry Jones lately? — but also some of the big deals that assured us that even the drive to save money for a lockout could not entirely snuff out the blood lust for victory.CHICAGO BEARS Their desperation is on full parade. With the window closing on an aging defense — and on Coach Lovie Smith and General Manager Jerry Angelo — the Bears pried open the McCaskey wallets and made agents happy. The Bears were the only team to lavish huge contracts on more than one free agent, landing the biggest one of all, the pass rusher Julius Peppers, and taking running back Chester Taylor, too. The Bears made the N.F.C. North a lot more interesting — Peppers gave the Minnesota Vikings such fits last year that Coach Brad Childress famously tried, and failed, to bench Brett Favre — and that was without filling their greatest need: offensive linemen.WASHINGTON REDSKINS Who are these people, and what have they done with Daniel Snyder? Free agency may be a little duller now that the Redskins are going the sensible route, but at least their few moves make sense. Their greatest need is on the offensive line, so the Redskins allowed the big-ticket Peppers/Karlos Dansby parade to pass them by and signed an offensive lineman first, the versatile Artis Hicks (they missed out on Tony Pashos, who had visited but signed with Cleveland on Sunday). Who knows how long this temperance will last, but here is something for Redskins fans to cling to: it took the Patriots’ Robert K. Kraft a few years to get the hang of ownership.AARON KAMPMAN Not only did Kampman, coming off a torn knee ligament, score a new contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars, but he will not have to play out of position in the Green Bay Packers’ 3-4 defense anymore. Hello, 4-3 and a happier pass rusher.JOE FLACCO Finally — finally! — the Baltimore Ravens have a premier receiver after Ozzie Newsome pulled off a deal for the former Arizona Cardinal Anquan Boldin. Newsome gave up third- and fourth-round picks, so he can still use his high-rounders to get another receiver or a pass-catching tight end early in the draft. The balance of power in the A.F.C. may have just shifted.'"
"'10-03-08,'0','ITVS is best known for its financing of documentaries, many of which appear on PBS’s “Independent Lens” series. But beginning on Monday, the organization will present a series of brief, fictional films that cast social issues into the future, in the hopes of drawing a younger audience not necessarily interested in public television.The new films, 11 in all, will appear first on the Web, and later move to broadcast. Their subjects will be familiar to those who watch ITVS-financed documentaries: climate change, immigration and exploitation of the poor, among other social issues. Under the series title “Futurestates,” the films will give fictional treatments to the same kinds of subjects, some with a science-fiction twist, exploring how those issues can play out in the future.The films, which run about 15 minutes each, are meant to attract a diverse audience of so-called millennials, young adults in their 20s and 30s, as well as filmmakers in that demographic group, said Sally Jo Fifer, the president and chief executive of ITVS. Fiction is “what they’re working in,” said Ms. Fifer, and online is where to reach them, ITVS executives said. “We wanted to get that demographic in the public media family,” Ms. Fifer added.Congress created ITVS, which stands for the Independent Television Service, in 1991 to support independent voices in the media landscape, and finances it through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. ITVS has supported a handful of nondocumentary films in the past, but has largely found the cost of feature-length work prohibitive.Moreover, PBS broadcasts little fictional programming with the exception of “Masterpiece Theater,” said Matthew Meschery, ITVS’s director of digital initiatives. “There’s very little, if any, distribution opportunity for narrative films on broadcast for public television,” he said.The Corporation for Public Broadcasting paid the $522,000 in development and production costs of “Futurestates,” which can be seen starting on Monday at futurestates.tv. In about a month, after a screening at the South by Southwest festival, the films will be available on PBS.org. ITVS is exploring distribution via mobile devices and other online outlets as well, Mr. Meschery said, in addition to their eventual broadcast.'"
"'10-03-08,'0','At a time when some colleges are favoring applicants who do not require financial aid, Hamilton College in upstate New York has decided to swim against that tide.Hamilton, a small liberal arts college in Clinton, N.Y., is announcing that it is adopting a need-blind admissions policy. In doing so, it joins a handful of other colleges and universities — including those of the Ivy League — that pledge to consider applicants regardless of their ability to pay.“It might be a little risky right now,” Monica Inzer, the dean of admission and financial aid of Hamilton, said in an interview. “It’s not always easy to do the right thing.”In rescinding a “need-aware” or “need-sensitive” admissions policy — previously some students were admitted partly because they required no financial aid, and others were rejected because they did — Hamilton expects over the next four years to add about $2 million to its annual financial aid budget, which is about $24.6 million this year.Initially, that additional expense will be borne by six trustees, who have each pledged $500,000 to seed the need-blind effort. The first students to be admitted under the new policy will be this fall’s freshman class. Soon, Ms. Inzer said, the college expects to embark on a capital campaign to raise $40 million as a permanent endowment for need-blind admissions.'"
"'10-03-08,'0','The open-carry movement is a wild card in gun rights advocacy and in some ways is to the N.R.A. and other mainstream gun rights advocacy groups what the Tea Party movement is to the Republican Party.Newer, more driven by grass-roots and the Internet than the N.R.A., open-carry groups are also less centralized, less predictable and often more confrontational in their push for gun rights. In the last year, there have been at least 140 formal and informal meet-ups at coffee shops and restaurants in California alone, organizers say.Some gun rights advocates see risks in the approach.“I’m all for open-carry laws,” said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun rights advocacy organization in Washington State. “But I don’t think flaunting it is very productive for our cause. It just scares people.”Robert Weisberg, a gun law expert and a criminal justice professor at Stanford University, described the open-carry activists as “a liability” for the N.R.A., in particular.While the N.R.A. is almost always going to support the increased deregulation of guns, Professor Weisberg said, the organization keeps its distance from open-carry advocacy because it does not want to distract attention from its higher priority of promoting the right to carry concealed weapons.“Add to this that the N.R.A. is a very disciplined, on-message organization,” he said, contrasting the N.R.A.’s approach with the free-wheeling nature of some open-carry advocates.Asked to comment on the open-carry movement, Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., said the organization “supports the right of law abiding people to exercise their self-defense rights in accordance with state local and federal law.” He declined to comment further.Gun control advocates have raised particular concerns about open-carry laws because under these laws in many states, gun owners are not required to have a permit or any sort of training or testing.The first meet-ups by open-carry advocates started nearly a decade ago in Virginia, but they became popular more recently in California because the law there makes it difficult for people to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon.“It is a discriminatory issue in California,” said Paul Higgins, 43, a software engineer who runs a Web forum called CaliforniaOpenCarry.org. “If you are politically connected, if you’re rich, if you’re a politician, if you’re a celebrity, you get a permit. Otherwise, you don’t.”Mr. Higgins said the meet-ups were not meant to be confrontational. The hope, he said, is that if other restaurant or cafe patrons are uncomfortable with guns being displayed so conspicuously, pressure will increase on lawmakers to consider changing the law so that weapons can be carried more discreetly.Mr. Stollenwerk, the co-founder of OpenCarry.org., who is a retired Army officer from Fairfax County, Va., said the meet-ups were also meant as chances for gun owners to exercise and advertise their rights in states that allow people to openly carry firearms. More than 27,000 members are registered for his group’s online discussion forum, he said.Gun control advocates say the open-carry movement’s real aim is to push the envelope and to force companies to take a public stand on the issue.”You have to wonder where their next frontier will be,” said Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “Will gun owners start trying to carry firearms openly into banks, on subways and buses, in schools?”For Starbucks, the debate has become a headache.After California gun owners began holding meet-ups in January at Starbucks, the Brady Campaign began sending out petitions to pressure the company to forbid weapons. Starbucks released a statement saying it would not turn gun carriers away from its cafes, and would instead continue to comply with local laws and statutes.“The political, policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts, not in our stores,” Starbuck officials said. They said the company did not want to be in the middle of the controversy.Other businesses have taken a different tack — and are embracing the movement.The East Coast Pizza Bar and Grill in Walnut Creek, Calif., about 25 miles east of San Francisco, invited gun owners to host open carry meet-ups. At least 70 people attended one last Sunday, many carrying firearms, said the owner, Jessie Grunner, 30. And over a dozen returned on Thursday night for more.“Frankly, I wasn’t sure how I would feel in that type of situation, and it really turned out to be a total nonissue,” Ms. Grunner said.“The families were great,” she said. “These were very gracious people.” The fact that customers wore sidearms, she said, “just faded into the background.”'"
"'10-03-08,'0','BELGRADE, Serbia (Agence France-Presse) — Mihajlo Mihajlov, a prominent dissident in the former Yugoslavia who was jailed for seven years during the cold war era, died in Belgrade on Sunday, the Beta news agency reported.He was 76, and the cause of death was not given.Born in a family of Russian emigrants in 1934, Mr. Mihajlov was a professor of Russian literature at the University of Zagreb campus at the coastal town of Zadar, now in Croatia, in the early 1960s.He was sentenced by the government of the Communist strongman Josip Broz Tito to three and a half years’ imprisonment in 1966 for “damaging the reputation of a foreign state” after publishing an essay on camps for dissidents in the Soviet Union after the 1917 October revolution.In 1975 he was tried again for “disseminating hostile propaganda” about Tito’s government in essays and articles published in the Yugoslav and Western press, and was sentenced to seven years in prison.Mr. Mihajlov was released early in 1978 and allowed to leave the country.Afterward, he resided in the United States and until 1985 taught Russian literature and philosophy courses at Yale, Ohio State University and the University of Virginia, as well as in Western Europe.Mr. Mihajlov also worked as an analyst at the American-financed Radio Free Europe before returning to Serbia in 2001, after the ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic.A number of his books were translated worldwide, notably “Russian Themes,” “Underground Notes,” “The Homeland Is Freedom” and “Moscow Summer.”'"
"'10-03-08,'0','After reaching the N.C.A.A. tournament twice and the National Invitation Tournament once in five years under Orr, Seton Hall will probably make its first N.I.T. appearance in four years under Gonzalez. The Pirates enter the Big East Conference tournament this week as the 10th seed and one of the most intriguing teams.Much of that is because Gonzalez has emerged as one of the most divisive and volatile characters in the conference. Gonzalez, 46, is the only coach in the conference’s history to be suspended for sideline misbehavior and for criticizing officials. He has openly sparred with rival Big East coaches. Despite his frequent blow-ups, the university extended his contract through 2015.“Seton Hall made a bad decision,” Jhony Garcia said after Gonzalez attributed a recent Senior Night loss partly to the two minutes his son, John Garcia, played.Gonzalez’s combativeness extends to his relations with the news media. Few journalists who report on Seton Hall have been spared Gonzalez’s tirades. His sister, Linda Gonzalez, and Richard J. Codey, the president of the New Jersey Senate, frequently make calls to complain about negative coverage.“He has a tremendous skill for being able to alienate himself from everyone,” said Emanuel Richardson, an assistant at the University of Arizona who has known Gonzalez since his days as a high school assistant 20 years ago. “He uses that as a mechanism to act the way he does. It’s his gift and curse. When I’d recruit against him he’d tell me, ‘You’re a shark, but I’m a great white.’ ”At Seton Hall, a small Catholic university that recently cut its track and field programs, men’s basketball is the athletic department’s flagship. Although Gonzalez’s teams have improved each season while playing in perhaps the nation’s toughest conference, the program has not evolved as administrators envisioned. When Seton Hall fired Orr, it cited his struggles in recruiting and running a program. Gonzalez has built his team around high-risk, second-chance transfers.Keon Lawrence, a junior guard who transferred from Missouri, was arrested by the New Jersey State Police before he played his first game for Seton Hall. He drove the wrong way on the Garden State Parkway and caused a two-car accident Nov. 9. Lawrence was charged with assault by auto (which involves causing serious bodily injury while operating a vehicle under the influence) and driving with a suspended license. Gonzalez suspended Lawrence for more than a month. Athletic Director Joe Quinlan declined to go into further detail because Lawrence’s case is pending.“I’m not trying to be like Coach Tarkanian at U.N.L.V. and taking in all the runaway kids,” Gonzalez said, referring to the former coach Jerry Tarkanian. “And I’m not saying they can’t screw up tomorrow. But they’ve been good people here. Hopefully counseling has cooled Keon’s butt down. Drinking and driving is like a cardinal sin.”Forward Herb Pope, a transfer from New Mexico State who leads the Pirates in rebounding, was also arrested for driving under the influence and under-age drinking two years ago.None of the three players who have committed to play for Seton Hall next season have qualified academically, continuing a pattern of questionable recruiting.Gonzalez has brought top local players to campus to raise the program’s profile. In March 2008, a period when coaches could not have in-person contact with prospects, he was seen ushering the former St. Anthony High star Dominic Cheek of Jersey City, a McDonald’s all-American now playing at Villanova, into his office during an Adidas-sponsored workout on campus. Gonzalez has repeatedly denied he did anything wrong, but he was seen with his arm around Cheek that day. “He just told me I had the key to Jersey City,” Cheek said after the meeting.Gonzalez nearly had a fistfight with his former assistant Steve Masiello, who is now at Louisville, during a visit to St. Benedict’s Prep in Newark. Their altercation was caught on a security camera.“I’m not entirely proud of that,” said Gonzalez, who describes himself as a workaholic but does much of his recruiting over the phone.“If Bobby gets you on the phone, you can look down at your wristwatch and know that the next hour is gone,” said Bob Hurley, the coach at St. Anthony High School in Jersey City, who has known Gonzalez more than 20 years. “It’s almost all monologue. He never comes up for air, and I try to get a word in, but it’s no use.”At Paterson Catholic, a favorite to win a state title this season, Gonzalez has cultivated a relationship with Coach Damon Wright and landed two of his players. Although Gonzalez has rarely been to the Paterson Catholic gym, Wright said that Jordan Theodore, now a Seton Hall sophomore, and Fuquan Edwin, a star senior at Paterson Catholic, were familiar with Gonzalez’s style and personality.“Bobby has yet to show me the craziness, but Jordan’s told me all about it,” said Edwin, one of the prospects who has not yet fulfilled the academic qualifications to play in college.Gonzalez, who grew up in Binghamton, N.Y., was a point guard in high school and then at Buffalo State.“He got to give the orders as point guard, and I think he really liked that,” said Tom Corgel, Gonzalez’s high school coach in Binghamton.While a counselor at a Syracuse University summer camp in the late 1980s, Gonzalez met Orange Coach Jim Boeheim, who eventually helped land him a job as the junior varsity coach at St. Nicholas of Tolentine High School in the Bronx.“Bobby didn’t know his way out of a brown paper bag when he got here, but he learned,” said Bob Mackey, then the varsity coach at Tolentine.One afternoon, Gonzalez was chided by Sister Rose Ellen Gorman, the school’s principal, for placing his hands around a student’s neck.Gonzalez established his style at Manhattan College, where he took his first head coaching job in 1999. Some former players recalled endless practices and pregame meals eaten in silence.Gonzalez’s teams went 129-77 in his seven-year run at Manhattan, including two trips to the N.C.A.A. tournament.Numerous players from Gonzalez’s time at Manhattan said he had instilled a culture so intense that it sapped their spirit. It drove at least one player to quit the team. Mike Konovelchick chose to go on spring break with his friends as a senior rather than play in the 2006 National Invitation Tournament.Manhattan’s athletic director, Bob Byrnes, said: “The thing about this grind was that it didn’t need to be as laborious as it was. It was made laborious by unprofessional or selfish behavior. He made things larger than they were.”Others described a culture in which the players’ main bond was their dislike of Gonzalez.“I don’t know how he coached guys who wanted to strangle him and then went out there and played lights-out for him,” said Mike Bramucci, a former assistant to Gonzalez at Manhattan. “It’s a gift. I don’t know what kind of gift, but it’s an absolute gift.”The former Jasper Kenny Minor called Gonzalez “the craziest person I’ve ever met in my life, by far.” Minor added: “If I were to ever become a coach, I learned a lot of things I wouldn’t do. Even though we won, it was hard to enjoy basketball.”He and others said that Gonzalez consistently broke the N.C.A.A.’s rules on practice hours. Byrnes confirmed that players “on more than one occasion” anonymously complained about Gonzalez going over practice limits. Byrnes said he had dealt with it by having an associate athletic director attend every practice to monitor the time.Minor and other players felt the team goals were focused toward promoting Gonzalez’s career. They said Gonzalez relished any attention he received, especially in the New York newspapers, and had assistants cut out the articles and highlight his name.“When I went to Manhattan, I learned how to win for someone’s career path,” Noah Coughlin, a former Jasper, said. “I learned how to win for the benefit of Gonzo.”On Thursday night, Gonzalez was in his element in a game at Rutgers. The Pirates pushed the pace behind the star transfers Pope and Jeff Robinson. Tensions rose to the point that Gonzalez rushed onto the court to separate his player from a potential fight, and he exchanged words with two Rutgers assistants in the handshake line. Afterward, Gonzalez suggested the chaos as a source of energy.“I think that resolve comes from all that we’ve weathered,” Gonzalez said.Msgr. Robert Sheeran, the university president, is set to step down at the end of the academic year. The athletic department situation is muddled; Quinlan, a bookish type who has clashed with Gonzalez, is working without a contract. (Byrnes said Sheeran and Quinlan did not call him for a background check before they hired Gonzalez.)Dean Patrick E. Hobbs of Seton Hall Law School has been running the athletic department since last summer. And then there is Codey, who has also served as Acting Governor. Codey said he had no official role at Seton Hall, but he helped Gonzalez negotiate his contract extension last summer.A university official with knowledge of the contract said that despite the extension through 2015, the university’s financial obligation is identical to the prior contract, so the university extended Gonzalez’s contract without offering him any more guaranteed money.When asked if Gonzalez had matured at Seton Hall, Codey said, “It’s not easy to change a lifetime of conduct in a short period.” He added, “But the light is much brighter at the end of the tunnel than it was before Bobby.”Still, Gonzalez never appears settled. Sonny Vaccaro, who mentored Gonzalez since his days as a high school assistant, called him this season after a big win. Vaccaro said he had left this voice mail message: “Gonzie, great win, great job. You’re doing a great job. Just stay humble.”Gonzalez called back, and Vaccaro recalled that he said: “Sonny, you know me, I can’t help myself. I work too hard. I was never one of the chosen ones.”'"
"'10-03-08,'0','Janet L. Yellen, who was a Fed governor and chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration, has been mentioned as a front-runner to succeed Donald L. Kohn, the departing vice chairman.But the people briefed on the process said it was not clear that Ms. Yellen, now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, would want to return to Washington. The White House might have to do some arm-twisting to get her; as vice chairwoman she would make $179,700, less than half her current pay.Another potential candidate for vice chairman would be Benjamin M. Friedman, a Harvard political economist.When Mr. Geithner held a meeting last month with leaders of labor, civil rights and consumer groups to discuss overhauling financial regulation, he found the conversation steering to the Fed, according to several participants.Advocates called on Mr. Geithner to appoint governors who could make the Fed more representative and accountable. Diversity is likely to be another consideration. Of the 87 governors since 1914, there have been seven women and three African-Americans.“It would really be helpful if they had knowledge of the real economy,” said William W. Sherrill, a former Fed governor who teaches entrepreneurship in the Bauer College of Business at the University of Houston. “All the attention lately has been on rescuing the financial sector from ruin, but the inability to move the stimulus over to the real economy — and most directly, small businesses — has been the problem.”Several banking executives, who have been supporters of Mr. Obama, have been cited as possible nominees: Paul Calello of Credit Suisse, Robert Wolf of UBS and Steven G. Thieke, a veteran of the New York Fed who retired a decade ago from JPMorgan Chase. All have the advantage of not having worked recently at the financial institutions that were at the center of the credit crisis and were bailed out by the Treasury and the Fed, though their ties to the banks could still be problematic.But speculation that the White House might turn to nominees not too closely tied to Wall Street or Washington was enhanced after Christina D. Romer, the chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told several news organizations on Friday that she did not intend or expect to be considered.Ms. Romer is an authority on the Great Depression, like the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and has closely studied the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s policy-making arm. Her main scholarly collaborator has been her husband, David H. Romer, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has himself been mentioned as a possible nominee.“There’s obviously a process under way, as there are with any positions,” Ms. Romer told Politico. “But I certainly won’t be one of them.”The people briefed on the talks spoke of several economists with ties to Mr. Summers and Mr. Geithner: Edwin M. Truman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a veteran of the Fed and the Treasury; the Harvard professors Jeffrey A. Frankel, Jeremy C. Stein and David S. Scharfstein; and David A. Lipton, a former Treasury official who is now at the National Security Council.Other names that have been mentioned include Laurence M. Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins; Austan Goolsbee, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers; and Jason Furman, a deputy to Mr. Summers.All of the potential nominees mentioned in this article either declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of the process, or did not respond to requests for comment.For their part, consumer advocates said they were closely watching the selection process.“I hope they will give serious consideration to adding people who understand and care about the financial needs of consumers, and who know how to balance access and protection,” said Jennifer Tescher, director of the Center for Financial Services Innovation, and a member of the Fed’s Consumer Advisory Council.'"
"'10-03-08,'0','Critics have said these sanctions are leaky and ineffective, and some say it makes more sense to spread digital technology, which makes it harder for governments to restrict the flow of information within societies, and to prevent their people from contact with the outside world.The Treasury Department’s action follows a recommendation by the State Department in mid-December that the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which is run by the Treasury, authorize the downloading of “free mass-market software” in Iran by Microsoft, Google and other companies.In a speech in January, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton declared that Internet freedom had become a fundamental principle of American foreign policy. “Viral videos and blog posts are becoming the samizdat of our day,” she said, referring to censored publications that were passed around in Soviet-era Russia and helped fuel the dissident movement.While Iran is the prime target of the Treasury’s action, it has implications for Sudan and Cuba, where the administration is also seeking to open more channels of communication to the outside world. Two other blacklisted countries, North Korea and Syria, are not affected by the decision because their sanctions do not currently rule out the export of Internet services.In the chaotic days after the June election in Iran, the State Department asked Twitter to put off maintenance of its global network, which would have cut off service to Iranians using it to swap information and tell the world about antigovernment protests. The administration’s move will not deprive the Iranian authorities of the ability to clamp down on the Internet, as happened in February, when service was constricted so heavily that Iranians had difficulty accessing Gmail accounts and organizing protests before the 31st anniversary of the Iranian Revolution. But by offering Iranians more options, the official said, it will force the authorities in Iran to plug more holes.“We want to make sure the information flows,” he said. “It will obviously have political implications in a range of ways.”The administration’s blanket waiver does not apply to encryption and other software that makes it harder for the authorities to track people’s Internet activity. That category of technology does not fall within the mass-market services that can be downloaded free from the Internet, he said.But the official said the Treasury would grant licenses to such providers on a case-by-case basis, and would generally look favorably on them. One such service, known as Haystack, is awaiting a waiver from the State Department, and is subsequently likely to obtain a Treasury license.Developed by the Censorship Research Center, a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization, Haystack uses mathematical formulas to disguise a user’s Internet traffic from official censors.In December, Representative James Moran, Democrat of Virginia, introduced a bill in the House that would “support the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people by enhancing their ability to access the Internet and communications services.” It also calls for the United States to give tools to Iranians to help circumvent government restrictions on the Internet.The State Department says it is working in 40 countries to help people get around these barriers. But critics said it had moved slowly in spending $15 million appropriated by Congress in 2008 to support these programs.Advocates of one service, Global Internet Freedom Consortium, complain that it has not received financing because it is linked to Falun Gong, a sect condemned by the Chinese government as a cult.The administration’s main focus on Iran these days is marshaling support at the United Nations Security Council for a tough new sanctions resolution, aimed particularly at the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Last month, the Treasury Department froze the assets of four construction firms linked to the guard, which runs Iran’s nuclear and missile programs.While the Internet decision would seem at odds with more sanctions “at some meta-level,” the official said, he described it as part of an overall strategy to force the Iranian government to alter its behavior.'"
"'10-03-08,'0','Aspiring bankers know their career choice comes at an awkward time. Ben Phelps, an M.B.A. student at Duke who is going to work for after graduation, was shouted at by a stranger on Wall Street during a summer internship. He and his classmates joke that they would sooner describe themselves as “bank tellers” than “investment bankers.”“A lot of people lost their savings, and I can understand those people being angry,” Mr. Phelps said. “But I wish sometimes that their anger wasn’t directed just at bankers.”Still, he said, the public perception of banking was not a factor when he accepted the job that he calls “the reason I came to business school,” in the bank’s mergers and acquisitions division. He expects the work to be fast-paced, intellectually challenging, financially rewarding and helpful in building a career — the same reasons given by many aspiring bankers.On a recent interview day at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, students in pinstriped suits and polished shoes waited anxiously for meetings with representatives from and Capital Markets.The competition would be steep — with dozens of students applying for each internship — but less selective than in 2009. The number of banks interviewing at Darden this year increased 20 percent, and the number of job offers so far has risen 33 percent, the school said.“There’s reason for students to be optimistic,” said Tracy Handler, a spokeswoman for the M.B.A. Career Services Council, an association of business school career advisers. “Any signs of recovery are modest. But business schools are looking ahead and seeing a light at the end of what is now a pretty short tunnel.”A survey by the career council in December found that 39 percent of business schools expected internship opportunities to increase this summer, while 26 percent expected them to decrease.At , for instance, the business school career office reported last month that the number of students with investment banking internships had doubled compared with last year. Four new banks went to Duke this year to interview, and the number of Duke students submitting résumés to banks increased 37 percent. The number of students participating in the school’s Week on Wall Street trip also rose, to 90 from 60 last year.“Ironically, this can be a superb time to enter banking,” said Jeff Fischer, the director of career management at the business school at the , where the number of investment bankers visiting campus has risen 67 percent since last year. “The M.B.A. population is like the end of a whip. When cycles swing up and down, students are the ones who swing up and down the most in terms of employment.”Though some banks are still cautious, business school counselors are telling students to be persistent. Banks under-hired during the market collapse, the counselors say, and will soon be creating more full-time positions than former interns can fill.Top banks declined to release hiring statistics for this article, and many business schools said it was too early to predict hiring results because job offers can continue through the spring. But in interviews with two dozen students and administrators at several business schools across the country, there was growing optimism about banking jobs. Many students said Wall Street remained a dream destination, even if they occasionally had to explain their dream to friends.“The answer is the level of knowledge that can be gained at such a young age,” said P. J. Martin, a first-year M.B.A. student at the University of North Carolina who is interning at Capital next summer, explaining his interest in investment banking. “You have access to top-level management, to the top minds in the finance field.”But many students admitted a twinge of guilt about landing jobs and internships while so many classmates — and much of the country — remain unemployed.“I feel lucky,” said Mr. Phelps, from Duke. “My timing ended up being perfect, and it could easily have not been. Lots of friends are struggling and not finding jobs.”The speed of the turnaround in banking has not surprised Ben Bloomfield, a first-year M.B.A. student at Darden. Business students, he said, expect cyclical markets, but know that banking will remain prestigious.“I don’t think any business school student was disillusioned enough to think, ‘Oh, on my résumé is not going to be valuable,’ ” Mr. Bloomfield said. “It was more, ‘Goldman Sachs is going to come to campus, and I’m not even sure they’re going to hire anybody.’ ”That patience seems to have been rewarded. After a tough round of interviews, Mr. Bloomfield just received an internship at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.'"

Vonn finished 0.15 of a second behind, and her United States teammate Julia Mancuso was 0.38 of a second back in third. Vonn already has the World Cup downhill title going into this weekend’s final World Cup races in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.Gisin appeared to have recovered from her spectacular crash during the final jump of the downhill at the Vancouver Olympics. Her flawless run prompted wild cheers from the home crowd and a pained smile from Vonn as she ceded the top step on the podium.CANADIAN CAPTURES SUPER-G Erik Guay of Canada ended three years of near misses and captured his second World Cup victory, narrowly winning a super-G in Kvitfjell, Norway.Guay edged the early leader, Hannes Reichelt of Austria, by 0.02 of a second on the 1994 Olympic course to win his first race since a 2007 downhill in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.'"
"'10-03-08,'0','Drone chords are accommodating and diplomatic. They’re the secret handshake between Westerners and Easterners, soft-eyed hippies and aggro noise merchants, improvisers and composers. They’re also totems, full of their own significance. And bullies.They don’t complain or explain. If they’re in the music’s foreground, they’ll blot out everything else. They sit there, enduring, vibrating; depending on use and context they can give you peace or make you want to punch the next five people you see.One way to understand the music of the improvising electro-acoustic quartet Glissando bin Laden — especially if you let the name sink in — is as a fight between rigid law and individual choice. It’s a band of aggression and subtle humor. It’s made one record, “Drone Level Orange,” released last year by the Carrier label (carrierrecords.com), and it headlined Thursday night’s showcase of improvised music from the Carrier roster at Issue Project Room in Gowanus, Brooklyn.Violins, played by Caroline Malloneé and Jim Altieri, squared off against laptops, played by Alex Ness and Sam Pluta. The violinists played loud, amplified drone chords, mostly consonant but with ear-scraping traces of dissonance, following a slow, regular, graceful pulse, interlocking their two-chord patterns or sometimes just working over a solitary one. (Their harmony, and basic strategy through each piece, was predetermined; the details of their phrasing and the duration of each piece were not.)The laptops, processing the violin sounds in real time and introducing new ones, scrambled the message through improvisation. In each of the band’s three pieces, there was always some kind of battle or tug of war; it was just a question of when and how it would happen.In “Gavotte,” upward string swoops were answered by downward swoops of digital noise. During “Bees in Space,” about five minutes into the violins’ solemn throb, the floor dropped out of the music, and a crazy cloud of digital buzzing noises flooded in. (A back screen showed a video of bees leaving their hives.) The violinists fought back, breaking up their playing into needling, improvised notes and sounds, and suddenly it was a free-for-all, each side subsumed into the other’s aural space.In “Rumble Seven,” the calmest piece, Mr. Ness sang meaningless syllables in a kind of north Indian raga chant, his long tones going against the violins’ slowly shifting harmony in pizzicato phrasing, while Mr. Pluta’s laptop imitated a chorus of small objects rattled in a bag — glass shards, pebbles, ball bearings.'"

"'10-03-09,'1','“It wasn’t a tough process,” Johnson said of free agency. “I had done my job, which was on the court. And then it was time for my agent to do his work. For the most part, it wasn’t hard at all. We looked back and saw a few places and just chose Atlanta as the best fit.”After three more years of flirting with records and ignoring the traditional basketball protocol of slowing down offenses, D’Antoni also changed course and joined the Knicks’ reclamation project.So far, Johnson’s Hawks have shown the greater maturation. Atlanta is poised to improve its win total for a fifth consecutive season. At 40-23, the Hawks are bunched with the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Orlando Magic and the Boston Celtics as the Eastern Conference’s elite teams.Johnson is leading the Hawks by averaging 21.5 points a game, 13th in the league. Last month, he started in the All-Star Game for the first time in his nine-year career. The 6-foot-7 Johnson is an adept ball handler for his size, but he can venture through unproductive stretches in games.“Our record indicates he’s grown,” Hawks Coach Mike Woodson said at the shootaround, adding that the pressure on Johnson had been eased by the improvement of young players like Josh Smith and Al Horford and the acquisition of Jamal Crawford.“The foundation was built around Joe when he first got here, and we’ve gotten better every year because of Joe Johnson,” Woodson said.The Hawks have made the playoffs the last two years after missing them eight years in a row. Johnson said this season would be incomplete without journeying deep into the playoffs.“He’s been a star player for a long time,” Crawford said. “It just so happens his contract is up. I think he’s focused on trying to win a championship here and going from there, but I think he’d rather be here than anywhere else. I hope, anyways.”For D’Antoni, the second half has disintegrated into little more than games that double as gatherings for players who could be attractive free agents.Johnson became the latest in the carousel on Monday night at the Garden, and if he wants to attempt to begin a reclamation process with a third franchise, the opportunity will probably be there. Johnson rejected an offer for four years and around $60 million from the Hawks so he could test unrestricted free agency this summer. He is generally viewed as a borderline maximum-salary player.He still says D’Antoni had one of the largest influences on his career. D’Antoni increased Johnson’s playing time when the Suns traded Stephon Marbury and Penny Hardaway to the Knicks.“He just told me to go out there and do my thing, and I just tried to take full advantage of it,” Johnson said. “It turned out to be a pretty good success.”If D’Antoni and Johnson are to try to duplicate that with the Knicks, the team’s fans may view the effort through a prism of disappointment if he is the only major free agent the Knicks land. While the free agency rumors concerning LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh have nearly crashed the Internet, Johnson has received far less scrutiny.Flying below the surface fits Johnson’s low-key demeanor. But it also raises the question of whether he is willing or able to play the role of savior for an intense fan base that has endured basketball indignities for several years.The Hawks are expected to try to retain Johnson. Meanwhile, the Chicago Bulls and possibly the Los Angeles Clippers loom as potential suitors.“I think everybody is going to be in contention,” Johnson said. “I can’t really say just one team that I’m looking forward to playing for. I don’t know. I think it’s going to be an exciting summer, and we’ll see what happens.”Wilson Chandler blocked Josh Smith’s shot as time dwindled, and after a review, the referees ruled that Al Horford’s putback arrived after the buzzer, giving the Knicks a 99-98 victory over the Hawks on Monday. The Knicks held on despite losing nearly all of an 11-point lead. Atlanta’s final possession was set up when Jamal Crawford stole the ball from Toney Douglas. ... Danilo Gallinari scored 27 points, his most since Jan. 16. Smith had 25 points and Joe Johnson 22 for the Hawks. ... After setting an N.B.A. record by going 0 for 18 on 3-point attempts last Saturday, the Knicks went 10 for 15. ... Tracy McGrady did not play, resting his surgically repaired left knee.'"
"'10-03-09,'1','“You can’t separate the underlying solvency of companies from the rates they charge,” said Sean Dilweg, the insurance commissioner in Wisconsin. “The federal proposal would be a huge pre-emption of decisions that states have made over their history.”Mary Beth Senkewicz, a deputy insurance commissioner in Florida, said, “If you divorce rate-setting from financial oversight, that’s a fundamental flaw.”“Premiums must be reasonable in relation to the benefits,” Ms. Senkewicz said. “That becomes a fairly complex analysis.”Insurance commissioners said they fully supported efforts to expand coverage and rein in health costs. But they said it would be risky to hold down premiums before costs were under control. And they do not expect the federal legislation to drive down costs anytime soon.Sandy Praeger of Kansas, one of several insurance commissioners who met with Mr. Obama at the White House last week, said: “From a consumer protection standpoint, the most important thing we do is ensure the solvency of companies. We would strenuously resist not having the ability to approve rates or having the commissioners’ oversight of rates overturned.”“You are not necessarily helping the consumer if you keep rates artificially low,” Ms. Praeger said. “What’s worse for the consumer: having a premium increase or having to pay the full amount of a medical expense because the company is out of business?”Mr. Obama has cited his proposal for a Health Insurance Rate Authority as one of the most significant elements of his plan to remake the nation’s health care system.Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said that in a meeting with liberal Democrats last week, Mr. Obama “focused in particular on the new provision that would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to block exorbitant premium increases.”As an example, Mr. Obama has pointed to a request by Anthem Blue Cross to increase premiums for individual policyholders in California by an average of 25 percent, with some rates going up as much as 39 percent.Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, called Monday on five big insurers to provide detailed public justifications for their latest premium increases.“If insurance companies are going to raise rates, the least they can do is tell us why,” said Ms. Sebelius, who has called their profits “wildly excessive.”The president’s proposal is modeled on a bill introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, which would give the health secretary the authority to deny or modify premium increases that she found unreasonable.“We are the only industrialized nation that relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care,” Mrs. Feinstein said. “I believe, fundamentally, that all medical insurance should be not-for-profit.”In a recent report to Congress, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said, “Most states require insurers in the individual market to obtain prior approval of proposed rate increases before putting them into effect.”At least 27 states have “prior approval” requirements. In 12 other states, rates must be filed with regulators before their use, and regulators often have the authority to block increases. In other states, insurers must inform state officials of rate increases or file their rates along with standard contract forms.Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, said federal regulation of insurance rates was overdue.“The current system is untenable,” Professor Rosenbaum said. “If insurers don’t like the results of regulation in one state, they can pull up stakes and go elsewhere. That’s why states often bend to the will of the industry.”Prof. James W. Ely Jr. of Vanderbilt Law School said the clamor against health insurance companies was “reminiscent of populist outrage against railroads in the second half of the 19th century,” when a number of Midwestern states created commissions to set rail freight rates. The Supreme Court, Professor Ely said, held that railroads and other regulated industries were entitled to a reasonable return on investment — an issue in some current battles over health insurance.Mila Kofman, the insurance superintendent in Maine, said federal standards must be “a floor and not a ceiling” for states.“I want to be sure that federal legislation does not pre-empt what we do, will not interfere with our strong standard and broad authority to do rate review,” Ms. Kofman said.Anthem requested an average rate increase of 18.5 percent in Maine, but Ms. Kofman allowed only 10.9 percent. She said the higher rates would have caused “extreme financial hardship for subscribers.”The company sued, arguing that Ms. Kofman had set inadequate, “confiscatory” rates, with no allowance for profit. Under Maine law, it said, the state could not consider a policyholder’s “personal financial circumstances” in establishing rates.Ms. Kofman defended her decision, citing the overall financial health of the company, as well as its income from individual insurance products. The case is pending.The individual insurance market is notoriously volatile, and Susan E. Voss, the Iowa insurance commissioner, said she had seen some companies paying out 50 percent more in claims than they collected in premiums for some policies in that market.'"
"'10-03-09,'1','His departure left not only a grieving family but also a ghostly legal presence and a host of questions in the artifact cases.The death of the government’s “confidential source,” as Mr. Gardiner was always identified in court documents (he later gave interviews with reporters in Utah, using his name openly and talking about his role) will change how the evidence is presented, prosecutors said, and how the tapes of his conversations with defendants will be introduced. But the tapes themselves, they said, can still be played to juries.“We believe the cases can proceed,” said Carlie Christensen, the acting United States attorney for Utah.Some other prosecutors and defense lawyers were not as certain. After Mr. Gardiner’s death, one of the first trials, scheduled to begin this month in Federal District Court in Denver, was postponed at the request of prosecutors.“This gives us time to consider what options we have as we review our case in toto,” said Jeff Dorschner, a spokesman for the United States Attorney’s Office there.Several defense lawyers at Monday’s hearing said they planned to file motions challenging the government’s use of Mr. Gardiner’s work — either because the defendants will lack an ability to confront a witness against them, a violation of the Sixth Amendment, or concerns over the possible violation of rules about hearsay evidence, when one witness quotes another.“No one knows the answers,” Walter F. Bugden Jr., a lawyer in Salt Lake who represents one defendant, Vern Crites, said in an interview. “Everyone is going to have to step back and try to assess what legal impact this will have on the admissibility of evidence.”Several criminal law experts said that because Mr. Gardiner did not act alone — he often talked in interviews and to his family about how federal agents hid in the brush surrounding a dig for artifacts or helped him prepare the recording equipment he wore —prosecutors should have other witnesses who could lay a legal foundation for the tapes.“If they have an audiotape and somebody is to able to say, ‘I recognize the voices, the undercover agent and defendant’s voice,’ or someone who helped set up the tape, or authenticate the tape, it should be admissible,” said Sherry F. Colb, a law professor at Cornell who teaches evidence and criminal procedure.The real question, Professor Colb and others said, is how much prosecutors had intended to rely on Mr. Gardiner as a physical presence in the courtroom to help construct the government’s narrative of the case.Dustin Gardiner said his father, who came of age in the 1970s in Utah and fell in love with the history and landscape of the desert badlands in the Four Corners area, where Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico meet, never expressed doubts about his role in the investigation.He told his family, Dustin Gardiner said, about the callous carelessness he had seen toward the land and the Indian sites.“He often talked about a moment where one of the diggers dug up a human skull and just kind of tossed it aside,” Mr. Gardiner said. “He saw a lot of things that disgusted him.”But the suicides of the defendants, including that of a prominent doctor in Blanding, Utah, James Redd, came as a surprise, Mr. Gardiner said. He said his father, who at that time had been sober for about two years, started drinking again.“He always knew he was doing the right thing, but the fact that two other people killed themselves because of it weighed on him deeply,” Mr. Gardiner said. “He felt guilty.”“The stress of the cases, the investigation, it seemed to be extremely intense,” he added, “and as time went on and the trials got closer, it all seemed to be having a pretty big impact on him.”Ted Gardiner’s ashes were scattered in southern Utah this week, his son said, along a stretch of river in a grove of blue spruce where he loved to camp.On Monday, Magistrate Judge Samuel Alba said defense challenges about the evidence would be considered as they came in. Judge Alba set trial dates beginning in May for many defendants.'"
"'10-03-09,'1','The largest shareholder and the largest unsecured creditor in the mall operator General Growth Properties intend to enhance the company’s reorganization plan to emerge from bankruptcy as an independent company, the company confirmed Monday night.The mall operator has been fending off an unsolicited $10 billion takeover offer from a major rival, Simon Property Group. General Growth’s own proposal to emerge from bankruptcy has raised questions about its ability to pay off unsecured creditors in cash.Under the deal now proposed, Fairholme Capital Management, the company’s largest unsecured creditor, and Pershing Square Capital Management, its largest shareholder, would invest about $3.93 billion in partnership with Brookfield Asset Management, General Growth said.“Our goal is to raise capital in the most cost-efficient way to maximize value for all of our stakeholders,” Adam Metz, General Growth’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We are pleased with the support shown by one of our largest unsecured debt holders and one of our largest equity holders.”One of the main goals of the Fairholme-Pershing proposal is to ensure that General Growth will be able to pay off its roughly $7 billion in unsecured debt in cash, instead of through a combination of cash and stock. Simon’s offer has the tentative backing of General Growth’s unsecured creditors committee in part because it would do just that.'"
"'10-03-09,'1','States and companies have started investing very differently when it comes to the billions of dollars they are safeguarding for workers’ retirement.Companies are quietly and gradually moving their pension funds out of stocks. They want to reduce their investment risk and are buying more long-term bonds.But states and other bodies of government are seeking higher returns for their pension funds, to make up for ground lost in the last couple of years and to pay all the benefits promised to present and future retirees. Higher returns come with more risk.“In effect, they’re going to Las Vegas,” said Frederick E. Rowe, a Dallas investor and the former chairman of the Texas Pension Review Board, which oversees public plans in that state. “Double up to catch up.”Though they generally say that their strategies are aimed at diversification and are not riskier, public pension funds are trying a wide range of investments: commodity futures, junk bonds, foreign stocks, deeply discounted mortgage-backed securities and margin investing. And some states that previously shunned hedge funds are trying them now.The Texas teachers’ pension fund recently paid Chicago to receive a stream of payments from the money going into the city’s parking meters in the coming years. The deal gave Chicago an upfront payment that it could use to help balance its budget. Alas, Chicago did not have enough money to contribute to its own pension fund, which has been stung by real estate deals that fizzled when the city lost out in the bidding for the 2016 Olympics.A spokeswoman for the Texas teachers’ fund said plan administrators believed that such alternative investments were the likeliest way to earn 8 percent average annual returns over time.Pension funds rarely trumpet their intentions, partly to keep other big investors from trading against them. But some big corporations are unloading the stocks that have dominated pension portfolios for decades. General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, J. C. Penney, Boeing, Federal Express and Ashland are among those that have been shifting significant amounts of pension money out of stocks.Other companies say they plan to follow suit, though more slowly. A poll of pension funds conducted by Pyramis Global Advisors last November found that more than half of corporate funds were reducing the portion they invested in United States equities.Laggards tend to be companies with big shortfalls in their pension funds. Those moving the fastest are often mature companies with large pension funds, and who fear a big bear market could decimate the funds and the companies’ own finances.“The larger the pension plan, the lower-risk strategy you would like to employ,” said Andrew T. Ward, the chief investment officer of Boeing, which shifted a big block of pension money out of stocks in 2007. That helped cushion Boeing’s pension fund against the big losses of 2008.Shedding stocks gave Boeing “material protection right when we needed it most,” Mr. Ward said. By the time the markets had bottomed out last March, Boeing’s pension fund had lost 14 percent of its value, while those of its equity-laden peers had lost 25 to 30 percent, he said.“We estimated that the strategy saved our company in the short term right around $4 or $5 billion of funded status,” he said.Boeing and other companies seeking to reduce their investment risk are moving into fixed-income instruments, like bonds — but not just any bonds. They are buying and holding bonds scheduled to pay many years in the future, when their retirees expect their money.The value of the bonds may fall in the meantime, just like the value of stocks. But declining bond prices are not such a worry, because the companies plan to hold the bonds for the accompanying interest payments that will in turn go to retirees, not sell them in the interim.Towers Watson, a big benefits consulting firm, surveyed senior financial executives last year and found that two-thirds planned to decrease the stock portion of their companies’ pension funds by the end of 2010. They typically said their stock allocations would shrink by 10 percentage points.“That’s 10 times the shift we might see in any given year,” said Carl Hess, head of Towers Watson’s investment consulting business. Economists have speculated that a truly seismic shift in pension investing away from stocks could be a drag on the market, but they say it would not be long-lasting.Corporate America’s change of heart is notable all on its own, after decades of resistance to anything other than returns like those of the stock markets. But it’s even more startling when compared with governments’ continued loyalty to stocks. When governments scale back on the domestic stocks in their pension portfolios these days, it is often just to make way for more foreign stocks or private equities, which are not publicly traded.'"
"'10-03-09,'1','Praise, when it was offered, was cautious.“It’s still a small step in Iraq; it’s a small minor turning point,” said Abdul Khaleq Abdullah, a political science professor at United Arab Emirates University. “Iraq is still full of challenges, and they are formidable challenges.”But after seven years of occupation, with so many killed, maimed and displaced, and with so many scandals, like Abu Ghraib, this is a very cynical audience. If the United States had hoped that the sight of millions of average Iraqis streaming out to vote might have begun to edge regional public opinion about American involvement in Iraq to at least a more neutral place, it is likely to be disappointed.“It could be seen in the West as very symbolic, as nice, as something that proves it was worth getting rid of Saddam, but definitely not in the Arab world,” said Randa Habib, a political analyst and newspaper columnist in Amman, Jordan. “Jordanians still see Iraq as being manipulated by outside forces. Their minds have been manipulated by Americans and Iranians, and the outcome of the election will not be the best for Iraqis.”The fear of undue Iranian influence, a common concern, may have sectarian underpinnings. Most of the region is majority Sunni, while Iran is a Shiite theocracy and Iraq has a newly empowered Shiite majority.Even if elections are seen as a step toward democracy, which few allowed, elections under occupation are not, said Emad Gad, an expert on international relations with the Ahram Center of Political and Strategic Studies, a government-financed research center in Cairo.“Free elections are the last step in a democracy,” he said. “Before that, you have to have a democratic society that accepts the values of democracy. In Iraq we see religious conflicts, sectarian conflicts. These are elections without democratic values.”Across the region, the news media operate with varying degrees of restrictions. But even in the most censorship-prone nations, news commentators are often allowed to opine about events beyond their borders. They have been especially vocal about Iraq, flogging the West and its allies for unleashing chaos there.But there was surprisingly little commentary written about the Iraqi elections in the days before the vote, which has been attributed to weariness with the topic and skepticism over the validity of the exercise, according to political analysts and Mideastwire.com, the news media monitoring company based in Beirut.“People viewed it cynically — critically and skeptically,” said Ghanim Alnajjar, a political science professor at Kuwait University.Once voters did go to the polls, Arab news media took notice, though primarily to report on the mechanics of the election, said Mirella Dagher, a regional analyst at Mideastwire.com.“In contrast to the Western and especially U.S. portrayal of these elections as ‘do or die,’ ” Ms. Dagher said, “the Arab media seems to be under no illusion that Iraq is heading toward either progress and democracy or complete disaster with these polls. Instead ‘more of the same’ is generally being seen as a continuation of the country’s problems.”For the average news viewer, it seemed like more of the same.People around the region said they saw images of Iraqis voting, but also the more familiar and disturbing images of violence. That set people on edge and diluted what the West hoped might be a positive message of self-determination for Iraqis.“I saw on Al Jazeera that Obama said that the elections went well in Iraq without problems,” said Dr. Ghada Fathy, 40, as she left a grocery store in the Nasr City district of Cairo. “But that wasn’t true; there was lots of violence. I became mad when I heard Obama’s words.”It may be too soon to say with certainty if the outcome of the election will move Iraq closer to unity and healing, or if it will drive the factions further apart.But it is certain, people around the region said, that it will be a long time before Iraq is viewed broadly as free and democratic.“People in the region are definitely interested in democracy and in practicing their own rights,” said Mr. Abdullah, the political science professor from United Arab Emirates University. “But the Iraqi experience will have an impact on the region only once it stabilizes. Right now, it is so sectarian and unstable that it turns people off. If it becomes a stable democracy, then it will have some impact.”'"
"'10-03-09,'1','Apparently everybody got the memo about minimalism.The fall ready-to-wear collections continued their clean sweep as Stella McCartney sent out linear coats with only a little notch in the front for a detail and crewnecks and slacks so plain and simple, you had to remind yourself you weren’t looking at Ann Taylor.Give the retail chain six months to catch up.That’s how long it took for Phoebe Philo’s first Céline show, last October, to have an influence. Ms. Philo isn’t the only designer who likes simplified clothes. Indeed, Ms. McCartney’s spring clothes had the same attitude. But Ms. Philo’s ability to give Céline a look makes her the equivalent of a yardstick. Suddenly, it seems, everybody is using her strict measure as the rule.Ms. McCartney’s collection was super clean, with V-neck tunics and skinny wool pants, sleeveless wool coats, mini-shifts and graphic uses of color amid the neutrals, like a cropped sleeveless jacket in burnt-orange wool over a salmon turtleneck.At Givenchy, Riccardo Tisci also toned things down, opening with a plain beige coat buttoned over a prim lace top and slim pants. Yet the striking difference at Givenchy is that while the silhouette might be more strict than in the past, there is more variety and sexiness in his clothes than in other collections toeing the minimalist line.Among the standout looks were shifts that mixed leather and lace and black velvet parkas. Jolts of Lido red also saved everything from looking too serious. Skirts and high-waist pants peeled opened in the front with the release of a zipper, creating a contrasting fold. It was an interesting effect that Mr. Tisci might have refined or, with further thought, eliminated.It’s fair to say that the chief interest of Karl Lagerfeld is Lagerfeld. He is not a minimalist today and something else tomorrow. His fashion always balances two opposing ideas: the love of domestic order and self control, expressed in rigorous tailoring, and an interest in the new, reflected in the slick black materials in his latest Karl Lagerfeld line. Trim skirts and leggings have the gloss of a touch-pad screen or, if you like, the kinkiness of latex. The material is actually patent leather. Mr. Lagerfeld’s idea for jackets, in black wool, was to cut them close to the body, with zippers and pressed-down folds for a sense of geometry.'"
"'10-03-09,'1','To help average Americans do something to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, several foundations and travel companies, in cooperation with the United Nations, are starting a campaign to allow travelers to donate $2 every time they pay for a flight, a rental car or a hotel room.The campaign, called MassiveGood, is asking users of various travel Web sites, including Travelocity, to click a box to donate an extra $2 when they pay.The management consultants McKinsey & Company estimated that the plan could bring in $600 million to $1 billion a year within four years, said Dr. Jorge Bermudez, executive secretary of Unitaid, the international charity that is to receive the donations.Unitaid, founded in 2006, receives about $350 million a year through small taxes on airline tickets in France, Chile and South Korea, a carbon tax in Norway and donations from Britain and Brazil. It then channels the money through other groups — including Unicef, the William J. Clinton Foundation and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria — to pay for drugs for children with AIDS, drugs for adults with drug-resistant AIDS or tuberculosis, and mosquito nets to prevent malaria.The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, and former President Bill Clinton last week announced the plan, which has been endorsed by several European governments. The United States government does not contribute to Unitaid, but the AIDS and malaria programs started by the Bush administration give money to many of the same recipients.'"
"'10-03-09,'1','James Cameron didn’t go home on Sunday night with as many Academy Awards as expected for his hit film “Avatar,” and not all the Oscar winners from the film remembered to call him a visionary at the podium. But he won’t have to share his “Avatar” profits with a Chinese writer who said the movie plagiarized his work. A court in Beijing has thrown out a lawsuit brought by the writer Zhou Shaomou, who said that the film closely resembled his novel “The Legend of the Blue Crow,” which he wrote in 1997 and published online in 1999, The Global Times of China reported. The author said his novel and “Avatar” shared 80 percent of their material, and was seeking 8 percent of the movie’s total revenue. A Chinese representative for 20th Century Fox, which released the film, told The Global Times that the story line for “Avatar” was first devised in 1995, two years before Mr. Zhou wrote his novel.'"
"'10-03-09,'1','For all three companies, Ratiopharm is an attractive target because Germany is the largest generic market in Europe, and Ratiopharm is the second biggest generics purveyor there. Germans spent about 4.9 billion euros on generics in 2008, said Ulrich Huwald, an analyst for M.M. Warburg & Company in Hamburg.Ratiopharm had global sales of 1.9 billion euros in 2008, nearly half of which were in Germany, according to the company’s Web site. But Ratiopharm also sells its products in more than 30 other countries, including established markets like Spain and Canada and emerging economies like Russia. Over all, it is the world’s fifth-largest maker of generics, accounting for 3 percent of the global market, a report last year from BCC Research said.Royal Bank of Scotland and Commerzbank, both lenders to Ratiopharm’s parent company VEM Vermögensverwaltung, are managing the sale of Ratiopharm, said Markus Braun, a spokesman for Ratiopharm. The transaction is expected to be completed this month, but the company would not disclose the names of the bidders, he said. But Ratiopharm is privately held and much about it is not publicly known.“It’s clearly the crown jewel in the German generics market. For any interested party, for Europe, it’s a megadeal,” said David M. Steinberg, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. “How profitable is it? It’s hard to know.”Teva has been aggressively expanding its global leadership in generics, in part through acquisitions. Two years ago it acquired Barr Pharmaceuticals, an American company, for about $7.5 billion. And Teva has indicated that it planned additional deals.Meanwhile Pfizer, which is based in New York, has been looking beyond its dominant position in brand-name drugs to increase its presence in generics. In 2008 it created a division called the established products business unit to sell medications that have lost their patent protection. And in the last year, Pfizer has signed licensing agreements to distribute more than 200 products from three generic-drug makers based in India.That might help explain Pfizer’s interest in Ratiopharm.“If Pfizer were to end up with that, it would make people look more closely at generics,” said Christopher T. Schott, an analyst with J.P. Morgan.But other analysts questioned the logic of a Pfizer purchase of Ratiopharm.“What is the strategic rationale for Pfizer to do it?” said Ronny Gal, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. “Maybe they are just trying to stick it to Teva, telling Teva they are not going to get away with this at a lower price.”The VEM Group put Ratiopharm on sale last year after the suicide of Adolf Merckle, who founded the company in 1973.Last month, the American drug maker Cephalon said it would buy another Merckle family asset, the Swiss generic maker Mepha, for an estimated $590 million.In Germany, Ratiopharm is the second-largest generics purveyor, behind Hexal, a part of the Sandoz division of the Swiss drug maker Novartis, but just ahead of another local generic-drug maker, Stada Arzneimittel, analysts said.Ratiopharm specializes in drugs for cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous system and metabolic disorders as well as in anti-infective medications.Pfizer, Teva and Actavis each has its own reasons to be interested in Ratiopharm, analysts said.In a note to investors last week titled “Why Ratiopharm makes sense,” David Risinger of Morgan Stanley wrote that such a deal would help Pfizer move its blockbuster drugs into global generics channels when the patents on those drugs expire — as well as helping the American company expand its presence in emerging markets.Buying Ratiopharm would allow Teva to immediately own a major share of the German market, Mr. Steinberg of Deutsche Bank said.“They have the explicit goal of being among the top three in every country,” he said. Teva is among the top three generic companies in every major Western European country, he said, except Germany.Another motivation may be that Teva and Pfizer are accumulating cash that might yield more through acquisitions, said Mr. Gal of Sanford Bernstein.“It is making 0.5 percent interest in the bank,” he said of Pfizer. “Why not buy generics?”Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank, an Actavis creditor, is said to be financing Actavis’s bid for Ratiopharm, Mr. Huwald of M.M. Warburg said.“Actavis is in a high-debt position,” he said. “Is Actavis more driven by Actavis, or by Deutsche Bank, which is interested in improving the strategic position of Actavis by buying Ratiopharm?”Analysts are already speculating about what will happen after the Ratiopharm sale. Will a losing bidder make a play for Stada, a publicly traded company with a market capitalization of about $2.3 billion with headquarters in the mineral spring town of Bad Vilbel, Germany?“Three big sharks want to gain market share in Germany, and two will not be rewarded,” Mr. Huwald said. “The highest probability is that the bidder for Stada would be Pfizer.”'"
"'10-03-09,'1','Oil prices recovered steadily through most of last year, and peaked in early January at just under $84 a barrel. Some energy analysts say it is possible the price will break that level in the next several days, but there are few reasons to expect the price to rise to anywhere near the 2008 highs.Global crude oil inventories have been slowly declining. But domestic inventories have been climbing and remain well above the five-year average for this time of year.Gasoline supplies also remain ample, but prices at the pump have been rising along with oil prices. The average gallon of regular gas rose nearly a penny, to $2.75 on Monday, up from just over $2.70 a week ago and $2.66 a month ago, according to a report compiled by AAA, the motorists’ group.Gasoline prices typically go up in the spring as refiners retool and switch to more expensive summer blends of gasoline. Demand and prices were particularly low this winter because of cold and stormy weather, and experts say they believe many drivers will be keen to take to the highway as spring blooms.Still, high unemployment is keeping many commuters off the road, and putting a cap on discretionary driving.In early morning trading on Monday, oil prices surged above $82 a barrel, but retreated later to settle at $81.87 a barrel, the highest closing price since Jan. 11.“It remains to be seen whether we can hold $80, since we’ve failed to hold it five times in the past five months,” said Addison A. Armstrong, senior director for market research at Tradition Energy, an energy broker in Stamford, Conn. “Given the low level of demand, gasoline inventories certainly aren’t tightening.”Several international factors, however, are pushing oil prices higher. A Nigerian rebel group recently called off a three-month cease-fire, and attacks on oil production operations have resumed. In recent weeks, oil production in Nigeria has fallen by 85,000 barrels a day, more than 4 percent of normal output.Meanwhile, China is building storage plants to amass emergency reserves while prices remain relatively low, raising expectations that China may import as much as 15 percent more oil this year.There is little expectation that OPEC, the producers’ cartel, will alter supplies at its meeting later this month. The oil minister for Ecuador, Germanico A. Pinto, who is the current president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has said there is no need for members to cut shipments.“If you look at the narrow supply and demand fundamentals, markets would seem to be a little bit ahead of themselves,” said Lawrence J. Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation. “But if you look at the futures markets out six to 10 months, they are not pricing in exogenous events that are likely to occur, like a hurricane or a crisis involving Iran.”For the oil industry, higher prices are naturally good news. Industry executives said they would encourage investment in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, and offset the impact of low natural gas prices.“It certainly helps the cash flow,” said Rodney L. Waller, a senior vice president of Range Resources, an oil and gas company in Fort Worth. “It certainly helps you take the added cash, reinvest and grow your company.”'"

"'10-03-10,'1','With about 10 days to go before the next round of bids are due, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is still considering other options to help reorganize its almost $4 billion debt load. The options include a potential stand-alone bankruptcy plan, people with direct knowledge of the matter said Tuesday.MGM put itself up for sale last fall as part of an effort to pay off the debt it took on in a $5 billion leveraged buyout in 2004. Its 4,000-title film library and rights to the James Bond series and “The Hobbit” have attracted the eye of rival studios and private equity firms. But potential buyers have signaled that they were willing to pay only about $1.5 billion or so.That may lead to MGM considering filing for a prearranged bankruptcy that would involve its creditors taking over the studio in exchange for forgiving their debt, these people said.MGM has been working on potential alternatives to a sale for some time, having hired advisers like the boutique investment bank Moelis & Company and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. In August, it hired the restructuring expert Stephen F. Cooper to help lead the company.While a forbearance agreement MGM has struck with its lenders will expire on March 31, the company is likely to seek yet another extension of that agreement, one of these people said. But the studio must also contend with a $250 million revolving credit facility that matures early next month, this person added.Any final decision is likely to come after March 31, this person said. An MGM spokeswoman, Susan Arons, declined to comment.MGM has faced several complications in its efforts to reorganize its debt. Its lender group has about 140 members, led by JPMorgan Chase.'"

"'10-03-10,'1','Trying to prevent the kind of brinkmanship that had ABC removing its affiliate station from millions of New York area homes hours before the Oscar broadcast, a group of television providers asked the government Tuesday to revamp the rules governing the retransmission of stations.In a petition to the Federal Communications Commission and in a letter to Congressional leaders, the providers — including heavyweights like DirecTV, Time Warner Cable and Verizon, as well as smaller providers and nonprofit groups — said the current rules were “broken and in need of repair.”The regulations date to 1992 and ensured that cable providers would carry over-the-air stations. Now that more of those stations are asking to be paid by the providers, the same way that cable-only channels are paid, the cable and satellite industries believe that the rules give the stations far too much leverage.During contentious negotiations, stations can withhold their signals from the providers, as the ABC station did for nearly 21 hours on Sunday until a tentative deal was struck between Cablevision and ABC’s parent, the Walt Disney Company.The F.C.C. had no immediate comment about the petition Tuesday evening. The commission has largely resisted intervening in recent disputes between local stations and the cable and satellite companies that carry them, and it is unclear what legal authority it has in the matter.The retransmission rules “have repercussions for what Americans can view and how much they pay for it,” Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote in a letter last week to the F.C.C. chairman, Julius Genachowski. Mr. Kerry, who has been vocal about the cable fee issue, asserted that the current rules were outdated, adding, “we need to fix the system.”Cablevision was one of the petitioners on Tuesday. The providers are asking the F.C.C. to allow for the government to step in more firmly during retransmission disputes, using a tool like mandatory arbitration or an “expert tribunal.” They also want the F.C.C. to require stations to keep sending a signal as long as the provider “continues to negotiate in good faith.”'"
"'10-03-10,'1','But even among policy makers, the exact role of credit-default swaps — which essentially provide insurance in the event a company or government defaults on its debts — remains the subject of fierce debate. Germany’s financial services regulator, known as BaFin, said Tuesday that despite all the hand-wringing it had found no evidence that speculators were using swaps to bet aggressively against Greece. Instead, BaFin said, the evidence suggested that most investors were trying to use the instruments to hedge their risks, much the way farmers use futures to guard against a sudden plunge in crop prices.But in a speech in New York, Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, singled out credit-default swaps as directly contributing to the financial crisis and needing comprehensive reform.“The 2008 financial crisis had many chapters, but credit-default swaps played a lead role throughout the story,” he said. “We need broad regulatory reform of over-the-counter derivatives to best lower risk and promote transparency in the marketplace.” He said credit-default swaps had “unique features that require additional consideration.”The criticism of credit-default swaps stems, in part, from the multiple and at times seemingly conflicted roles that investment banks like Goldman Sachs often play in the markets.Over the last decade, Goldman and others helped the Greek government legally mask its debts so the nation appeared to comply with budget rules governing its membership in the euro, Europe’s common currency. In that role, Goldman advised Greece and, in return, collected hundreds of millions of dollars in fees from Athens.But, just as the true extent of Greece debts began to worry investors, Goldman put on another hat. Last July, it sent clients a 48-page primer on credit-default swaps entitled “C.D.S. 101.” The report said that credit-default swaps enabled investors “to short credit easily” — that is, to bet against certain borrowers. The report made no mention of Greece.Goldman followed up with its August report, issued by its hedge fund research unit, which said the price of swaps “may be too cheap as it may underestimate the risks to developed countries who have recently issued large amounts of debt.”“Buy C.D.S. of developed sovereigns,” the report said. Again, no countries were singled out.Despite such advice, Goldman promptly went back to work for the Greek government. Since last September, the bank played a role in underwriting more than $33 billion of new bonds for Greece, Spain and Britain, according to data compiled by Dealogic. Those three countries are among the most heavily indebted developed nations, as measured by their debts relative to economic output.Goldman, in a statement, said its reports merely outlined a variety of trading strategies. The bank said it saw no conflicts in its various roles.“It is not a conflict to sell new products on behalf of clients while suggesting to other clients, who may have different opinions and objectives, that they may want to buy insurance to protect themselves,” Goldman said.Andrew Ang, a finance and economics professor at Columbia Business School, said banks typically tried to maximize their profits across a range of businesses, and that he saw no conflict in Goldman Sachs’s approach.Still, others warn that credit-default swaps have evolved from what was essentially an insurance product into instruments of pure speculation.'"

"'10-03-10,'1','For two months, Mr. Jiang has been mostly known as the grainy figure seen ducking under a security rope after a Transportation Security Administration officer left his post. On Tuesday, he shared his version of events that afternoon and in the days that followed.A native of China, he moved to the United States in 2004 to study and met his girlfriend about a year ago at Rutgers University. She has since moved to California. He said little about her except that she is also Chinese and 26, and that they were still very much an item.The lovebirds did the town over the Christmas holidays: shopping in SoHo, visiting the tree at Rockefeller Center, celebrating New Year’s Eve in Times Square — the works. On Jan. 3, he watched her pass through security, but he wanted to spend more time with her. When he noticed the officer leave his post, he saw his chance, he said.“I saw her at the exit,” he said in nearly fluent English. “At that moment, I’m very excited for her. I didn’t realize the consequences.”He slipped under the rope and kissed her and, arm in arm, walked her to her Continental Airlines gate and saw her onto the jetway. “And immediately I left,” he said. There was no commotion in the terminal when he drove away to his home in Piscataway, he said.He does not spend much time following the news, he said — he is working to earn his doctorate degree in the field of biology, seeking a cure for eye ailments like glaucoma and cataracts. So it was two days before he heard about the evacuation at the airport. He was unfazed. “I only know it’s maybe caused by a camera problem,” he said. “I didn’t know it was me.”Three days passed. “Friday, the police found me,” he said. He was at the gym when his roommate called to say two police officers were at their home. Reality finally dawned on the budding scientist: “It’s not right to enter the airport. Immediately I know the police want to ask me this thing.”They showed him a picture from the video and took him to a police station, where he told his story, he said. “I say, ‘I just want to spend more time with my girlfriend.’ ”When the officers released him that night, his roommate said their front lawn had become something of a circus. “They tell me many media people were at my house,” he said. Rattled, he stayed with a friend. He called his girlfriend right away. “She was worried about me,” he said.He quickly came to realize the high cost, in hours of people’s lives, that his actions brought. “I feel guilty about this,” he said. “I’m trying to apologize for any inconvenience caused by my mistake. It’s a big mistake.”His actions prompted some to suggest that Mr. Jiang should be deported or face federal charges.“I never face this situation before; I try to do my best to fix the problem,” Mr. Jiang went on, by getting a lawyer and admitting his mistake.He does not type his name into search engines: the sheer number of hits is overwhelming.He anticipates serving half of his community service in a soup kitchen — “I like to cook” — and the other half in a hospital or some sort of nonprofit agency. He flew to California without incident for Valentine’s Day. He and his girlfriend talk for 2,000 minutes a month, he said, mostly late at night. He plans on moving to California to be with her and work in a laboratory after completing his degree in May or June.She has no plans to return to New York. Her Christmas visit, despite its frightening postscript, still brings a smile to Mr. Jiang’s face.“We had a lot of fun in those days,” he said.'"

He approached from all directions, absorbing fouls and charging hard at a soft Blue Demons zone when the Bulls settled into a halfcourt set.At one point, he outscored his counterparts, 14-11.That was in the first half. DePaul deterred Jones’s path better in the second half, but South Florida marched into the Big East tournament’s second round with a 58-49 win Tuesday. Jones finished with 20 points, 9 rebounds, 4 steals and 4 assists.“We tried to go zone,” said DePaul’s interim coach, Tracy Webster. “They scored a lot when there were breakdowns in the paint.”Jones added, “I think that I turned it up and then everybody else turned it up.”Ninth-seeded South Florida (20-11) will face Georgetown (20-9) on Wednesday afternoon at Madison Square Garden. The Bulls, who beat Georgetown last month, 72-64, probably need at least one more win to be in consideration for an N.C.A.A. tournament berth.

"'10-03-10,'1','The Chevron Corporation said on Tuesday that it would cut 2,000 jobs this year and sell some overseas operations as it revamped its struggling oil refinery, marketing and transportation operations.The job cuts represent almost 12 percent of its 17,000 workers in the so-called downstream part of its business and just over 3 percent of its overall work force.Executives are still deciding where and when they will eliminate the jobs as they work to complete the reorganization by the third quarter, a spokesman, Lloyd Avram, said. Additional cuts are expected next year.Chevron said it would also seek bids for its Pembroke refinery in southwest Wales, and fuels marketing, aviation and lubricants businesses in the Caribbean and some markets in Central America.Oil refineries, which turn crude into gasoline, diesel and other fuels, struggled amid rising oil prices and falling demand last year.

"'10-03-10,'1','TRENTON (AP) — Two of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies said on Tuesday that they were uniting their animal health businesses in a move to become the largest supplier of veterinary medicines.The two firms, Merck & Company and Sanofi-Aventis, said they would jointly own the business, which would control about 29 percent of the $19 billion annual global market for medicines for pets and livestock. That is well ahead of the current leader, Pfizer’s Fort Dodge unit, which has about 20 percent of the market.The joint venture will combine Sanofi’s Merial animal health business, the maker of the Frontline flea and tick treatment and Heartgard for preventing heartworm infection, with Merck’s Intervet/Schering-Plough unit, which makes vaccines and drugs mostly for farm animals. Merial operates mostly in North America and South America, while Intervet sells in Europe and emerging markets.Last year, Merial had sales of about $2.55 billion and Intervet had $2.74 billion, for a total of $5.3 billion.The chief executive of Merck, Richard T. Clark, noted their products and countries of operation were complementary, adding that anticipated growth would bolster resources for research.The chief executive of Sanofi-Aventis, Christopher A. Viehbacher, said the animal health market was expected to grow 5 percent a year through 2014, fueled by multiple trends.'"

"'10-03-11,'1','There are plenty of services like this online-SugarSync, for example-but they're not free. I'd venture that they're not even as simple.Here's how to set it up. Suppose, in this example, that you have a PC at work and a Mac at home. Suppose, furthermore, that you've already signed up for a free Windows Live account (www.live.com).On each computer, visit https://sync.live.com/clientdownload.aspx. Download and install the little Live Sync app. It puts a tiny Sync icon on your menu bar (Mac) or system tray (PC).Now sit at the PC and sign into the Sync Web site (http://sync.live.com). Click ""Create a personal folder."" Navigate to the folder on your hard drive that you want to sync; select it by opening it, right there on the Sync Web page, and then clicking ""Sync folder here."" (You can also create a new folder at this point.)You're shown a list of the computers on which you've installed the Sync program (and that are turned on and online). Click the one you want this folder to sync with, and then, on the ""Select a folder"" screen, specify which folder on the Mac you want synced with the PC folder you chose. Finally, choose either Automatic or On-demand synchronization, and click Finish.And that is all. When you add, change, or delete anything in a synced folder on one machine, it's automatically updated on the other, over the Internet. It's totally great for keeping the latest versions of everything accessible at all times. And it has a lot of fans among my readers.As a handy side effect, Live Sync lets you grab files from any of your computers, from the Web site, even from folders you haven't set up for syncing. Left the Smithers presentation at the office, and now you're on-site at the client's place? No problem. You're covered.You can also make certain folders available to family members and coworkers, making the whole thing even more useful.The fine print: You can synchronize up to 20 folders, each containing up to 20,000 files, max. Files can't be larger than 4 gigabytes each. Files can be synced with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Macs. Microsoft recommends that you don't sync your Outlook mail stash, because it's an enormous file that's constantly changing.This, by the way, isn't even the end of the story. The next-generation Microsoft free sycning software is called Windows Live Mesh. It's roughly the same idea, but it's even more powerful and complicated. It creates a Web-based ""desktop"" with 5 gigabytes of storage-and your Macs, PCs, smartphones, and even authorized friends can sync up to it.Clearly, Microsoft is aiming to be the leader in giving away that syncing feeling. And it's doing a darned good job.'"

"'10-03-11,'1','Asked Wednesday evening to explain the apparent inconsistency, the panel’s chairwoman, Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor, said only that “this was a four-person panel” and that the report’s language represented a consensus. She declined to state her personal view on the bailout.The report said that the Treasury Department had yet to require the company to put forward a plan for returning to profitability and fully repaying taxpayers.In a statement Wednesday evening, the Treasury restated its previous arguments for the necessity of the rescue, saying it was ""the least costly and least disruptive of all the options available.""The government owns a 56.3 percent stake in GMAC, which started in 1919 as the in-house financing arm of G.M. and was spun off in 2006. It is now projected that $6.3 billion from the bailouts, which were provided in December 2008 and in May and December 2009, may never be repaid.Along with the Treasury money, GMAC also used emergency loan programs run by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.The panel found that the Treasury treated GMAC with greater lenience than it did G.M. and Chrysler: it did not wipe out GMAC’s equity holders, require GMAC to plot a return to viability, or prod the company to use taxpayer money to increase consumer lending.And the panel found that while the rescue of GMAC helped support the American auto industry, it also reinforced GMAC’s dominance over the revolving lines of credit used by auto dealers.The report details, among other developments, the company’s collapse at the hands of a subsidiary called ResCap, which became one of the largest originators and servicers of mortgages.Witnesses who addressed the panel said GMAC’s major mistake was taking advantage of and leveraging its high credit rating to move away from automotive financing and diversify into other areas such as mortgage lending, the report said.Indeed, in a conference call in January, Michael A. Carpenter, GMAC’s chief executive, called the mortgage unit “a millstone around the company’s neck.”The Treasury has said that the initial bailout was needed to prop up the auto industry, and that the subsequent ones were deemed necessary after GMAC took part in the “stress tests” ordered by the Fed, even though it “might appear that good money was being thrown after bad.”The panel found that “half-hearted attempts at saving an institution from insolvency that lack coordination among regulators” might be more costly than a full bailout or bankruptcy.The report also found that the commitment to GMAC arguably outlasted its the economic justification and that Treasury’s reasons for not allowing GMAC to fail were not totally persuasive.”'"
"'10-03-11,'1','PepsiCo is raising prices on its Tropicana orange juice because of the deep freeze that hurt much of Florida’s citrus crop, the company said Wednesday.PepsiCo said it was shrinking its most popular size by about 8 percent, while maintaining its price, and raising the price on another size starting in May.The 64-ounce container of orange juice will drop to 59 ounces. The suggested retail price will remain at $3.59.The price of Tropicana’s gallon container of pure premium orange juice will rise from 5 percent to 8 percent. The suggested retail price now is $6.49.Citrus growers in Florida, the nation’s top orange producer, are struggling because of freezes this winter. This year’s orange crop is expected to be 19 percent smaller than last year’s, according to a report from the Agriculture Department on Wednesday.Florida had eight consecutive days of below-freezing temperatures in January. Growers said it was an unseasonably long freeze, though the damage was less than expected. Some of the oranges that survived are expected to be smaller than normal.

"'10-03-11,'1','The struggling British music company EMI announced on Wednesday that Elio Leoni-Sceti, the chief executive of its recorded music division, will step down at the end of March after less than two years in the job.The company gave no reason for Mr. Leoni-Sceti’s unexpected departure, but named Charles Allen as its new executive chairman. Mr. Allen had been the nonexecutive chairman at EMI Music since early last year, helping put much of the company’s leadership in place. He will now oversee the day-to-day operations.Mr. Allen, 53, a former chief executive at the British television company ITV and an adviser to Goldman Sachs, said in an interview that EMI’s board thought he offered “a unique combination of skills that the company needed at this stage.”Guy Hands, the chairman of the private equity firm Terra Firma, brought Mr. Leoni-Sceti to EMI in 2008, a year after Terra bought the music company. Terra Firma has fought an uphill battle since the purchase, as the company’s debt load from the deal, combined with declining sales across the industry, have put it on the verge of defaulting on its $5.2 billion loan from Citigroup.Although EMI Music’s revenue has increased under Mr. Leoni-Sceti, the improvement has not generated enough money to cover the debt payments. Talk of a possible sale of the company, either piecemeal or as a whole, is widespread in the industry.Mr. Allen said his top prioritywas developing a business plan to persuade investors to inject money into the company.'"
"'10-03-11,'1','But Boeing’s airplane operations “are definitely on the mend,” he added.Still, Boeing’s latest contract win could come at a price. It has angered European leaders, creating new tensions over disputes about subsidies for Airbus, which had teamed up with Northrop in the tanker bidding.European officials have criticized the Obama administration’s handling of the tanker competition as politically motivated, aimed principally at protecting American jobs.“This has gone beyond acceptable,” Pierre Lellouche, France’s European Affairs Minister, told Reuters, adding that he did not consider the matter to be closed.The decision by Northrop and Airbus’s parent, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, to drop out of the bidding undermines President Obama’s efforts to increase competition for military contracts.Military analysts said that Pentagon officials would try to keep Boeing from pushing up its price for the tankers in the final negotiations.But Jacques S. Gansler, who was the Pentagon’s top acquisition official in the Clinton administration, said that even if the military could hold down the price now, Boeing could be able to raise it in the future if there was no competitive pressure.As soon as the Pentagon makes the first changes in the planes or the number it is ordering, he said, that “will give Boeing justification to say, ‘O.K., but it will cost you more.’ ”Analysts say Boeing’s victory also suggests it has rebuilt its political influence since the Air Force’s first attempt to replace its aging tankers collapsed in 2004 amid corruption charges involving a proposed leasing deal with Boeing.Northrop and EADS then teamed up to compete with Boeing, and the two sides had waged an almost operatic struggle since then. Northrop and EADS upset Boeing in a competition in 2008, only to have the award overturned after Boeing protested that its rivals had unfairly received extra points for offering a larger plane.But instead of just tweaking those parts of the rules, Pentagon officials came up with a new approach to scoring the bids that was meant to be more objective.Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington State, where Boeing assembles many of its planes, said in an interview that he insisted the Pentagon consider how much the smaller Boeing plane would save in fuel and other costs over 40 years, rather than just over 25 years, as in the earlier competition.Referring to Northrop and EADS, he added, “I think those factors alone made it almost impossible for them to win.”Ralph Crosby, the chairman of EADS North America, told WKRG-TV in Mobile, Ala., that these and other changes amounted to “a very bad set of Department of Defense decisions” that negated any advantages the larger plane could offer.If it had won the tanker contract, EADS would have built its first American plant in Mobile. But it is now dropping plans for that factory, which also would have made freight planes, thus sparing Boeing from another threat.Northrop has also tried to put the Pentagon on the spot, pointing out that taxpayers should expect to pay less for Boeing’s smaller plane than the $184 million that the larger Airbus tanker would have cost in 2008.Mr. Dicks, who recently became chairman of a House subcommittee that oversees the Pentagon budget, said the smaller Boeing plane could handle nearly all of the Pentagon’s fuel deliveries. He also said Boeing had told him it would bid “as if it is still in a competitive mode.”Whatever the final price, the contract will be a boon to Boeing in many ways.Its tanker will be based on its 767 passenger jet, which is being replaced by the Dreamliner. So the Air Force contract will allow it to maintain that production line in Everett, Wash., and add thousands of workers there and in Kansas, where it will also work on the planes. That could help ease some recent tensions with labor unions.James F. Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division, said the tanker should eventually bring in up to $3 billion a year in revenue.Boeing persuaded Congress to approve $2.5 billion worth of additional C-17 cargo planes last year, and delays in Lockheed Martin’s new F-35 fighter jet could force the Pentagon to buy more of Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornets.Pentagon officials plan to phase out those planes, however, and the tanker program will enable Boeing to offset much of the lost revenue.Mr. Albaugh said in an interview on Monday that Boeing’s commercial airline business was also starting to look up as the recession eased. He said Boeing was considering increases in the production rates for its 737 and 777 passenger jets.He also said that the Dreamliner — which is critical to Boeing’s future profits — had performed well in its initial flight tests, with the first delivery still scheduled for December.'"
"'10-03-11,'1','Brandon Richardson scored 19 points and No. 12 seed Nebraska took command with an early 16-1 run and shocked No. 5 seed Missouri, 75-60, Wednesday in an opening-round upset at the Big 12 tournament in Kansas City, Mo.The Cornhuskers (15-17), who had won just 2 of 16 Big 12 regular-season games, outrebounded, outshot and outhustled the team that had easily beaten them twice this year.After Kim English pulled the Tigers (22-10) to 61-51 with a pair of free throws with 4 minutes 1 second to play, Richardson hit a long 3-pointer, drew a foul from Zaire Taylor and made the free throw for a 4-point play that clinched it.Laurence Bowers had 11 points for Missouri, the defending Big 12 tournament champion.In another Big 12 opener, Damion James had 28 points and 16 rebounds, and sixth-seeded Texas (24-8) pulled away from plucky Iowa State, 82-75. James had 3 points, 3 rebounds and an assist during an 11-0 run that turned a 1-point lead into a 12-point spread.In other Big 12 openers: Keiton Page scored 19 of his 24 points in a dominating first half, and Oklahoma State (22-9) withstood a brief rally in the season’s third Bedlam game to beat Oklahoma, 81-67; and John Roberson scored 19 points, Nick Okorie added 18 and Texas Tech (17-14) overcame a sloppy start defensively to beat Colorado, 82-67.'"
"'10-03-11,'1','Baseball is especially suspicious of the role of independent agents in the country, called buscones, who train young players until they can sign as professionals at age 16. Buscones often demand half of players’ signing bonuses from teams and have been known to advise players on taking performance-enhancing drugs as well as lying about their age in order to be more attractive prospects.Baseball officials used the extreme measure of subjecting unsigned Dominican players to DNA tests last year to make certain they were not lying about their ages — a practice they have since halted in the wake of harsh public criticism.“It’s not a one-way street; these are mutual problems that have to be dealt with comprehensively,” Alderson said. “Not all the problems originate with the Dominican Republic and buscones. There are people on the team side who are playing a role in aiding this.”Alderson, a veteran of the Vietnam War and a graduate of Harvard Law School, was the general manager of the Oakland Athletics from 1983 to 1997. He oversaw field operations for the commissioner’s office from 1998 to 2005 and was most recently a top executive of the San Diego Padres.“Given Sandy’s career and his ability to deal with complex problems, he is the right person,” Selig said in a telephone interview. “You don’t have to draw any maps for him, he knows how to proceed.”Alderson said some of the first steps would be restructuring Major League Baseball’s office in Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital. He said the office’s director had been dismissed. He intends to develop measures to exercise more oversight of scouts and executives of major league teams doing business in the country and to expand educational programs informing players about the perils of performance-enhancing drugs.Baseball plans to create its own youth baseball program in the country, Alderson said, and will consider fingerprinting prospects to keep track of them as they work their way through the system.“People expressed to me here, they are proud of the place the Dominican Republic holds in professional baseball and proud of what they have produced,” Alderson said. “But there is also genuine embarrassment about those who use substances or turn out to be who they did not claim.”John Mirabelli, the assistant general manager of scouting operations for the Cleveland Indians, praised baseball for its recent efforts in the Dominican Republic. But he added: “Nothing really seems to have acted as a deterrent, because it keeps on happening — the false ages, the false identities. So I think that’s going to be his biggest challenge, is changing a culture. It’s hard to do anywhere.”Baseball is still trying to figure out how to verify the ages of players and may suggest that players and their families undergo private DNA testing that they can submit to Major League Baseball along with other age documentation.“We have a significant problem here,” Alderson said. “We have to figure out what is appropriate legally, and we want to be recognized as a good corporate citizen, and we want a positive reputation. Does something like DNA testing undermine that? It very well might.”Although baseball is by far the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic, Alderson and Major League Baseball have no legal standing in the country and will need cooperation from the government.Charles S. Farrell, a former editor and reporter for The Washington Post who produces a newsletter on sports in the Dominican Republic and is trying to build a baseball academy there, said local officials “don’t want somebody telling them how to change the system.”“The biggest mistake would be for Sandy Alderson to come down here with some sort of agenda without putting together some sort of coalition,” Farrell said.Alderson said he would try to strike the right tone when he speaks with members of the news media, government officials and business leaders.“We have to be good corporate citizens here,” he said.'"
"'10-03-11,'1','The agency would gather data from the largest firms and from a broad set of market participants, including all United States-based financial institutions, which would be required to report all their financial transactions, regardless of whether the counterparty was based here or abroad. The agency would take steps to safeguard proprietary trading information, while also shining a light onto the so-called shadow banking system of mortgage brokers, subprime lenders and unregulated hedge funds that contributed to the financial crisis.The financial reform bill approved last year by the House would create a systemic risk council that would collect similar data without establishing an independent agency, a difference that will have to be resolved before a bill is sent to the president.A group called the Committee to Establish the National Institute of Finance — made up of current and former financial executives, statisticians and economists, including six Nobel laureates in economics — has been lobbying for such an agency for much of the last year.Allan I. Mendelowitz, a former director of the Federal Housing Finance Board who was a founder of the group, said in an interview that regulators were unable to assess expanding risk in the recent crisis in part because they relied on independent contractors, like the credit rating agencies, for data.If a security was rated triple-A by the ratings agencies, for example, as were many mortgage-backed securities, regulators wrongly assumed that it posed little systemic risk, Mr. Mendelowitz said.The agency would require a vast array of computing capacity, supporters said, and it would probably take a couple of years to establish data standards and build analytical models. But it could immediately begin to assess counterparty risk based on existing data.Senate negotiators also tentatively agreed to establish a $50 billion fund to finance the dissolution of failing firms that could not be rescued through bankruptcy proceedings. The fund is intended to support companies that are forced to wind down their operations, without having to resort to taxpayer bailouts.People who have been briefed on the negotiations said two proposals were under consideration. One would require financial companies to pay into a fund upfront and the other would have them buy interest-bearing shares in a trust that would allow the firms to keep the assets on their balance sheet.Also on Wednesday, five Senate Democrats, including two members of the Senate Banking Committee, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, introduced a bill that would ban deposit-taking banks from owning or investing in hedge funds or private equity funds and from making market bets for the company’s own benefit.President Obama put forward the idea in January and called it the Volcker Rule, in recognition of its champion, Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman.The bill has been endorsed by John S. Reed, a former Citigroup chairman; the economist Joseph E. Stiglitz; and Robert B. Reich, a former labor secretary, among others. But it faces significant resistance in Congress and is unlikely to be part of the revised bill that is expected to be introduced this month by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Banking Committee.'"
"'10-03-11,'1','And in cities like New York, where neighbors are often separated only by bricks and mortar, one person’s infestation is everybody’s problem, since bedbugs can crawl through walls and along wiring and pipes, and hitchhike on clothing, furniture, luggage and more. In this city of 8.3 million, it seems as if everyone has a bedbug story.Just ask Gale A. Brewer, a self-appointed bedbug evangelist and a City Council member from the Upper West Side. She prodded the Mayor’s office to convene a bedbug advisory committee last fall, after years of what she and others felt were woeful public policy inadequacies in the face of the relentless advances of what some have called “the pest of the century.” (The committee — entomologists, civic policy experts and advocates for children, the elderly and others — will issue its recommendations next month.)The breadth and scope of the problem has been captured anecdotally in anguished tales — the family living in a tent outside their lovely-but-infested home, the woman in the Upper West Side one-bedroom who spent $9,500 on extermination and lived out of plastic bags, at friends’ apartments, for three months — posted on blogs like bedbugger and newyorkvsbedbugs, the likes of which have been spreading like, well, bedbugs, over the last few years. They are told over and over at community board hearings presided over by Ms. Brewer and others, and recorded in mainstream media. Another picture, though still incomplete, comes from the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which has been tracking bedbug complaints and violations through calls to the 311 help line. Consider that six years ago, there were 537 bedbug complaints and 82 violations (in other words, verified infestations); last year, complaints topped out at nearly 11,000, with 4,084 violations cited (nearly double that of the previous year).But the complaints registered with the department and 311 relate only to rental properties; reports of bedbugs scampering through the private sanctums of hotels, co-ops and condos, colleges and office buildings remain largely uncounted, though real estate lawyers and brokers report that co-op minutes reveal a world that’s just as infested as the rest of the city.In the last three months, and for the first time in her 21-year career, for example, Lori Braverman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, advised buyers she was representing in three deals to inspect apartments they were in contract for, having noted in the co-op boards’ minutes instances of bedbugs in their buildings. “One was described as a ‘significant infestation,’” she said. “It’s the deep, dark secret of co-ops and condos.” (All three checked out clean, including a classic five on the Upper West Side inspected by Cruiser.) Still, as Ms. Brewer said darkly, “Those bugs are everywhere.”After a day or two with Cruiser, one would have to agree.NINE-THIRTY in the morning in Borough , Brooklyn, at the home of a family of seven, two of them still in diapers: the family was poised to move to a new house, their things in boxes, the rooms askew, to the horror of the mother, who had to welcome a reporter and a photographer into the pre-move disarray. (Like all the bedbug sufferers in this story, she asked not to be identified because of the stigma surrounding the pests.)Cruiser had been invited because the mother had found a dead bedbug floating in the bath of one child the night before, and she wanted to make sure, if there was an infestation, that it didn’t travel to their new home. The house next door had had a problem, she said, and she knew bedbugs travel easily through walls. All this was related to Mr. Ecker, while Oscar , his colleague, waited outside with Cruiser.“I don’t want to know the details,” Mr. Rincon said later, lest the knowledge affect his body language and interfere with the dog’s inspection.Mr. Rincon, 42, is an old friend of Mr. Ecker’s who worked for years at the North Shore Animal League. He and Mr. Ecker, Cruiser and his partner, a beagle called Freedom, were all trained for their work at J&K Canine Academy in High Springs, Fla., where rescue dogs are schooled in the scent detection of termites, bedbugs, bombs, some cancers and canker, a scourge on citrus crops. The school has an ongoing relationship with the University of Florida, which has been testing its results.In two weeks training with Cruiser and Freedom, Mr. Ecker and Mr. Rincon learned how to hide live of bedbugs — little gangs of bugs tucked into vials fitted with mesh covers, so the scent can travel, but the bugs stay put — and work with the dogs in constantly changing scenarios (hiding bugs in high cupboards, in drawers, under rugs and so forth). Like all scent-detecting dogs, Cruiser and Freedom work for food; put another way, they are fed only when they find their target, which keeps them accurate and keen on their jobs.This poses challenges, however, for a dog handler. Back home in Fresh Meadows, , Mr. Ecker discovered pretty quickly that his new career required an extreme lifestyle commitment. Not only would he have to live with bedbugs to train and feed his new roommates, Cruiser and Freedom, he would have to feed the bugs, too. Remember that dinner for a bedbug is a nice long quaff of human blood; Mr. Ecker rolled up a sleeve to reveal a horrifying tattoo of old bites. (Bedbugs don’t carry disease, but their bites can itch like crazy.)Happily, the bugs need to eat only once a month or less, he said. “It’s not so bad. You can hardly feel it.”A few days later at his home, Mr. Ecker demonstrated, tipping a vial of bugs onto his forearm, which the critters latched on to like hungry newborns, their bodies quickly with blood. Meanwhile, Mr. Rincon was cleaning vials, ensuring that the dogs learn to detect only live bugs and eggs. He swept the debris — bedbug feces, maybe some eggs — into plastic cups, which he filled with water and stuck in the freezer, since extreme temperatures are proven bug snuffers.“You have to be very focused,” Mr. Ecker said. “You can’t sneeze, or answer the phone. The cat has to be out of the room. Want to try?”BACK in Borough Park, Cruiser had started to work. Mr. Rincon wiped his paws with a towel and began leading him around the house. The family’s boxed possessions, stacked in the basement, were quickly vetted. But a wooden crib in a child’s room gave Cruiser pause. The father turned it back to front and the dog began pawing the mattress, signaling an alert. (What Cruiser does is detect the scent of a bug or an egg; it’s up to an exterminator, said Mr. Ecker, to visually confirm the presence of bedbugs in the spots a dog has noted.)The mother exhaled slowly. “That’s where my 2 ½-year-old sleeps,” she said. She had the expression, a sort of satisfied wince, familiar to parents everywhere, when a nagging suspicion — the toe is broken, the teeth need braces, the itchy scalp is really — has been confirmed.Returning Cruiser to a crate in the back of his white Subaru Outback, Mr. Ecker, who had been in the extermination business for six years, reflected on his new career. Since he and Mr. Rincon returned from in September, they’ve done hundreds of inspections. Despite the ick factor, “it’s very rewarding work,” he said. “We get to walk dogs for a living and we help people get peace of mind.”Mr. Rincon added: “We see people who literally haven’t slept for weeks. They think everything is a bedbug. At a place in Jersey, the wife was a total wreck. She’d saved 15 samples of stuff, thinking it was bedbugs.”It was mostly lint, as it turned out.A mother of 7-month-old in a bedroom community outside of New York was not so lucky. It was Cruiser’s last stop of the day; after Borough Park, he’d inspected a Midtown office and an apartment in Riverdale. Both were bedbug-free, the day’s happy endings. Outside the city, the rain was still coming down in sheets. A Manhattan-dwelling relative of the mother had had bedbugs, perhaps the source, she said, of her house’s infestation, which she had had heat-treated, at a cost of $5,000. (Many sufferers with animals or young children choose this nontoxic method, in which very hot air is channeled into a space.)She and her husband and their young family had decamped to a hotel. Back in her pristinely renovated 19th-century brick row house a week later, however, she was convinced she was being bitten again. The woman extended a graceful bare foot with a large, angry welt on the arch. She had called the pest control company she had used, but they were backed up on inspections and couldn’t promise a dog for another week. “I can’t wait that long,” she said.When Cruiser arrived, he greeted the woman by placing his paws on her knees.“Does that mean I’ve got them?” she wondered. “I feel like one big bug. If I can get through this, having twins isn’t going to be an issue.”Cruiser spent 15 minutes at the house and alerted four times, scratching a parlor-floor loveseat, an upholstered side chair nearby, the mother’s side of the bed and a small black suitcase in a closet.The mother’s eyes welled. “I have to remember no one is sick, no one has ,” she said. “Is it possible, when we went to the hotel, I brought them with me and then brought them back?”Cruiser insinuated his wet nose into the reporter’s hand, and she scratched his silky ears.Back in the car, she wondered: Shouldn’t the mother wrap the couch, the chair and the suitcase in plastic? What about her mattress? Does the inspection mean that heat treatment doesn’t work? Should the reporter, who had taken off her muddy boots in the house, throw away her socks?Mr. Ecker shook his head. “What if I tell her to do one thing and it contradicts the pest-control company’s plans?” he said, referring to the client. “There’s nothing wrong with heat. There’s more than one way to cut apples.”He added: “We’ve never taken a bug home with us. They’re not like . They don’t jump on you.”Bedbugs need time to get to know you, he explained. A short visit to a bedbug lair poses no risks. Still, as Mr. Rincon pointed out, “I never sit down.”In the last several years, infestations have increased exponentially in , but so have the resources to deal with them. The city offers a guide at nyc.gov. , a blog, is a Baedeker for treatment and a group memoir; focuses more on city policies than remediation.Think you have bedbugs? Bites might be the first sign, but not everyone reacts the same way: on some they look like or , on others mosquito bites and some people don’t react at all. Once you’ve met a bedbug, though, you won’t mistake it for anything else. The bugs look different at each life stage: the eggs are clear and the size of a pencil point, the babies are semi-transparent and poppy seed-size and adults are rust-colored and as big as an apple seed.

"'10-03-11,'1','In recent years, amateur hockey in North America and the international game have moved to outlaw checks to the head.“Basically, we’re taking a completely legal hit now, with the shoulder, and saying next year that’s going to be an illegal hit if delivered to the head,” said Colin Campbell, the N.H.L. vice president for hockey operations. “Part 2 of that, which is a huge statement in the game, we’re shifting some of the responsibility from the player getting hit to the player delivering the hit.”Campbell said statistical input from concussion experts had helped persuade the general managers to propose the ban.Brian Burke, general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, called the rule a “slight culture shift.”“Now if you’re the hitter, you have to make a choice — you can still hit that guy, but you can’t target his head,” Burke said. “And sometimes you’re just going to have to avoid the hit altogether.”Burke is an advocate of physical hockey. But when asked if he thought players known for hitting might lose their jobs because of the new rule, he replied, “Good.”“If it’s a predatory act, if it’s a case where this is how a player is making his living, he should be making his living doing something else,” Burke said.Boston Bruins General Manager Peter Chiarelli spoke about a triangle of vision in which a player can see what is coming. Anything coming from outside that triangle, he said, leaves the player vulnerable and would be outlawed.Chiarelli said he was “a little emotional” on the subject because the Bruins’ top scorer, Marc Savard, sustained a concussion Sunday on a blindside shoulder check from Pittsburgh’s Matt Cooke.“There’s no specific rule on a shoulder hit to the head, regardless of intent to injure or not,” Chiarelli said about how the current rulebook pertains to the hit on Savard. “And that’s unfortunate.”Last year the players union called for a rule prohibiting all checks to the head.Brendan Shanahan, who retired as a player at the start of the season to become an N.H.L. vice president, said players would have little trouble adjusting to the new standard.“This is not something that managers and fans and the media have demanded on their own,” Shanahan said. “All you have to do is pick up a newspaper any day; players want certain types of hits gone from the game.”Glen Sather, the Rangers’ general manager, noted that the measure was an outgrowth of rules enacted in 2005 to speed up the game by cracking down on obstruction tactics.“The game has absolutely changed,” Sather said. “It is an evolution, and hockey is something that changes every day. You can’t hook, hold or interfere any longer, so your way of slowing players down is to hit them. But you have to hit them legally.”'"
"'10-03-11,'1','The Columbia-Greene Humane Society and Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, with the help of rescue groups, found homes for 96 of those horses. Six horses were too sick to recover and were euthanized.Ron Perez, president of the Columbia-Greene Humane Society/S.P.C.A, praised the prosecutor Terry Wilhelm for laying out a case that demonstrated Paragallo’s criminal neglect.“It was a good verdict, one that is going to be a precedent for animal cruelty cases across the nation,” he said.The raid and subsequent arrest of Paragallo last April stunned the thoroughbred industry and raised awareness of the plight of aging racehorses, especially in New York.In the days since, new retirement centers like Old Friends at Cabin Creek Farm outside Saratoga Springs, N.Y., have sprung up. Last week, the national A.S.P.C.A. announced a $1 million grant to six racehorse rescue groups.In New York, tighter regulations have been put in to bar horsemen who have committed inhumane acts. Last December, the New York Racing Association said it would bar any owners or trainers from competing at its racetracks if any of their horses were sold for slaughter.Paragallo was a well-known figure in New York racing, starting 4,686 runners and earning $20.6 million in purses. He also owns half of Unbridled’s Song, one of the most successful sires in thoroughbred racing, who commands a $100,000 stud fee.The New York State Racing and Wagering Board forced Paragallo to surrender his agent’s license shortly after he was arraigned; his daughters Kristen and Jennifer gave up their owners’ licenses, and most of the family racing stock has been sold.The episode has also changed the way the state’s breeding fund is administered. In 2009 the state’s Thoroughbred Breeding and Development Fund gave out $6.3 million in breeder awards and another $2.4 million in stallion awards. Over the past six years, Paragallo had collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fund.The racing and wagering board’s chairman, John D. Sabini, is also the chairman of the Thoroughbred Breeding and Development Fund. He has put in stringent inspection standards for the 400 farms participating in the program.“Racehorses — whether they are in training, retired from racing or in active competition at our tracks — must be properly cared for in accordance with the laws of the State of New York,” Sabini said in a statement.'"
"'10-03-11,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — Businesses trimmed inventories at the wholesale level again in January even though sales rose for a 10th month. The dip in inventories underscored that businesses remained cautious about restocking their depleted shelves.The Commerce Department said Wednesday that inventories at the wholesale level were reduced 0.2 percent in January after a 1 percent drop in December. Inventories were down 9.7 percent from a year ago, the report said.Sales were up 1.3 percent, the best showing since a 3.6 percent rise in November. Sales were up 10.5 percent from January a year ago.Economists are hoping that the steady gains in sales will prompt a sustained rebound in inventory restocking. That would set off increased factory production and provide support for the fledgling recovery.Analysts say that the stage has been set for such a rebound given how lean inventories are at present after a significant inventory liquidation during the recession. Inventories at the wholesale level have fallen for 13 consecutive months and have been down 15 of the last 17 months. The only gains in wholesale inventories occurred in October and November.With the January drop, the ratio of inventories to sales dipped to a record low of 1.10, meaning it would take 1.10 months to deplete inventories at the wholesale level given the January sales pace. That was the lowest point since the data series began in 1992.'"
"'10-03-11,'1','A renewed sense that Wall Street’s biggest financial companies had endured the worst of the economic downturn helped lead the stock market higher on Wednesday.Investors snapped up financial shares amid speculation that bailed-out companies were on track to report substantially improved balance sheets.

It was the second day of stunning gains for each company.“The bottom line is they are paying back their bailout money, and the economy has turned around,” said Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor of The Stock Trader’s Almanac. “They were extremely oversold, priced at bankruptcy levels, and that didn’t happen.”'"
"'10-03-11,'1','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — New election laws enacted by Myanmar’s military junta make a mockery of democracy and ensure that elections that are expected this year will be a farce, a State Department spokesman said Wednesday.The spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, said the new election measures, which set strict limits on political participation, undercut American efforts to improve ties with Myanmar, formerly Burma.“Given the tenor of the election laws that they’ve put forward, there’s no hope that this election will be credible,” Mr. Crowley said at a news briefing.“This is a step in the wrong direction,” he said, adding that the set of laws published in state-run newspapers in Myanmar this week “makes a mockery of the democratic process.”The laws would bar Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the country’s democracy movement, from joining a political party and running in a national election. They prohibit anyone with a criminal conviction from taking part. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was convicted of violating the terms of her house arrest by letting an uninvited American enter her home after he swam across a lake. The laws have been released in preparation for Myanmar’s first election in 20 years.'"

Truth be told, our rifles are the only things we think about more than sex.”Those are the words of First Lt. Mike Scotti, whose footage shot on his Mini-DV in the triumphal early days of the operation in Iraq forms the spine of Kristian Fraga’s documentary “Severe Clear.” That footage, some of it shot in the thick of combat, puts you in the boots of a Marine fighting in Iraq in 2003.More than the battle scenes filmed with a jiggling, hand-held camera, the profane, hyper-macho banter and roughhousing among the men in Lieutenant Scotti’s unit are what make you feel part of the experience. So do his complaints: about the awful food, lack of adequate body armor, and the endless sand. At least at the start, the troops share a righteously gung-ho fighting spirit.“This is the coolest thing ever,” one Marine enthuses during a firefight. “It’s raining bombs. Steel rain, baby, steel rain!” There are eerie scenes in pitch blackness where the only lights are red streaks of rockets in the night sky.Lieutenant Scotti, who was honorably discharged from the corps in 2007 (by then he had been made captain), remains mostly off camera. His home movies, and an intermittent voice-over narration gleaned from a journal he kept and letters he wrote, are woven together with British television news clips, commentary and excerpts from speeches by George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld into a 2003 time capsule. Compared with Lieutenant Scotti’s raw footage, almost everything he didn’t film himself has the feel of dull but necessary narrative filler.'"

"'10-03-12,'1','Doris Haddock was almost 89, stoop-shouldered but stiff-spined, when she laced up her sneakers, threw on a backpack and began trekking 3,200 miles across the country on New Year’s Day in 1999 — a one-woman march for campaign finance reform that started in Pasadena, Calif., and ended on the steps of the Capitol in Washington 14 months later.Granny D, as she preferred to be called, drew considerable attention to her cause along the way. Cameras captured her strides. Drivers who had seen her banner on TV — “Granny D for Campaign Finance Reform” — honked. Politicians came out to pose for pictures. Reporters scratched her utterances into their notebooks.In El Paso one Saturday night in April 1999, after passing strip clubs, fireworks stands and a sea of scrub brush along U.S. 62, Mrs. Haddock sat with a New York Times reporter at a Mexican restaurant.“It just infuriates me!” she said, balling her hands into fists and striking the table. “I feel we are losing our democracy.

"'10-03-12,'1','Sheila Jordan, Alameda County superintendent of schools, said that despite her concerns she lacked the authority to investigate Ms. Alaiwat’s behavior. “We’re the authorizers,” Ms. Jordan said, “not the people in charge.”Some experts on charter schools disagree. “It is the job of the authorizing agency to protect students and the public’s interest,” said Greg Richmond, president of the National Association of Charter School Authorizers, whose members oversee half the nation’s charter schools.Chartering agencies should not limit themselves to oversight required by law, Mr. Richmond said, adding, “This should not be a free-for-all.”Different authorizing agencies respond differently, said Carol Barkley, the director of the charter schools division of California’s Department of Education. When it comes to oversight, Ms. Barkley said, “There isn’t a lot of regulation for local authorizers on what that means.”FAME, which had a budget of about $11 million in public money last year, may be an example of the management issues that can arise when a school’s primary overseers are part of a self-perpetuating, unelected four-member board, three of whose members have had family members either employed by the school or doing business with it.The family relationships violate no law, but can raise questions about board members’ objectivity.Among FAME’s 1,490 students are immigrants and local children, Muslims and Christians, and about half are home-schooled. Ms. Alaiwat, its founder and director, served on the school’s governing board from its inception until last year, when, she said, she stepped down. Two other core board members, Robert Chisholm and Michael Cerny, have served with her for years. About two years ago, Dimitri Kastriotis took the fourth seat on the board.Daughters of both Mr. Cerny and Mr. Kastriotis are employed by the school. The two men said in interviews that they recused themselves from all decisions directly involving their relatives.“What’s difficult about a charter school is that it has few rules,” said Diane Everett, the former superintendent of schools in Sunol Glen Unified School District.It was the Sunol Glen board, in a vote controlled by Mr. Cerny and Mr. Chisholm, that granted the original charter to the Bay Area School for Independent Study in 2001. The school was reincarnated as FAME in 2005.A fifth spot on FAME’s board is designated for the county board’s representative. Superintendent Jordan said that given the county’s supervisory role, having a representative in that post would present a conflict.Ms. Jordan said she supported charter schools. “Often they are an excellent chance for innovation and choice for parents,” she said, but she added that FAME illustrated “the challenges of oversight.”In interviews, she said that some aspects of FAME’s operations “seem unethical and inappropriate,” but that she had no authority to intervene.Bruce Fuller, professor of education and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, said: “Once you get that charter, you’re exempt from almost all state education codes. You’re as free as a bird to operate outside the normal regulatory structure.”Mr. Richmond said problems arose “when an authorizer relies on a very narrow reading” of the law. California law requires such agencies to oversee fiscal issues and compliance with charter school laws.Jeff Stark, senior deputy district attorney for Alameda County, said in an interview this week that the issues involving FAME were “under review.” He would not elaborate.Even critics of FAME praise its effort to educate children, particularly Muslims, who may feel alienated in regular public schools. “They are clearly providing a very important service to a number of people from the community they’re serving,” Ms. Jordan said.Parents whose children attend FAME support it enthusiastically.“We come to FAME for the class size, personal attention” and the Arabic program, said Germin Awadalla, president of the parent-teacher organization.The school’s reputation as a haven for Muslim students spread quickly. And yet one mother who brought her family here from the East Coast in 2005 so her children could attend FAME has become Ms. Alaiwat’s most prominent accuser, telling the authorities — and repeating in extensive interviews with The New York Times — that school money was used inappropriately.That woman was also a school clerk. She said that over time she had become concerned about how public money was being used, and on May 8, 2008, she sent a signed six-page complaint to Superintendent Jordan with accompanying documents.Ms. Jordan said that after finding the accusations “compelling,” she requested an extraordinary audit, which disclosed questionable school payments to Ms. Alaiwat, including some not reflected in her original W-2 tax forms. Ms. Alaiwat said this week that revised tax forms had been completed last month.Although the former employee’s name is known to the authorities, she requested that her name not be used in this article to protect her family from publicity.The former employee left the state after writing Ms. Jordan, and the auditors said they could not find her to ask about her most serious accusation: that Ms. Alaiwat bought a condominium in Fremont and installed the employee’s family as rent-paying tenants.Before Ms. Alaiwat bought the property, the woman said, she had told Ms. Alaiwat that she and her family could afford to pay rent of only $1,800 a month.Then, the woman said, Ms. Alaiwat promoted her to office manager, from clerk, increasing her pay to $45,000 a year from $15 an hour. Ms. Alaiwat set her rent at $2,500, payable in cash, the woman said.Ms. Alaiwat called the former employee a liar. “I did not rent my condo,” she said.Ms. Alaiwat added that she had allowed the woman and her family to stay in the condo because she had said she was “going to be left homeless.”The former employee denied those assertions, and provided records supporting her own account. She also provided The Times with bank deposit slips and e-mail messages to Ms. Alaiwat reflecting the rental payments for the condominium.The employee was not alone in complaining about Ms. Alaiwat.Ten former FAME employees interviewed described Ms. Alaiwat as having an explosive personality. “My dad was a cop,” said June Delane, a history teacher from 2006 to 2008. “I’m a good-size person, and she scared me.”Many of those interviewed said Ms. Alaiwat fired employees capriciously. Alvin Burns, a former dean of student affairs who was fired by Ms. Alaiwat, said, “This woman was controlling this charter with an iron fist.”Ms. Alaiwat said she and the board “do not tolerate incompetence and take active measures to remove staff who are not working in the best interest of our students and their families.”Some of these former employees said that at the same time Ms. Alaiwat’s yearly compensation was rising — it is now $240,000 — school supplies like books were scarce.“I think the teachers were sincere about trying to do things, but they were handicapped by not having books and supplies,” said Jerold Preston, a school principal in 2005.Former employees said a crowd of teachers often gathered around the copy machine. “Teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade were Xeroxing books,” Ms. Delane said.Ms. Alaiwat denied the teachers’ claims. Ms. Jordan said that she had never heard about a shortage of books but that she had heard numerous complaints about Ms. Alaiwat’s volatile behavior.

"'10-03-12,'1','When the Jets released Thomas Jones after he declined to take a pay cut, the prevailing analysis was that he might have slowed at the end of last season. But the Jets lost an experienced veteran who was a tremendous presence in the locker room. Might they be trying to lure someone like Jones to replace him?How about LaDainian Tomlinson, the former Charger and future Hall of Famer who rushed for more than a 1,000 yards a season from 2001 to 2008? Tomlinson, who was clearly diminished in 2009 (a career-low 730 yards, but 12 touchdowns), will visit the Jets on Friday.Tomlinson left the Vikings without a contract on Thursday evening after two days of meetings. Adding Tomlinson to the backfield would give the Vikings a powerhouse combination with Adrian Peterson. A fast indoor field and one of the best offensive lines in the N.F.L. might still attract Tomlinson.With the Jets, Tomlinson would probably back up Shonn Greene, a second-year pro who emerged during the playoffs. Tomlinson, 30, would probably get more plays with the Jets than with the Vikings, because Greene is less established than Peterson. The Jets also have Leon Washington, but he is returning from a serious leg injury.Extra plays may not be such a good thing, though. Limiting Tomlinson’s touches could help him regain some of the burst that he was clearly lacking in the Chargers’ playoff loss to the Jets.'"
"'10-03-12,'1','The result is a lawyer- and paperwork-centered system in which the families most in need of quick relief wait months to save up for the filing costs and attorneys’ fees necessary to file a bankruptcy petition. Although total expenses vary a great deal, the statutory filing fees are now almost $300 and lawyer’s fees alone average more than $1,000.Congress’s 2005 reforms also directly discouraged filings under Chapter 7 (the option typically used by people with few assets) and encouraged filings under Chapter 13 (the traditional procedure for homeowners).If the bankruptcy system was doing its job, the mortgage-driven financial crisis should then have led to a sharp increase in filings under Chapter 13. Homeowners unable to keep up with their mortgages should have been able to file for relief under Chapter 13, resolve their problems and move on with their lives. Yet the share of Chapter 13 filings fell in 2009 to only 28 percent of all filings, from 42 percent in 2006.That’s another perverse result of the 2005 reforms: Chapter 13 does not let people avert foreclosure by paying the actual value of their homes, even when their bubble-era mortgages far exceed realistic market prices. In fact, a “special rule” for home mortgages allows lenders to prevent normal bankruptcy relief for borrowers. Thus, the reforms created a system that makes it harder to file for Chapter 7 while doing nothing to make Chapter 13, once the savior of homeowners, useful in this sort of mortgage crisis.Under a sensible bankruptcy system, households in severe financial distress ought to be able to discharge their debts if they are willing to do two simple things: turn over all assets and make payments out of future income, to the extent that either exceeds a low and nationally uniform threshold. If debtors wanted to keep assets against which they have borrowed, they should have to pay the fair value of the assets, but nothing more.A rational bankruptcy system would also scrap the separate chapters altogether, along with the complicated paperwork now required to document and justify the chapter choice in each particular case. There would be simple, separate tracks automatically determined by each family’s financial position. Families with no substantial income or assets — the great majority of bankrupt households — should face a process as simple as filing a 1040EZ tax form.The debtor would provide the most basic identifying information (name, address and Social Security number); current information about salary and nonsalary income (rents, royalties, dividends and the like); and a list of debts owed on houses, cars, credit cards or other arrangements.The form also would require disclosure of assets broken down by simple categories, permitting the typical debtor to check boxes indicating, for example, that he had less than $1,000 in household assets or less than $500 in financial assets, and renouncing claim to any other assets. This document could be completed without the assistance of legal counsel. All unsecured debts would then be wiped out in a matter of days without further hearings or judicial procedure.Like taxpayers with more complicated financial affairs, debtors with mortgages, car loans or income and assets they wish to protect would need to fill out more detailed forms to allow a reasoned determination of the assets and income they should turn over to their creditors. A legal process and judicial supervision would be appropriate to assess the debtor’s responsibility in cases where creditors can expect borrowers to make payments.It might seem that this proposal does little more than substitute a new two-tiered system for the two-chapter system we now have. But the existing system lets borrowers choose between payment plans based on their strategic interests, and requires wasteful paperwork in all cases, just so the courts can limit the abusive potential of that choice.The new system would eliminate debtor choice and state-by-state variation, make distinctions based only on income and asset holdings and, in the overwhelming majority of cases, drastically truncate paperwork and process. Most important, it would lower the counterproductive obstacles to filing for bankruptcy.Such a bold reshaping of the bankruptcy system would provide Americans immediate respite from crushing debt and the ceaseless emotional and financial pressure that comes with it. Then they could turn their attention to finding new jobs, moving into housing they can afford and caring for their families.'"
"'10-03-12,'1','“A lot of people have no idea what my ministry does,” Mr. Paraison admitted to about 100 Haitian community leaders who gathered on Monday to try to improve and streamline the Haitian-American response to the earthquake.Haitians abroad contribute from $1 billion to $2 billion annually to Haiti, but they cannot vote, a legacy of political chaos and successive governments that did not want to give influence to opponents who had fled the country. Haitian-Americans complain of being told they are “not really Haitian,” and they sometimes find the country corrupt and disorganized. Some in Haiti see their American brethren as arrogant and demanding.Mr. Paraison tried to do what he could. Diaspora groups, he said with admiration, responded no less quickly than international relief agencies, though they have far fewer resources. He estimated that 1,400 Haitian professionals — doctors, nurses, engineers — traveled to the country in the first six weeks, and those were only the ones the government knew about.That was exactly what the crowd had come to discuss. The dimly lighted hall in Times Square — headquarters of 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, the union that represents 350,000 people from Washington to Massachusetts, a fifth of them of Haitian descent — reverberated with sweeping ambition to rebuild Haiti.After the earthquake, Haitian-Americans volunteered their services in overwhelming numbers. But many found it difficult to get to Haiti or to figure out how best to help. There are various reasons: Many international relief organizations, while in need of Creole speakers, do not deploy inexperienced volunteers to disaster zones; the many smaller aid groups founded by Haitians abroad lack a unifying organization; and the Haitian government, barely functioning, has offered little help in coordinating would-be volunteers.Mr. Paraison vowed to restructure the ministry to change that.The meeting’s ostensible focus was to bite off a small chunk of that problem: how to harness the large number of Haitian medical professionals abroad, not only to provide emergency medical care but also to help overhaul the country’s health care system.But it was impossible to keep out the broader tensions. One man challenged Mr. Paraison about the voting issue; a woman shushed him, saying it was inappropriate to bring that up when an estimated quarter-million people were dead. But another agreed, saying, “They think of us as a big A.T.M.”Georges Boursiquot, a Brooklyn real estate agent who declared outside the room that Mr. Paraison’s ministry was a waste of money, demanded: “By the way, where is your office in New York? What is your phone number in New York?”Mr. Paraison did not provide a New York number, but gave the ministry’s Web site (mhave.gouv.ht) and his personal e-mail address.The next day, he was philosophical. “An open and authentic dialogue, that’s what is needed,” he said.His next stop was a tiny room at Haitian-Americans United for Progress, a community group on a stretch of Linden Boulevard in Cambria Heights, Queens, dotted with Haitian salons and groceries.Crammed in were prominent leaders: Bishop Guy A. Sansaricq of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn; Father Jean-Miguel Auguste, the pastor of St. Jerome, one of the city’s largest Haitian Catholic congregations; and Councilman Leroy G. Comrie Jr. There were also ordinary Haitians like Fabienne Doucet, a New York University assistant professor with a proposal. Dr. Doucet wants to create HaitiCorps, a nonprofit organization, to vet Haitian and non-Haitian professional volunteers and steer them to projects in Haiti that need them.“That interests me!” the minister declared in French, and they exchanged business cards on the spot.Elsie St. Louis-Accilien, the director of Haitian-Americans United for Progress, said she hoped it was just the beginning. “You are the first high official to visit us,” she said in French. “Merci, merci, merci.”But on his way out, Father Auguste said of the minister’s outreach, “Nothing will come of it.”Members of the diaspora, he said, should unite and “take things into our own hands.” Arrogance will not be a problem, he said. Anyone helping in Haiti has to “sleep on the streets with the people.”'"
"'10-03-12,'1','In Mr. Coats’s view “The Demons” will be a relief from the onslaught of films, and television shows that clutter American culture. “This will be like going on an adventurous foreign trip without needing a passport,” said Mr. Coats, who will attend with his wife, Alma Becker, a guest artist at Skidmore College. “We’ve been to and just missed a Stein production there. We were in and just missed Stein there. Our colleagues and other theater people have spoken so highly of Stein, so we want in on the conversation.”Another ticketholder, Rajika Puri, a dancer and choreographer, said she yearned for theater and art that aspired to a fresh aesthetic, rather than the Broadway fare that rarely impresses her. What makes New York important to her, she said, is the pleasures that can be found in taking a Saturday morning subway ride to a Lower ferry and then walking to a warehouse that will be transformed for a dozen hours by 26 European actors and a director known for his uses of timing, perception and space.“I know my friends, and I will be asking each other: ‘Are you going? And what did you think of it?’ because it’s that sort of communal, unique experience,” Ms. Puri said. “You talk about the play, about plays as literature, about the sets, about the ideas. I look around me in those audiences and see people who crave being stimulated by art. I don’t want to be elitist, but the fact is there’s an elitism to self-education.”“The Demons” is different from most other popular multihour shows like “The Orphans’ Home Cycle,” now at the , and ’s “Coast of Utopia” at in 2006-7, in that the Stein production will be performed only in its entirety; those other two shows could be seen in parts or as a marathon. Marathons tend to be the toughest ticket to come by, yet they also yield the mathematical impossibility of squaring the number of people who claim to have witnessed great cultural events with the number of seats available.Almost everyone who’s anyone in the New York theater world, it seemed, said this winter that they had seen ’s critically acclaimed performance in with tickets costing as much as $1,000 in online scalping. But “Streetcar” had only 28 performances in an 874-seat theater, which helped make the production one of the most popular in the history of the . ( ’s nine-hour “Mahabharata” in 1987 is another candidate.)Joseph V. Melillo, executive producer of the academy, said there was no way to accommodate everyone who wanted to see “Streetcar.” (Of course plenty got in. There were 24,688 tickets total, of which 19,145 were sold to the public; some of those tickets were for floor cushions.)“We’re still home to the cocktail party where someone is extolling the quality of a theatrical experience and you can’t comment because you didn’t make a commitment to see the show,” he said. “Making contributions about culture at cocktail parties still has priceless value for a great many people.”’s performance in the title role of “Mother Courage and Her Children,” for a month at the Delacorte Theater in 2006, also became a legend in the annals of audience attendance. People with even the best connections could not finagle tickets from the producer, the . Those willing to wait in line for hours could hope for one of 1,300 free tickets available each day. (Though not even arriving by 7:30 a.m. guaranteed a seat.) Some 500 more tickets went to patrons who financially support summer shows, as well as corporate sponsors and the news media, among others.“I had people calling me all the time for comps, and they would say, ‘You’re giving them away for free, why not give me some?’ ” said , artistic director of the Public Theater. “I’d say, ‘If I give them to you, it means some kid from who slept all night in the park will be shut out.’ So I didn’t. I’ve said no to famous people. I’ve said no to family.”As for the Lincoln Center Festival, few tough tickets have rivaled those for the 2000 production of Aleksandr Ostrovsky’s “Innocent as Charged,” for which the open seating became a cause of bodily harm.“At one performance an audience member literally clawed another audience member and drew blood — I’m talking about real blood,” said Nigel Redden, director of the festival. “We haven’t had general admission seating since then.”Mr. Stein, the director of “The Demons,” said that instead of widespread buzz about his production, he was expecting an intensity of interest among die-hard fans of intellectually challenging — and physically demanding — theater.“Stamina is absolutely necessary, and I’m aware that some New Yorkers who care about their culture will expend a great deal of energy on it,” Mr. Stein said in an interview by phone from . “If you have energy and openness, you will be repaid, I believe. If you want to have your two hours of musical entertainment, then you must go to some other place.”'"
"'10-03-12,'1','“She was truly a mover and a shaker, so well-liked and so well-loved by so many,” said Representative John King, 33, who holds her former seat in the General Assembly.Family members suspect that Ms. Goggins had developed dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in her final years. She rarely left her small, cluttered house on Carousel Circle, except occasionally to ride the bus to Bi-Lo for groceries.In 16 years as her next-door neighbor, Erskine Hunter, 83, said he was allowed inside only once, to fix a water heater.When he dropped off groceries every month, Mr. Hunter said, Ms. Goggins asked that he ring the doorbell and leave the food on her front stoop. “She didn’t let nobody in that house,” he said. “She just wasn’t the type to stop and talk.”So it came as a surprise when neighbors this week found Ms. Goggins’s obituary in newspapers across the South.“When I read it in the newspaper and learned everything she had done, I was like, ‘Wow,’ ” said Linda Martin, the longtime property manager for Ms. Goggins’s rented house. “I really didn’t know anything about her.”But that pride was tempered with sadness and regret. Her death might have been prevented, family members say, if only Ms. Goggins had been more receptive to help. Her son, Horace W. Goggins Jr., and Ms. Martin had both asked Richland County’s department of adult protective services to monitor Ms. Goggins, but she had refused their assistance.“It’s just so sad,” Ms. Martin said. “You reach out to help a person, and they reject you. What else can you do?”She added, “I always dreaded that something of this nature would happen.”Ms. Goggins’s body was discovered on March 3, when the police entered through a window after neighbors reported that she had been unusually reclusive, even by her own standards. It had snowed recently, and temperatures were still in the 30s. Ms. Goggins was found wearing several layers of pants, socks and shirts.Her thermostat and stove were working, but were turned off, said the county coroner, Gary Watts.Ms. Goggins’s utility company shut off her electricity for nonpayment on Feb. 23. But the police found $2,500 in cash and uncashed retirement checks in her house, Mr. Watts said.“This wasn’t a matter of not having money,” he said. “She appears to have been in the early stages of dementia and not taking care of herself.”A funeral will be held Friday in Rock Hill. Mr. Goggins, 42, of Powder Springs, Ga., called it a “homecoming celebration of life,” adding, “We’re going to focus on her achievements and the positive part of her life, not on her death.”Those achievements include teaching public school, founding a tutoring company and in 1972 becoming the first black woman from South Carolina to be a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Ms. Goggins was elected to the State House in 1974, defeating a white male incumbent.“I am going to Columbia to be a legislator, not just a black spot in the House chambers,” she told The Associated Press at the time. Voters, she said, “were ready to accept a person who was sincere and concerned about things. Those feelings go beyond color.”In the legislature, Ms. Goggins helped expand kindergarten classes, reduced student-teacher ratios and approved sickle-cell anemia testing in county health departments.“She had an amazing life,” said Mr. Hunter, her neighbor, before adding, “I just wish I’d knocked on her door more often.”'"

"'10-03-12,'1','But the global growth picture remains uneven, the association said.North American and European markets were lagging, with gains in international passenger demand of just 2.1 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, in January.In emerging markets, the picture is strikingly better, Mr. Bisignani said. International passenger demand in the Asia-Pacific region climbed 6.5 percent in January from the level of a year earlier.The association predicted that airlines in the Asia-Pacific region would swing to a combined $900 million profit this year, from a loss of $2.7 billion in 2009.“This is a very dramatic shift,” Mr. Bisignani said, adding that airlines in that region were now facing a shortage of capacity, particularly for air freight.The situation in Latin America was also encouraging, with international passenger demand up 11 percent in January from a year earlier. The association forecast that carriers in the region would record profit of about $800 million this year, in line with 2009.Much of the strength in the region was the result of growing economic ties to the fast-growing economies of Asia, the association said, as well as a recent wave of cross-border airline mergers that have given carriers greater flexibility and economies of scale.Globally, airline revenue is expected to recover sharply this year, to $522 billion, from $479 billion in 2009.“Revenues are halfway to recovery — $42 billion below the 2008 peak and $43 billion above the 2009 trough,” Mr. Bisignani said.Airlines in North America and Europe, where consumer confidence and job growth remain low, were expected to record another year of losses in 2010.North American carriers were likely to lose about $1.8 billion this year, compared with $2.9 billion in losses in 2009. Air travel demand was expected to grow by 6.2 percent, although first- and business-class travel remained sluggish.European carriers were expected to lose about $2.2 billion in 2010, slightly less than the $2.5 billion the association forecast in December, amid an expected 4.2 percent increase in demand.Airlines in the Middle East were expecting one of the sharpest recoveries in demand this year, up 15.2 percent from 2009, although they are likely to remain unprofitable, with a combined loss of $400 million. Excess capacity in the region was weighing heavily on ticket prices.After reducing capacity last year by cutting flights and using smaller aircraft, airfares and cargo rates are beginning to rise. The association forecast that average revenue per distance traveled, known as yield, would improve by about 2 percent in 2010 for passenger travel and 3 percent for cargo, compared with a precipitous 14 percent drop experienced by both sectors in 2009.'"
"'10-03-12,'1','“I think most farmers would look to have more competition in the industry,” said Laura L. Foell, who raises corn and soybeans on 900 acres in Schaller, Iowa.The Iowa attorney general, Tom Miller, has also been scrutinizing Monsanto’s market dominance. The company’s genetically engineered traits are in the vast majority of corn and soybeans grown in the United States, Mr. Miller said. “That gives them considerable power, and questions arise about how that power is used,” he said.Critics charge that Monsanto has used license agreements with smaller seed companies to gain an unfair advantage over competitors and to block cheaper generic versions of its seeds from eventually entering the market. DuPont, a rival company, also claims Monsanto has unfairly barred it from combining biotech traits in a way that would benefit farmers.In a recent interview at Monsanto’s headquarters in St. Louis, its chief executive, Hugh Grant, said that while his company might be the market leader, competition was increasing as the era of biotech crops matured.“We were the first out of the blocks, and I think what you see now is a bunch of people catching up and aggressively competing, and I’m fighting with them,” Mr. Grant said. He said farmers chose the company’s products because they liked the results in the field, not because of any untoward conduct on Monsanto’s part.Yet in a seed market that Monsanto dominates, the jump in prices has been nothing short of stunning.Including the sharp increases last year, Agriculture Department figures show that corn seed prices have risen 135 percent since 2001. Soybean prices went up 108 percent over that period. By contrast, the Consumer Price Index rose only 20 percent in that period.Many farmers have been willing to pay a premium price because the genetically engineered seeds that make up most of the market come with advantages. Genetic modifications for both corn and soybeans make the crops resistant to herbicides, simplifying weed control and saving labor, fuel and machinery costs. Many genetically engineered corn and cotton seeds also resist insect pests, which cuts down on chemical spraying.Lee Quarles, a Monsanto spokesman, said the price increases were justified because the quality of the seeds had been going up, and new biotech traits kept being added. For example, he said, many corn varieties now include multiple genes to battle insect pests, raising their value.Mr. Quarles said higher prices were justified because the traits saved farmers money and made their operations more efficient.Monsanto began investing heavily in biotechnology in the 1980s — ahead of most other agricultural companies. In the mid-1990s, it became the first to widely market genetically engineered seeds for row crops, introducing soybeans containing the so-called Roundup Ready gene, which allowed plants to tolerate spraying of its popular Roundup weed killer. Soon after, it began selling corn seed engineered with a gene to resist insect pests.The number of biotech plant traits has grown since then, and other large companies — including DuPont, Dow Chemical, Syngenta, BASF and Bayer CropScience — have gotten into the business. But Monsanto has taken advantage of its head start. Today more than 90 percent of soybeans and more than 80 percent of the corn grown in this country are genetically engineered. A majority of those crops contain one or more Monsanto genes.As biotechnology has spread, Monsanto and its competitors have bought dozens of smaller seed companies, increasing the concentration of market power in the industry.Monsanto sells its own branded seed varieties, like Dekalb in corn and Asgrow in soybeans, to farmers. But it has expanded its influence and profits by licensing those traits to hundreds of small seed companies, allowing them to incorporate the traits in the seeds they sell. It has also granted licenses to the other large trait developers, allowing them to create combinations of engineered traits in a process known as stacking.Monsanto says that its licensing shows it is the opposite of a monopolist, encouraging rather than hampering competition.But critics say the licenses give Monsanto excessive control. Seed company executives said the licenses were sometimes worded in a way that compelled them to sell Monsanto traits over those of its competitors. Mr. Quarles denied that, saying the contracts contain sales incentives typical of the industry.Some of the most pointed accusations have come in a court battle between Monsanto and DuPont. Last year Monsanto sued its rival, saying DuPont had used a Monsanto trait to create a gene combination that was not permitted in its licensing agreement.DuPont countered by charging that Monsanto was using its market power to strong-arm competitors and quash innovation that would benefit farmers and consumers.In January, Monsanto won a partial victory. A federal judge ruled that the license barred DuPont from creating the gene stack. But the judge said that DuPont could move ahead with its antitrust claims, which, if successful, could potentially nullify the stacking ban.DuPont made another accusation that caught the attention of farmers and regulators, saying that Monsanto was trying to head off the eventual entry into the marketplace of generic Roundup Ready seeds.The company’s patent on the Roundup Ready trait in soybeans expires before the 2014 planting season, meaning that, just as in the pharmaceutical business, rivals would be free to sell a cheaper version. Farmers would also be free to save seed from one year to the next, a money-saving step they are now barred from taking.But DuPont charged that Monsanto was trying to force seed companies to switch prematurely to its second-generation Roundup Ready soybeans and taking other steps to make the entry of generics more difficult.Monsanto responded by announcing that it would not block companies from selling a generic version of Roundup Ready seeds. But farmers have continued to fret that cheaper generic seeds may be at risk.'"

"'10-03-12,'1','Marquette and Villanova squared off in a shootout Thursday afternoon as both guard-oriented offenses shot freely. For Villanova, it was Corey Stokes, best known as the Bayonne Bomber, connecting on 6 of 7 3-pointers for 22 points. For Marquette, it was Darius Johnson-Odom, a southpaw who made 5 of 7 from that range for 24 points.The lasting image of the game was Villanova’s inability to get off a 3-point shot when it trailed by 4 points with less than 10 seconds left. Stokes’s hot hand was left to foul Lazar Hayward to try to stop the clock after a timeout. The Golden Eagles made both free throws and survived to win, 80-76, extending a run though the Big East tournament to a Friday night semifinal against Georgetown. Marquette shot 57.9 percent from 3-point range as a team. Villanova finished at 52.9 percent.The pace quickened down the stretch but neither team pulled away, just as had happened in the regular-season matchups, which Villanova won each time by 2 points.

They were playing for a possible No. 2 seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament, but they will now have to wait to see how other conference tournaments play out.Marquette’s makeup is one of a team able to absorb knockout attempts by taller, more talented teams, but the relentless perimeter attack showed that it is rounding into a tough matchup for any team in March.'"
"'10-03-12,'1','“What goes around comes around,” the triumphant Wolf says sneeringly to the Fox. This may not be Aesop’s wording, but it succinctly captures his message. It also neatly describes the action at the Circle in the Square Theater, where that ancient Greek’s sly and savvy animals are running through the aisles, up and down the stairs and onto the stage in “Aesop’s Fables,” a new children’s musical directed by Theodore Mann and presented by the theater school’s Alumni Ensemble.The space’s configuration — the audience is seated in the round — offers viewers circuslike thrills as the stories’ beasts enter and exit in their midst. The adult actors, wearing ingenious masks (some revamped from other shows, some created by Sophia Duran and Hannah Scott) morph so effectively into forest creatures that it hardly matters that “Aesop’s Fables” has no scenery. (The empty stage is later filled with the set for “The Miracle Worker.”)Aesop (Justin D. Quackenbush) functions as a genial M.C. for the show, which deftly weaves “The Tortoise and the Hare,” “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” “The Fox and the Crow” and “The Lion and the Mouse” into a single narrative. Michael Milligan, who wrote the book, opens the action with a race, where the only runner brave enough to challenge Roddy the Rabbit (Kane Prestenback) is Travis the Tortoise (Marissa Parness).The other tales unfold against the backdrop of that competition, with the wily Wolf (Clark Thomas Feeney) popping up frequently as an all-purpose bad guy. He steals from the Fox (Courtney Shaw) and casts the net that traps the Lion (Rendell Anthony DeBose).This adaptation avoids Aesop’s preachiness with the help of humor, Joziah Longo’s score and lots of audience involvement. Mr. Longo, also the lyricist, has Travis droning a comically slow tune while Roddy rocks out. The two Sheep sing a funny baa-ing and lah-ing counterpoint to the Shepherd Boy’s ballad of boredom. And if your children have never cried wolf, they will certainly do so here.One caveat: theatergoers under 5 may find the Wolf’s menacing scary. They should be reassured that this Wolf doesn’t get to steal any children, but he comes close to stealing the show.'"
"'10-03-12,'1','St. Patrick’s Day is coming soon and the libations will surely be flowing around town this weekend, but there is more to Irish culture than that, you know. On Sunday afternoon the Irish Arts Center in Clinton presents its annual Open Day, a free sampler of Irish culture.“Many people, when they think of St. Patrick’s Day, think of the parade and green beer, but this is a chance for people interested in the culture to see what traditional Irish arts are all about,” said Rachael Gilkey, education coordinator for the center.The center will be abuzz with Irish music and dance performances, film screenings and educational opportunities for people of all ages and ethnicities.

(An adult class is also on the agenda.) The center regularly offers courses in Irish language, music, history and more, and students from some of those classes will perform on Sunday, showing a bit of what they’ve learned.“It really is a day that allows us to showcase everything, and it’s free,” said Aidan Connolly, the executive director.Mr. Connolly is expecting a big turnout, “probably in the neighborhood of four to five hundred over the course of the day,” he said. He also expects the participants to be a culturally diverse lot, just like the students and teachers at the center.“There’s something interesting about what ethnically based cultural institutions can do in New York,” he said. “We’re able to tap into a combination of ethnic diversity and cultural voraciousness and create a different kind of cultural experience.”'"
"'10-03-12,'1','Manager Jerry Manuel said that in Reyes’s absence, Alex Cora and Ruben Tejada, a 20-year-old infielder who has never played above Class AA, would get the bulk of the playing time.Manuel said he was stunned by the news that Reyes could be out for an extended period, but he sounded optimistic that it would be the shorter end of the spectrum. He could even foresee circumstances in which Reyes would be available for opening day.If Reyes made it back for the final 10 games of spring training, Manuel said, that would give him enough time to be ready for the beginning of the season.“He’s a guy we projected to bat third in the lineup,” Manuel said. “That puts a little strain on us. But for some reason I just feel like everything is going to be all right. I just feel that.”David Wright said: “Obviously, it’s frustrating that he had had a setback, which is obviously out of his control. But the most important thing is to get him better, get him out there and let him do what he loves to do.”Reyes has seen several specialists and taken numerous tests that have all shown he has slightly elevated thyroid levels. Because elevated thyroid levels can sometimes cause dehydration and then add stress to the heart, the Mets and their doctors have taken a cautious approach by keeping him inactive until his levels return to normal, which they are expected to do on their own.“They said it’s two to eight weeks, and he will be tested on a weekly basis and hopefully the levels will start coming down,” Reyes’s agent, Peter E. Greenberg, said on a conference call with reporters. “The doctor told us this was the best possible diagnosis in that there is no intervention or medication necessary.”After initial lab results in Florida showed that Reyes had an overactive thyroid, he stopped playing and exercising for three days and flew to New York for more tests, which showed he had only mildly elevated thyroid levels.Encouraged by the initial reports, Reyes worked out Monday and Tuesday in New York, Greenberg said, and when he was retested on Wednesday, the levels had risen slightly.After the initial visit to the doctor on Monday, Reyes had been expecting to return to camp within a few days, so the news that he would have to wait was difficult for him.“Jose is obviously disappointed that it’s going to be a matter of weeks as opposed to days,” Greenberg said, “but it’s a completely curable, treatable situation, and we all view it as good news.”In addition to rest, Reyes has been told to change his diet. He had been eating a lot of seafood lately, Greenberg said, and the doctors told him the iodine in shellfish could contribute to the higher iodine levels in his blood.He may also have had a virus that caused the thyroid to become inflamed and overproduce hormones.“He has to rest and watch his diet,” Greenberg said. “He’s not supposed to do anything that will raise the heart level.”According to Dr. Robert McConnell of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center in Manhattan, a leading expert on the thyroid, the change in the levels of thyroid hormones is not unusual.McConnell agreed with the assessment of the Mets’ doctors that in most cases of mild hyperthyroidism, the levels tend to return to normal on their own.“It’s not definite,” he said. “The only definite is that you will pay your taxes on April 15. But you can say the chances are very, very good.”The Red Sox made their only visit of the spring here and pummeled the Mets, 8-2. The stands were full, with a heavy Boston presence, which was why the former Red Sox Jason Bay was booed when he came to the plate. The new Red Sox pitcher John Lackey threw three scoreless innings. Mike Pelfrey allowed three runs in three innings but said his bruised knee was fine.'"
"'10-03-12,'1','EL BIREH, West Bank — Dozens of Palestinian students from the youth division of Fatah, the mainstream party led by President Mahmoud Abbas, gathered here on Thursday to dedicate a public square to the memory of a woman who in 1978 helped carry out the deadliest terrorist attack in Israel’s history.Though one senior Fatah leader and a Palestinian Authority security official joined the gathering in this town abutting Ramallah, the administrative center of the authority, the relatively low key nature of the event, timed to the 32d anniversary of the attack, was a kind of compromise. An official ceremony was put off by the Palestinian Authority as a result of Israeli protests and to avoid an unnecessary embarrassment during a visit to the region by the American vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., who came partly to promote new Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.The woman being honored, Dalal Mughrabi, was the 19-year-old leader of a Palestinian squad that sailed from Lebanon and landed on a beach between Haifa and Tel Aviv. They killed an American photojournalist, hijacked a bus and commandeered another, embarking on a bloody rampage that left 38 Israeli civilians dead, 13 of them children, according to official Israeli figures. Ms. Mughrabi and several other attackers were killed.To Israelis, hailing Ms. Mughrabi as a heroine and a martyr is an act that glorifies terrorism.But, underscoring the chasm between Israeli and Palestinian perceptions, the Fatah representatives described Ms. Mughrabi as a courageous fighter who held a proud place in Palestinian history. Defiant, they insisted that they would not let Israel dictate the names of Palestinian streets and squares.“We are all Dalal Mughrabi,” declared Tawfiq Tirawi, a member of the Fatah Central Committee, the party’s main decision-making body, who came to join the students. “For us she is not a terrorist,” he said, but rather “a fighter who fought for the liberation of her own land.”'"
"'10-03-12,'1','Mr. Posner said that in places like China and Iran, “connective technologies” had proved to be double-edged. While they allow a ferment of sometimes spontaneous organizational activities by dissidents and government critics, they also give governments “greater energy in curtailing freedom of expression.”In Iran, an opposition Web site reported on Thursday that a prominent political activist who was arrested on June 12, the day of Iran’s disputed presidential election, has been released from prison.Mostafa Tajzadeh, a former deputy interior minister, was released on Wednesday in what was called a “leave from prison,” the Web site, Jaras, reported. Mr. Tajzadeh received a hero’s welcome, and pictures circulated on the Web of two leading opposition figures, Mir-Hussein Moussavi and the former president, Mohammed Khatami, visiting him at his home.Hundreds of opposition activists have been arrested since the presidential election, and most of them remain incarcerated. Human Rights groups have said that none are released unconditionally and that most have posted hefty sums for bail and are summoned regularly to appear in court.The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York based group, announced this month that at least 52 journalists remain in prison. On Thursday a lawyer for Saeed Leylaz, a prominent journalist and economist, said that his client’s sentence had been reduced from nine years to six, a term that human rights groups said remained indefensible. The sentence for Bahman Amuwee, another journalist, was reduced from seven years to five, the rights group Reporters without Borders said.The criticism in the State Department report was not limited to authoritarian or developing countries. The State Department expressed its ""growing concern"" over discrimination against Muslims in Europe, noting in particular a Swiss ban on the construction of minarets.Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in releasing the report, insisted that the United States holds itself to the same standards it uses to assess other countries.There was, in any case, criticism for some countries closely allied to the United States.Even as the Obama administration works to bolster the Afghan government for an eventual American departure, the report described the existing rights situation there as poor. It listed problems like extrajudicial killings, torture, poor prison conditions, restrictions on freedom of expression and discrimination against women.The election there last year was marred by “serious allegations of widespread fraud,” the report noted.As for Iraq, the report noted an overarching reality: that violence had significantly decreased last year. Still, it listed numerous rights offenses, including arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture, poor prison conditions, arbitrary arrests and inadequate protection for refugees.Mr. Posner also signaled some trends of global concern. One was the increasing efforts by some governments to curtail local advocacy. “No less than 25 governments in the last couple of years have imposed new restrictions on nongovernmental human rights and other organizations,” the report said.Another was governments’ misuse of national-security or emergency legislation to broadly curtail civil liberties. He said Egypt, Russia and Sri Lanka had all been guilty of this.'"
"'10-03-12,'1','The White House, which has called the legislation one of its top priorities, rejected that explanation. “Republicans in the Senate are going to have to ask themselves why they would stand in the way of financial reform,” Mr. Obama’s press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said at a news conference.Mr. Gibbs, who said that “lobbyists are being hired hand over fist to kill financial reform,” said of lawmakers: “I don’t believe many are going to want to go home and face voters next November not having done something.”While Mr. Dodd and Mr. Corker took pains to praise each other and held out hope that a compromise could still be achieved, the developments clearly made the prospects for the legislation more difficult.Mr. Dodd said he intended for the committee to take up formal consideration of the bill during the week of March 22, with the goal of a committee vote before Congress recesses on March 26. “As time moves on, you just limit the possibility of getting something done, particularly a bill of this magnitude and this complexity,” he said.But Mr. Corker said it “would be a travesty” to push a bill of such length and complexity through in one week.The lack of agreement put the process closer to a showdown. Democrats, who control 59 votes in the Senate, would have to successfully woo at least one Republican to achieve the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said that Mr. Dodd “has done his very utmost to do something on a bipartisan basis.” He said of Mr. Dodd’s impending proposal, “I hope it’s something that we can move on quickly.”Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, top Republican on the committee, who found himself in the unusual position of being largely left out of the negotiations after his talks with Mr. Dodd broke down last month, issued a conciliatory statement. “As long as we remain focused on policy and not politics, an agreement is still very possible,” he said.Labor, consumer and civil rights groups have been increasingly critical of Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Corker said he believed that Mr. Dodd, who is retiring at the end of this year, was responding to pressure from the left.In a news conference, Mr. Corker disclosed significant details about compromises that he said had been reached with Mr. Dodd, as well as remaining areas of disagreement.He said that both sides had agreed to house a new consumer financial protection agency within the Federal Reserve, with a director appointed by the president and broad ability to write rules governing mortgages, credit cards and the so-called shadow banking system of payday lenders, debt collectors, and loan originators and servicers.Whether that agency would have independent enforcement powers has been a major point of contention. Mr. Corker said Mr. Dodd had agreed that the agency would not be able to conduct its own compliance examinations, as consumer advocates have urged. Instead, other regulators, who are already charged with ensuring the soundness of banks, would take on the responsibility for protecting consumers, too.The negotiators had also agreed, Mr. Corker said, to strip the Fed of its power to supervise bank holding companies except those with assets of $100 billion or more. Whether to remove from the central bank its oversight of state-chartered banks that are members of the Fed system, he said, was still to be determined.“The Fed no doubt is going to have its wings clipped,” he said.Consensus had also been reached on the creation of an interagency council, led by the Treasury, to detect and monitor systemic risk; the establishment of an Office of Research and Analysis that would give the council daily updates on the stability of individual firms and their trading partners; and the removal of credit rating agencies’ exemption from liability under securities laws.Mr. Corker revealed several areas that remained in dispute at the point that Mr. Dodd announced that he would move ahead on his own.One of them, he said, was the extent to which banks would be exempt from new requirements for greater transparency in the trading of derivatives. While standardized derivatives would have to be traded through clearinghouses, some banks have pushed to have transactions of some of their most complex derivatives — including the credit-default swaps that helped bring on the financial crisis — shielded from public view.Gary G. Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said on Thursday that the loophole some banks were seeking would exempt as much as 60 percent of derivatives. The banks have found allies in companies like Boeing and Caterpillar that use derivatives to hedge against risk, but such derivatives trades make up only 9 percent of the market, Mr. Gensler said.Other areas of disagreement, Mr. Corker said, included whether shareholders should be allowed an advisory vote, by proxy, on executive compensation, and how much credit risk mortgage originators should be required to keep when they packaged and sold loans.Mr. Corker also said that details remained to be worked out over a new “resolution authority” that would empower the government to seize and dismantle a systemically important financial institution on the verge of failure.'"
"'10-03-12,'1','ABU DHABI—Defense secretary Robert M. Gates met here on Thursday with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates as part of an intensifying American effort to build up defenses with Arab allies and contain Iran’s military might in the Persian Gulf.Mr. Gates, who is a vital player in the Obama administration’s campaign to put more pressure on Iran, focused in his talks with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Zayyed al Nuhayyan on the American effort to seek tougher sanctions against Iran. Mr. Gates told reporters afterward that there was broad support in the Gulf for new sanctions, even though he made no predictions that they would work.The administration only recently abandoned an attempt to engage Iran diplomatically to persuade it to give up its nuclear program, which Iran insists is for peaceful purposes and Western nations believe is part of a covert nuclear arms program.“I think there is an understanding that we have to try this, this is the next step,” Mr. Gates said at the Emirates Palace hotel, speaking of the sanctions. Although engaging Iran had produced no results, he said, “the engagement policy served to expose the Iranian government to the rest of the world, in terms of its policies, for what it is.”Mr. Gates said that studies of situations in which sanctions have worked — he cited anti-apartheid efforts against South Africa as an example — showed that their success “was because there was very broad international support and there were very few cheaters.” There is similar support now against Iran, he said, adding that “the prospects of success are certainly better than in a lot of other situations where sanctions have been applied.”'"

"'10-03-13,'0','Tennessee will need to be stingy in the semifinals Saturday against No. 2 Kentucky (30-2), which defeated Alabama, 73-67. John Wall led the Wildcats with 23 points in a game that seemed to be played on their home floor in Rupp Arena. In an arena that seats 19,123, there seemed to be about 14,000 fans dressed in blue.The Vols had a reality check last September when Emmanuel Negedu, a sophomore forward from Nigeria, collapsed after a workout. He had a heart problem and had a cardiac defibrillator implanted. He is sidelined, but sits on the bench. It was not enough to shock the team into harmony, Williams said.“Last year, it was my turn, my turn, or my team; there were certain things that distracted us on and off the floor from being a great team,” Williams said. “We had way more talent last year, but this year we have had walk-ons play like they were top-ranked Division I players.“It came together as a family and it is really showing right now.”In the last nine games, Tennessee is holding teams to 63.8 points a game and holding opponents to 39 percent shooting, including 27 percent from the 3-point line.After the suspensions, Pearl did not dwell on the loss of the four players. Williams missed nine games and Tatum, who scored 15 points off the bench Friday, missed four games. Goins also missed four games, and Smith is playing in Turkey.Pearl has been viewed as showman, but these Vols look solid, not flashy.The theatrics on the sidelines — and the $3,000 cashmere orange sport coat he wears in honor of the former Vols coach Ray Mears — contrast with his thriftiness. Pearl usually buys his sport coats off the rack in big box department stores.His team contrasts with his public persona.“Our guys knew how hard I was working with those guys that were dismissed to help get them through the discipline, but I also did not mention them in public talking about how much we missed them,” Pearl said. “We did not bring them up in team meetings and say, we have to do this different and that different.“The guys responded to that, and it made us a better team.”MISSISSIPPI ST. 75, FLORIDA 69 Mississippi State, fighting for an N.C.A.A. tournament berth, landed five players in double figures and improved to 22-10 to help its tournament chances with a victory over Florida.

"'10-03-13,'0','Netflix’s $1 million contest for the best method to improve its movie recommendations was such a research and business hit that, when the winners were declared last September, the company immediately announced plans for another one.But it turned out that letting very smart computer scientists and statisticians dig through the video rental site’s data had one major, unforeseen drawback. A pair of researchers at the University of Texas showed that the supposedly anonymized data released for the contest, which included movie recommendations and choices made by hundreds of thousands of customers, could in fact be used to identify them.That brought the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, and also drew a lawsuit from KamberLaw L.L.C. On Friday, bowing to privacy concerns, Netflix said it was shelving its plans for a sequel to the first contest.In a post on a company blog, Neil Hunt, Netflix’s chief product officer, explained that the company had “reached an understanding” with the F.T.C. and settled the lawsuit. “The resolution of both matters involves certain parameters on how we use Netflix data in any future research programs,” he said.Netflix, Mr. Hunt wrote, will continue to “explore ways to collaborate with the research community” to improve its recommendation system.The three-year competition for the first Netflix Prize, which began in 2006, offered $1 million to the first group that could improve the predictive accuracy of the company’s movie recommendation software by at least 10 percent.

"'10-03-13,'0','The Internal Revenue Service is intensifying its scrutiny of wealthy Americans.The federal agency increased its audits of taxpayers who earned $1 million to $5 million by 33 percent last year compared with 2008, new I.R.S. figures show.The numbers, released late Thursday in the agency’s 2009 annual data book, also show that the I.R.S. increased its audits by 16 percent for those earning $5 million to $10 million last year. Audits of those who made at least $10 million rose by 8.5 percent, according to the data.The figures are the strongest evidence yet that the agency is honoring a vow by the I.R.S. commissioner, Douglas H. Shulman, to increase scrutiny of wealthy taxpayers.Taxpayers who earned at least $1 million a year made up 0.25 percent of the more than 144 million individual federal returns filed last year, the data showed, but affluent Americans account for a far greater share of the underpayments in federal income tax returns.“The 2009 results show our emphasis on higher-income individuals,” Bruce I. Friedland, an I.R.S. spokesman, said Friday in a statement. “We will continue to focus our enforcement efforts on high-income taxpayers, particularly those hiding their assets overseas.”'"
"'10-03-13,'0','As the Tea Party pushes to change the Republican Party, the purity they demand of candidates may have more to do with economic conservatism than social conservatism. Some Tea Party groups, for instance, have declined to endorse , who has claimed the mantle of a fiscal conservative, in the Republican Senate primary in . But these groups find his record in Congress no more fiscally responsible than the man he seeks to oust, .The Tea Party defines economic conservatism more strictly than most Republicans in Congress would — the Tea Party agrees about the need to do away with earmarks, but the Contract, for example, also includes a proposal to scrap the tax code and replace it with one no longer than 4,543 words (a number chosen to match the length of the Constitution, unamended.) It would limit the growth of federal spending to inflation plus the percentage of population growth and require a two-thirds majority for any tax increase.Social issues still pack a wallop: a group of Democrats opposed to abortion rights could determine the fate of health care legislation in the House. And Republicans at the last month, while celebrating the Tea Party for energizing their movement, spent much of their time talking about banning gay marriage and overturning Roe v. Wade. “God’s in charge,” Gov. of told a cheering crowd.Tea Party leaders themselves have found it hard to keep the issues out. The inaugural Tea Party convention, organized by the social networking site Tea Party Nation, featured remarks by fervent opponents of gay marriage and abortion rights, including the Baptist pastor Rick Scarborough And some leaders criticized — normally a Tea Party favorite — for advocating “divine intervention” to help the country.Jenny Beth Martin, the leader of the Tea Party Patriots, complained that she spent the days after the convention answering questions about social issues.“When people ask about them, we say, ‘Go get involved in other organizations that already deal with social issues very well,’ ” she said. “We have to be diligent and stay on message.”Many Tea Party members do embrace those issues. The subset of Tea Party organizations known as 9/12 groups, founded by , asks members to embrace seven of nine principles, the second of which is “I believe in God and he is the center of my life.”Some experts, like Lisa McGirr, a professor of history at Harvard and the author of “Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right,” say that the Tea Party uses a kind of code to talk about social values. For instance, when they emphasize a return to the strict meaning of the Constitution, they interpret that as a return to a Christian foundation.“When they talk about returning to the values of the Founding Fathers,” she said, “they are talking about life as a social issue.”Tea Party leaders champion states’ rights, holding dear the Tenth Amendment, which restricts the role of the federal government. The Independence Caucus questionnaire, for instance, asks candidates for their views on Wickard v. Filburn, a decision that Tea Party groups say has been used to vastly expand federal powers. (Roe v. Wade does not come up.) So while some may oppose gay marriage or abortion, they want it left up to states to decide. Nor do they support any abridgement of the right to carry guns.But when the Sam Adams Alliance, a Tea Party-friendly conservative organization in , surveyed 50 leaders of the movement about the most important direction for the movement, none selected social issues. Most said “budget” or “economy/jobs.”While social conservative movements grew out of churches, the Tea Party has built its numbers online. Advocacy groups that have helped grow the movement, like Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Works, have also emphasized the importance of focusing on economic conservatism.Raising social issues, the movement’s leaders say, risks fracturing the strength it has built. “Every social issue you bring in, you’re adding planks to your mission,” said Frank Anderson, a founder of the Independence Caucus, based in . “And planks become splinters.”They also recognize that support for gay marriage has increased, particularly among the young, and so opposing it may alienate supporters.At a candidate forum sponsored by the Kitchen Table Patriots in suburban in January, nine candidates, mostly first-time politicians seeking office after getting involved in the Tea Party, were asked whether they believed that Roe v. Wade should be repealed. Only one said yes.“I think that it’s also going to get Democrats over, if you’re not so rigid,” said Anastasia Przybylski, the co-founder of the Patriots. “I have friends where that’s a big turnoff — they’re registered Democrats because of abortion but they’re totally freaking out about the debt.”'"
"'10-03-13,'0','Japan’s finance minister said Friday that an investigation revealed that Tokyo had secretly agreed with Washington to shoulder extra costs of Okinawa’s 1972 return to Japan beyond the $320 million stipulated in a treaty. The investigation was part of a push by the Democratic Party government to expose secret pacts made with Washington in the 1960s and 1970s by the Liberal Democrats, whose half-century grip on power the Democrats ended last summer. The finance minister, Naoto Kan, left, said the inquiry had discovered that Tokyo paid $85 million more for the relocation of American military bases on the island.'"
"'10-03-13,'0','“Although our domestic transit systems have thus far been spared,” they wrote, “deadly terrorist attacks in Spain, Great Britain, India and Russia over the last few years have emphasized the vulnerabilities of public transportation in large urban areas and demonstrated the security challenges unique to these open, passenger-heavy systems.”They added a reference to Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan immigrant who pleaded guilty to terrorism charges last month in what he said had been a plot by Al Qaeda to detonate a bomb in the subway. “The case of Najibullah Zazi,” they wrote, “is a chilling reminder that our transit systems are targets of Al Qaeda and its affiliates.”The House members acknowledged that “front-line employees cannot, on their own, monitor the entire system,” but they said that the workers were “an important link in the transit security chain.”A spokesman for the authority, Aaron Donovan, denied that safety would suffer. “The subway system,” he said, “is the safest it’s been in years, thanks to the vigilance and dedication of the N.Y.P.D., and there will continue to be a strong presence of M.T.A. employees throughout the subway system.”Mr. Donovan said that layoff notices had been sent to 620 station employees. Of that group, 125 to 150 were told that they could apply for jobs as cleaners. It was not immediately known whether those who changed assignments would face a cut in pay.John Samuelsen, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, said the letter underscored the importance of having agents in the stations because they can call for help when they see something to be concerned about.The transit agency’s “overall position is they don’t need a human presence on the station platform, they don’t need station staffing,” Mr. Samuelsen said.That, he said, conflicted with what transit officials had told the New York Police Department, the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies, “that the station agents were actually a cog in the security program that they have, and that the station agents were part of the overall layered approach to homeland security — the use of human beings interlaced with technology such as closed-circuit TVs and other things.”'"
"'10-03-13,'0','The commission then used GPS data, collected in every cab, to review millions of trips in New York City and found a huge number in which the out-of-city rates had improperly been charged, officials said.The investigators determined that 36,000 drivers improperly activated the higher rate at least once, and that about 3,000 drivers did it more than 100 times.The higher rate, reserved for rides in Nassau and Westchester Counties, is 80 cents per one-fifth of a mile — twice the rate charged for rides in the five boroughs.As described by officials, the fraud might rank as the biggest in the taxi industry’s history.“We have not seen anything quite this pervasive,” said Matthew W. Daus, the taxi and limousine commissioner. “It’s very disturbing.”The commission has turned over its probe to the city’s Department of Investigation.“Some of these people could face serious charges,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Friday.Applying the higher rate in New York City violates the commission’s rules. The penalty for it varies, from a fine of $200 to the mandatory revocation of a cab license, depending on how much was overcharged.The taxi industry vigorously challenged the city’s findings, saying it was unimaginable that such a pervasive problem could be the result of deliberate fraud. The city said that 35,558 out of the city’s roughly 48,000 drivers had applied the higher rate.“This is clearly a systematic failure on the part of the meters and the technology,” said Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents cabbies.“For this to be so widespread — nearly every single driver — makes no sense,” she added.The taxi commission refused to comment on the alliance’s claim, citing its continuing investigation. “We have to sort through the numbers,” Mr. Daus said.In interviews on Friday, taxi drivers expressed dismay at the city’s findings, which they said threatened to tarnish the image of their industry.“We are ashamed,” said Bagicha Singh, of Floral Park, Queens, who was on East Houston Street on break from his shift. “People will look at us as a thief.”Several cabbies defended themselves and their colleagues and said it was easy to accidentally activate the higher rate because of the way the meters were designed.On some models, they said, the buttons for the New York City and out-of-town rates are extremely close together.“You’re driving, your fingers are small, the buttons are tiny,” said Rana Singh, 38, of Maywood, N.J. “You look up at traffic; you look at the car ahead.”Cab drivers are supposed to charge the higher rate only when they cross the border between New York City and Nassau or Westchester.But according to the taxi commission, drivers often pressed a button on the meter that categorized the fare as Code No. 4, which is charged for trips outside the city, rather than Code No. 1, for those in the city limits.Currently, passengers can see which rate is being charged by looking at the meter, which displays a No. 1 or a No. 4 — something few riders are aware of. The rate is also printed on every taxi receipt.The system demanded by the city would require an acknowledgment from the passenger that the higher rate is to be charged before the alert disappears from the digital screen, the commission said.Eventually, officials said, the changes would remove the ability of drivers to manually activate the higher rate, by creating a GPS-based mechanism that automatically charged it based on the location of the cab.“We will make sure that this problem comes to an end,” Mr. Daus said.'"
"'10-03-13,'0','“Unchain My Heart, the Ray Charles Musical” is scheduled to begin preview performances on Broadway on Oct. 8 and open on Nov. 7, the lead producer, Stuart Benjamin, said on Thursday. It will be directed by Sheldon Epps with a book by Suzan-Lori Parks, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright of “Topdog/Underdog.” The musical, which had a developmental production at Pasadena Playhouse under the title “Ray Charles Live!” in 2007, imagines Charles, at his last live recording session, where stories from his life pour out and mix with his best-known hits that will be featured in the show. A spokeswoman for the production said that “Unchain My Heart” represents the first musical book-writing effort by Ms. Parks, whose plays also include “Venus,” “In the Blood” and her newest, “The Book of Grace,” which is now in preview performances at the Public Theater. Mr. Benjamin, who worked with Charles for years and produced the Academy Award-winning film “Ray,” said the production would run at a Shubert Organization theater to be announced later.'"
"'10-03-13,'0','The Swiss banking giant UBS has stepped up its lobbying to pass a treaty with the United States that would resolve a dispute over tax-evading clients, amid signs that the deal is running into trouble in Parliament.In a letter sent to several Swiss lawmakers, a copy of which was obtained Friday by The International Herald Tribune, UBS said failure to approve the treaty could encourage United States officials to go after other Swiss banks, further undermining the country’s all-important financial industry. “The effects of not approving the deal are multiple and will not just affect a single entity like UBS,” the bank said.The Swiss government said last month that it would place a settlement made last year between UBS and American authorities before the country’s Parliament in an effort to overcome objections that were raised in a Swiss court.In the deal, struck in August, UBS agreed to disclose names and account details of thousands of wealthy Americans suspected of tax evasion, in return for the suspension of American legal action against the bank.If Parliament approves it retroactively, the accord would become a treaty and hence “take precedence” over previous agreements on banking secrecy, which the court had cited, the justice ministry has said.'"
"'10-03-13,'0','A company spokesperson said Wednesday that Google expected the dispute to be settled “in weeks, not months.”Speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress, China’s party-controlled legislature, Mr. Li said that he hoped for an amicable resolution to the standoff. But he gave no indication that the government would ease the censorship rules that are at the heart of Google’s ultimatum.“I hope Google will abide by Chinese laws and regulations,” The Associated Press quoted Mr. Li as saying. But “if you want to do something that disobeys Chinese law and regulations, you are unfriendly, you are irresponsible and you will have to bear the consequences.”Whether the company chooses to remain in China, he added, will be up to Google.Since it opened shop in China four years ago, Google has captured roughly 30 percent of the search market in the world’s largest assemblage of Internet users, and it is a favorite among the better-educated and wealthier classes that advertisers covet. But the company has long been uncomfortable with Chinese demands that it censor search results to prevent users from viewing some kinds of content, notably political matters that the government deems unacceptable.Google’s Chinese Web site does censor some of its content, but its restrictions are generally less onerous than elsewhere, and the censored items are clearly identified as having been banned by the authorities.People briefed on the situation said that Google was still trying to decide how to proceed. The company said on Jan. 12 that it was no longer willing to cooperate with Chinese censors. That said, it was not clear whether Google would unilaterally stop censoring results on Google.cn, its China-based search engine, in open defiance of China’s warnings. It is also possible that the company intends to shut down Google.cn and try to reach Chinese customers instead through its search engine based in the United States.Google issued its threat to leave China after concluding that a sophisticated hacker attack on its computers and about 20 other American targets had originated in China. The company has not directly accused the Chinese government of sponsoring the attack, but it did note that the hackers’ targets included the e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. China’s human rights community is the frequent object of government surveillance and oppression.China has denied any role in the Google attacks and has said it will punish the hackers if they are found. American experts have said subsequently that the attacks had been traced to computers at a prominent Chinese technical university and a vocational school with ties to the Chinese military.Since Google first disclosed the hacking incident, executives there have said that the company would like to keep its engineering, sales and other businesses in China, even if it cannot reach a resolution over Google.cn. And Google executives have said privately that they are not likely to take any actions that could compromise the safety of their employees in China.The Chinese have sometimes cast Google’s complaints as part of an American effort to establish global hegemony over the information on the Internet. Officials here reacted brusquely after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a February speech, chided the Chinese government for restricting free speech online.More recently, however, the government appears to have sought to play down differences, saying that the Google dispute is not a threat to relations with Washington. Nor is China making any effort to prevent Chinese companies from adopting other Google products, like its Android operating system for cellphones and other mobile devices.Little is known about efforts by Google and Chinese officials to resolve the dispute, and news reports on the talks have sometimes contradicted one another. Mr. Li, of the Information Technology Ministry, told Reuters last week that the government was working with Google to resolve matters, but his vice minister, Miao Wei, later told the state-run Xinhua news agency that Google had yet to turn over a report on the hacker attacks to the ministry.Negotiations may be complicated by the fact that Internet regulation is split among a bevy of Chinese government agencies.On Friday, Mr. Li said only that “Google has made its case both privately and publicly.”'"

"'10-03-14,'0','As Senate aides worked through the weekend on drafting the legislation, key elements became clear, according to the people briefed on the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the situation was still fluid.The consumer financial protection agency would have a director appointed by the president and the ability to write rules governing mortgages, credit cards, payday loans and a wide range of other financial products.It would have some ability to ensure that the rules are followed; how the rules would be enforced has been a major source of partisan division. As in a House version of regulatory overhaul adopted in December, the bill would, in some circumstances, restrict states from writing their own, stronger consumer protection rules.The Federal Reserve would see its bank supervision powers significantly diminished. It would continue to oversee bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in assets, and would be entrusted to regulate systemically important nonbank financial institutions. Mr. Dodd had considered setting the threshold at $100 billion, which would have been even worse for the Fed.Smaller bank holding companies, if they have a federal charter, would be overseen by a new regulator formed out of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which already oversees national banks. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which already oversees state-chartered banks that are not members of the Fed system, would gain oversight over those that are.The provision for shareholder input on executive pay would represent a significant shift in corporate governance, handing a victory to shareholder activists and investors, large and small. While “say on pay,” as the provision is called, would be advisory and not binding, compensation consultants and the companies that use them fear that the provision would allow populist sentiment to boil over from annual meetings into boardrooms.Giving shareholders a way to nominate their own slates of directors using the proxy ballots that companies mail to shareholders would be similarly unnerving for boards that customarily designate their own successors, with little input or opposition from stockholders.The proposal would substantially alter the role of the Federal Reserve in protecting the economy, but the net effect would be a mixed outcome for the central bank.On one hand, the Fed would be entrusted with oversight over all systemically important financial institutions, even if they are not banks. American International Group, the insurance giant that nearly brought down the financial system, was the most notorious example of such a company in the recent financial crisis. The Fed would also continue to oversee the nation’s largest bank holding companies — those with assets of $50 billion or more, or about 35 companies.In addition, investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which converted to bank holding companies in 2008 to take advantage of the Fed’s liquidity programs, would not be able to go back to their earlier status to avoid Fed oversight.On the other hand, the Fed would lose oversight over more than 4,900 bank holding companies with roughly $3 trillion in assets, and about 870 state-chartered banks that are members of the Fed system and have a total of $1.7 trillion in assets.The Fed’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and leaders of the Fed’s 12 district banks have pressed Congress to let the Fed retain its say over smaller banks, and the fact that senators appear to be unwilling to go along is a reflection of the central bank’s diminished prestige in the wake of the financial crisis.The bill would also create a council to detect systemic risks to the financial system, and trigger, if necessary, a process to seize and dismantle a large financial firm on the verge of failure; the goal would be to limit the possibility of a broader meltdown and the need for a government bailout.The risk council would be headed by the treasury secretary and include representatives of the Fed, the new consumer agency, the F.D.I.C., the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Housing Finance Agency — along with an official appointed to monitor the insurance industry, which is largely regulated by the states.The bill would also impose comprehensive regulation of the sprawling market in over-the-counter derivatives. Standardized swaps and derivatives would have to be traded on exchanges or clearinghouses.But companies that do not primarily deal in derivatives and are not major participants in the swaps market would be exempt from the new requirements. The size and extent of that exemption has been a key focus of behind-the-scenes negotiations over the past several months.A key Republican objection to the consumer agency is that a new body of regulators empowered to write and enforce consumer protection rules could interfere with existing regulators tasked with ensuring the “safety and soundness” of banks.To address that objection, Mr. Dodd would allow the consumer agency’s rules to be overturned by a two-thirds vote of the new systemic risk council, or 6 of the 8 members, the people briefed on the matter said. In addition, the consumer agency would have enforcement powers over only those banks with more than $10 billion in assets. It would potentially have the ability to issue sanctions against nonbank financial companies, like payday lenders, debt collectors and mortgage originators and servicers, but which sectors and industries would be covered was not clear.While the bill addresses many of the priorities the Obama administration outlined last July, and which the House acted on in a financial regulatory overhaul adopted in December, the bill does not go as far as the White House would like in reining in the size and scope of banks.In January, Mr. Obama put forward a proposal he called the Volcker Rule, named for Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, which would prohibit deposit-taking banks from investing in or owning hedge funds or private equity funds, and from making market bets with their own money, as opposed to their customers’ money, a practice known as proprietary trading. Senators from both parties have said that the Volcker Rule arrived late, and have been wary of adding to a bill that is already of immense length and complexity. Like the House bill, the Dodd proposal would empower regulators to crack down on excessively risky practices, but not ban proprietary trading outright.It appeared that Mr. Dodd was focused on advancing a proposal that could advance through the Banking Committee with united support among its Democratic members, and hoped to have a committee vote on the bill before Congress recesses on March 26.He appeared to be taking steps to satisfy concerns by several Democrats on the committee, including Jack Reed of Rhode Island, who has advocated for an autonomous consumer agency, and Charles E. Schumer of New York Democrat, who has advocated for shareholder rights.'"
"'10-03-14,'0','Varnado averages 13 points and 10 rebounds, and he is still trying to build on a modest offensive game. There is nothing to build on when it comes to blocking shots. He averages almost six blocks per game this season. He had six against Vanderbilt (24-8), giving him 552 in his career, the Division I record.“My job is to clean things up,” Varnado said. “That’s what I do. I’m pretty decent at it; I’m trying to get better.”Varnado is not on scholarship this season. He explored jumping into the N.B.A. draft last April, but Coach Rick Stansbury said he could not hold the scholarship. Stansbury needed it for the high school all-American Renardo Sidney.Varnado pulled back from the draft, but without a scholarship, his parents took out a student loan. Sidney, meanwhile, has been mired in a dispute over his eligibility with the N.C.A.A. and has not played this season, but is attending classes with the help of Varnado’s scholarship. Essentially a walk-on, Varnado was named all-SEC this season.Varnado, the son of a high school basketball coach, was not highly recruited in high school in Brownsville, Tenn. The University of Tennessee looked him over, and passed, but when Varnado attended a Mississippi State basketball camp, Stansbury latched on to the potential.“You just can’t practice shot blocking, the timing and the instincts, you just have to have that,” Varnado said.Guard Barry Stewart led the Bulldogs with 14 points Saturday. Mississippi State shot just 39 percent from the field, but it forced Vanderbilt to shoot 35 percent.KENTUCKY 74, TENNESSEE 45 In a game that featured three technical fouls and plenty of cold stares, the Wildcats got revenge for one of their two losses this season.DeMarcus Cousins, a 6-foot-11 freshman center, had 19 points and 15 rebounds to lead the second-ranked Wildcats. The crowd was imposing as well with the sellout crowd of 20,207 in dominant blue colors.Tennessee (25-8), which was already expecting a berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament, shot just 31 percent from the field and was outrebounded, 44-29.'"
"'10-03-14,'0','“Every year you hear: ‘When are the Yankees going to move him off catcher? He’s not this, he’s not this,’ ” General Manager Brian Cashman said. “I don’t care what anyone else thinks. We’re going to do what we think. All the tools are there, all the ability is there. With that bat, if he can stay behind home plate? Wow.”Long said Montero reminded him of Robinson Cano — “another kid who can wake up out of bed and hit.” He has already shown a consistent ability to put the barrel of his bat on pitches and hit to the opposite field, and the Yankees are most impressed with his gift for making adjustments from at-bat to at-bat and from pitch to pitch.Cashman recalled an instance from last Sunday’s game against the Minnesota Twins, when Montero, after falling behind to Jesse Crain, 0-2, sensed that an outside breaking ball was coming. It did, and Montero poked it down the right-field line for a double.“It’s amazing that at 20 years old he’s a .320 lifetime hitter,” Long said. (Montero’s career average is actually .325.) “But he’s got to get his body in shape and turn from being a soft kid to a hard-nosed man. He’s got to do it in a hurry because he owes it to the organization. He owes it to everybody around him.”Whenever he reaches the major leagues, Montero said, it is important — “very, very important,” he said — that he does so as a catcher. The Yankees have every intention of fulfilling that wish, at least for now. The catching instructor Tony Pena and Manager Joe Girardi have worked with Montero on refining his throwing mechanics, specifically on shortening his release.According to the Yankees, Montero usually needs 1.9 to 2.0 seconds to catch and throw the ball to second base, whereas an elite catcher, like Yadier Molina of the St. Louis Cardinals, can do it in about 1.7. Long after his teammates had finished their morning workout Saturday, Montero remained in the Yankees’ bullpen to work on his throwing technique with Girardi.Pena said: “He has a strong arm — a very strong arm — but he can’t rely on that. If he has the proper mechanics, everything else will take over, and then we’ll have what we like.”If Montero is ready next season, the Yankees will happily make room. One way to integrate him would be to use him as the designated hitter and to spell Posada. Cashman said it was pointless to envision that possibility until he saw how Montero fared this season at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Posada turns 39 in August, and his contract expires after the 2011 season. By then, Montero may be ready to take over.“My job is to put the best team on the field that will help us win games,” Cashman said. “If a guy turns out to show us that he’s better than what we have, then we have to make it work. If that guy is Montero, then that’s what we’re hoping for.”Francisco Cervelli, playing for the first time since sustaining a concussion March 6, went 2 for 3 in the Yankees’ 6-2 loss to Detroit in a split-squad game in Lakeland. Cervelli wore an extra-protective batting helmet when he hit. ... As the other No. 5 starter candidates Chad Gaudin (three runs in three innings) and Sergio Mitre (three runs in four innings) struggled in Lakeland, Alfredo Aceves allowed one run to the Orioles over four innings. ... The Yankees reassigned nine players to minor league camp, including Kei Igawa and the pitching prospect Andrew Brackman.'"
"'10-03-14,'0','The higher rate was inappropriately charged at least once by more than 35,000 of the city’s taxi drivers, officials said, and more than 100 times by each of about 3,000 drivers.Over a 26-month period, the overcharges added $4 to $5 to the fare on 1.8 million trips, the commission said, for a total of $8.3 million.In a city where gridlock, street closures and aggressive drivers are the norm, taxi rides are not often thought of as pleasant experiences, as Evan Creque, a graphic designer from Queens, pointed out on a rainy Saturday morning. Asked if he had ever had a bad experience in a yellow cab, he replied, “When I open the door and get in.”For many regular riders, the report of widespread price-gouging was no shock, and it provided even more reason to opt for subway cars over cabs. The unsettling feeling of sitting in the back of a cab and watching the price tick suspiciously high was common even among tourists.Collette McHugh, 45, a travel agent consultant from Ireland, offered a solution as she was leaving the SoHo Grand hotel.“I’m going to go get the train,” she said, bypassing several waiting taxis. “They’re easier, even on a rainy day. Taxis always rip people off.”The price-gouging as described by the commission was simple, but easy for riders to miss. At the start of a ride, cabbies can simply click a small button on their meters that categorizes the trip as Code No. 4, for a ride outside the city, rather than Code 1, the lower, in-city rate.Passengers can see which rate is being charged by looking for the code number on the meter, but few riders do. The rate is also printed on every taxi receipt, something else many riders said they did not realize.Nick Coleman, 27, of Astoria, Queens, who is studying to be an olive oil expert and works at O & Co, an olive oil store in Grand Central Terminal, said he did not take many taxis and was not too bothered by stories of cab riders being duped.“In the game of capitalism, buyer beware,” he said. “The whole point of capitalism is to turn a profit. So long as this mentality remains, we the people must be skeptical of all monetary transactions.”One rider who did file a complaint said Saturday that she got little satisfaction from doing so.That rider, Monica Gutierrez, 39, said she got into a cab outside Saks Fifth Avenue on her birthday last May and asked the driver to take her to Brooklyn. He initially refused but then relented, only to activate the No. 4 setting when he turned on the meter. Ms. Gutierrez added that at the time she did not know what that meant.Along the way he stopped the cab to make a call and left the meter running. Ms. Gutierrez said that when she reached her destination near Downtown Brooklyn, the fare was more than $30, far more than what the trip usually cost. She refused to pay, but she said her mother-in-law eventually gave the money to the driver.Ms. Gutierrez filed a complaint and pursued the matter at a Taxi and Limousine Commission hearing, where the driver “made up a bunch of stories,” she said, adding that a judge eventually ruled in the driver’s favor. Now, Ms. Gutierrez said, she mostly uses the subway.“It was just a terrible experience, and it was on my birthday, so I can’t forget it,” she said.On Friday, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents drivers, said that failures of the meters and the technology that operates them were a more likely cause of the overcharges than widespread fraud. The commission, which has noted that it found overcharges only on a tiny fraction of rides in the 26-month period it examined, did not comment on that argument.At a popular spot for cabbies, the restaurant Punjabi on East Houston Street, drivers insisted Saturday that only a fraction of riders had been cheated and said they had no sympathy for any driver who was caught and penalized.“I think just a few drivers are doing it,” said Lalit Chauham, 50, who lives in Floral Park, Queens, and has been driving for 20 years. “Whoever did it, they are going to get caught.”Mr. Chauham said he worried that passengers would start second-guessing their fares.Already that morning, he said, a man got into the back seat of his cab and almost immediately asked whether he had heard the news about passengers being cheated. Ruefully, Mr. Chauham said, he turned to the passenger and acknowledged that he had. Then he continued driving.'"
"'10-03-14,'0','Three years ago, Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, jogged onto a San Francisco stage to shake hands with Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, to help him unveil a transformational wonder gadget — the iPhone — before throngs of journalists and adoring fans at the annual MacWorld Expo.Google and Apple had worked together to bring Google’s search and mapping services to the iPhone, the executives told the audience, and Mr. Schmidt joked that the collaboration was so close that the two men should simply merge their companies and call them “AppleGoo.”“Steve, my congratulations to you,” Mr. Schmidt told his corporate ally. “This product is going to be hot.” Mr. Jobs acknowledged the compliment with an ear-to-ear smile.Today, such warmth is in short supply. Mr. Jobs, Mr. Schmidt and their companies are now engaged in a gritty battle royale over the future and shape of mobile computing and cellphones, with implications that are reverberating across the digital landscape.In the last six months, Apple and Google have jousted over acquisitions, patents, directors, advisers and iPhone applications. Mr. Jobs and Mr. Schmidt have taken shots at each other’s companies in the media and in private exchanges with employees.This month, Apple sued HTC, the Taiwanese maker of mobile phones that run Google’s Android operating system, contending that HTC had violated iPhone patents. The move was widely seen as the beginning of a legal assault by Apple on Google itself, as well as an attempt to slow Google’s plans to extend its dominion to mobile devices.Apple believes that devices like smartphones and tablets should have tightly controlled, proprietary standards and that customers should take advantage of services on those gadgets with applications downloaded from Apple’s own App Store.Google, on the other hand, wants smartphones to have open, nonproprietary platforms so users can freely roam the Web for apps that work on many devices. Google has long feared that rivals like Microsoft or Apple or wireless carriers like Verizon could block access to its services on devices like smartphones, which could soon eclipse computers as the primary gateway to the Web. Google’s promotion of Android is, essentially, an effort to control its destiny in the mobile world.While the discord between Apple and Google is in part philosophical and involves enormous financial stakes, the battle also has deeply personal overtones and echoes the ego-fueled fisticuffs that have long characterized technology industry feuds. (Think Intel vs. A.M.D., Microsoft vs. everybody, and so on.)Yet according to interviews with two dozen industry watchers, Silicon Valley investors and current and former employees at both companies — most of whom requested anonymity to protect their jobs or business relationships — the clash between Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Jobs offers an unusually vivid display of enmity and ambition.At the heart of their dispute is a sense of betrayal: Mr. Jobs believes that Google violated the alliance between the companies by producing cellphones that physically, technologically and spiritually resembled the iPhone. In short, he feels that his former friends at Google picked his pocket.“We did not enter the search business. They entered the phone business,” Mr. Jobs told Apple employees during an all-hands meeting shortly after the public introduction of the iPad in January, according to two employees who were there and heard the presentation. “Make no mistake: Google wants to kill the iPhone. We won’t let them.”One of these employees said Mr. Jobs returned to the topic of Google several times in the session and even disparaged its slogan “Don’t be evil” with an expletive, which drew thunderous applause from his underlings.Apple declined to comment for this article. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founders, have openly expressed admiration for Mr. Jobs, and Google says it isn’t at war with its former ally. “Apple is a valued partner, and we have great respect for everything they have done for technology for more than 30 years,” says Jill Hazelbaker, a Google spokeswoman.In a statement, Mr. Schmidt concurred. “I continue to believe, as many do, that Steve Jobs is the best C.E.O. in the world today, and I admire Apple and Steve enormously,” he wrote.Despite such sentiments, the tech world at large is watching the battle between Apple and Google with shock and awe.“I’m sure it is going to get uglier,” says David B. Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School who has studied the tech industry for decades. “To beat Apple, Google is going to have to be very aggressive. If they are successful, it will put price pressure on Apple and the iPhone.”One well-connected Silicon Valley investor, who did not want to be identified talking about the Google-Apple feud, says he is stunned by the level of rancor he’s witnessed.'"
"'10-03-14,'0','Progress is measured by a sundial in this stunted desert kingdom. Sarah dryly refers to it as “Saudi time.”As women nudge their way into the work force, they are still hampered by archaic tribal rules and patriarchal religious ones.An American Muslim working here says there are hard adjustments, like hearing men use the occasional epithet to address her, and not being able to leave the airport coming home from a business trip because she has no husband or male relative to pick her up.She had to secure a letter from her employer stating that she could leave the airport on her own. When she wanted to buy a car, she had to use the subterfuge of having a male friend buy it for her, and even then, she can’t drive it except in one of the exclusive compounds with looser rules.A recent article in The Arab News headlined “Working Mothers in a Double Bind” showed the growing pains of Saudi suffragettes. It told of a woman who secretly hired a cook to deliver meals and assuage her husband’s demand for home-cooked dinners. When her husband caught her, he divorced her — and Saudi divorces are easy as long as you’re male.“He forgot his promises and left me just because of food,” said the woman, Huda.Saudi Arabia is in the throes of differentiating between cultural customs for women — like wearing the , not driving and not mixing with men — and actual dictates of the Koran. Many Saudis stressed that their mothers didn’t wear head scarves.“Personally, I push the envelope,” Sarah said. “I don’t cover my hair.” If she is approached by the mutawa — the religious police — she’s willing to back chat.“So if a guy is yelling at me, telling me to cover my hair, there’s something we say in Arabic that means, ‘You really shouldn’t be looking in the first place,’ ” she said. “And actually, Islam argues that men should keep their gaze down. So you can argue back to the mutawa, if you know how to do it properly.”Sarah and others I talked to in the privileged, educated set preferred not to use their full names. Free speech can be costly. “You can’t push the envelope too much or you start alienating a part of our society,” Sarah concedes, “because a part of our society is very conservative, and you have to respect that.”It is feminism played in adagio. Young women talk about wanting abayas in pastels or made of materials, being able to go out with a group of male and female friends to chic restaurants, and being able to score visas for visiting pals.“We’re allowed to invite friends now, which is a big thing,” Sarah said. “We’re at the stage where you still have to pull some strings, but in four or five years ...”Her friend Reema said that Americans are sometimes shocked to see Saudi women and realize “we’re not cowering, we’re actually quite professional. Are there issues here? Absolutely. There isn’t a place in the world that doesn’t have issues.“I’d like to live in a Saudi where the woman that chooses to cover from top-to-bottom is equally as respected as the woman who chooses not to cover her face, and people from the West can accept that it is a lifestyle choice, inasmuch as wearing a miniskirt or a long, flowing dress is a choice. I find a lot of people minimize the women’s cause in Saudi by how we dress, and that is actually offensive.”'"
"'10-03-14,'0','“If you have those kinds of incidents in your background,” said Matthew Burbank, a political scientist at the University of Utah, “I think you’d be less inclined to want to run for public office, in part because of the risk of exposure and what that would do to your career.”“For the most part,” Mr. Burbank added, “it would end your career. There’s a fairly strong moral sense in Utah.”Mr. Garn said Friday that he would not resign, but it was not clear whether he would seek re-election this year.“Any time you are involved with an under-age girl, that really raises the ante quite a bit,” said State Representative Mike Noel, a Republican. “There’s just a taboo there, big time. It’s shocking to me. It puts a damper on the whole session.”Mr. Garn said that reliving the decades-old episode and trying to grapple with the intense public scrutiny had been painful. “I’m dying,” he said. “I’m just dying.”The story unfolded because Ms. Maher, who now lives in Derry, N.H., began calling Salt Lake City news outlets in recent days to tell them about being naked with Mr. Garn when she was 15. Mr. Garn said that Ms. Maher’s statements violated a confidentiality agreement but that he was tired of living in fear.“This is something I should have done back in 2002,” said Mr. Garn, who was married at the time. “But I was scared. I did not want to be publicly judged by one of my life’s worst decisions.”Mr. Garn said that he felt like the payment to Ms. Maher amounted to extortion but that he did not plan to press charges.Ms. Maher said in e-mail and text messages to The Associated Press on Friday that she was not taking phone calls. And she said questions about whether there was any sexual contact between her and Mr. Garn were inappropriate. “I will NOT go into detail,” she wrote in a text message.Mr. Garn’s confession was the second blow to the Republican leadership in the state since the start of the year. In January, the State Senate majority leader, Sheldon Killpack, was arrested and charged with driving under the influence. He resigned a few days later.A major focal point of this legislative session was an ethics overhaul intended to restore the public’s faith in its elected leaders. As House majority leader, Mr. Garn helped shepherd much of that legislation. While in office, he has avoided sponsoring many morality bills, but he did co-sponsor a bill last year that made it illegal for teenagers to send nude pictures of themselves to others.The chairman of the Utah Republican Party, Dave Hansen, said he was shocked to read about Mr. Garn’s confession.“I’ve always known Kevin to be a very bright and very good person,” Mr. Hansen said. “It’s just one of those things I wouldn’t have expected, but let’s not forget this was 25 years ago. It’s not like it happened the last week in the legislative session, but that does not mitigate it.”'"
"'10-03-14,'0','Maureen Dowd’s column describing the “enlightened” trends in Saudi Arabia regarding women’s rights may reflect truly remarkable Saudi moves toward “chipping away at gender apartheid” (“Loosey Goosey Saudi,” March 3). Nevertheless, Saudi society cannot be compared to the dynamic, liberal Israeli society.Israeli women have long played leadership roles at all levels of society, including as prime minister. An active women’s rights movement and an independent court system provide for protection of human rights and continued progress. Israeli society is engaged in a continuing evolution, blending the best of modernity and ancient tradition.For the sake of Saudi and all Muslim women, we can hope that Prince Saud al-Faisal’s prediction of progress comes true, and that one day Saudi and all Muslim societies will be as tolerant of all groups — all Muslim sects, women, gays, Christians and Jews — as Israeli society is today.'"
"'10-03-14,'0','In the bargaining over the makeup of the last government, formed in 2006, Iraq’s three most prominent posts were divided along sectarian and ethnic lines: the prime minister to a Shiite Arab, the presidency to a Kurd and the Parliament speaker to a Sunni Arab. The process lasted more than five months and exacerbated Iraq’s divisions.But the Constitution does not stipulate the division on sectarian and ethnic lines. And while identity remains the axis of politics here, many recoil at making any affiliation a prerequisite.Until now, only the position of prime minister, by far the most powerful office, seems assured of going to a Shiite Arab. Mr. Maliki and Ayad Allawi, a secular Shiite and former interim prime minister, appear to be front-runners.In the past week, though, politicians have suggested a flurry of names for the presidency — from a representative of the Turkmen minority, whose relevance in national politics comes from its prominence in the divided city of Kirkuk in northern Iraq, to a tribal Sunni leader whose claim to fame is his late brother’s role in defeating the insurgency in western Iraq. Even Adnan Pachachi, an 86-year-old lawmaker, has expressed his desire to end his career by being president.But the most strident claims have come from Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who is a Sunni Arab, and the current president, Jalal Talabani, the Kurdish candidate, whose avuncular nature made him a compromise pick for a post even he, with a self-deprecating smile, called honorary.Mr. Hashimi’s very public ambitions for the job have already ignited a dispute with Kurdish officials, who are eager to retain a pivotal say in politics in Baghdad.Fuad Hussein, the chief of staff to Massoud Barzani, the president of the semiautonomous Kurdish region, called the notion “insulting for the Kurdish people, as if the Kurds cannot produce a president in this country or cannot be president in this country.”A statement from Mr. Barzani’s office last week went further, saying the idea that the next president must be a Sunni Arab rekindled beliefs of “chauvinism and ethnic superiority” that were redolent of the days of President Saddam Hussein.On Saturday, Mr. Hashimi apologized for any slight but reiterated his ambition.“It is the right of the vice president to express his will to be a president of the republic in the future,” a statement from his office said. It asked how “insisting on a particular person or particular ethnicity” for the position “adheres to the Constitution.”The intensity of the dispute reflects some of the most divisive issues before Iraq today, from Shiite fears that an aggressive Sunni president could weaken their decisive sway over the country’s politics to Sunni ambitions to reclaim prominence through a position that, while symbolic, could serve as a pulpit for the community’s concerns.Often heard is the Sunni Arab contention that an Arab president, in a country with a clear Arab majority, would help restore Iraq’s tattered relations with other Arab states.“I prefer him to be an Arab,” said Muqdad Jaafar, a professor of physical education at Baghdad University. “We’re an Arab country, surrounded by the Arab world. Hashimi has good relations with our Arab neighbors.” The Kurds have taken pride in the presidency, viewing it as an acknowledgment of Iraq’s diversity after decades of state-ordained orthodoxy about Iraq’s Arab identity. But they themselves are divided over the post. A dissident group in Mr. Talabani’s own movement has opposed his candidacy. Even if the Kurds keep the post, politicians say, they may fail to agree on someone with Mr. Talabani’s stature.The stakes are high. In an interim arrangement, Iraq has had a presidency council, consisting of the president and two vice presidents, each with the power of veto. That council, though, is not stipulated by the Constitution. Some have suggested the arrangement may persist, but if not, the presidency could assume a higher profile simply by being in the hands of one person.In fact, one of Mr. Talabani’s strengths was his reticence on taking strong positions in a country whose political process has shown a remarkable tendency toward deadlock.“To be fair, many Iraqis saw in Talabani more than just a Kurd,” said Barham Salih, the prime minister of the Kurdish region and an ally of Mr. Talabani’s. “They saw in him someone who has the ability to bring the various factions of Iraq together.”'"
"'10-03-14,'0','KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan has agreed to reverse an earlier decision and allow two foreigners on a commission that will monitor coming parliamentary elections, his spokesman said Saturday.The development comes amid pressure on Afghanistan to avoid a repeat of last year’s fraud-tainted presidential vote.Last month, Mr. Karzai signed a decree allowing him to appoint all five members of the Electoral Complaints Commission in consultation with parliamentary leaders and the chief of the Supreme Court. The commission previously had three United Nations appointees.The decree was criticized as a bid to control the monitoring process ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for September.After last year’s presidential election, the complaints commission ruled that there had been widespread ballot stuffing. It stripped Mr. Karzai of nearly one-third of his votes, forcing a potential runoff. Mr. Karzai was eventually declared the president when his remaining challenger dropped out of the race.'"

"'10-03-14,'0','Such studies present a different way to look at hunger: not starving, but “food insecure,” as the researchers call it (the Department of Agriculture in 2006 stopped using the word “hunger” in its reports). This might mean simply being unable to afford the basics, unable to get to the grocery or unable to find fresh produce among the pizza shops, doughnut stores and fried-everything restaurants of East Fordham Road.Precious, the character at the center of the Academy Award-winning movie by the same name, would probably count as food insecure even though she is severely obese (her home, Harlem, ranks 49th on the survey’s list, with 24.1 percent of residents saying they lacked money for food in the previous year). There she is stealing a family-size bucket of fried chicken from a fast-food restaurant. For breakfast.That it is greasy chicken, and that she vomits it up in a subsequent scene, points to the problem that experts call a key bridge between hunger and obesity: the scarcity of healthful options in low-income neighborhoods and the unlikelihood that poor, food-insecure people like Precious would choose them.Full-service, reasonably priced supermarkets are rare in impoverished neighborhoods, and the ones that are there tend to carry more processed foods than seasonal fruits and vegetables. A 2008 study by the city government showed that 9 of the Bronx’s 12 community districts had too few supermarkets, forcing huge swaths of the borough to rely largely on unhealthful, but cheap, food.“When you’re just trying to get your calorie intake, you’re going to get what fills your belly,” said Mr. Berg, the author of “All You Can Eat: How Hungry Is America?” “And that may make you heavier even as you’re really struggling to secure enough food.”For the center’s survey, Gallup asked more than 530,000 people across the nation a single question: “Have there been times in the past 12 months when you did not have enough money to buy food that you or your family needed?”The unusually large sample size allowed researchers to zero in on trouble spots like the South Bronx.New York’s 10th Congressional District, which zigzags across Brooklyn and includes neighborhoods like East New York and Bedford-Stuyvesant, ranked sixth in the survey, and Newark ranked ninth, both with about 31 percent of residents showing food hardship. (At the state level, the South is the hungriest: Mississippi tops the list at 26 percent, followed by Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, the Carolinas and Oklahoma. New York ranks 27th, with 17.4 percent; New Jersey is 41st, with 15.5 percent; and Connecticut is 47th, with 14.6 percent.)The survey, conducted over the past two years, showed that food hardship peaked at 19.5 percent nationwide in the fourth quarter of 2008, as the economic crisis gripped the nation. It dropped to 17.9 percent by the summer of 2009, then rose to 18.5 percent.Though this was the first year that the center did such a survey, it used a question similar to one the Department of Agriculture has been asking for years. The most recent survey by the agency, from 2008, found that 14.6 percent of Americans had low to very low food security.Bloomberg administration officials see hunger and obesity as linked problems that can be addressed in part by making healthful food more affordable.“It’s a subtle, complicated link, but they’re very much linked, so the strategic response needs to be linked in various ways,” said Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services. “We tackle the challenge on three fronts — providing income supports, increasing healthy options and encouraging nutritious behavior.”To that end, the city offers a Health Bucks program that encourages people to spend their food stamps at farmers’ markets by giving them an extra $2 coupon for every $5 spent there.The city has also created initiatives to send carts selling fresh fruits and vegetables to poor neighborhoods, and to draw grocery stores carrying fresh fruit and produce to low-income areas by offering them tax credits and other incentives. The city last month announced the first recipients of those incentives: a Foodtown store that burned down last year will be rebuilt and expanded in the Norwood section of the Bronx, and a Western Beef store near the Tremont subway station will be expanded.But the Bronx’s hunger and obesity problems are not simply related to the lack of fresh food. Experts point to a swirling combination of factors that are tied to, and exacerbated by, poverty.Poor people “often work longer hours and work multiple jobs, so they tend to eat on the run,” said Dr. Rundle of Columbia. “They have less time to work out or exercise, so the deck is really stacked against them.”Indeed, the food insecurity study is hardly the first statistical measure in which the Bronx lands on the top — or, in reality, the bottom. The borough’s 14.1 percent unemployment rate is the highest in the state. It is one of the poorest counties in the nation. And it was recently ranked the unhealthiest of New York’s 62 counties.“If you look at rates of obesity, diabetes, poor access to grocery stores, poverty rates, unemployment and hunger measures, the Bronx lights up on all of those,” said Triada Stampas of the Food Bank for New York City. “They’re all very much interconnected.”'"
"'10-03-14,'0','Judge Pickard’s decision “opened citizens’ eyes” to the consequences of having ignored the issue, said Oxford’s first selectwoman, Mary Ann Drayton-Rogers. The moratorium, which would not apply to the Garden Homes project, is meant to ward off a potential rush of applications from developers while planning officials work on writing the overdue regulations, she said.Patrick Cocchiarella, who heads the town planning commission, made the case for the moratorium this way: “We’re amateurs, so what we needed was some breathing room. This is kind of like calling a truce while we figure out which direction we’re going in.”No other Connecticut municipality has imposed an affordable-housing moratorium since the statute governing such housing, called 8-30g, was adopted 19 years ago, according to Timothy Hollister, Garden Homes Management’s lawyer. The reason, in Mr. Hollister’s opinion, is that such a moratorium is clearly not permissible under the statute, which he helped write.Mr. Cocchiarella said the town counsel’s opinion was that the town does have that authority, although the question has never been tested in court. Either way, if Oxford makes the moratorium work, other municipalities confronting their obligations under 8-30g will surely follow its example, said David Elder, the senior planner for the Valley Council of Governments, a regional planning organization.“In some ways,” Mr. Elder said, “the statutes don’t allow towns the freedom to really look at, say, ‘Where will our infrastructure support really dense development?’ A moratorium could give towns that time.”A fairly rural community in the central Naugatuck Valley, Oxford has struggled with rapid growth over the past decade. Although it is still among the least dense communities in the valley, its population of roughly 13,000 represents a 30 percent increase over 2000.The town’s minimum two-acre zoning encourages single-family houses. Denser development has been approved for age-restricted communities, but higher density has otherwise been prohibited to date.The subject of affordable housing became a flashpoint in local elections last year, after town officials accepted a state grant to study suitable locations for mixed-income housing. The planning commission abandoned the study after it was accused by some political challengers of inviting low-income high-rises to town.The Garden Homes decision came shortly after the election; the town is pursuing an appeal.The 8-30g statute is intended to compensate for the lack of affordable housing statewide by limiting the conditions under which towns may deny applications for such developments. Builders may appeal a denial in court, placing the burden on the town to prove that the project’s potential infringement upon the public interest outweighs the need.Towns qualify for a permanent exemption from the law once 10 percent of their overall housing stock meets the definition of affordable. Oxford is well below this threshold, at 1.1 percent.According to Mr. Hollister, the notion of a town-imposed moratorium runs contrary to the statute’s intent. Although the state does grant four-year moratoriums, towns must show they have approved enough new units to warrant a slowdown.“The moratorium is a reward,” Mr. Hollister said. “If towns could declare a moratorium, every town in the state would do so and then take years to get their regulations done.”Oxford officials say they hope to have regulations in place by Jan. 15 of next year, when the moratorium expires. Avoiding controversy in the meantime, however, may prove a challenge. Keep Oxford Green, a political action committee formed last year, will speak out against any regulations that allow for high-density apartment or condominium complexes, the group’s president, Ed Carver, said.“Everybody would like an affordable house — I’d like an affordable house,” he said. “But there’s a big difference between an affordable house and a high-density apartment building.”'"
"'10-03-14,'0','Housing counselors offer at least one possible explanation for the shift: some people with financial reversals who are in danger of losing their homes anyway might be more likely to pay back their credit cards, because they still need them to buy groceries and other essential items.Ms. Bell declined to speculate about the motivations of borrowers. Because the FICO analysis did not look at specific households, she said she could not determine whether a particular family carried both a mortgage and credit cards, and defaulted on one before the other.But she did say that the growing mortgage problem among households with high FICO scores might be linked to two areas of increasing trouble in the mortgage industry — namely, defaults on vacation homes, and so-called strategic defaults, in which owners abandon homes that are worth less than the mortgage.The Mortgage Bankers Association, which closely tracks foreclosures and defaults, says it does not track such statistics for vacation homes. But Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors, said that if foreclosures had risen among vacation homes, their owners would most likely have bought the properties recently and for investment purposes.The more value a home loses, the more likely an owner will be to consider a strategic default. A study in late 2009 by three university researchers — from the European University Institute, Northwestern University and the University of Chicago — found that when the mortgage exceeds the home’s value by less than 10 percent, homeowners rarely consider a strategic default. But if the value was just half the mortgage amount, 17 percent would abandon the house, and the loan.FICO did not break out its recent data by state, but its regional data suggest that those with high credit scores in the Northeast were faring better than such people elsewhere. In the Northeast, borrowers with high FICO scores were still twice as likely to default on their credit cards as their mortgages. In 2005, they were four times as likely to default on their credit cards as their mortgages.Borrowers with FICO scores of 760 and higher generally qualify for a bank’s best mortgage rate, as long as the down payment and monthly income also fall within the bank’s limits. A score of 720 is considered “prime,” and is usually the lowest rate that will allow borrowers to secure the most widely advertised mortgage rates.FICO does not publish an average FICO score, but the company said the median score was about 720. And for the high FICO borrowers who default, even 720 is a dream score. One default drops such people into the mid-600 range, at best.'"
"'10-03-14,'0','In 1988, The New York Times ran the Le Bernardin chef Gilbert Le Coze’s famed recipe for bouillabaisse, with its 13 steps and 25 ingredients. And that was pretty much the symbolic end for the Marseillaise fish stew: over the years, chefs made it so complicated that no one actually wanted to eat it, let alone source all the fish and cook it.Bouillabaisse has long had a reputation for being difficult and confusing. In 2002, R. W. Apple Jr., the Times reporter and noted bon vivant, wrote that “controversy clings to bouillabaisse like barnacles to a ship. Is it a soup? Perhaps not, because the broth and the solids are eaten separately. Is it a stew? Surely not, because a stew by definition is cooked very slowly, and bouillabaisse must be boiled furiously to achieve an amalgamation of olive oil with water and wine. It is best described as a fish boil, which is what its name seems to imply.” Alan Davidson, in “The Oxford Companion to Food,” points out that a 19th-century dictionary by Littré interprets it as bouillon abaissé, or “broth lowered,” meaning the broth is boiled down.Whatever you want to call it — broth lowered or fish boil, soup or stew — bouillabaisse is meant to contain a bunch of fish, olive oil and water, and is not supposed to take three days to make. A century ago, it was much simpler. It was an ideal dish for home cooks: there was no doting over perfect slices of fish, no high-octane fish stock and no mention of garlicky rouille. It began with water, olive oil and sometimes wine, an onion or two, tomatoes, saffron, some herbs and fish. Then you gave the mix a blast of heat so the oil and broth would come to an excited boil and engulf the aromatics.The 1904 recipe I settled on contained equal parts water and oil and half the amount of white wine. The saffron- and herb-scented oil insulates the fish and dresses it as the fish breaks down, making for a rich and rustic oily broth. It completely changed my sense of what bouillabaisse could be.Of course, this old-style version is so unembellished that it’s not for everyone. Sang Yoon — the chef at the Father’s Office gastropubs in Los Angeles, whom I asked to try the recipe — called it “a head-scratcher.” He and his cooks found it difficult to add so much oil to the soup pot. “It didn’t remind me of bouillabaisse or a Provençal fish soup,” Yoon said. But he, like most of us, grew up with Le Coze-style bouillabaisse.'"

"'10-03-14,'0','The book makes excellent use of rarely seen photographs from the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam — the museum located in the building at 263 Prinsengracht where Otto Frank had his business and where he and his partner, Hermann van Pels, converted a “secret annex” on the rear top floors into a hiding place. (A remarkable series of illustrations demonstrates how the annex was hidden from street view.) Under the intimacy of the authors’ gaze, Anne emerges with her vulnerability and contradictions intact. She is allowed her hopes and self-­proclaimed idealism, and also her terrors and, more prominently than usual, her loneliness (“Her father had turned out to be a disappointment,” the authors write). In short, she stays an individual. Of the book’s less well-known images, perhaps the most striking is a breathtaking new view of Anne: a snapshot of her at a writing desk at home, an expression of luminous intelligence on her face as she looks up and past the camera.When the diary ends, the book stays within as close a range as possible to Anne, drawing on Willy Lindwer’s “Last Seven Months of Anne Frank” for much of the text and on photographs of the various concentration camps and death camps to which the Franks and the others in hiding were sent. Though the authors don’t exclude photographs of atrocities, neither do they play up the worst details or choose the most shocking pictures. They do not permit the reader to grow numb.Those who know Anne Frank’s story may approach “A Faraway Island” — winner of this year’s Batchelder Award for the most outstanding children’s work published in translation — with the presumption that its protagonists are the lucky ones. Twelve-year-old Stephie and her younger sister, Nellie, are the daughters of a doctor and a retired opera singer. As this novel opens, it’s the summer of 1939, the year after the Anschluss, and the sisters have left Vienna on a train with other Jewish refugee children, bound for Sweden. The girls fully expect their parents to be obtaining visas for America and reuniting in Amsterdam in six months’ time; they also expect to stay together. (The comparison is painful: Melissa Müller’s 1998 biography, “Anne Frank,” revealed that a cousin in England had offered to take Anne and her sister, Margot, but that Otto and Edith Frank couldn’t bear the thought of ­separation.)The author, Annika Thor, based Stephie and Nellie’s experiences on interviews she conducted with some of the 500 Jews who found refuge in Sweden as children during World War II, along with stories from her own family. She unobtrusively brings the reader into full alignment with Stephie, who finds herself sent to a bleak fishing village, living apart from Nellie with a dour housewife who has hung a picture of Jesus in Stephie’s bedroom (“Doesn’t she know I’m Jewish?” she asks herself).But Stephie’s foster mother is less intractable than she first seems. As Thor slowly shades her characters, deepening their personalities as Stephie gets to know them, she also captures the approaching noise of war.Stephie’s conflicts multiply: she knows she is supposed to be grateful, and flashbacks to the anti-Semitism she has experienced and the brutality she has witnessed give readers enough background to understand what she has escaped. She is grateful, and she is good. But she is also angry: she has been raised with cooks and maids and fine clothing and, most of all, attentive parents, and no one acknowledges her losses. “Old, worn-out books will do for a foreign child,” she thinks bitterly, “a refugee child who has to live off the charity of others.”Anxiety overhangs Stephie’s every step. As Germany invades Poland, each piece of news has repercussions for her family and increases her sense of responsibility for her sister. The tension is just right, as schoolroom dramas distract both Stephie and the reader from the otherwise overwhelming danger her parents face.The first of four novels that have been widely published abroad, “A Faraway Island” concludes after Norway has been invaded and Stephie’s parents have asked her to help get them visas to Sweden. Readers will want to know what happens next for the characters in this powerful series.'"
"'10-03-14,'0','Four women I know — none of whom know one another — are building chicken coops in their backyards. It goes without saying that they already raise organic produce: my town, Berkeley, Calif., is the Vatican of locavorism, the high church of Alice Waters. Kitchen gardens are as much a given here as indoor plumbing. But chickens? That ups the ante. Apparently it is no longer enough to know the name of the farm your eggs came from; now you need to know the name of the actual bird.All of these gals — these chicks with chicks — are stay-at-home moms, highly educated women who left the work force to care for kith and kin. I don’t think that’s a coincidence: the omnivore’s dilemma has provided an unexpected out from the feminist predicament, a way for women to embrace homemaking without becoming Betty Draper. “Prior to this, I felt like my choices were either to break the glass ceiling or to accept the gilded cage,” says Shannon Hayes, a grass-fed-livestock farmer in upstate New York and author of “Radical Homemakers,” a manifesto for “tomato-canning feminists,” which was published last month.Hayes pointed out that the original “problem that had no name” was as much spiritual as economic: a malaise that overtook middle-class housewives trapped in a life of schlepping and shopping. A generation and many lawsuits later, some women found meaning and power through paid employment. Others merely found a new source of alienation. What to do? The wages of housewifery had not changed — an increased risk of depression, a niggling purposelessness, economic dependence on your husband — only now, bearing them was considered a “choice”: if you felt stuck, it was your own fault. What’s more, though today’s soccer moms may argue, quite rightly, that caretaking is undervalued in a society that measures success by a paycheck, their role is made possible by the size of their husband’s. In that way, they’ve been more of a pendulum swing than true game changers.Femivorism is grounded in the very principles of self-sufficiency, autonomy and personal fulfillment that drove women into the work force in the first place. Given how conscious (not to say obsessive) everyone has become about the source of their food — who these days can’t wax poetic about compost? — it also confers instant legitimacy. Rather than embodying the limits of one movement, femivores expand those of another: feeding their families clean, flavorful food; reducing their carbon footprints; producing sustainably instead of consuming rampantly. What could be more vital, more gratifying, more morally defensible?There is even an economic argument for choosing a literal nest egg over a figurative one. Conventional feminist wisdom held that two incomes were necessary to provide a family’s basic needs — not to mention to guard against job loss, catastrophic illness, divorce or the death of a spouse. Femivores suggest that knowing how to feed and clothe yourself regardless of circumstance, to turn paucity into plenty, is an equal — possibly greater — safety net. After all, who is better equipped to weather this economy, the high-earning woman who loses her job or the frugal homemaker who can count her chickens?Hayes would consider my friends’ efforts admirable if transitional. Her goal is larger: a renunciation of consumer culture, a return (or maybe an advance) to a kind of modern preindustrialism in which the home is self-sustaining, the center of labor and livelihood for both sexes. She interviewed more than a dozen families who were pursuing this way of life. They earned an average of $40,000 for a family of four. They canned peaches, stuffed sausages, grew kale, made soap. Some eschewed health insurance, and most home-schooled their kids. That, I suspect, is a little further than most of us are willing to go: it sounds a bit like being Amish, except with a car (no more than one, naturally) and a green political agenda.'"
"'10-03-14,'0','The propositions juxtaposed by Jonah Lehrer are not mutually exclusive. Depression, as framed in his article, could be an adaptive tendency to rethink decisions and mull over past events, thereby increasing focus. When severe, however, depression could be regarded as a brain disease and the inability to stop repetitive thinking could be seen as a symptom.Similarly, the immune response to foreign agents is a critical adaptive trait that cures us of most infections. When our immune system overreacts, though, causing illnesses like poison ivy and rheumatic fever, the term “disease” is warranted.It is not difficult to recognize the difference between a person’s sadness, which can come with life events, and that person’s disease of depression, which causes him to feel he is unworthy of medical care and to believe he is dying of a dread disease, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Recognizing depression, the disease, is even more convincing when effective treatment completely restores the patientto the previous “normal” self.My clinical experience does not reflect the premise that depression promotes problem solving. Rather, in most of my patients, depressive thinking creates the illusion that they are confronted with serious dilemmas. Debilitating ruminations — whether to leave a job, end a relationship or move across the country — become background noise or even evaporate once depression is adequately treated, leaving patients confused that they had felt such torment over issues that no longer hold such urgency.'"
"'10-03-14,'0','To the uninitiated, vision therapy is a funny-looking endeavor. Practitioners’ offices are equipped with picture-viewing stereoscopes that look like something from the Victorian era. Some practitioners use a Visagraph — black goggles hooked up with infrared sensors — to measure and track children’s eye movements while reading and to test their fluency and comprehension. Depending on the practice, you may see children standing in hula hoops, dodging balls suspended from strings, looking through prisms that give them double vision and then trying to fuse the image, playing Wii-like games for balance and “visual thinking” or pointing to bright spots blinking on a light box for hand-eye coordination.When I visited Appelbaum in January, I watched as a boy named Brian Dennis sat on a stool wearing prism glasses and struggling to see straight as he faced a spinning board covered with red and green lines and black squares. As the board turned and a metronome ticked, he worked to follow the shapes as they swiveled, keeping them clear, single and distinct, one eye at a time. Some young patients, Appelbaum noted with a laugh, leave their therapy sessions only to vomit on his waiting-room floor, which is why his entryway is now uncarpeted.On the day that we met in that bare-floored vestibule, Appelbaum spoke animatedly with Brian’s mother, Francesca Dennis, who works in human resources and is from Silver Spring, Md. An affable man, Applelbaum has an enthusiasm for vision therapy that is boundless and infectious. As a child, he suffered from chronic headaches and hated to read. Then in optometry school, in the 1970s, he found out he had convergence insufficiency — a condition characterized by eyes that don’t turn in together, or converge, well for close work like reading — and was treated with eye exercises. His headaches disappeared, and his life was changed. “I went from a reluctant reader to this voracious, active reader,” he says.Brian began vision therapy because he, too, hated to read. He was doing poorly in school, struggling to stay focused in class, and his teachers started suggesting he had attention-deficit disorder. His school, a private religious school, began intimating that he might have to leave.“He was becoming more and more frustrated,” his mother recalled.A psychologist diagnosed , saying that a toxic school environment was driving Brian to distraction.But Dennis suspected another cause of her son’s difficulties. He was born walleyed, with one eye that visibly turned out. And although the condition largely disappeared over the years, and though a pediatric ophthalmologist who had followed Brian since infancy said the boy had perfectly normal vision, Dennis was sure that something was being overlooked. “I just kept thinking,” she told me in the waiting room, “he wasn’t paying attention in school because of that eye.”Appelbaum agreed. He prescribed a range of exercises to get Brian’s eyes to stay straight and work together. He also gave Brian a pair of extremely low-power glasses to help reduce his “visual stress” — the fatigue he says accompanies trying to work with improperly aligned eyes.Brian did the exercises and, at home at least, wore the glasses. And after four months, his mother said, he “just blossomed.” He became happier in school. He improved in sports. “Now he just has so much confidence,” Dennis told Appelbaum, as she waited for Brian to finish a therapy session.Appelbaum then told Dennis about Larry Fitzgerald, the wide receiver, who started life appearing to be a not-particularly-gifted athlete. He didn’t like reading. He didn’t do well in school. But then he got vision therapy — help that, Fitzgerald has said publicly in recent years, changed everything. And he went on to become a star.This is one of Appelbaum’s favorite stories.“This is gonna be Brian,” he said.“Whatever it costs, whatever we have to do,” Dennis declared. She and her husband were committed, she said.The ground-floor hallway of Appelbaum’s homey practice is hung with framed statements from ecstatic parents and former patients who say their headaches, reading problems, , low self-esteem and school misery evaporated once they began to do vision therapy.Appelbaum keeps scores of additional happy stories in a folder. There is one from a family in who flew cross-country one summer and stayed three weeks so that their third-grade son could do two hours of vision therapy a day. Subsequently, they write, he went up two grade levels in reading and started to play sports. There is also a note from the family of a girl whose struggles in school were so terrible that her mother quit her job in order to have the time and energy to help with homework. After vision therapy, she reads without help, is first-chair violin in the school orchestra and is now volunteering to work with a blind child.These glowing reports are echoed on the Internet, where sites like the Optometrists Network and Parents Active for Vision Education are filled with tributes to the life-changing effects of vision therapy and tales of unfortunate encounters with mainstream medical specialists who either overlook important vision issues in children or misdiagnose them as learning disabilities, emotional problems or A.D.H.D. They refer readers to studies showing links between vision problems like convergence insufficiency and reading and attention issues.According to a press release by the American Optometric Association, “studies indicate that 60 percent of children identified as ‘problem learners’ actually suffer from undetected vision problems and in some cases have been inaccurately diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.” Many behavioral optometrists say that 20 to 25 percent of children overall have vision problems that can impede their ability to reach their potential. These problems commonly include: poor eye-movement control or “tracking issues,” problems with accommodation (when the eyes don’t focus well together or sustain focus at various distances), convergence insufficiency, difficulties sustaining visual attention, poor visual-motor integration (bad hand-eye coordination), weak visual form perception (the ability to reproduce and generalize shapes) and poor visual . The symptoms of these eye problems, the vision therapists say, commonly include getting lost on the page while reading, difficulty copying from the blackboard or from one page to another, skipping or omitting words while reading, an avoidance of close work, difficulty in remaining focused, poor handwriting and sports performance. With vision therapy, in most cases, these problems can be fixed, they say. And through more holistic, more natural, more humanistic methods than those offered by mainstream medicine.Or, as Appelbaum puts it: “There are a lot of doctors and therapists who have a vested interest in teaching the child how to deal with their problem. Then there are people like me . . . who want to get rid of the root of the problem.”The claims that many make for vision therapy are controversial. In fact, vision therapy is a practice that many doctors say lacks a solid grounding in good science. “It has no validity,” says Marshall Keys, a Rockville, Md., pediatric and adolescent ophthalmologist who is an outspoken critic of vision therapy.Pediatricians do not generally refer patients to vision therapy. Ask about vision therapy at the National Institute of Mental Health (the branch of the that includes learning disabilities and A.D.H.D. in its purview), and they draw a blank. The same is true at the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, where you might assume vision therapy would be a subject of interest. Query the National Eye Institute, the branch of the N.I.H. that conducts vision research and you get one study — one single randomized, placebo-controlled “gold standard” study — that recommends in-office vision therapy for the treatment of convergence insufficiency, the condition for which Appelbaum was so successfully treated back in optometry school. Beyond that, you get the sense that doctors speaking in an official capacity don’t much like to offend their colleagues. “The kind of proof we look for in terms of things we want to uniformly refer to people is really at the level of science,” Brian Brooks, an investigator and the chief of the unit on pediatric, developmental and genetic ophthalmology at the National Eye Institute, told me. “The N.E.I. is here to do science — we want to encourage science. . . . That’s the area of discomfort.”Vision therapy’s critics argue that the published research in its favor is largely anecdotal, often derived from studies in which the practitioners had a vested interest in positive results, where disorders were badly defined and therapies inconsistently practiced and during which children were usually receiving other kinds of therapy.All of that renders the research “useless scientifically,” says Walter Fierson, a pediatric ophthalmologist in and a former chairman of the ’ section on ophthalmology.Critics say that behavioral optometry rests upon some very basic misconceptions about the way the brain operates, particularly regarding the processes involved in paying attention and reading. They point out that recent advances in brain imaging have shown that most reading problems are not vision problems but instead involve glitches in language processing in the brain.Some behaviors, they say, appear to be caused by problems with vision but really aren’t. Children with dyslexia, for example, may often lose their place while reading, but this isn’t because they have eye issues — many studies have shown that ocular coordination, movement and visual processing are normal in these children — but because they are struggling to decode letters and word combinations. Some critics do acknowledge that eye problems like convergence insufficiency and accommodation disorders can cause serious problems with reading. But they argue that behavioral optometrists grossly overdiagnose these conditions, which pediatric ophthalmologists say occur in only a small percentage of children — perhaps 1 percent of the patients he sees, says David Guyton, a professor of pediatric ophthalmology and the director of the Krieger Children’s Eye Center at the Wilmer Eye Institute, at Johns Hopkins Hospital.“Ophthalmologists as a rule do not test for convergence insufficiency or accommodation disorders,” Appelbaum responds. “If you don’t test for a problem, you won’t see it at all.”At base, the dispute comes down to the fact that behavioral optometrists and pediatric ophthalmologists define what constitutes a diagnosable level of problems like convergence insufficiency differently. “The two professions can’t talk to each other because their basic definitions are so different,” Guyton says.Guyton says that many of his colleagues in ophthalmology can be too categorical in condemning vision therapy, which he says can be of real value in helping patients overcome a number of eye problems. The trouble is, he says, behavioral optometrists overstate their claims, generalizing, for example, from the evidence that vision therapy works for convergence insufficiency to validate all that they do. “You really can’t validate by association,” Guyton says.He and other critics say, for example, that the low-power glasses that behavioral optometrists prescribe to reduce stress are so weak that they can’t actually have any effect on a child’s vision — except to make the child believe that they are helping his vision (or to please a parent who believes they are helping the child’s vision).And A.D.H.D. specialists argue that the symptoms behavioral optometrists attribute to problems with vision (problems with “visual attention,” specifically) are primarily problems of self-regulation and executive function. It may look as if these kids are having problems with their eyes — they’ll look away from what they’re supposed to attend to; they’ll lose track of where they are while reading, or jump over words on a page — but the problem is occurring in the part of the brain that controls attention, not vision, says William Stixrud, a neuropsychologist in . The behavioral optometrists, Stixrud notes, often confuse association and causation. These kids “do have problems with things like visual memory, but that’s because those parts of the brain that do that also control attention.” Stixrud adds that he does refer some children to vision therapy, but only if they have “adequate reading skills but it’s uncomfortable for them to read, they have headaches or words bounce around on the page.”It isn’t just ophthalmologists, arguably the natural business rivals of optometrists, or learning or attention specialists (also competitors for clients), who dispute many of the claims of behavioral optometry. Eager to assess the validity of the practices of a growing number of their colleagues, the U.K. College of Optometrists, an association of optometrists, commissioned major reviews of the literature on vision therapy in 2000 and 2008. The studies came out in favor of in-office exercises for convergence insufficiency and also found there was valid research to indicate that vision therapy may help rehabilitate the vision of stroke and trauma patients. But regarding the assertions of behavioral optometrists — that vision therapy can make a meaningful difference in the kinds of children who are commonly given diagnoses of conditions like learning disabilities, A.D.H.D., autism spectrum disorders or problems with coordination — the group issued a vote of no confidence. “The continued absence of rigorous scientific evidence to support behavioral management approaches, and the paucity of controlled trials in particular, represents a major challenge to the credibility of the theory and practice of behavioral optometry,” Brendan T. Barrett, an optometrist, concluded in the second College of Optometrists report.The American Academy of Pediatrics also essentially declared war on behavioral optometry last summer. It reviewed 35 years of the literature in support of vision therapy and issued a statement — in conjunction with other ophthalmological associations — condemning the therapy and its contention that it could help with learning disabilities. Visual problems, it claimed, are not the basis for learning disabilities.It issued a stern warning about the seductions of treatments that sound convincing but aren’t based on science: “Ineffective, controversial methods of treatment such as vision therapy may give parents and teachers a false sense of security that a child’s learning difficulties are being addressed, may waste family and/or school resources and may delay proper instruction or remediation.”All this has done nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of vision therapy’s parent backers and practitioners. If anything, the constant chorus of negativity from mainstream medicine has fueled a crusade to help vision therapy spread from the rarefied realm of those who can afford it (treatment typically costs thousands of dollars out of pocket each year) to the population at large.To that end, advocacy organizations have worked hard to publicize and gain acceptance for behavioral-optometry techniques. Some behavioral optometrists make visits to elementary schools, offering free optometric screenings. They offer continuing-education seminars for teachers and school counselors. Around the country, advocates of behavioral optometry have been pushing state legislatures to mandate that every child have a complete beyond the screening routinely performed by pediatricians before and to require companies to reimburse vision therapy. The National PTA in 1999 passed a resolution calling upon all public schools to screen for the kinds of “visual skill deficiencies” behavioral optometrists treat. (Even the passed a resolution, at its 100th convention last year, endorsing vision therapy as a way to help some prisoners become productive members of society.)“It’s a big problem,” Fierson, the former chairman of ophthalmology says of the spread of vision therapy, “and it’s not going away.”Why, given the near unanimity of the medical opinion arrayed against it, do so many parents swear by vision therapy? Why are they moved not just to pay for it but also to advocate, even evangelize for it, helping optometrists spread their influence in greater numbers of communities and schools?The reasons have as much to do with the very appealing promises of vision therapy as with the culture of parenting today — and with the peculiar culture of parents of children with issues in particular. Vision therapy is noninvasive, nonjudgmental and logical-seeming. (If a kid has problems with reading, copying from the board, tires easily during homework and loses focus, wouldn’t it stand to reason that there’s something wrong with his eyes?) The fact that virtually no medical doctors endorse the wider claims of vision therapy means little to those who, whether because of temperament, philosophy or discouraging experience with the medical establishment, are used to going it alone when it comes to their child’s treatment.“Vision makes sense,” says Shelly Galli, a Washington mother whose daughter, Camille, is autistic and who has spent much of Camille’s life being told by doctors that the treatments she wants to pursue won’t work.What makes sense, too, to many parents today is that vision therapists often see children’s learning and attention problems as part of the high-pressure society that kids are forced to grow up in. While problems like A.D.H.D., dyslexia and other developmental or learning disorders are now seen by mainstream medicine as related to differences in brain structure, wiring and chemistry, the behavioral-optometry model conceives of achievement-related problems as resulting from the environment: notably, the stress of growing up in an unnatural and overly visually demanding world.This idea — however contemporary-sounding in an era of ubiquitous computers, video games and preschool reading programs — is far from new. In the late 19th century, the ophthalmologist William Horatio Bates proposed that conditions like and arose from eye and mental strain. Bates believed they could be addressed through deep relaxation of the eye induced by “palming,” or covering closed eyes with one’s palms. In the early 20th century, Arthur Marten Skeffington, an English optometrist generally considered the founding father of behavioral optometry, developed his theory of vision and described reading and other close work as “socially compulsive” and “biologically unacceptable.” A person who is “constrained” to read, he wrote, becomes “an impaired organism.”When modern-day behavioral optometrists put this theory into practice, they talk about the demands of universal literacy. They talk about children who spend too much time indoors and not enough time outside, letting their eyes roam as their ancestors’ did, hunting and scanning the horizon for predators.This overarching theory of eye and brain dysfunction resonates with parents, many of whom believe, as does Jeffrey Kraskin, an optometrist in Washington, that children with issues are merely canaries in the coal mine for the pathologies of our time, being labeled as “sick” when their bodies and minds can’t adapt to the accelerated demands of our era.“A human problem becomes apparent when a demand is greater than the ability,” Kraskin says. “We’re making our demands on human beings earlier. If you push a person to do something before they’re ready, something’s got to give. And I think that when that thing gives, you see attention-deficit disorder.”In this schema, vision therapy just undoes what culture has created. There’s nothing actually wrong with the child who’s struggling to learn or pay attention — his or her dysfunction has been caused by the outside world. This reasoning is filled with the promise that, with the right kind of care, any child can rise to any sort of opportunity. Its logic is particularly well suited to parents who believe that if they have the time and money they can — indeed, must — do all they can to give their children the best shot in life. If they have a child with issues, they must try everything, wrestle with fate and take it upon themselves to research, create and organize a treatment program for their child — no matter the personal or financial cost.That goal, that sense of possibility, is what for the past 18 months has driven Jennifer Allred, a construction lawyer turned stay-at-home mom, to fly from her family’s home in to Washington to take her 8-year-old son, Jack, to the Vision and Conceptual Development Center, a vision-therapy practice that operates out of a first-floor office suite downtown.Jack was given a diagnosis at age 2 of a mixed expressive and receptive language disorder. “He was difficult but not impossible to engage,” Allred recalled one Wednesday this winter while Jack did his exercises. “He met all his developmental milestones but not as robustly as you would have expected him to. You could get him laughing and playing but only if you were, like, Bozo-the-Clown-animated. He was scared of crowds, of noise.”Jack began occupational therapy and did a lot of floor-time therapy, a one-on-one intervention developed primarily for children with autism by Stanley Greenspan, a prominent child psychiatrist in Washington. Ultimately, Jack’s developmental psychologist judged that it was time to look at “the vision piece.” After a stint in therapy in Atlanta, mother and son began traveling to Washington.They met with Harry Wachs, the founder of the vision center, who is considered a pioneer for having tied optometric practice to Piagetian concepts of cognitive development. Wachs met for a half-hour with Jack, who at 6½ “wasn’t reading — not close to reading,” his mother says. She recalls that Wachs told her, “There’s no reason this kid shouldn’t go to Harvard.”Allred and Jack have flown to Washington for vision therapy every 8 to 12 weeks ever since. Jack has, at the same time, attended a mainstream private school with an adult facilitator to help him navigate the day. He recently graduated from occupational therapy and from floor-time therapy. But vision therapy remains in the mix, his mother says, even though it requires a plane ride and a hotel stay and a “ridiculous, insane cost” for the family.Such a believer is Allred, in fact, that on the day I observed Jack’s vision therapy, she’d brought along her younger son, Wyatt, a sandy-haired 5-year-old, for a consultation.“Wyatt’s teachers think I’m crazy,” she explained afterward. “He’s a normally developing kid. But I noticed with Wyatt, doing floor time with him, the richness of the language and the play were not there with him. I wanted to know how he was visualizing. I’m kind of probing. That’s my thing with my kids: they need to learn to be thinkers. Vision therapy is also for this.”Some doctors suspect that what really lies behind parent and optometrists’ reports of vision therapy’s success is something called the Hawthorne effect — the fact that many problems, and mental-health problems in particular, tend to get better when they receive intensive positive attention of pretty much any kind. Working with a warm and caring specialist, getting extra parental attention, concentrating on skills that can be improved (even if it’s just a matter of performing better on repetitive tests) is self-reinforcing. Under these conditions, you can certainly see great “vision” results in kids who, physicians say, didn’t have anything wrong with their eyes in the first place. And, notes Eileen Costello, a pediatrician in and co-author of the book “Quirky Kids: Understanding and Helping Your Child Who Doesn’t Fit In,” spending time and money on noble-minded alternative remedies like vision therapy may have a positive, ancillary effect on parents. “I think they’re maybe alleviating their own anxiety,” she says.Shelly Galli, the mother of Camille, is used to dismissive attitudes from doctors. There was a time when medical specialists told her to all but give up hope that Camille would ever be able to communicate. “When my daughter was diagnosed, they told me, if she doesn’t talk by 5 or 6, she probably won’t,” she recalls. Camille didn’t. But Galli refused to give up.Camille spent years in applied behavior analysis, the intensive one-on-one behavior training technique recommended by the National Institute of Mental Health as a therapy of proven value in helping autistic children. She did speech therapy, occupational therapy, — plus a host of scientifically unproven, even highly controversial treatments, like chelation (intravenous infusions aimed at removing mercury and other heavy metals from her body). She now eats a special organic and every afternoon drinks small cups of acidophilus and vinegar to counter internal yeast. She spends 35 hours a week in a one-girl schoolroom that her parents have created for her in an unused portion of a local religious school, working with a former preschool teacher with expertise in special education. She works with an art teacher and does speech therapy twice a week, works out at a gym with trainers every day and goes to vision therapy twice a week at the Vision and Conceptual Development Center, where she does jumping jacks on a trampoline and animal walks, throws and catches a beanbag and “fixates” on pictures.All this costs well over $100,000 a year. But now, at age 11, Camille is talking. “Talking more every day,” Galli says. And Camille is reading. “And I’m glad we didn’t listen to those people,” Galli adds. In addition to twice-weekly sessions at the vision center, Camille does follow-up exercises at home or in school. She also does additional computer exercises, which help her with “tracking” skills, according to her teacher, Colleen Bane, and also — according to the computer program’s Web site — help her develop eye-muscle strength and letter recognition and activate the visual processing center of her brain. On the day I came to see her in her classroom, she was doing a set of those exercises on her laptop computer. She kept looking away from the screen, where words flashed quickly, requiring her to track with her eyes and point with her finger. As the exercise changed to one that required her to quickly memorize a short stream of letters and type them on the keyboard, she closed her eyes entirely. She twisted around constantly, trying to get a good look at the wall clock, where the minute hand was ticking, ever so slowly, toward 3 o’clock and the release for home. This was new. In recent months, her teacher, Colleen Bane said proudly, Camille has made great progress in telling time.Though Camille has been taking part in many types of therapy, Galli attributes much of Camille’s progress in reading, and conducting herself in the world generally, to vision therapy. The same is true for Francesca Dennis, Brian’s mother, even though during the time her son was doing vision therapy he also switched schools, a change that, Dennis told me, vastly improved his life. And Jack, the boy from Atlanta with the language disorder, began for the first time to receive speech therapy while he was doing vision therapy. When I asked Allred whether Jack’s progress might just as well have been because of his speech therapy, she said: “To be honest with you, I don’t think you can tell. From my perspective, I don’t care. Are you going to deny your kid a therapy just to see if another therapy works? I’m mostly going on my gut.”Galli also said it was possible that Camille’s progress might be a result of her other, more proven therapies, but she added that it didn’t really matter: “We never know what it is that’s really helping. But we’re not going to take any chances. You just don’t want to lose time.”'"

"'10-03-15,'1','“We were lucky with the problems of Sebastian Vettel to pass,” Massa said. “I’m very happy. It’s also the best start of my season. I rode through the race normal, with very good pace. Thanks to God, I’m fine.”Ferrari gave up early on last season — its worst run of results since 1993 — to focus on 2010.“After the very difficult decision we had to take last year, this shows the decision was right,” Stefano Domenicali, the Ferrari team principal, said. “The only way to react is to come back with results.”Lewis Hamilton of McLaren Red Bull overtook Red Bull’s Vettel, edging him to finish third.“We had control of the race today and things we were on top of the strategy — everything was running smoothly,” Vettel said. “We should have won today. It cost us a lot.”Nico Rosberg was more than 40 seconds behind Alonso in fifth. Schumacher, his Mercedes teammate and a seven-time champion, placed sixth in his first race in three years.Alonso and Ferrari confirmed the preseason predictions that had them as title favorites. It was Alonso’s 22nd career victory over all and his 3rd at the Bahrain track, but his first since 2006, when he won his last title.“There is always pressure with every race, every test you go into,” Alonso said. “You live with stress on your shoulders.”PENSKE CAR WINS INDY OPENER Will Power, an Australian driving for the Penske team, made a late move to take the lead from Ryan Hunter-Reay and win the rain-shortened IndyCar season opener on the streets of São Paulo, Brazil.Power passed Hunter-Reay with three laps to go, clinching the inaugural São Paulo Indy 300 for his second career victory.Power crossed the line 1.858 seconds ahead of Hunter-Reay when the race ended at the two-hour time limit with only 61 of the 75 scheduled laps completed. Hunter-Reay, driving for Andretti Autosport, dominated much of the race.The race had to be red-flagged near its halfway point after heavy rain made track conditions unsafe.Vitor Meira of Brazil, the home-crowd favorite, was third, followed by his compatriot Raphael Matos on at the 2.6-mile, 11-turn Anhembi temporary circuit. Danica Patrick lost control of her car as it started raining and finished 15th.Power got out of his car and celebrated with the thousands of fans packing the grandstands of the stadiumlike Sambadrome, where the race took place.“I feel awesome,” he said. “We battled it out; it was a great day.”There were only about three minutes left when Power overtook Hunter-Reay, making the pass at the end of the long backstretch. Power’s Penske teammate Ryan Briscoe had gotten past Hunter-Reay for the lead late in the race but crashed with about 13 minutes left.It was the first time an IndyCar Series race was run on the same day as qualifying, which was postponed from Saturday because the front straightaway was too slick and drivers said it made racing unsafe. Officials added grooves to the track overnight and fixed the problem in time for qualifying.'"
"'10-03-15,'1','Skype looks to be Silicon Valley’s best hope for a blockbuster initial stock offering in 2010. With Facebook apparently determined to stay private until next year, Skype is in prime position to steal the scene with a quick flip. Moreover, as a result of clarifying copyright issues and rewriting its code to attack the business market, the company may be worth twice the $2.75 billion it was valued at when eBay sold all but 30 percent of its stake in Skype last year.Skype, the Web telecommunications provider, already has 500 million users and made $48 million in the third quarter, its last before going private. That’s good, but eBay wasn’t a natural owner. Its core auction and payments businesses had little to do with managing a communications company.And eBay’s poisoned relationship with the founders, Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, also hurt. Because those two threatened to withdraw Skype’s license to use the underlying source code, and shut the service, eBay was reluctant to extensively upgrade Skype’s software. Skype’s new owner, a private equity consortium led by Silver Lake, has patched things up, bringing back Mr. Zennstrom and Mr. Friis — and the company’s source code — with a slice of equity.The company can now improve voice and video quality on calls by revamping the software. Furthermore, many companies are reluctant to use Skype because it pierces firewalls that protect technology systems from outside intruders. Updated software should give Skype a chance to tap the larger and more profitable enterprise market.EBay sold the business for 3.5 times its estimated 2010 sales. That’s low for an Internet company whose brand is becoming entrenched, where revenue is growing a third annually and where operating margins are increasing. Eliminating the possibility that the business would be shut down and retooling its software for new markets make Skype more valuable.'"
"'10-03-15,'1','Ernst & Young itself paid an $8.5 million fine to the S.E.C. in December for its role in allowing another client, Bally Total Fitness, to avoid restating its earnings in 2002 when accounting rules changed.Charlie Perkins, an Ernst & Young spokesman, said in a statement that the firm’s last full audit of Lehman was for the 2007 fiscal year and that it stood by its results. “After an exhaustive investigation the examiner made no findings in his report that Lehman’s assets or liabilities were improperly valued or accounted for incorrectly in Lehman’s November 30, 2007 financial statements,” he said.“One thing Sarbanes-Oxley reminded us of is that technical compliance isn’t enough,” said Lawrence A. Cunningham, a law professor at George Washington University. “Accounting firms need to be sitting back the whole time and thinking, is this a fair presentation?”He added that any large judgment against the accounting firm, let alone tough regulatory action, could prove enormously damaging in terms of both money and future business.“If a breach of liability is established here, this could be disastrous in my view,” he said.According to the report, Ernst first learned of Lehman’s use of Repo 105 in 2001, shortly after it was designed. Partners of the accounting firm told Mr. Valukas that at the time, Ernst had not signed off on Repo 105 on anything more than a “theoretical” level, and gave approval only of Lehman’s internal policy regarding the practice.At no point did Ernst review the approval letters by the British law firm Linklaters, the only outside legal counsel Lehman could find that would sign off on the practice.By 2007, Mr. Valukas writes, Ernst was aware of $29 billion in Repo 105 transactions. While Ernst knew of the practice for years, the issue of Repo 105 was thrust to the fore in spring 2008. On June 12, two Ernst partners, William Schlich and Hillary Hansen, met with Matthew Lee, a Lehman executive who had written senior management a letter to complain of what he saw as accounting improprieties.The firm was “also dealing with a whistle-blower letter, that is on its face pretty ugly and will take us a significant amount of time to get through,” Mr. Schlich wrote in a June 5 e-mail message to colleagues, the examiner’s report said.At that meeting, Mr. Lee informed the two accountants that Lehman was using Repo 105 to move $50 billion of the firm’s assets off its balance sheet at the quarter’s end to make its debt levels look smaller. The firm reassumed those assets about a week later.But the next day, Ernst spoke to Lehman’s audit committee — but did not disclose Mr. Lee’s allegations on Repo 105.Mr. Perkins said Ernst never concluded its review of Mr. Lee’s claims because Lehman filed for bankruptcy before the firm could finish its audit.'"
"'10-03-15,'1','Mr. Graves became known for taking all his roles seriously, injecting a certain believability into even the campiest plot. He appeared in westerns like “The Yellow Tomahawk” (1954) and “Wichita” (1955); a Civil War adventure, “The Raid” (1954); and gangster movies (“Black Tuesday,” 1954, and “The Naked Street,” 1955). He played earnest scientists in science fiction/horror films: “Killers From Space” (1954), “It Conquered the World” (1956) and “Beginning of the End” (1957, about giant grasshoppers in Chicago). There was also cold war science fiction anti-Communism: “Red Planet Mars” (1952).Other movies included “East of Sumatra” (1953), “Beneath the 12-Mile Reef” (1953), “A Rage to Live” (1965), “Texas Across the River” (1966), “Sergeant Ryker” (1968), “The Ballad of Josie” (1968), “The Five-Man Army” (1969), “The Clonus Horror” (1979), “The Guns and the Fury” (1981), “Savannah Smiles” (1982), “Number One With a Bullet” (1986), “Addams Family Values” (1993), “The House on Haunted Hill” (1999) and “Men in Black II” (2002).In 1955 Mr. Graves began his career as a television series regular as the star of “Fury,” a western family adventure series about a rancher named Jim Newton, his orphaned ward and the boy’s black stallion. It ran until 1960 on NBC, helped pioneer television adventure series and solidified Mr. Graves’s TV credentials.Some of his hundreds of television credits include “Alfred Hitchcock Presents,” “Whiplash” (1961), “The Dean Martin Show” (1970), the Herman Wouk mini-series “The Winds of War” (1983) and “War and Remembrance” (1988), “Fantasy Island” (1978-83) and “7th Heaven” (1999-2005). He served as the host or narrator for numerous television specials and performed in television movies of the week like “The President’s Plane Is Missing” (1973), “Where Have All the People Gone” (1974) and “Death Car on the Freeway” (1979).Mr. Graves played his most famous television character from 1967 to 1973 in “Mission: Impossible,” reprising it from 1988 to 1990. He was Jim Phelps, the leader of the Impossible Missions Force, a super-secret government organization that conducted dangerous undercover assignments (which he always chose to accept). After the tape summarizing the objective self-destructed, the team would use not violence, but elaborate con games to trap the villains. In his role, Mr. Graves was a model of cool, deadpan efficiency.But he was appalled when his agent sent him the script for the role of a pedophile pilot in “Airplane!” (1980). “I tore my hair and ranted and raved and said, ‘This is insane,’ he recalled on “Biography” in 1997. Some of the role’s lines (“Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?”) looked at first as if they could get him thrown in jail, never mind ruining his career. He told his agent to tell David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams, the director-producers, to find themselves a comedian. He relented when the Zucker brothers explained that the secret of their spoof would be the deadpan behavior of the cast; they didn’t want a comedian, they wanted the Peter Graves of “Fury” and “Mission: Impossible.”Mr. Graves used his familiar earnest, all-American demeanor in service of some of the comic movie’s most outrageous moments. He reprised the role of Captain Oveur in “Airplane II” in 1982.Starting in the mid-1980s Mr. Graves was the host of a number of television science specials on “Discover.” In 1987, he became the host of the Arts and Entertainment Network’s long-running “Biography” series, narrating the lives of figures like Prince Andrew, Muhammad Ali, pioneers of the space program, Churchill, Ernie Kovacs, Edward G. Robinson, Sophia Loren, Jackie Robinson, Howard Hughes, Steven Spielberg and Jonathan Winters.In 1997, Mr. Graves was the subject of his own “Biography” presentation, “Peter Graves: Mission Accomplished.” In 2002, Mr. Graves was interviewed for a special about the documentary series, “Biography: 15 Years and Counting.”Mr. Graves won a Golden Globe Award in 1971 for his performance in “Mission: Impossible” and in 1997, he and “Biography” won an Emmy Award for outstanding informational series.In 1998, he joined his wife, Joan, in an effort to get Los Angeles to ban gasoline-powered leaf blowers from residential areas, testifying before the City Council, “’We’re all victims of these machines.”In addition to his brother, he is survived by his wife, Joan Graves, and three daughters, Amanda Lee Graves, Claudia King Graves and Kelly Jean Graves.'"
"'10-03-15,'1','You would be half right to be skeptical about his chosen field of research. Only half right because while we’re appropriately interested in understanding alcohol issues like driving while intoxicated, we don’t spend nearly as much energy making sense of the places where the intoxication takes place.And Professor Roberts, 34, who says he did not drink alcohol when he did the research in 2001, adds that, alas, this is another area where we’re falling behind the rest of the world.“It’s really an underresearched area, especially in the United States,” Dr. Roberts said. “I’m one of the few researchers who do this.” Most of the best research on subjects like barroom aggression, he added, is coming out of the United Kingdom, and in other places with vibrant night life, like Vancouver, Canada, and Queensland, Australia. “We’re kind of lagging behind what other countries are doing.”Still, the language of academia and the atmosphere of the tavern are not a perfect match. His findings about “bivariate correlations” and the rest probably make for better academic research than great bar talk at McSwiggan’s Pub.On the other hand, Professor Roberts has strong cred as a former Jersey Shore bartender, and as someone who teaches at a place where bar research can be taken seriously, as opposed to a snob-appeal campus. On this one, Scranton, yes. M.I.T., no.FOR the record, his two main findings were that in curbing aggression, any bouncer is better than no bouncer (almost every good-size bar in Hoboken has at least one), and the biggest contributor to serving drinks to already drunk patrons who shouldn’t be served are the so-called secondary servers, like shot girls and tub girls who prowl the floors. The first dispense shots, the second beer out of tubs, but this seems more of a Shore phenomenon than a Hoboken one, anyway.As for his laboratory, it’s hard to argue against Hoboken as promising turf. Indeed a brief tour of Hoboken bars and clubs from Lana Lounge, sort of the Xanadu of the crop, to the many Irish bars, sports bars, gay bars, Tiki bars and the rest, suggests an almost infinite number of potential topics:“The ‘Jersey Shore’ Shout-Out in the Barroom Milieu: A Study in Pop Culture Transference.”“From Barbary Coast to Yuppie Mecca: A Historical Survey of the Bar as Cultural Signifier.”“Sizeism in the Urban Labor Market: Bar Security as Full Employment Program for Oversized Males.”Dr. Roberts is now doing his bar research in Scranton rather than in Hoboken, and spent more than a year interviewing members of hard-rock, heavy-metal cover bands, researching the link between loud, aggressive music and bar violence. He is also interested in the efficacy of female bouncers.“I could go on and on about holes in bar research,” he wrote in an e-mail message. “There are endless possibilities for new research.”'"
"'10-03-15,'1','For the past five years, the family has been fighting in the Supreme Court a government directive to distribute the 10,000-acre Hacienda Luisita — the second-biggest family-owned piece of land in the Philippines, about 80 miles north of Manila — to 10,000 farmers.In 2004, the military and the police killed seven protesters during a strike by farmers fighting for land and higher wages. Since then, the family-controlled Hacienda Luisita Inc. has managed to plant only 40 percent of the estate with sugar cane; the rest has been seized by individual farmers or remains idle.Criticized for his family’s position, Mr. Aquino, 50, the front-runner in the presidential election, announced recently that the family would transfer the land to the farmers after ensuring that debts were paid off.“It will be theirs clear and free,” Mr. Aquino said in an interview in Manila.But Mr. Aquino’s cousin, Fernando Cojuangco, the chief operating officer of the holding company that owns the plantation, said that the extended Cojuangco family, owners of this plantation since 1958, had no intention of giving up the land or the sugar business.“No, we’re not going to,” Mr. Cojuangco, 47, said in an interview here. “I think it would be irresponsible because I feel that continuing what we have here is the way to go. Sugar farming has to be; it’s the kind of business that has to be done plantation-style.”He dismissed the widely held view that Mrs. Aquino, his aunt, had made land reform a centerpiece of her government.“Is there a document that it was a centerpiece? I always asked that question even to her ex-cabinet members. Was there a cabinet meeting where she said this is the centerpiece?”In 1987, when Mrs. Aquino, born a Cojuangco, began carrying out land redistribution, the government estimated that 10 percent of the population controlled 90 percent of the country’s agricultural land.The government says that under the program it has redistributed 10 million acres of privately owned land and 7.4 million acres of public land, allowing each farming family to acquire up to 7.4 acres with government-backed loans. The government says owners who relinquish land have received compensation; for sugar estates, the payment is $2,000 per acre.Last year, the government extended the program to redistribute 2.5 million acres of “problematic lands” that the authorities have been unable to distribute “because of the resistance of some big landowners,” said Nasser C. Pangandaman, the secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform.Mr. Pangandaman described the program as a success. But most farmers’ groups, scholars and businessmen question the department’s figures.“The department has never provided us with a clear and credible inventory of the lands that have been distributed,” said Rafael V. Mariano, a congressman who is a member of Anakpawis, a union-based political party.What is more, lawmakers, most of whom come from large landowning families, included loopholes in the program, critics say.“Because of the loopholes, landlords have been able to find all sorts of ways and means to recover their land,” said Roland G. Simbulan, a professor of development studies and public management at the University of the Philippines.The biggest loophole, critics say, was a stock and profit-sharing program that Mrs. Aquino agreed to under pressure from large landlords. Instead of redistributing their land, about a dozen families, including her own, were allowed to turn farmers into shareholders.The government eventually found that the Cojuangcos had violated the agreement by failing to share profits with the farmers and ordered that the land be distributed, said Mr. Pangandaman of the agrarian reform department.Mr. Cojuangco said the ruling was a politically motivated attack against his family. The family company treated the workers well, providing health care, homes for some, interest-free loans and a guaranteed minimum wage, he said.The farm workers at Hacienda Luisita voted in favor of the stock and profit-sharing program in 1989. But because of the decline of the sugar industry and mechanization, the amount of available work diminished steeply so that some farmers were working only one day a week by the late 1990s, said farmers and union officials.Since the 2004 strike, many have been unable to return to work at the hacienda even as they lacked the funds to buy the seedlings and fertilizer necessary to plant crops on land they are occupying.In a barrio called Paunawa, Esmeraldo Alcantara, 42, was one of several frustrated jobless men collecting brush to sell for about 30 cents a bundle.“If I had land and capital, that would be ideal,” said Mr. Alcantara, who controlled a two-acre plot that he had given up trying to plant. “But since I don’t, going back to work at the hacienda would be better. But I can’t do that, either.”A sign at the village entrance warns motorcyclists wearing helmets or bandanas to stay out — a reminder of the tumultuous strike, when union officials, farmers and supporters were assassinated, sometimes by hit men riding motorcycles. (The Philippine military, which accuses farm leaders of being tied to the Communist rebellion, is believed to be behind these kinds of killings.)Mr. Cojuangco said he was not afraid of venturing into the hacienda that his family has controlled for three generations.“I can go out there to the barrios,” he said.Lito Bais, the head of the farm workers’ union, said, “If that’s true, then why isn’t he doing that?”“I believe that as long as the Cojuangcos are here, they’ll never give up the land,” Mr. Bais said. “And as long as we’re here, we’ll never give up the struggle for this land.”'"
"'10-03-15,'1','WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats will press forward this week on legislation to overhaul the nation’s financial system in a critical test of whether Washington can pass reform.The bill that Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, will introduce on Monday appears written with the goal of forging a consensus that can overcome partisan division, with provisions that incorporate ideas from both Democrats and Republicans.Among the most recent provisions in the bill to emerge, according to people who have been briefed on the draft, is one that would curb Wall Street’s influence over the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Its president would be appointed by the president of the United States, not by a board that includes representatives of member banks.Another rule would ban bank officers from sitting on the New York Fed’s board, meaning that Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, would probably have to leave the board.The legislation would create a consumer protection agency within the Federal Reserve to write rules governing mortgages, credit cards and other financial products, said the people, who insisted on anonymity because the details were still in flux.In a concession to liberals, states’ attorneys general could sue violators of those rules, and the agency would have enforcement powers over large banks, mortgage originators and servicers, and other large lenders.But in a nod to Republicans, the bill would allow a council of regulators, led by the Treasury, to overturn proposed consumer rules by a two-thirds vote. And although the consumer protection agency would have a director appointed by the president, it would be housed within the Fed, an anathema for consumer advocates.The bill would also reshape the regulatory role of the Fed. It would be entrusted for the first time with oversight of all of the largest and most interconnected financial companies, even if they are not banks. And it would continue to oversee the largest bank holding companies, those with $50 billion or more in assets — about 35 companies, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.But even as the details were being hammered out Sunday evening, questions remained: can Democrats tap into the vein of populist anger over the excesses of Wall Street and shepherd the bill through, 18 months after the near-collapse of the banking system almost wrecked the economy? And can they avoid getting caught up in the partisan struggle that has held back health-care reform?For now, after months of stop-and-start bipartisan talks, the Democrats are going it alone on one of the Obama administration’s top priorities.“This is certainly the farthest thing from ‘take it or leave it,’ ” said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat. “This has been going on for months.”He said of Republicans: “I’ve just got to ask the question of whether they want to have agreement, and whether they want to have the legislation go forward. I think we do. I know the American public does.”Republicans have been pushing back, but without trying to seem like allies of big banks or opponents of reform. After Mr. Dodd announced on Tuesday that he planned for a committee vote before Congress recesses on March 26, Republicans lashed out over the timetable.In a letter last Friday to Mr. Dodd, the 10 Republicans on the Banking Committee said they remained “open to finding common ground” but added that “a markup scheduled in haste would certainly prevent” a bipartisan consensus.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who had spearheaded Republican talks on the bill, said last week: “If the senators can pass a bill of this substance out of committee in a week — a 1,200-page bill full of substance, that has a real effect on the financial industry — then the states who elect them might as well send robots to the Senate.”Republicans have also said that the poisonous atmosphere over health care had spread. “Never did I realize that health care would affect financial regulation,” Mr. Corker said.Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who is ideologically an opposite to Mr. Corker in many respects, agreed that the debate had gotten bogged down.“Health care has delayed it,” he said. “I’m not happy. I think we should have gotten this done earlier, and it’s why Dodd is right to keep taking this forward. We can’t sit around. It has been too long.”The bill would also empower the government to seize a company that poses a systemic risk to the financial system; create a Treasury-led council to watch for such risk; create safeguards against excessive risk-taking of the kind that caused the housing crisis; establish an agency to crack down on abusive lending; and revamp the supervision of banks, the governance of corporations and the trading of derivatives.Perhaps the most hotly debated feature in the legislation has been the new consumer protection agency, and its placement within the Fed is certain to disappoint those angry at the Fed for long failing to protect consumers. “If indeed it’s going to be an independent operation and it’s simply ‘renting space’ from the Fed, the question is, ‘Why the Fed?’ ” said Senator Merkley, who has been an advocate, along with Mr. Reed, on consumer issues.The bill would revamp governance of public companies, empowering shareholders to have advisory votes on executive pay and to nominate directors through company-issued proxy ballots. Corporations have lobbied vigorously against those provisions, fearing that shareholder activism could spill over from annual meetings into boardrooms.Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who has advocated more rights for shareholders, said that the provisions were modest and that corporations opposing them risked being viewed as obstructionist.“Many of them think that if they push back hard enough, there will be no reform in this area,” he said.J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, called the proposal “a mixed bag” for the Fed. He applauded the new role for the Fed in overseeing the largest and most complex financial institutions, saying, “That mandate has not been clear in the past.”But he said it would be a mistake to strip Fed oversight of smaller banks that would be under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.“Those banks are an important link between the Fed and Main Street,” he said.The bill would also reform the sprawling market for over-the-counter derivatives, making derivatives transactions more transparent. But many companies that use derivatives to hedge, or manage, commercial risk would be exempt, a source of consternation for reformers.The bill would allow regulators, after a study, to implement elements of a proposal President Obama put forward in January. Named for Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, it would prohibit deposit-taking banks from investing in or owning hedge funds or private equity funds, and from making trades unrelated to their clients’ interest, a practice known as proprietary trading.'"
"'10-03-15,'1','The researchers checked the results of ESPN’s Tournament Challenge competition for 2004 and 2005. With about three million entries, it amounts to the largest office pool in the world. The number of predicted upsets almost perfectly matched the actual historical pattern — as the seedings became closer, the contestants predicted more upsets.But they did not predict upsets correctly. In 2004, they picked 75.2 percent of the winners, and in 2005 they were right 72.9 percent of the time. But if they had simply predicted the lower seed to win every game, they would have scored 87.5 percent in 2004 and 75 percent in 2005.It is possible that the entrants did badly because they were ignorant of college basketball and did not understand how to evaluate the strengths of the teams. Or it could be that their rooting interest in particular teams allowed sentiment to overcome judgment.To eliminate such effects, the researchers recruited 19 fans, establishing their expertise with a college basketball trivia test. Just after the 2000 bracket was announced, they asked the fans to rate on a 7-point scale how much they liked each team and how strong they thought each team was. Then they were asked to predict the outcome of the 32 first-round games. The winner was promised a $20 prize.The researchers found that whether fans liked a team or believed its seeding was inaccurate did not enter into their choices. The fans just “knew” when an upset was coming. But they were right only 86.8 percent of the time over all, when just picking the better seed to win would have yielded 90.6 percent correct picks. Two similar experiments using slightly different conditions had similar results.Why is basketball expertise so useless? The outcome of a particular game is based largely on nonrandom effects — that is, the team with players who are more skilled, better prepared and more effectively coached is more likely to win. But the seeding process has accounted for these effects, so only random events remain — an injury, a foul at the wrong moment, a last-second desperation shot that luckily drops in. Such things no one can predict.It is very hard to make people understand probability. The researchers described an experiment that illustrates the problem.A subject is told that Event A randomly occurs 25 percent of the time and Event B the other 75 percent. He is then is asked to predict whether A or B will occur in a series of trials. Guessing B every time assures a 75 percent success rate over the long haul. But people do not do this. Instead, they try to solve the problem by guessing A sometimes and B a little more often.“People approach it by trying to get 100 percent right, completely misunderstanding the probability,” said Sean M.

"'10-03-15,'1','A bright, utilitarian voice that sweeps across continents as it conjures the aspirations of the inner princesses in millions of nice young women from Manila to London: no, it’s not Celine Dion, but Lea Salonga, the demure 39-year-old Philippine star whose autobiographical show, “The Journey So Far,” opened a three-week engagement at Café Carlyle on Tuesday evening.Ms. Salonga is the vocal personification of what might be called the Broadway and Hollywood international style, which embraces Disney songs, Rodgers and Hammerstein ballads and the anthems of Schönberg and Boublil. Hers is a talent groomed to express inspirational generalities that please most of the people most of the time without taxing their emotions. Beyond an eagerness to please, impersonality is its signature quality.The show-business history Ms. Salonga related in the agreeable tone of a friendly saleswoman helps explain the formation of such a sensibility. A child star in the Philippines, she made her professional debut at 7 in “The King and I” and starred in the title role of “Annie.” That track led her to the role of Kim, which she originated in “Miss Saigon” in London in 1989. Back then she was so innocent, she recalled, that the director, Nicholas Hytner, had to demonstrate the onstage love scenes step by step. She later played both Éponine and Fantine in “Les Misérables.” Her voice has been heard in “Aladdin” and in two “Mulan” movies.Backed by a functional quartet under the direction of Larry Yurman, Ms. Salonga touched many of these bases on Tuesday, with some forays into Philippine music. Like most singers who rely on various degrees of declamation, Ms. Salonga was most appealing when she relaxed and sang a sweet, low-key rendition of “Someone to Watch Over Me,” accompanied by a single guitar. Especially in an intimate space like Café Carlyle, the cliché applies: Less is more.'"
"'10-03-15,'1','Google, however, is unlikely to stop censoring its results, people with knowledge of the situation said. Instead, they said, it is more likely that the company will shut down the Chinese search engine and try to reach Chinese customers through its search engine based in the United States.If it does close its Chinese search engine, Google has other operations in China that it hopes to save, including a toehold in the country’s mobile phone business.Eric Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, said last week that “something will happen soon” to resolve Google’s fate in China. Reporters have been camped at Google’s Beijing headquarters since then in anticipation of an announcement that the company will close down some or all of its China operations.Since Google opened the China-based service about four years ago, it has filtered responses to users’ searches to remove results that the government finds objectionable, including pornography and content on political topics like Chinese human rights issues. Despite the self-censorship, the company has drawn a strong following, especially among educated and wealthier Chinese Internet users.Google has a widespread network of Chinese partners that have set up their Web sites to link to Google’s Chinese-language search engine. The government’s warning was a reminder to operators that they are responsible for any content on their sites, even if it is provided by a third party like Google. Those companies could switch to services that are more accommodating to the government, like Baidu, the search engine that holds the dominant share inside China.Should they remain loyal to Google, the companies could satisfy government censors by filtering their customers’ searches themselves, excluding objectionable topics before relaying them to Google. But that option could prove difficult, especially for smaller companies, which would have to buy or develop software to do that job. It would be easier for most simply to switch to another search engine.If Google refuses to censor its searches, industry specialists said, the government will most likely disrupt its service temporarily, frustrating users and driving them away from the Google search engine and possibly from its partners’ Web sites.Users of Google’s worldwide search engine, google.com, would be likely to find their situation unchanged, industry specialists said. The site is accessible in China, but Chinese Internet users can gain access only to Web pages that have been approved by Chinese censors, rather than Google’s own employees.Asked Sunday about the Chinese government’s warning to Google partners, a Google spokeswoman, Courtney Hohne, declined to comment. A company statement said last week that Google had “been very clear that we are no longer going to self-censor our search results.”“We are in active discussions with the Chinese government but we are not going to engage in a running commentary about those conversations,” the statement said.China’s position has seemed equally unyielding. On Friday, Li Yizhong, China’s minister of industry and information technology, warned Google, “If you want to do something that disobeys Chinese law and regulations, you are unfriendly, you are irresponsible and you will have to bear the consequences.”'"

"'10-03-16,'1','On the one hand, he said in an interview with The Montgomery Advertiser in 2005, he refused to get on his knees and beg as racists had demanded. On the other, he said, he did everything possible to avoid confrontation, explaining that if he were arrested he couldn’t photograph.“I’d let people trip me, jostle me, pull my hair and threaten to smash my camera,” he told The New Orleans Times-Picayune in 1997.Hank Klibanoff, who with Gene Roberts wrote “The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle, and the Awakening of a Nation” (2006), said in an interview Monday that Mr. Moore, almost always using a short lens, would immerse himself in the middle of the action. He often appeared in the pictures of other photographers who were standing back.One of Mr. Moore’s images shook the author Paul Hendrickson to the core. The picture showed six Mississippi sheriffs and a deputy, some chortling, waiting to confront Mr. Meredith at Ole Miss. One appears to be showing the others how to swing a riot club.Mr. Hendrickson wrote about the seven lawmen in “Sons of Mississippi: A Story of Race and Its Legacy” (2003). The photo is included in Mr. Moore’s 2002 book, “Powerful Days: The Civil Rights Photography of Charles Moore.”“It was a two-second grab shot,” Mr. Hendrickson said on Monday. “The greatest photographers see the image before they click it.”Charles Lee Moore was born in Hackleburg, Ala., on March 9, 1931, and took his first pictures with a Kodak Brownie. He served three years in the Marines as a photographer and then attended the Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara, Calif. He next applied for a job as a photographer with the morning and afternoon newspapers in Montgomery: The Montgomery Advertiser and The Montgomery Journal.His training in fashion photography at Brooks helped him get the job, Mr. Klibanoff said. When Mr. Moore arrived at the newspapers’ office, Mr. Klibanoff said, he was sent to a country club where the photography editor was taking pictures of bathing beauties. The editor, who hated the job, was having trouble positioning everyone.Mr. Moore took over, all went smoothly, and he was hired.At the newspapers Mr. Moore quickly proved his versatility. An article in Editor & Publisher in 1961 praised him for “turning pictures of everyday people into dramatic, emotional experiences for readers.”In 1962, Mr. Moore left the newspapers to start a freelance career. He worked for the Black Star picture agency, which sold much of his work to Life.Mr. Moore is survived by his brother, Jim; his sons, Michael and Gary; his daughters, April Marshall and Michelle Moore Peel; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.Mr. Moore went on to cover the Vietnam War and many other trouble spots. He then decided he wanted to “shoot beauty” and moved on to nature, fashion and travel photography, in addition to corporate work. But he always said his civil rights work was his most important, and in 1989 he received the inaugural Kodak Crystal Eagle Award for Impact in Photojournalism.His civil rights success resulted in part from cunning and resourcefulness. After being arrested in Birmingham in 1963, he was desperate to get out of town with his film the next day, he said in a biography prepared by Black Star. But a police car blocked the entrance to the airport.He and his colleagues sneaked along the side of the terminal building and boarded the airplane just as the stairs were about to be pulled away.“We flew away as fugitives from justice,” Mr. Moore said.'"
"'10-03-16,'1','In a little more than a year in office, Education Secretary Arne Duncan has used his bully pulpit and a burgeoning discretionary budget to focus state governments on school reform as never before. Mr. Duncan has now promised to energize the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights, which has done a poor job in recent years of enforcing federal laws that protect poor, minority and disabled students from discrimination.If the secretary follows through, states and localities that have historically shortchanged these children — by saddling them, say, with watered-down curriculums and unqualified teachers — will be required to do better or risk losing federal education dollars.Mr. Duncan announced his goals during a speech commemorating the 45th anniversary of the “Bloody Sunday” civil rights march in Selma, Ala., during which demonstrators were bludgeoned by police on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Mr. Duncan compared the voting rights struggle to the effort to secure educational opportunity for poor, minority and disadvantaged children.Mr. Duncan said that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would be pleased by the racial progress that the country has made but “would have been angered to see that disadvantaged students still have less-effective teachers; that they still have fewer opportunities to take rigorous college-prep courses in high school; that black, and brown, and low-income children are still languishing in aging facilities and high schools that are little more than dropout factories. He would have been downhearted that students with disabilities still do not get the educational support they need. And he would have been dismayed to learn of schools that seem to suspend and discipline only young African-American boys.”Mr. Duncan made clear that his department wants to ensure that all students have equal access to educational opportunity as defined by things like a college-prep curriculum, advanced courses and science classes. He seems keenly interested in ending the odious, widespread practice under which poorly qualified teachers are shunted into schools serving the neediest children.The department said that it would soon notify thousands of school districts and colleges of their responsibilities under federal equal opportunity laws. Beyond that, the department’s civil rights chief, Russlynn Ali, plans this year to open investigations, known as compliance reviews, in 38 school districts across the country.Districts that are found to be out of compliance with federal law must formally agree to correct illegal practices. If they refuse, they could be sued or stripped of federal financing.'"
"'10-03-16,'1','One crucial move was to shift assets off its books at the end of each quarter in exchange for cash through a clever accounting maneuver, called Repo 105, to make its leverage levels look lower than they were. Then they would bring the assets back onto its balance sheet days after issuing its earnings report.And where was the government while all this “materially misleading” accounting was going on? In the vernacular of teenage instant messaging, let’s just say they had a vantage point as good as POS (parent over shoulder).The new mystery is why it took this long for anyone to raise a red flag. “Even though Lehman dressed up its accounts for the great unwashed public, it did not try to fool the authorities,” Yves Smith, the author of “ECONned: How Unenlightened Self Interest Undermined Democracy and Corrupted Capitalism,” wrote on her blog last week. “Its game-playing was in full view.”Indeed, it now appears that the federal government itself either didn’t appreciate the significance of what it saw (we’ve seen that movie before with regulators waving off tips about Bernard L. Madoff). Or perhaps they did appreciate the significance and blessed the now-suspect accounting anyway.Oddly, when the bankruptcy examiner asked Matthew Eichner of the S.E.C., who was involved with supervising firms like Lehman, whether the agency focused on leverage levels, he answered that “knowledge of the volumes of Repo 105 transactions would not have signaled to them ‘that something was terribly wrong,’ ” according to the examiner’s report.There’s a lot riding on the government’s oversight of these accounting shenanigans. If Lehman Brothers executives are sued civilly or prosecuted criminally, they may actually have a powerful defense: a raft of government officials from the S.E.C. and Fed vetted virtually everything they did.On top of that, Lehman’s outside auditor, Ernst & Young, and a law firm, Linklaters, signed off on the transactions.The problems at Lehman raise even larger questions about the vigilance of the S.E.C. and Fed in overseeing the other Wall Street banks as well.“I’m concerned that the revelations about Lehman Brothers are just the tip of the iceberg,” Senator Ted Kaufman wrote in a speech he was preparing to give Tuesday on the Senate floor. “We have no reason to believe that the conduct detailed last week is somehow isolated or unique. Indeed, this sort of behavior is hardly novel.”Here’s how Repo 105 worked in simple terms: At the end of each quarter, to reduce its all-important leverage levels, Lehman would “sell” assets (typically highly liquid government securities) to another firm in exchange for cash, which it would use to pay down its debt. The assets were typically worth 105 percent of the cash Lehman received. Several days later, after reporting its earnings, it would buy the assets back. Normally, this would be considered a loan, or repurchase agreement, but instead it was booked as a sale.Huge piles of cash were moving in and out. According to the examiner’s report, “Lehman reduced its net balance sheet at quarter-end through its Repo 105 practice by approximately $38.6 billion in fourth quarter 2007, $49.1 billion in first quarter 2008, and $50.38 billion in second quarter 2008.”Perhaps tellingly, there is no evidence that Lehman kept two sets of books or somehow tried to hide what it was doing from regulators. The bankruptcy examiner spent over a year searching through virtually every e-mail message at the firm and didn’t say he found any evidence of a cover-up.That may explain why so few at the firm seemed to think that what they were doing was wrong, based on the e-mail traffic reviewed by the examiner. They talked openly about Repo 105. And while some apparently felt queasy about it, they also repeatedly said that it was legal (there are no e-mail messages from Richard Fuld Jr. or any senior executive directing another executive to use Repo 105 to mask earnings).Lehman’s shell game didn’t come to light until June 2008, when a lower-level executive named Matthew Lee sent a letter to management raising a host of questions about the firm’s practices. (By the way, the S.E.C. and Fed were still working inside the building at this point.)What the examiner didn’t report, however, was that Mr. Lee started raising questions about Repo 105 only when it became clear that he was being replaced in his role, according to people briefed on the matter. Indeed, Mr. Lee’s original letter to management did not mention the use of Repo 105.Whatever the case, in an age calling for more accountability on Wall Street, it seems we could use some in Washington too.'"
"'10-03-16,'1','Mr. Giblin has accused Mr. McLaughlin of failing to justify all his meal expenses and taking too large a payout for accrued vacation when he retired.“He’s a schoolyard bully,” Mr. McLaughlin said of Mr. Giblin, president of the 280,000-member International Union of Operating Engineers. “We exposed Lundy, and I think Giblin thought I slapped him in the face doing it.”Mr. Giblin declined to be interviewed. His spokesman, Joseph Brady, cited Mr. McLaughlin’s resignation letter to say he had retired voluntarily and was not forced out. Mr. Brady said the parent union had brought formal charges against Mr. McLaughlin and his two aides after an audit found “varying degrees of irregularities in the finances and operation of the local.”Mr. Lundy’s lawyer, Kevin Thelen, said his client “maintains that he had no wrongdoing in this event,” although Mr. Lundy paid an agreed-upon part of the $2,350.Mr. McLaughlin and officials from the local said investigators from the racketeering office at the Labor Department had interviewed them about wrongdoing in the union, which represents crane, bulldozer and boiler operators.An outside watchdog group has voiced concern about Mr. Giblin’s effort to expel the three men. “These guys raised some issues about someone who is O.K. with Giblin, and now he’s out to crucify them,” said Herman Benson, founder of the Association for Union Democracy, an anticorruption group.The dispute began in July 2007, shortly after Mr. Giblin promoted Mr. Lundy from apprenticeship coordinator to Western regional director for the national union. That was when Mr. McLaughlin reviewed Mr. Lundy’s spending records and concluded that he had charged many expenses improperly. Soon after, Dan Himmelberg, the apprentice program’s chairman, sent Mr. Lundy a certified letter, demanding he repay $2,350. Mr. Giblin was quick to respond.“One Sunday morning in August, I got a phone call from Giblin,” Mr. McLaughlin said. “He’s screaming at me, he’s going off. ‘What are you doing? You make this investigation into Dennis Lundy go away right now.’ It was never the same after that. It seemed no matter what I did, it was wrong.”As for Mr. Himmelberg, Mr. McLaughlin recalled Mr. Giblin saying, “You tell him for me that nobody sends a certified letter to one of my employees, and that I will punch his ticket for him.”When Mr. Himmelberg learned of Mr. Giblin’s threats, he started worrying about getting fired.Mr. Himmelberg said: “Why did I deserve this? I was just doing my job.” When Mr. McLaughlin told Mr. Himmelberg and his other top aide, Finn Pette, the local’s financial secretary, to accompany him to Chicago for the parent union’s executive board meeting in 2008 to help him develop negotiating strategy, Mr. McLaughlin was surprised by Mr. Giblin’s reaction. According to Mr. McLaughlin, Mr. Giblin ordered him not to bring the aides anywhere near the meeting.That trip is central to the charges brought against the three men. The charges accuse Mr. Himmelberg and Mr. Pette of going to Chicago on personal business and misusing about $1,000 each in union money.Mr. Himmelberg and Mr. Pette reject the charges, saying they went to Chicago at the request of their boss, Mr. McLaughlin, not on personal business.Mr. Pette is also charged with misappropriating $300 in union money for flying first class to study at the Harvard Trade Union Program. Mr. Pette said he could not have misappropriated that money because Local 501’s board had approved and bought the first-class ticket to assure him a direct flight to Boston.Mr. Pette said Mr. Giblin wanted to expel him because he is a well-liked political opponent with ambitions for higher union office.The main accusation against Mr. McLaughlin is that he retired with a $106,000 payout for 38 weeks of accrued vacation. He cashed those weeks out at his final pay rate, but the charges say he should have cashed them out at his lower pay rate of the earlier years when he accrued those vacation weeks. Mr. McLaughlin says the parent union’s proposed way of calculating the payout violates California law.Local 501 is boiling with conflict over the charges against Mr. McLaughlin. Mr. Giblin’s allies criticize Mr. McLaughlin’s years of heading the local, pointing out that one woman had filed a sex-discrimination lawsuit against the local and that an aide in the local’s Las Vegas office had embezzled more than $200,000.Mr. McLaughlin called the sex-discrimination claim unfounded and said he had helped uncover the embezzlement. Mr. Himmelberg and Mr. Pette are scheduled for trial in April before several of the parent union’s board members. Mr. McLaughlin’s trial will be later this year.'"
"'10-03-16,'1','In another scheme, prosecutors said, Mr. Antonucci approved millions of dollars in bank overdrafts to firms controlled by an associate, who then gave him use of a private plane for trips to destinations like the Super Bowl and the Masters golf tournament.They also charged that he defrauded officials of a Florida church of more than $100,000.Mr. Antonucci, 59, of Fishkill, N.Y., was released on a $2 million personal recognizance bond by a federal magistrate judge. His lawyer, Charles A. Stillman, said after the hearing that he expected his client to plead not guilty.The fraud charges were the first to emerge from federal inquiries into the suspected misuse of bailout funds. The office of the TARP’s special inspector general said in its most recent report that officials were conducting 77 criminal and civil investigations into companies that accepted bailout money, including inquiries into insider trading and accounting and securities fraud. Other federal and state investigators are also regularly involved.Neil Barofsky, the bailout program’s special inspector general, said the charges against Mr. Antonucci represented “an important chapter in the history of the TARP bailout.” He said it was the first time an individual was “being criminally charged for attempting to steal money from the taxpayer through the TARP.”On Friday evening, New York State banking regulators shuttered the Park Avenue Bank because of ineffective management and inadequate capital, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation immediately seized and sold it. Valley National Bank, a New Jersey lender, took control of the operations.“No customer of the bank will lose a dime and I expect that this transition will be seamless,” said Richard H. Neiman, New York State’s superintendent of banks.The bank, which had its headquarters at 460 Park Avenue, had several retail branches in Manhattan and Brooklyn, the authorities said.As the crisis worsened in fall 2008, Treasury Department officials rolled out the TARP program to aid healthy lenders. Banks needed a satisfactory regulatory rating, and ample capital, to qualify.Although regulators questioned Park Avenue’s deteriorating condition, Mr. Antonucci pointed to the $6.5 million investment in fall 2008 as evidence the bank was viable, the authorities said.“The bank was broken,” Mr. Bharara said, adding that Mr. Antonucci “methodically went about pretending to fix it.”Federal officials began reviewing Park Avenue’s application in November 2008. By late February 2009, the officials determined that the bank was not strong enough to receive bailout money. In response, Park Avenue withdrew its application.In the scheme involving the church, prosecutors charged that Mr. Antonucci defrauded officials of the Calvary Springs Chapel in Coral Springs, Fla. Church officials wanted to construct a new building for the congregation and were told that if they invested $103,940 with an associate of Mr. Antonucci’s, they would be paid back $604,848 within two or three weeks, prosecutors said.“The church members still have not seen a penny of the promised gains or of their original moneys,” said James T. Hayes Jr., special agent in charge of the New York office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.On Monday, at a branch at 45th Street and 13th Avenue in Borough Park, two blue-and-yellow Valley National banners covered the bank’s old name on a red awning. Some customers expressed surprise at the developments.“It was a great shocker,” Barry Reichman, 59, said. “We thought, a bank is a bank. We don’t expect one to change.”He said he had been unaware of the criminal charges but said he had no plans to close his account. “We like the friendliness of this bank,” he said.Moses Menczer, 24, a student, came out pushing a baby carriage. “They didn’t explain to me anything,” he said. “As long as they give me my money, it’s not my business. They can call it whatever they want.”'"

"'10-03-16,'1','PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) — PepsiCo said Monday that it would buy back up to $15 billion worth of its own common stock through June 2013.Pepsi, whose brands include Gatorade, Quaker and Pepsi-Cola, said previously that it was buying about $4.4 billion worth of its shares this year. Some of the buybacks will be made under a 2007 repurchase authorization, which had $6.4 billion remaining at the start of the year and expires in June.The company also said Monday that it would increase its annual dividend by 7 percent, to $1.92, most likely starting on June 30 when it expects to pay its next quarterly dividend.The dividend will be paid to shareholders of record June 4, the company said.Last month PepsiCo, based in Purchase, cleared the final regulatory hurdle in a bid to buy its two biggest bottlers — the Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas — allowing it to close the $7.8 billion deal.Shares of PepsiCo rose $1.05, or 1.61 percent, to $66.15 on Monday.'"
"'10-03-16,'1','Ads for menstrual products remain conspicuously euphemistic, typically featuring women practicing yoga in white spandex, riding white horses along the beach, or airborne in cheerleader outfits.“Fem-care advertising is so sterilized and so removed from what a period is,” said Elissa Stein, co-author (with Susan Kim) of the book “Flow: The Cultural Story of Menstruation.” “You never see a bathroom, you never see a woman using a product. They never show someone having cramps or her face breaking out or tearful — it’s always happy, playful, sporty women.”The U by Kotex campaign aims to both parody such conventions, and to make an impression with marketing that is more frank. But that approach turns out to be a bit too frank for some networks.Merrie Harris, global business director at JWT, said that after being informed that it could not use the word vagina in advertising by three broadcast networks, it shot the ad cited above with the actress instead saying “down there,” which was rejected by two of the three networks. (Both Ms. Harris and representatives from the brand declined to specify the networks.)“It’s very funny because the whole spot is about censorship,” Ms. Harris said. “The whole category has been very euphemistic, or paternalistic even, and we’re saying, enough with the euphemisms, and get over it. Tampon is not a dirty word, and neither is vagina.”The new line primarily caters to women from 14 to 21.Another spot, which will make its debut next month, opens with a woman strolling confidently toward the camera. “I’m a believably attractive 18- to 24-year-old female,” she says. “You can relate to me because I’m racially ambiguous. Market research shows that girls like you love girls like me.”The sense of an ad somehow deconstructing itself continues, as she says, “Now I’m going to tell you to buy something. Buy the same tampons I use. Because I’m wearing white pants, and I have good hair, and you wish you could be me.” Screen text near the end of the spot asks, “Why are tampon ads so obnoxious?”A print ad, meanwhile, shows a woman driving a convertible with this text: “I tied a tampon to my key ring so my brother wouldn’t take my car. It worked.”Packaging for the new products are primarily black, with individually wrapped items within in four bright colors.“This has been an institutional type of product, with products that are white and light blue and boring, and what we have is a variety of bold lipstick colors in each pack,” said Mr. Meurer, of Kotex. “What we like to say is ‘We’re taking the category from institutional care to personal care.’ ”Visitors to the Web site, UbyKotex.com, designed by the New York office of Organic, part of the Omnicom Group, are urged to sign a “Declaration of Real Talk,” vowing to defy societal pressures that discourage women from speaking out about their bodies and health.For every signer, Kotex will donate $1 to Girls for a Change, a national nonprofit based in San Jose, Calif., that pairs urban middle school and high school girls with professional women to encourage social change.While the brand may have to finesse some of its newfound candor to pass muster with networks, it is unencumbered online. In what by all accounts is unprecedented in menstrual product marketing, the videos on the Web site show women demonstrating how to use the products, including video of an actress in a bathroom applying a panty liner, and another of one inserting a tampon in an anatomically correct puppet.Of both demonstrations, Ms. Kim, the “Flow” co-author, said, “Given what’s gone before, it’s a big step forward.” And she praised the writing and the young actresses for “giving the nod to the fact this might be funny but not modeling shame.”“We’re really out there and we’re trying to touch women and say we care about this conversation,” said Mr. Meurer, of Kotex. “We’re changing our brand equity to stand for truth and transparency and progressive vaginal care.”'"
"'10-03-16,'1','Open defecation — which the World Health Organization describes as “the riskiest sanitation practice of all” — is on the decline in many countries, according to a report released Monday by the W.H.O. and Unicef.Nonetheless, about 1.1 billion still practice it, the report said. While the percentage of the world population doing so decreased to 17 percent in 2008 from 25 percent in 1990, constant population growth and movement into crowded urban slums mean that the absolute number has grown by 36 million people.While Africa has the fewest toilets, it is also very rural, so the problem is at its worst in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Afghanistan, where the rate is estimated at 44 percent. In many slums, where shanties are pressed together for miles on end, with no water pipes between them and drinking water sold from passing carts, millions are forced to squat along railroad tracks, or to use bits of vacant land. (Covered pits and outhouses are not considered “open defecation,” while buckets and long drops over running water are.)The issue has drawn more attention with the designation of annual World Toilet Days, the opening of World Toilet College in Singapore in 2005, and the rise of organizations like the Sulabh International Social Service Organization, which builds public pay toilets that work with little water.'"
"'10-03-16,'1','Fertilizing the oceans with iron has been proposed as a way of fighting climate change. The idea is that iron will promote blooms of phytoplankton that will remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. When the phytoplankton dies and sinks, the carbon will effectively be sequestered in the deep ocean.Enthusiasm for the idea has waned, in part because of concerns about large-scale manipulation of ocean ecosystems. Now, a study in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences points out a specific risk: by promoting the growth of certain organisms, iron enrichment may result in the harmful production of a neurotoxin.Charles G. Trick of the University of Western Ontario and colleagues studied several species of diatoms of the genus Pseudonitzschia. These organisms produce domoic acid, which they use to help grow but that is toxic to many organisms, including marine mammals and humans.Large blooms of Pseudonitzschia in coastal waters have led to poisonings of sea lions that eat tainted shellfish. But studies had suggested that in midocean, the diatoms did not produce the toxin.Dr. Trick said his team’s work suggested that the earlier studies were flawed. Pseudonitzschia collected in midocean and subjected to shipboard experiments produced plenty of domoic acid. “We found there is a lot of toxin out there,” he said. “If we were to seed with iron, the amount of toxin would go up.”The researchers found evidence that increased domoic acid production enabled Pseudonitzschia to outcompete other phytoplankton. “So it’s more toxic than it was before,” Dr. Trick said, “and there’s more of it.”'"
"'10-03-16,'1','New research provides evidence that proposed taxes on soft drinks may make young people healthier.The study, which collected food intake data from 12,123 young adults for 20 years, found that with every 10 percent increase in the price of a two-liter bottle, people consumed 7 percent fewer calories from soda. They also took in fewer calories over all.When people faced an even larger increase — $1 for a two-liter bottle of soda, comparable to a proposed tax in Philadelphia — they consumed 124 fewer calories a day, the study found. The lower soda intake was associated with a drop in weight of more than two pounds — and a lower risk for pre-diabetes. The studyappears in the March 8 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine.Maureen L. Storey, senior vice president for science policy at the American Beverage Association, said taxing soda would be discriminatory as well as ineffective. “Taxes do not make people healthier,” she said. “Making smart education decisions about diet and exercise do.”But the study’s lead author, Barry M. Popkin, an obesity specialist at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina, said the study would help answer an important question.“You always know that if you reduce the cost or increase the cost of something, consumption of that item will change,” Dr. Popkin said. “What we don’t know is whether you will buy something equally bad or worse. In this case, we found that people would get healthier.”'"
"'10-03-16,'1','It is a seamy side to March Madness, a wildly popular carnival noted for feel-good underdog stories and buzzer-beating thrillers that ultimately produce a national champion.But teams that underperform in the classroom are attracting increasing attention. The N.C.A.A. began tracking and publicizing the Academic Progress Rate (A.P.R.) for individual sports programs, by college, in 2004; those that fall below certain standards can be hit with penalties like losing scholarships. In January, Education Secretary urged the N.C.A.A. to redouble its efforts.The N.C.A.A. notes that graduation rates for basketball players have slowly risen in recent years and are slightly higher than those for the general student population.But universities like Xavier are leaning more heavily than ever on academic advisers. Xavier’s basketball team has the tournament’s 11th-highest A.P.R., which measures academic eligibility, retention and graduation rates. And people there know whom to thank.“Our alumni over the years have told me that they’re so proud of the graduation rates,” Fleming said over a post-Mass at last week during the Atlantic 10 Conference tournament in . “They don’t want to hear about Xavier, or any university, using students athletically and then dumping them without a degree.”She was dressed not in a habit, but in gray sweats with Xavier’s Musketeer logo and white tennis shoes. Her hair, nearly all white, is cropped above the ears. She wears a heavy gold cross on a chain around her neck, representing her order, the Sisters of de Namur. She cannot help smiling when she talks.“She’s not that nun you had in first grade that hits you across the hand with the ruler,” said Mack, a first-year coach who has known Fleming since he was a player at Xavier in the early 1990s and through several years as an assistant there.She has lived on campus since 1983, when she was teaching at Xavier, in a dorm that for a long time housed the men’s basketball team. (For a couple of years, she lived across the hall from David West, now an forward — and a Xavier graduate.)She rises at 4 a.m. for an hour of prayer and meditation. Then she usually spends an hour or more at the computer, often researching law cases that she takes on for Volunteer Lawyers for the Poor. (A law degree is one of several she holds, including Master’s degrees in English, business administration and theology, and a doctorate in education administration.) She exercises on an elliptical trainer, lifts weights and swims. Daily Mass is at 8.By 8:30, she is usually in her office, overseeing two other full-time advisers and two volunteers who help her track Xavier’s 271 athletes in 17 sports.Fleming has the ear of faculty members and cellphone numbers for the athletes. On occasion, athletes will find her knocking on their doors or waiting outside for their return.“She’ll wait in a blizzard if she has to,” said the sophomore guard Terrell Holloway, who received a visit from Fleming when he fell behind in reading during summer school. “Whenever she wants us, she knows where to find us.”When potential athletes go to Xavier for recruiting visits, Fleming is one of the first people they meet. Xavier players said that they rarely met academic advisers when they visited other programs.“Coaches call me and say, ‘Look, this person is really a good player,’ ” Fleming said. “ ‘But this person has not done well academically.’ And my first question is why.”Her belief is that if students are focused enough to harness their talent into becoming Division I athletes, they certainly have the capacity to learn. But people learn differently.“There are different channels to learning,” she said. “And I see my job as finding the best possible one.”Xavier’s freshman athletes are required to attend 10 hours of supervised study hall each week, two hours per night. That continues unless grade point averages are above 3.0. Tutors are brought in for specialized help.“There’s such a respect level because she’s been the academic adviser for Brian Grant and James Posey and David West,” said Mack, naming Xavier basketball players who completed degrees and went on to the N.B.A. “So when a freshman comes into our program, it’s not like we just hired her last week.”In 1991, Pete Gillen, the coach at the time, named Fleming the team’s most valuable player. In 2000, she was inducted into Xavier’s athletic hall of fame.Yet, most have never seen her shoot a basketball — which she did in high school in Cincinnati and college at Mount St. Joseph, when she was not playing on field hockey teams.“If I wanted to shoot today, I’d have to spend a lot more time in the weight room strengthening my arms and chest,” Fleming said.A few hours later, a photographer found a large ladder at Atlantic City’s Boardwalk Hall to stand on to take a picture of Fleming and the men’s basketball team, but needed someone to haul it to the center of the court.“Need some help with that?” Fleming asked.'"
"'10-03-16,'1','Having only one kidney does not appear to affect the long-term survival of live kidney donors, and the risk of dying from the surgery itself is very low, according to new research published in the March 10 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.The study is one of the first to assess the long-term survival of some 80,347 adults in the United States who donated a kidney to a loved one from April 1994 to March 2009, said Dr. Dorry L. Segev, a transplant surgeon at Johns Hopkins and the paper’s lead author.The live donors were followed for an average of 6.3 years, and their survival was compared with a group of 9,364 people who had both kidneys but were similar in age and health status. The study found that the live kidney donors were no more likely to die than the comparison group.While the risk of dying within 90 days of the transplant surgery was low — with a rate of 3.1 deaths per 10,000 donors — some people were at higher risk than others, with men, blacks and people with high blood pressure at greater risk than women, whites, Hispanics and people without high blood pressure.'"
"'10-03-16,'1','With the prospects for a recovery looking better, businesses are beginning to tentatively rebuild inventories. That has helped drive factory orders and made manufacturing one of the few bright spots of the economy. The sector continues to outpace the growth of the overall economy.Factories are also benefiting from a resurgence in orders from overseas. Many businesses have seen exports grow significantly over the last six months, helped in part by a weak dollar and a surge in demand as foreign economies begin to stir.Industrial production was up 1.7 percent in February compared with a year earlier, and it rose 0.9 percent in January. February’s gains marked the eighth month of upward momentum.A separate report by the Fed on Monday provided more evidence that the recovery for manufacturing was robust. New York-area manufacturers recorded a surge in orders and shipments in March, according to the Fed’s Empire State Manufacturing Survey. Employment in the sector reached the highest level since 2007, and inventories grew to the largest levels since before the start of the financial crisis. The overall index of manufacturing activity fell, but not as much as expected.Production is expected to continue to make gains this year. Economists forecast a large gain in industrial output in March as businesses make up for lost time caused by February’s weather.John Ryding, chief economist for RDQ Economics, predicted that industrial production would grow 7 percent this year as the labor market improved and businesses in the United States and abroad began spending more on capital goods.“The financial system has stabilized, and trade flows are reconnecting,” Mr. Ryding said. “The recovery continues to be led by a recovery in manufacturing.”But economists note that a return to normal production levels is still a way off. Capacity utilization, which measures how much of the nation’s production capability is in use, increased slightly to 72.7 percent in February, far below the historical average of 80.6.'"
"'10-03-16,'1','RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Consol Energy said Monday it had agreed to buy Dominion Resources’ Appalachian exploration and production business for $3.475 billion, substantially increasing its natural gas reserves and production capacity.The deal will give Consol, a supplier of coal and natural gas, a leading position in the strategic Marcellus Shale, a rock bed 6,000 feet beneath New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio that could be the country’s most productive natural gas source.Most energy companies, both producers and utilities, expect the federal government to tighten regulations for coal mining and emissions. Utilities are swapping coal-fired power plants for cleaner-burning natural gas turbines.Last month, the coal mine operator Alpha Natural Resources, based in Abingdon, Va., said that it was expanding its natural gas business by drilling its first well in the Marcellus Shale in a venture with Rice Energy.Consol, based in Canonsburg, Pa., near Pittsburgh, predicts its natural gas business will account for as much as 35 percent of its total revenue. It needs to raise about $4 billion for the Dominion acquisition, which is expected to close by April 30.Consol has operations in West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Utah. In January, the chief executive, J. Brett Harvey, said that he considered coal mining a cash cow that would be used to pay for increased production from CNX Gas, which Consol controls through its 83 percent stake. CNX already has a sizable stake in the Marcellus Shale as well as coal bed methane wells in Virginia.'"

"'10-03-17,'1','HARRISON, N.J. — The first thing you notice about Red Bull Arena is how big it appears from the outside. As you approach the stadium, the new home of the Red Bulls of Major League Soccer, it rises on the horizon like a giant floating silver soufflé. The stadium looks as if it could easily hold 50,000 fans, maybe more.Its size is magnified by the enormous adjacent lots that have been cleared to make way for a series of shops and condominiums that are part of a plan to revitalize this town. The roof, which billows over the stadium, also masks what turns out to be a cozy stadium, something you recognize once you enter.Red Bull Arena will open Saturday when the Red Bulls play the Brazilian team Santos F.C., Pelé’s old team. In many ways, the stadium, which cost about $200 million, is the antithesis of the team’s old home, Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. The new building has seats for just 25,000 fans, one-third as many as Giants Stadium, which was better suited for football. The team will play on grass, not artificial turf, and the soccer field will not become lost in a maze of faded football yard markers.With far fewer seats, the Red Bulls will not draw the large crowds that turned out to see World Cup matches and superstars like Pelé and David Beckham. But fans will be closer to the action. There are only 17 rows of seats in the lower bowl, and the first rows are just seven yards from the sidelines. The pitch of the upper bowl is somewhat steep, but the entire field is visible from the top rows. The handful of seats that have obscured views will not be sold.The original design for the stadium, which goes back 10 years, included 66 suites, 2,000 premium seats and a stage. When Red Bull, the Austrian maker of energy drinks, took over the stadium project in 2007, it scrapped the stage and cut the number of suites to 30 and the club seats to 750. This increased the seating capacity of the stadium by about 40 percent and helped the team keep the average ticket price at about $25.'"
"'10-03-17,'1','At the same time, lawmakers in Washington are discussing whether to raise the capital gains tax by as much as 50 percent, which would slice into the profits of owners selling their teams.George Postolos, a former Houston Rockets executive who bid against Jordan for the Bobcats, said rising franchise values earlier this decade masked years of losses, debt, bad management and the problems of running teams in smaller markets. “Warren Buffett says the tide has gone out and we can see who’s been swimming naked,” Postolos said.This new dynamic could fundamentally change the business of sports. As lenders reassess what teams can earn, they are challenging some buyers unwilling to agree to stiffer rules for borrowing, like having the lead investor in a group sign a contract to personally guarantee annual losses.“Does it practically change behavior? No,” said a person involved in buying a franchise who did not want to be named because the deal is not complete. “But does it cross a line? Yes.”For decades, sports teams weathered recessions remarkably well. Ticket and advertising sales sometimes dipped, but teams continued to sell at a profit despite the headwinds buffeting the broader economy, according to research by Moag & Company, which brokers sales of teams.But John Moag, the company’s chairman, said this recession had been drastically different. “The impact of the stock and real estate devaluation on franchise ownership is indirectly, but very certainly, impacting the stability of a number of professional sports franchises,” he said.The effect of the financial crisis has been seen even in sales of marquee teams like the Chicago Cubs ($845 million) and the Montreal Canadiens ($550 million), which almost certainly would have received more in a thriving market.But the sums paid for financially weakened teams like the Bobcats suggest a growing gap between the value of stronger and weaker franchises.¶The Russian billionaire Mikhail D. Prokhorov agreed to pay $200 million for 80 percent of the Nets, the worst team in the N.B.A., and 45 percent of their new Brooklyn arena. He will also finance $60 million in team losses and be responsible for most of its $207 million debt.¶Last month, the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League was sold to Jeffrey N. Vinik, who once ran the giant Fidelity Magellan Fund, for a sum described as from $100 million to $150 million — well below the $200 million paid in 2008.¶The debt-laden Phoenix Coyotes were sold last fall in bankruptcy court for $140 million to the N.H.L., which fended off a much higher bid from a suitor who wanted to move the team to Canada. The league plans to resell the Coyotes for an estimated $150 million.¶In a three-step process, the buyers of baseball’s San Diego Padres are taking on more than $200 million in stadium debt from an owner who needed cash to pay for his divorce.¶The pending sale of the Texas Rangers came after Tom Hicks, the Major League Baseball team’s owner, defaulted on $525 million in loans on the Rangers and the Dallas Stars of the N.H.L.Now that the economy seems to be on the mend, owners who held off selling during the downturn are seeking to unload their teams. According to sports bankers, the teams thought to be for sale include the Atlanta Hawks, the Memphis Grizzlies, the Golden State Warriors and the Detroit Pistons in the N.B.A; the Stars, the Atlanta Thrashers and potentially the Columbus Blue Jackets in the N.H.L.; and baseball’s Houston Astros.The Los Angeles Dodgers could be sold because of the pending divorce of their owners.In any economy, owners cash out after long tenures, as H. Wayne Huizenga did early last year when he completed the sale of the Miami Dolphins for $1.1 billion nearly 15 years after buying them for $138 million.And owners die. The St. Louis Rams agreed to the sale of the N.F.L team last month, two years after their owner’s death. The Washington Wizards are in play as their minority owner is seeking to buy out the interests of Abe Pollin, who died in November.The sale of the Bobcats is symptomatic of how the economy exposes poorly run, money-losing teams.David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, said Robert Johnson, the Bobcats’ primary owner, was hurt early on by a bad cable television deal, the absence of a naming rights partner for the arena and slow ticket and sponsorship sales. Though the team has largely fixed those flaws, Stern said, “The legacy of financial underperformance is still with the team.” He said the league and city of Charlotte were fortunate that Jordan, a Bobcats part-owner and executive since 2006, is buying the team, which has “lost money every year and has incurred substantial debt.”While the economy is slowly improving, the pool of wealthy investors willing to buy teams has shrunk, as has the number of financial institutions willing to finance team acquisitions. Dave Checketts, who led a group to bid for the Rams, said buyers needed “a big equity check” to avoid using too much debt.Checketts, the principal owner of the N.H.L.’s St. Louis Blues, said his goal was to find an undervalued team in any economy. He said, “We look for situations, like the Blues and Rams, that have seen better days.”'"
"'10-03-17,'1','“Who is the sovereign, the state or the federal government?” said State Representative Chris N. Herrod, a Republican from Provo, Utah, and leader of the 30-member Patrick Henry Caucus, which formed last year and led the assault on federal legal barricades in the session that ended Thursday., and Washington are considering bills or constitutional amendments that would assert local police powers to be supreme over the federal authority, according to the Tenth Amendment Center, a research and advocacy group based in . And Utah, again not to be outdone, passed a bill last week that says federal law enforcement authority, even on federal lands, can be limited by the state.“There’s a tsunami of interest in states’ rights and resistance to an overbearing federal government; that’s what all these measures indicate,” said Gary Marbut, the president of the Montana Shooting Sports Association, which led the drive last year for one of the first “firearms freedoms,” laws like the ones signed last week in South Dakota and Wyoming.In most cases, conservative over federal authority is fueling the impulse, with the Tea Party movement or its members in the backdrop or forefront. Mr. Herrod in Utah said that he had spoken at rallies, for example, but that his efforts, and those of the Patrick Henry Caucus, were not directly connected to the Partiers.And in some cases, according to the Tenth Amendment Center, the politics of states’ rights are veering left. , and , for example — none of them known as conservative bastions — are considering bills that would authorize, or require, governors to recall or take control of National Guard troops, asserting that federal calls to active duty have exceeded federal authority.“Everything we’ve tried to keep the federal government confined to rational limits has been a failure, an utter, unrelenting failure — so why not try something else?” said Thomas E. Jr., a senior fellow at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, a nonprofit group in Auburn, Ala., that researches what it calls “the scholarship of liberty.”Mr. Woods, who has a Ph.D. in history, and has written widely on states’ rights and nullification — the argument that says states can sometimes trump or disregard federal law — said he was not sure where the dots between states’ rights and politics connected. But he and others say that whatever it is, something politically powerful is brewing under the statehouse domes.Other scholars say the state efforts, if pursued in the courts, would face formidable roadblocks. Article 6 of the Constitution says federal authority outranks state authority, and on that bedrock of federalist principle rests centuries of back and forth that states have mostly lost, notably the desegregation of schools in the 1950s and ’60s.“Article 6 says that that federal law is supreme and that if there’s a conflict, federal law prevails,” said Prof. Ruthann Robson, who teaches constitutional law at the School of Law. “It’s pretty difficult to imagine a way in which a state could prevail on many of these.”And while some efforts do seem headed for a direct conflict with federal laws or the Constitution, others are premised on the idea that federal courts have misinterpreted the Constitution in the federal government’s favor.A lawsuit filed last year by the Shooting Sports Association after the state’s “firearms freedom” law took effect, for example, does not say that the federal government has no authority to regulate guns, but that courts have misconstrued interstate commerce regulations.National monuments and medical , of all things, play a role as well.Mr. Herrod in Utah said that after an internal memorandum from the was made public last month, discussing sites around the country potentially suitable for federal protection as national monuments — including two sites in Utah — support for all kinds of statements against federal authority gained steam.And at the Tenth Amendment Center, the group’s founder, Michael Boldin, said he thought states that had bucked federal authority over the last decade by legalizing medical marijuana, even as federal law held all marijuana use and possession to be illegal, had set the template in some ways for the effort now. And those states, Mr. Boldin said, were essentially validated in their efforts last fall when the Justice Department said it would no longer make medical marijuana a priority in the states were it was legal. Nullification, he said, was shown to work.Whether the political impulse of states’ rights and nullification will become a direct political fault line in the national elections this fall is uncertain, said Mr. Woods of the von Mises institute.But in Utah, at least, a key indicator is coming much sooner. The party caucuses to determine, among other things, whether candidates will face primary elections, are to be held next Tuesday, and Mr. Herrod said the states rights’ crowd would attend and push for change.“Those politicians who don’t understand that things are different are in big trouble because a few people showing up to caucus can have a big influence,” Mr. Herrod said.A spokeswoman for Gov. Gary R. Herbert, a Republican — who signed a firearms law like South Dakota’s last month declaring exemption from federal regulation for guns made and used within the state — said Mr. Herbert was still studying the new batch of bills passed this week and had not yet made decisions about signing them.'"
"'10-03-17,'1','The Senate bill calls for a new study even though the Securities and Exchange Commission commissioned a similar report in 2008. At the same time, the new bill leaves the S.E.C. with no power to act on the subject of either review.Opponents of new regulations say that the prescribed studies are warranted because they can help derail overly burdensome rules that can strangle growth, particularly for small companies, which often lack the resources required to meet the demands of regulators.In the House bill, therefore, there is a call for a study of how regulations affect small businesses, and another to examine the definition of “small.”Christopher J. Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who introduced the bill, told committee members on Tuesday to submit proposed amendments by Friday afternoon, and said the committee would begin considering those changes on Monday.Consumer advocates say they believe that too often studies are used to push an issue down the road, perhaps with the hope of never having to address it.Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said there was truth to that, but political realities often dictate that studies be included.“If you shoot them down, the other side will say, ‘What, are you afraid of, the facts?’ ” Mr. Frank said. “Occasionally it is a legitimate thing, but mostly it is political folderol.”The House bill, which was passed last year, is more laden with requirements for studies — at least 38 of them, to be conducted by the Government Accountability Office, the S.E.C., the Treasury Department, or the proposed systemic risk council, which would include members representing at least 10 federal agencies. The Senate bill calls for roughly two dozen studies.The problem with lengthy studies is that they delay regulatory changes, which can end up hurting investors, said Lynn E. Turner, formerly the chief accountant for the S.E.C. He said that after the Enron collapse, some members of Congress wanted to include legislation in the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act that would restrict the use of off-balance sheet entities, which were a central part of the Enron fraud.Instead, Congress opted for a study, which the S.E.C. delivered in 2005, recommending several accounting and reporting changes to provide more transparency on company financial statements.The recommendations were largely unheeded by Congress, Mr. Turner said, and a few years later, similar problems contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Some of the proposals for studies are so specific that they raise questions about whose interests are being watched over.Other studies address issues that have been debated in the financial industry for years, like proposals over whether individual investors should be required to use arbitration to settle disputes with brokers, rather than having access to the courts. “I think there have been hearings and testimony and lawsuits over this year for years,” said Lauren K. Saunders, a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center.Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said some of the studies could provide useful information to regulators, like the proposed review of financial literacy and mutual fund advertisements called for in the Senate bill.“They are designed to bring attention to areas where the S.E.C. does currently have the authority to improve the nature of disclosures,” Ms. Roper said. But, she added, “some of these studies are clearly designed to create the impression that Congress is doing something about the problem when in fact they won’t.”Now that they have a Senate proposal to focus on, consumer and banking organizations began their lobbying efforts in earnest Tuesday. Hundreds of members of the American Bankers Association had come to Washington for a previously scheduled industry meeting, and the trade group lost no time in urging them to contact their senators.The banking group opposes the removal of the Federal Reserve Board’s authority over some of its current state-chartered members and it objects to some of the consumer protection measures in the bill.Carmen Balber, Washington director for Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit education and advocacy group, also opposes some of the consumer provisions, but for the opposite reason, saying they do not go far enough. Some of those provisions are subject to study as well.'"
"'10-03-17,'1','BRUSSELS — European Union finance ministers delayed a decision on new rules for hedge funds Tuesday in a reprieve for Britain, which fears that onerous regulations could drive the industry from London.The ministers, meeting in Brussels, could take until the summer to reach agreement on the issues, officials said.“We were not the only country with reservations,” said Alistair Darling, the British finance minister, referring to the ministers’ meeting. “It’s sensible to spend a while trying to see if we can get consensus.”Earlier this month, Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, warned that the proposed rules could discriminate against funds in the United States, raising the specter of trade friction.The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive would have required funds based outside the 27-member European Union to ask permission from individual European countries to market themselves to investors rather than being able to treat the bloc as a single market.The rules also would require hedge funds, private equity groups and others to register and disclose trading information to supervisors.'"
"'10-03-17,'1','In a rare interview, by telephone on Tuesday, Monsignor Scicluna acknowledged the concern. Asked if he wanted reinforcements, he said with a laugh: “I would hope we have less work. That’s my hope. Not more people, less work.”He added that if the number of cases averaged 300 a year, “We can continue doing our job well with 10 people. The problem is: Are these numbers going to settle?”A decade after the Roman Catholic Church in the United States was shaken by revelations of widespread sexual abuse of minors by priests, a similar phenomenon is sweeping Germany.This week, the German church suspended a priest who had been allowed to work with children for decades after a court convicted him of molesting boys. In 1980, Archbishop Ratzinger allowed the priest to move to Munich for therapy after allegations of abuse.Although last week the auxiliary bishop who approved the priest’s return to pastoral work stepped down, some have raised questions about Benedict’s responsibility in the matter.“It depends what you mean by responsible,” Monsignor Scicluna said. “If he was involved in the decision, he would be. If he was not involved, it’s a responsibility that comes from his office, a ‘the buck stops here’ sort of thing.’ But I think that the person concerned has already taken responsibility for what he did; the answer to that question has already been given.”Despite the small number of people in the Vatican working on such cases, he stressed that his office was the last step in a long process for the cases, after they have been investigated by “hundreds of canon lawyers” in dioceses worldwide.""It's not that these people are doing every case from A to Z, otherwise we'd really be bonkers,"" he said.The German Bishops Conference announced Tuesday that it would open a sexual-abuse hot line on March 30. The hot line would be for victims and professionals, but also for abusers.Bishop Ludwig Schick of Bamberg told Bavarian Radio on Tuesday that he was surprised by the number of cases that had come to light, and that the matter had to be dealt with openly and directly. “It’s bitter and it’s hard, but it absolutely has to be worked through,” he said. “This abscess must be opened and dried out so that it can heal.”'"
"'10-03-17,'1','The authorities forced stores and shopping malls in Tehran to close in the afternoon and banned motorcycles in the city. Thousands of pro-government forces were stationed on major streets. Municipal garbage containers were collected to prevent their being used to make bonfires, a witness said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.And neighborhood police officers went door to door warning residents that large celebrations were banned.However, many neighborhoods “rocked” with bonfires and music later in the evening, witnesses said. The celebrations were scattered around Tehran but took place in almost all of the city’s neighborhoods. Firecrackers echoed across the city, witnesses said, despite police efforts over the past few weeks to confiscate them.There were unconfirmed reports on opposition Web sites of sporadic clashes between pro-government forces and people in the streets.The semiofficial news agency ISNA said 50 people were arrested for “causing disturbances.” The Fars news agency reported that 220 people were injured on Tuesday, although given the traditional pyrotechnics of the occasion, that number was not unusual.In a statement that was reported Tuesday on the opposition Web site Jaras, Mr. Moussavi named the new Iranian year, which begins Sunday, the year of “perseverance and patience.”The statement appeared to be a soft but pointed challenge to Ayatollah Khamenei, who in recent years had chosen names for each year in an annual message.“Next year will be the year of perseverance and patience,” Mr. Moussavi said. “My feeling is that the direction of this movement is irreversible, and we would never go back to a year ago. We must value this change.”The statement was also seen as a move to assert his leadership and to define a new strategy for the opposition movement, which is facing mounting government pressure.“Mr. Khamenei always announces a name on March 21, but it looks like Mr. Moussavi did it a few days before him,” said Fatimeh Haghighatjoo, a former member of Parliament who is now a visiting professor at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. “He was also telling his supporters not to expect big changes in a matter of months.”Mr. Moussavi made the statement in a private meeting over the weekend with members of the Islamic Participation Party, a reformist party banned this week by the government.The statement also pointed to what might be a new strategy for the movement beyond the mass street protests, which have been brutally suppressed by the government.“We have to reach out to major groups in society, like teachers, workers and various classes of people, to explain to them the message of the movement,” the statement said.'"
"'10-03-17,'1','His A.N.C. comrades could perhaps tolerate his abuse of political opponents, enjoying how he denounced them as Satanists or demeaned the women as too ugly to marry. He recently insulted the country’s Afrikaner minority by leading students in the old struggle chant, “Kill the farmer, kill the Boer.” In a nation where the police say 861 white farmers have been killed since 2001, some deemed this sing-along insensitive to say the least.But Mr. Malema has also turned his tongue on veteran A.N.C. stalwarts, particularly leaders of the party’s alliance partners, the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions, calling them reactionaries. He said the Communists presented themselves as champions of the working class while “they spend most of their time drinking red wine.”Mr. Malema is popular in the townships, where most young people delight in the entertainment value of his scalding wit. But he is increasingly despised within his own party’s hierarchy and now claims that several A.N.C. leaders are out to “smear” him. This hardly seems implausible.For a long time, people have wondered how a young man with an impoverished past has collected enough cash to own a fine home in the Johannesburg suburbs. Mr. Malema serves Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky and Moët & Chandon Champagne at his parties. He wears Gucci suits and a Breitling watch. He walks through poor communities in designer jeans.In a single weekend last month, three major newspapers published exposés about Mr. Malema, asserting that he has amassed a fortune through government contracts steered to businesses in which he owns an interest.According to The City Press, one company, SGL Engineering Projects, which listed Mr. Malema as a director, won $20 million in contracts from municipalities in Mr. Malema’s home province. The company’s earnings have multiplied in just the past two years, even though its work has often been found shoddy, news reports said.These simultaneous revelations may have been a case of coincidental sleuthing — or perhaps closely timed leaks from well-informed enemies.Under pressure to respond, Mr. Malema, speaking through his attorney, said that in 2008 he resigned his directorships in all companies. He insisted that he was unaware that he currently held a position in SGL.Mr. Zuma has routinely supported his pugnacious acolyte, and this time was no different. “I’m not sure Malema has no right to business, on what basis I don’t know,” the president said.But blood was in the water, and soon the call for lifestyle audits stretched into the presidency itself. Mr. Zuma said such invasive accounting was unnecessary, arguing that by law government officials already were obligated to disclose their business interests, gifts and assets.The president was correct about that. In fact, by law he was supposed to report the details of his finances within 60 days of assuming office. He was inaugurated 10 months ago but had yet to comply with the ethics code.Last Wednesday, a week after the news media finally awakened to Mr. Zuma’s non-compliance — and after even some political allies had joined political adversaries in their disapproval — the president submitted an accounting of his holdings, though the extent of that disclosure has yet to become public.As to how he supports all those dependents, part of the answer emerged Tuesday when Collins Chabane, a minister within the presidency, said the government provided more than $2 million a year for “spousal” support. The examples he gave were for expenses relating to the duties of Mr. Zuma’s wives in their capacities as first ladies, such as secretaries, air travel, cellphones and computers. No details were given regarding government support for the president’s children.The payment of Mr. Zuma’s bills has been an issue before. In 2005, a close friend and financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, was found guilty of bribing Mr. Zuma in return for help in various business deals. The moneybags were open for items big and small: vacations, medical bills, even the allowance for Mr. Zuma’s children. The trial judge said the two had a “mutually beneficial symbiosis.”Mr. Zuma was later charged with 16 counts of fraud, corruption and racketeering. He avoided a trial when prosecutors dismissed the case because of misconduct within their ranks, just weeks before he was sworn in as president.Mr. Shaik, sentenced to 15 years, spent only 28 months in jail before being freed on medical parole in March 2009. At the time, he was said to be near death, though he has since been observed driving around Durban in his BMW X6.That is not the automobile Mr. Malema prefers. He sits behind the wheel of a black C63 Mercedes-Benz AMG.'"
"'10-03-17,'1','“The service that Matthew and other folks provide for us is extraordinarily valuable,” said Brent Grulke, the creative director of South by Southwest, whose five-day music festival begins on Wednesday. “It inspires a degree of confidence that it will be done and done properly. Artists that endeavor to do it on their own certainly are capable of it and often do manage to do it. But the learning curve is steep.”In person, Mr. Covey, 41, strikes a figure somewhere between aging punk rocker and detail-obsessed bureaucrat. Dressed in black jeans with long zippers up the sides, he looked as if he could be pressing play on a noisy remix track when he hit the space bar on one of the office’s gleaming iMacs. Instead, Tamizdat’s database popped up, showing dotted, color-coded checklists for dozens of artists at a time.“The system kind of works,” he said in his characteristic rapid-fire, here’s-what-you-need-to-know speech. “It’s poor; it’s badly conceived; it’s based on some decent ideas, the execution of which is needlessly Kafkaesque.”Mr. Covey found his calling while living and playing music in Slovakia in the mid-1990s; there, and later as a Knitting Factory employee, he and his girlfriend (now wife), Heather Mount, helped promote and book tours for Eastern European bands that had few other resources. One referral led to another, and before long Tamizdat was a fully functioning visa prepper.Its business volume is an indication of the growing international presence at South by Southwest, which in 24 years has developed from a small regional festival to a global clearinghouse of independent music; this year there are delegations from Chile, Germany, France, Britain, Brazil and other countries. But the fact that Mr. Covey’s services are so needed also points to the complications of travel to the United States.The documentation for a performer’s visa application can be extensive. Depending on the type of visa sought, an applicant may have to demonstrate evidence of “renown,” in the form of press clippings and awards, which officials have wide latitude to interpret. The laws covering these visas have not changed much in decades, immigration lawyers and others say, but since 2001 enforcement has tightened in sometimes puzzling and disruptive ways.The problems cut across all genres. Recently the Cleveland Orchestra’s application for Martin Mitterrutzner, an acclaimed young Austrian tenor, was denied for reasons that left the orchestra perplexed: the report from immigration officials said, among other things, that the scheduling of Mr. Mitterrutzner’s performances did not indicate prestige, since he was booked for matinees, not evening performances. After two denials, the orchestra retained a lawyer and got the decision reversed in the nick of time — but only after considerable expense.“A lot of people don’t imagine it could possibly be this hard,” said Mr. Covey, who makes clear to clients that since he is not a lawyer, his role is strictly procedural. But despite the white knuckles that can result from the uncertainty and high stakes of the immigration system, most artists, if their applications are executed properly and with sufficient lead time, eventually do make it through. And many people in the concert industry say Mr. Covey’s resourcefulness in dealing with the immigration system, and his skill in explaining it to frightened musicians and music executives, has a value all its own.“Music people aren’t always the most organized people in the world,” said Bill Bragin, director of public programming at Lincoln Center. “There are lots of little steps in this process, and lots of opportunities to do it wrong or get misinformation. That’s where Matthew goes into fixer mode. He keeps people on point so you can reduce that margin of error.”For the most part, Tamizdat’s error rate is low. Mr. Covey boasted that of its 2,262 clients in the last five years — that’s 2,262 bands, a total of almost 8,000 people — he has had only three unresolved denials.“It’s a hassle,” he said, “but it’s not an insurmountable hassle.”'"

"'10-03-17,'1','HONG KONG — China’s foreign minister waded into the mystery over the disappearance more than a year ago of one of the country’s most prominent human rights lawyers, but his remarks on Tuesday shed little light on the lawyer’s fate.At a Beijing news conference, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said the lawyer, Gao Zhisheng, had been sentenced to prison for subversion. But Mr. Yang did not say whether he was referring to a new sentence or whether he was citing a suspended sentence that Mr. Gao had received in late 2006 after writing an open letter to President Hu Jintao alleging mistreatment of adherents of the banned Falun Gong movement.In the 2006 case, Mr. Gao was quickly released after he made a confession. He later said he had been coerced into confessing by state security officials.Shang Baojun, a prominent human rights lawyer in China who has advised other dissidents, said that Chinese courts had the power to send people released on suspended sentences back to prison without a trial. It was not clear whether that was the case with Mr. Gao.Mr. Yang, who spoke Tuesday at a joint news conference with Foreign Secretary David Miliband of Britain, said that Mr. Gao had not been tortured, something human rights activists had raised as a possibility. He said nothing to clarify where Mr. Gao was being held. The Foreign Ministry’s press office said afterward that it had no further information.'"

"'10-03-18,'1','Five of the country’s six largest publishers — Macmillan, Simon & Schuster, Hachette, HarperCollins and Penguin — have already reached deals with Apple to sell their books through its iBookstore, which will be featured on the iPad. (The holdout is Random House.)Under those agreements, the publishers will set consumer prices for each book, and Apple will serve as an agent and take a 30 percent commission. E-book editions of most newly released adult general fiction and nonfiction will cost $12.99 to $14.99.Amazon has agreed in principle that the major publishers would be able to set prices in its Kindle store as well. But it is also demanding that they lock into three-year contracts and guarantee that no other competitor will get lower prices or better terms.Apple, for its part, is requiring that publishers not permit other retailers to sell any e-books for less than what is listed in the iBookstore. So the publishers have sought to renegotiate agreements they have with Amazon under which they sold books to it at wholesale, allowing Amazon to set the consumer price.Amazon has built up a 90 percent share of the American e-book market, in part because it sells most new releases and best sellers at a heavily discounted standard price of $9.99. Many Kindle owners have said the low price motivates them to buy more e-books, but publishers feared that the price would eventually erode their profits.According to three people briefed on the discussions, publishers are reluctant to sign three-year contracts because the digital book world is changing so rapidly and they want room to adjust as it takes shape.Amazon has also begun talking with smaller publishers that have not yet signed contracts with Apple. In those conversations, according to one person briefed on the discussions, Amazon has said it prefers to retain its wholesale pricing model, as opposed to Apple’s so-called agency model.But some of these smaller publishers have begun talking with Apple, which has effectively said that any publisher that wishes to sell its books on the iPad must offer the same terms to all booksellers. In other words, to do business with Apple, publishers must export Apple’s business model to all retailers. Amazon, by contrast, has not promised to adopt the agency approach for any but the largest publishers.Amazon appears to be responding to the Apple threat by waging a publisher-by-publisher battle, trying to keep as many books as possible out of Apple’s hands, while preserving as much flexibility as it can to set its own prices.But if Amazon tries to enforce its demands by removing “buy” buttons from some pages again, some believe it could harm its reputation in the eyes of customers and the publishing industry.“They cannot remove the ‘buy’ buttons from two major publishers’ lists without doing serious long-term damage to their own brand,” said Mike Shatzkin, chief executive of Idea Logical, a company that advises book publishers on e-books.If Amazon does stop directly selling books from some publishers, many of those books will still be available from outside sellers that use Amazon’s site as a storefront.Amazon may have more leverage with smaller publishers, which typically sell their books in fewer outlets and thus tend to rely more on Amazon for sales. Amazon may believe that if it can keep those publishers from moving to an agency model, Apple will choose not to sell their e-books, and Amazon will be seen as having a broader selection.Amazon’s strategy “is to work very hard to limit participation in the agency model to only the big four or five firms that are already announced,” said Evan Schnittman, vice president for global business development at Oxford University Press. “This would leave 50 to 60 percent of the content out there subject to the standard distribution terms, enabling Amazon to promote and price as it does today, and forcing Apple to have to compete with Amazon’s strength.”Apple is not likely to give up on smaller publishers. A new job posting on its Web site is for an “independent publisher account manager, iBookstore.” The posting says the person would be “responsible for building and growing relationships with small- and medium-size book publishers, self-published authors and other content providers for the iBookstore.”'"
"'10-03-18,'1','The 911 call came in at 11:55 p.m. on Nov. 8, 2008. Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant, had been stabbed in the chest near a train station in the Long Island village of Patchogue. The nearest hospital, Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center, was three miles away. Mr. Lucero appeared to be alive when the Patchogue Ambulance Company arrived at the scene, his eyes opening upon being moved and his breathing fast and labored, according to ambulance company documents.But when Mr. Lucero finally arrived at Brookhaven Memorial, the time was 12:34 a.m. — nearly 40 minutes had elapsed. That delay in getting Mr. Lucero to the hospital will most likely play into the defense of the young man charged with killing him.The man, Jeffrey Conroy, 19, is accused of second-degree murder as a hate crime, gang assault and other charges in connection with Mr. Lucero’s stabbing, as well as attempted attacks on three other Hispanic men. Mr. Conroy was one of seven Patchogue-Medford High School students who the police and prosecutors said taunted and beat Mr. Lucero that night as he walked with a friend near the train station.Opening arguments in the trial are set for Thursday in State Supreme Court in Riverhead in Suffolk County. Mr. Conroy, the first defendant in the case to go to trial, has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Four of the seven defendants have pleaded guilty to gang-assault and other charges and are cooperating with the authorities.Mr. Lucero’s death exposed racial tensions in Patchogue and caused a number of Hispanic residents to come forward claiming they were the victims of regular harassment and assaults. Advocates for immigrants criticized the Suffolk County Police Department for failing to fully investigate allegations of assaults on Latinos and also criticized some county leaders and politicians for fueling the hostility with what they said was anti-immigrant talk.'"
"'10-03-18,'1','Nearly two years before the Taxi and Limousine Commission uncovered a widespread scheme to overcharge passengers, city officials investigated two similar cases in which cabbies were found guilty of the same fraud.Although the episodes occurred within weeks of each other in 2008, officials never thought to examine GPS data from other yellow cabs to see whether the fraud was more pervasive.“They didn’t raise a red flag,” said Allan J. Fromberg, a spokesman for the agency.“These two cases were isolated cases that went through a mostly administrative process,” he said. “The investigation was limited to the circumstances of the incident that was the subject to the complaint.”Although one of the drivers, Antoine Dauphin, had his hack license revoked, the action did not require a review by Matthew W. Daus, the taxi commissioner, mandated in certain cases.The city revealed last week that about 3,000 cabbies had overcharged 1.8 million riders over two years, costing passengers a total of $8.3 million.'"
"'10-03-18,'1','Caracter and his stuffed orangutan came on the scene thanks to an exhaustive profile, under the headline “Boy Wonder,” in The Star-Ledger of Newark during the summer before his eighth-grade year.His high school choice soon became a big story, and he picked St. Patrick, a New Jersey powerhouse in Elizabeth near his family’s home in Fanwood. And he proved to be as precocious on the court as he was immature off it.“I’ve never seen a kid with so much ability,” said Grant Billmeier, a teammate at St. Pat’s. “I don’t think he realized what he had was so special.”Off the court, Caracter struggled with the school’s discipline policies. He did not make it through his first season before being suspended for a year for an accumulation of smaller offenses, ranging from uniform violations to tardiness to class misbehavior.“The principal didn’t want to deal with it anymore,” Caracter said.He transferred to Scotch Plains-Fanwood, his local public high school, and played there as a sophomore. Coach Dan Doherty said one conversation summed up that year.Doherty recalled Caracter telling him: “I don’t understand why I have to be here in math class. I don’t need this. I’m just going to go to the N.B.A.”That year, as Caracter climbed atop the recruiting rankings and LeBron James transformed from phenomenon to N.B.A. sensation, Doherty said things began to change.He said Caracter could call Nike representatives and they would ship gear to him by overnight mail. Caracter would show up with a new watch or a cellphone with a California area code.Doherty said Caracter’s explanation would be, “People give me things.”Around that time, Caracter’s aunt began dating Eddie Lau. Doherty said he was told that Lau was working for Dan Fegan, a prominent N.B.A. agent. Doherty said Lau offered to bring better players to the high school, an offer Doherty declined. He said Lau tried to hang around practices.“I’m certainly not a big fan of his,” Doherty said of Lau. “I know he’s not a big fan of mine. I would ask Derrick’s mom, ‘Who is this guy and why is he around?’ She’d say he’s going out with Derrick’s aunt and living in the house.”Caracter left Scotch Plains-Fanwood after his sophomore year to return to St. Patrick. Neither side was disappointed. Doherty said Caracter’s lack of interest in class forced his departure.“He had no study skills,” Doherty said. “He never learned how to and never really wanted to.”Caracter was happy to attend St. Pat’s, summing up his public school experience with Doherty by saying, “A good guy, but he was a math teacher.”Caracter’s junior year was his most productive in high school. He relished his time playing for Kevin Boyle, whose camps he had attended since fourth grade. Caracter’s reputation bloomed and Lau’s presence increased.Lau, who dated Caracter’s aunt for four years, would pick Caracter up after practice. Boyle said he would let Lau in the gym, as he would other players’ family members.“I think Eddie had some influence over Derrick,” Boyle said. “Was it good or bad? I don’t know. I don’t know all the details.”On the advice of the Louisville assistant coach Steve Masiello, Caracter transferred to Notre Dame Prep, a school in Massachusetts with a reputation for getting academically troubled basketball players eligible.Caracter got his grades, but his game regressed, his playing time was limited and his weight ballooned. He openly clashed with Coach Bill Barton, now an assistant coach at Duquesne. Barton found Caracter lazy and irresponsible.“He really wanted the N.B.A. lifestyle for the lifestyle and not the game itself,” Barton said.Caracter said he chose Louisville in part because of Lau’s friendship with Masiello, and he said he had no regrets about going there. When Caracter arrived, he weighed 315 pounds. Coach Rick Pitino would not let him practice until he reduced his weight to 265.That began two seasons of two-way frustration and minimal production. There were suspensions, public criticisms and finally a dismissal. Soon after, the people around Caracter, including Lau — who had broken up with Caracter’s aunt — began to disappear.“I just felt like Eddie wasn’t one of the people who had my back when everyone thought I was washed up at 20 years old,” Caracter said.Lau said: “All these decisions were all made by Derrick and his mom and uncle. I didn’t influence him at all. People love to write about him and blame it on Eddie Lau.”Caracter’s mother, Winnie Terry, and uncle, Dodd Terry — known as Rusty — said they hate to think that Lau dated Caracter’s aunt only to forge a relationship with Caracter and deliver him to an agent.“I don’t know,” Rusty Terry said. “Honestly. I honestly don’t know. He indicated that he cared a lot about her. In hindsight, you become more and more suspicious.”Lau said in a telephone interview that his intentions were pure.“I dated her like any other girl who I cared about,” Lau said.He added about Caracter: “I don’t need to bring him to an agent to make it in life. I don’t sell kids. I help kids.”After four seasons of tumult, Caracter has found relative stability. He loves El Paso, saying “it’s like Miami, except there’s no beaches.” He has averaged 13.8 points and 8.0 rebounds, rehabbing his hopes as an N.B.A. prospect.“You can’t change or turn like he has if you are a bad person,” Barbee said. “You can’t. You are what you are.”Caracter does not believe he has undergone a wholesale transformation. He said he has found some peace, living in El Paso with his girlfriend — a former Louisville dance team member — a friend from New Jersey, and his two pit bulls, Bentley and Bernie.“Honestly, I wouldn’t do anything different,” Rusty Terry said. “I think this was a necessary road for all of us to experience. This has all made him a much better person.”'"
"'10-03-18,'1','Cavanaugh may have a hard time proving a direct correlation between new uniforms and a team’s on-court success.But the surprising thing is that Crons — whose name Cavanaugh came up with 15 years ago — is supplying the uniforms and practice gear at all.Two years ago, the university went looking to buy new uniforms. It found that the bigger companies were not willing to do much more than give it different-colored models of uniforms they were already providing to larger programs — and wanted to charge Robert Morris about 30 percent more than Crons.“We get the booklets these other companies produce, and when you look for a new uniform, it’s usually a Syracuse or Kentucky style, and if you choose it, you’re basically wearing their uniform,” Rice said.It also did not hurt that in the intertwined world of college basketball, Rice had a tie to Cavanaugh. Rice was an assistant coach at Pittsburgh before going to Robert Morris three years ago, and had met Cavanaugh there and seen the line of clothing his company made for local Amateur Athletic Union teams.So when Rice asked him what he could do for Robert Morris, Cavanaugh offered a custom look that completely revamped the team’s red, white and blue tops and bottoms, and added red, white and blue horizontal stripes down the sides — a look the team’s players instantly liked.“The guys liked it and people have talked about it, so, yeah, it’s gotten some buzz,” said Rice, who points out that the team still wears Nike sneakers. All but 12 of the other 64 teams in the N.C.A.A. tournament are wearing sneakers from Nike or its Jordan division.And while it may be only anecdotal, other smaller programs also describe similar situations that demonstrate why companies like Crons — beyond its founder’s kinetic personality — are making inroads with teams that previously would have never considered going with anyone but Nike, Adidas, Russell Athletic or even Under Armour.“The landscape of uniforms and shoes is changing,” said Ryan Marks, the coach of Texas-Pan American, which last year became Crons’s second Division I basketball client. “Major schools are bound by the shoe contract of whether the coach is a Nike guy or an Adidas guy, and we never were. But schools like ours also don’t get the shoe allotments or discounts we used to on uniforms.”Rice said, “It’s kind of the haves and have-nots these days, and Crons is taking advantage of that, making quality apparel that’s affordable.”Both Nike and the universities peg that to the economy. In recent years, as the economy has constricted and budgets have become tighter at smaller places in particular, programs have started to look to save wherever they can. At the same time, companies like Nike are putting more emphasis on larger, more visible programs, while giving fewer free goods and smaller discounts to the smaller guys.“With the economy, we’re not immune to it like everyone else,” said Kejuan Wilkins, a Nike spokesman.That is red meat to career salesmen and entrepreneurs like Cavanaugh, who started his first company when he was 21 while he was at Pitt, and has built the Cavanaugh Marketing Network into a $10-million-a-year company.He created Crons in 1996, and thought initially he would go straight into retail, so he offered his line to Dick’s Sporting Goods, which is based in a Pittsburgh suburb.“They said: ‘Pat, great product. But come back when you have a track record,’ ” Cavanaugh said.So, over the last four years, Cavanaugh has ignored retail sales and focused on selling to high schools, athletic organizations, then small colleges, smaller professional teams and now bigger colleges and conferences. Last fall, he secured a contract to provide league gear — though not individual team uniforms — for all of the teams in the Big South conference.In all, the company has gone from about 20 clients in 2006 to more than 400. It had revenue of more than $2 million last year, which Cavanaugh believes will grow to nearly $8 million this year.Should Nike ($19 billion in revenue last year) and Adidas ($15 billion) be worried?“Oh, no,” said Jim Hartford, chief executive of SportSourceOne, which publishes the trade journal SGB Update. “But then, Nike wasn’t worried about Under Armour until it was too late.”'"
"'10-03-18,'1','MOSCOW — Shares in Russia’s state oil company, Rosneft, slumped Wednesday after the company was said to have warned its trading partners that a British court could seize assets under a lawsuit filed by former executives of Yukos Oil.An overseas branch of Yukos, now organized as a foundation based in the Netherlands, won a $380 million lawsuit against Rosneft in a Dutch court in 2007 but has been unable to collect the award.The case stemmed from disputes during the bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos in Russia in 2007. The Yukos representatives are trying to collect in commercial court in Britain, where Rosneft has a trading business and lists its shares.The case is one of several pending before European arbitration panels, the European Court of Human Rights and elsewhere stemming from the dissolution of Yukos, once the largest Russian oil company.It was dismantled and filed for bankruptcy in a politically tinged tax-fraud case from 2003 to 2007. Its most valuable assets were acquired by Rosneft, in which the Russian state owns a majority stake.Rosneft notified trading partners and banks about the litigation, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing oil traders. The company pumped 2.1 million barrels of crude a day last year, about a fifth of Russia’s total output.'"
"'10-03-18,'1','In Dearborn, Mich., the county paid more than $37,000 to clean up the home of a convicted hoarder, Kenneth Lang Jr., where the authorities found more than 150 dead Chihuahuas and Chihuahua mixes and over 100 other dogs, covered in feces and filth, living there. Many of the dead dogs were found in refrigerators and freezers at the residence.More than 30 states now have laws that shift the financial burden of caring for abused or neglected animals from taxpayers to the defendants. The same number of states now authorize veterinarians to report suspected animal abuse.And in the last three years, Arkansas, Illinois, Oregon and Washington, D.C., have enacted laws that require or authorize child or spousal abuse investigators and animal control officers to inform each other when they find something potentially amiss in a home. Eight states now have such laws.Law enforcement officials often do not pursue charges against animal abusers because of limited resources, opting instead for noncriminal remediation that results in animals remaining in the custody of their abusers.“In addition to protecting animals from suffering during a lengthy legal process, we used to have to worry about not bankrupting our county while caring for hundreds of animals for an extended period,” said William Lamberth, a prosecutor in Sumner County, Tenn., where the state legislature passed a law in 2007 giving courts the ability to require that those charged with animal abuse pay for care for their impounded animals or lose ownership.He added that the new law had already saved his county tens of thousands of dollars.States are also pushing for improved tracking of offenders.Advocates for the registries say they will be useful because they will allow animal shelters to screen potential adopters, alert law enforcement to the presence of residents with a history of hoarding and warn communities about violent offenders. But opponents argue that once people have served their time and paid their fines, they should not be punished indefinitely for their crimes.The proposed registries in Tennessee and California would include only adult and convicted offenders of felony level animal abuse.The cost of building registries or mandating new reporting requirements has also been a concern.According to a report issued by the Tennessee General Assembly in 2009, a registry there would cost the state $26,200 per year. Colorado conducted a similar analysis in 2002, which found the costs for developing and maintaining an abuser registry at $18,514 the first year and $10,994 for subsequent years.But advocates say cost should not deter states from taking up this issue.“Animal abuse is one of the four indicators that the F.B.I. profilers use to asses future violent behavior, so I don’t see why we should not use it too,” said Diana S. Urban, a Democratic state representative in Connecticut who sponsored a bill mandating that animal control workers and child welfare workers cross-report suspected animal, child or domestic abuse.Frank R. Ascione, a professor at the University of Denver Graduate School of Social Work who has extensively studied the topic, said, “The research is pretty clear that there are connections between animal abuse and domestic violence and child abuse.”One study found that in 88 percent of homes where children were physically abused, pets were mistreated too. A 2007 study found that women abused by their intimate partner were 10 times more likely to report that their partner had hurt or killed one or more of their pets than women who were not abused.Professor Ascione, who also advises law enforcement officials in abuse cases, said that cross-reporting requirements helped foster early intervention.In several recent cases, he said, children hinted at animal abuse to teachers who alerted animal protection agencies. Those workers spotted warning signs of other types of abuse, and child welfare workers intervened only to find that the children themselves were being abused.“Often children are not willing to talk about what is happening to them, but they will talk about their concerns about what they are seeing done to their pets,” Professor Ascione said.States have grown increasingly intolerant of animal abuse over the years. Two decades ago, just six states had felony level animal cruelty laws. Now all but four do.Some states are bucking the trend. In Idaho, which is one of the states without a felony cruelty penalty, farmers and ranchers are pushing a bill that would more clearly distinguish livestock from pets and would exempt livestock from the protections afforded pets.'"
"'10-03-18,'1','At a policy meeting on Wednesday, the Bank of Japan’s board decided in a 5-to-2 vote to double a loan program for banks aimed at increasing liquidity in the Japanese economy, to 20 trillion yen ($222 billion). The fixed-rate loans are available for three months.The board voted unanimously to keep the bank’s benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.“The latest step is additional monetary easing,” the bank’s governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, said at a news conference. “We are employing the available tools to contribute to improving the economy and overcoming deflation.”Mr. Shirakawa struck a note of caution, saying the latest step alone “would not clear up the cloud hanging over the Japanese economy.”One way central banks have encouraged economic activity has been to lower interest rates, making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow money and less attractive for them to save. With interest rates already close to zero, Japan must resort to other measures.The country pursued a zero interest-rate policy from 2001 to 2006, when it gradually started raising rates, which reached 0.5 percent in early 2007. In late 2008, the central bank again started to cut rates as Japan’s economy was hit by the effects of the global economic crisis.With the action on Wednesday, Japan’s financial institutions will be able to borrow a combined total of 20 trillion yen for three months at a fixed rate of 0.1 percent. Still, this most recent action could be offset by the end of a separate credit facility that provides unlimited loans, backed by collateral, to commercial banks.Japan’s efforts may have little effect because banks are struggling to encourage credit growth in a weak economy despite ample liquidity — a situation economists call a “liquidity trap.”Japan is not expected to start tightening monetary policy soon. Even as Japan’s economy shows signs of recovery — its economy has grown for three consecutive quarters — prices continue to fall. Consumer prices slipped for an 11th month in January, and bank lending fell for three consecutive months amid sluggish demand for credit.A major problem facing Japan is deflation, or a general decline in prices because of a lack of demand. Falling prices make consumers even more reluctant to spend, because any purchase is likely to be cheaper in the future.Deflation depresses investment by corporations because falling prices make it difficult to predict returns and make debts harder to pay off.Finance Minister Naoto Kan has called on the central bank to do more to fight deflation. This week, he said he hoped Japan’s economy would beat deflation this year.Mr. Kan applauded the central bank Wednesday, saying its action showed it was “stepping up efforts to fight deflation.”Takehiro Sato, an economist for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report: “It is not hard to imagine that the government’s strong hope that Japan can beat deflation is behind the monetary loosening. If the government and Bank of Japan can present a unified front in fighting deflation, they might be able to send a positive message to markets.”The central bank has “made it clear that it does not believe that it has the tools to bring deflation to an early end,” Richard Jerram, Japan economist for Macquarie Securities, said in a report.“As a result,” he said, “it seems prudent to expect another extended period of price declines.”'"
"'10-03-18,'1','DAKAR, Senegal — The acting president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, dissolved his cabinet on Wednesday in the strongest assertion yet of his authority over a country where his rule has been challenged.The ministers were all inherited from Umaru Yar’Adua, the gravely ill president whose place Mr. Jonathan took in February. Analysts and presidential advisers suggested that they had become an impediment to Mr. Jonathan’s attempts to put his stamp on the office.Information about Mr. Yar’Adua’s condition has been sparse. Three weeks ago, he returned home after a long hospital stay in Saudi Arabia.Mr. Jonathan has had to deal with sectarian and ethnic violence in one region, a flare-up in the rebellion over oil in another and strife in the cabinet. “There are pro- and anti-Jonathan ministers in the cabinet, and pro- and anti-Yar’Adua ministers, and they were polarized as to whether the acting president should act or not act,” said Hassan Tukur, a retired diplomat who is close to Mr. Jonathan.In a foretaste of Wednesday’s dismissals, Mr. Jonathan dismissed Mr. Yar’Adua’s national security adviser last week after mass killings near the city of Jos.“It’s the prerogative of the president to change the cabinet whenever he feels the need to inject new blood, reinvigorate the cabinet and give it a new focus, and that’s what we’ve done here,” said Ima Niboro, Mr. Jonathan’s spokesman.'"
"'10-03-18,'1','The authors of “Face It” aren’t the first to note that modern women are in a bind.In her 1991 book, “The Beauty Myth,” Naomi Wolf argued against the idea — flourishing today — that older female workers “need” plastic surgery to stay employed: “We can better understand how insidious this development is if we try to imagine a racial discrimination suit brought in the face of a powerful technology that processes, with great pain, nonwhite people to look more white. A black employee can now charge, sympathetically, that he doesn’t want to look more white, and should not have to look more white in order to keep his job. We have not yet begun the push toward civil rights for women that will entitle a woman to say that she’d rather look like herself than some ‘beautiful’ young stranger.”In Nancy Etcoff’s 1999 book, “Survival of the Prettiest,”she explained one reason why an older face looks angry when the person doesn’t feel mad. “The lips get thinner as we age, and the brows lower. Both mimic what we do with our facial muscles when we get angry.”'"
"'10-03-18,'1','For Mr. Flay, who camped out for weeks in the Costa Rican jungle to get the shots, a miniature camera was critical, and having patience was probably almost as important.He planned for the trip carefully, mapping out what types of cameras he would need. He settled on something called an Iconix, a camera “a bit bigger than a lady’s lipstick,” he said, that can be placed close to the animals.Local experts helped Mr. Flay and his production partner, an assistant producer named Tom Clarke, find spots in the rainforest where male frogs were guarding groups of eggs. “From there we knew we had a story, and we had a starting point,” Mr. Flay said. Soon the mother would be there to feed her tadpoles.Mr. Flay mounted the Iconix camera on a tripod and a track to capture the mother making her way across the canopy floor. Then he had to find a way to show the frog making the arduous climb up a tree to find a new home for her tadpoles.“For that, we decided we needed to take some sort of crane device,” he said, “just to help give the sense of the epic journey the frog was taking.”After the cameras were set, “it’s just patience — waiting for the frog to do the right thing for you,” he said.Mr. Flay, 51, first entered the natural history field in the mid-1980s, and has contributed to many of the landmark nature programs by David Attenborough, including “Trials of Life” and “Life in Cold Blood.”While on location the cameramen work the same hours as the animals they are tracking. To film the frogs, that meant entering the rainforest by 6 a.m. and staying until dusk. Merely keeping the frogs in camera focus was difficult because of their small size.More often than not, Mr. Flay said, he finds himself living in the vicinity of the animals. Costa Rica was an exception, he said, because there was a hotel “just down the road.” But in the jungle in Madagascar recently, he said, he stayed in a wooden shack that was infested with snakes and rats.For “Life” he filmed Komodo dragons, star-nosed moles and other animals.Like “Planet Earth,” which wowed viewers with stunning high-definition sequences three years ago, “Life” was commissioned by the BBC in partnership with Discovery, which owns the rights in the United States. The BBC generally shows the series first, and Discovery follows months later. After “Life” comes “Human Planet,” a look at indigenous peoples and their relationship to their environment, and “Frozen Planet,” about the north and south poles. Discovery has not specified when it will show either series, but premieres in 2011 and 2012 are likely.In the United States the 11 hours of “Life” will be screened two hours at a time on Discovery on Sunday nights. For Discovery “it’s a great brand-definitional show,” said David M. Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery Communications, the channel’s parent company.The first two episodes will be shown simultaneously on seven of the company’s channels, in an effort to promote the other installments of the series. After “Life” completes its run on Discovery, the episodes will be shown again in order on the Animal Planet channel.The company hopes that “Life” — which is narrated in the United States version by Oprah Winfrey — has the same impact as “Planet Earth,” called the most expensive nature documentary ever produced.Mr. Gunton is now starting work on a series about Africa. He said each of the series take “between three and five years to make.”The pressure placed on the cameramen to capture never-before-seen animal and plant behaviors makes them “very strange people, actually,” Mr. Gunton said.“They have the ability to chill and cope with long periods of boredom, yet when the moment comes, they have the ability to switch on instantly,” he said. “They’re like gunfighters.”'"
"'10-03-18,'1','Humans lived as roaming hunters and gatherers for most of their existence. Dr. Wayne believes that wolves began following hunter-gatherer bands to feed on the wounded prey, carcasses or other refuse. At some stage a group of wolves, who happened to be smaller and less threatening than most, developed a dependency on human groups, and may in return have provided a warning system.Several thousand years later, in the first settled communities that began to appear in the Middle East 15,000 years ago, people began intervening in the breeding patterns of their camp followers, turning them into the first proto-dogs. One of the features they selected was small size, continuing the downsizing of the wolf body plan. “I think a long history such as that would explain how a large carnivore, which can eat you, eventually became stably incorporated in human society,” Dr. Wayne said.The wolf DNA in the study was collected over many years by Dr. Wayne from wolf packs around the world. A colleague, Elaine Ostrander, gathered much of the dog DNA by persuading owners at dog shows to let her take a scraping of cells from inside the cheek. The dog genome has been decoded twice: scientists at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., have sequenced the boxer’s genome, and Craig Venter, a pioneer of DNA sequencing, has decoded his poodle’s genome.With these two genomes in hand, the Broad Institute designed a dog SNP chip, similar to those used to scan the human for genetic disease. SNPs, or “snips,” are sites of common variation along the DNA. Affymetrix, a SNP chip maker, manufactured the dog SNP chip for Dr. Wayne’s team, letting him have 1,000 chips free, though thereafter they cost $250 apiece. The dog SNP chip brought to light the close relationship between dogs and wolves in the Middle East and also the genetic relationship between various breeds.Dr. Wayne was surprised to find that all the herding dogs grouped together, as did all the sight hounds and the scent hounds, making a perfect match between dogs’ various functions and the branches on the genetic tree. “I thought there would be many ways to build a herding dog and that they’d come from all over the tree, but there are not,” Dr. Wayne said.His team has also used the dog SNP chip to scan for genes that show signatures of selection. One such favored dog gene has a human counterpart that has been implicated in Williams syndrome, where it causes exceptional gregariousness. Another two selected genes are involved in memory. Dogs, unlike wolves, are adept at taking cues from human body language, and the two genes could have something to do with this faculty, Dr. Wayne said.An earlier survey of dog origins, based on a small genetic element known as mitochondrial DNA, concluded that dogs had been domesticated, probably just once, in East Asia. The author of the survey, Peter Savolainen of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, said he was not convinced by the new report for several reasons, including that it did not sample dogs in East Asia from south of the Yangtze, the region where the diversity of mitochondrial DNA is highest. Also archaeologists in China have been less interested in distinguishing dog and wolf remains, he said.Two other experts on dog genetics, Carlos Driscoll and Stephen O’Brien, of the National Cancer Institute, said they believed that Dr. Wayne’s team had made a convincing case. “I think they have nailed the locale of dog domestication to the Middle East,” Dr. O’Brien said in an e-mail message from Siberia, where he is attending a tiger management workshop.Dog domestication and human settlement occurred at the same time, some 15,000 years ago, raising the possibility that dogs may have had a complex impact on the structure of human society. Dogs could have been the sentries that let hunter gatherers settle without fear of surprise attack. They may also have been the first major item of inherited wealth, preceding cattle, and so could have laid the foundations for the gradations of wealth and social hierarchy that differentiated settled groups from the egalitarianism of their hunter-gatherer predecessors. Notions of inheritance and ownership, Dr. Driscoll said, may have been prompted by the first dogs to permeate human society, laying an unexpected track from wolf to wealth.'"
"'10-03-18,'1','WHEN his father died in 2006, Allen Frechter thought that his work as executor of the estate would be fairly straightforward.But then he looked under the hood of his father’s firm, Plexi-Craft Quality Products, a manufacturer in New York City of acrylic furniture. Mr. Frechter’s father, George, had worked until the day before his death, at 86, and like many small-business owners, he had made no plans for what followed.Purchase orders were still handwritten. There was no list of best customers or products. There was no data and no way to analyze the company’s performance. So Mr. Frechter, 49, wound down his own home-improvement firm in Boston and started commuting to New York to run Plexi-Craft. He moved it to a cheaper location and had an employee spend 250 hours entering six years’ worth of customer data.Not only did the firm survive, but Mr. Frechter expects it to double its annual revenue to $5 million by 2012. But many are not so lucky. Business owners who do not form a succession plan create a time bomb that can not only destroy their companies but tear apart their families. “A lot of families fight and fight until the business is gone,” said Jim Clay, who heads the trusts and estates department at the law firm of Morrison Fenske & Sund in Minnetonka, Minn. “It eats up everyone’s inheritances.”Here are some suggestions to avoid a succession disaster:IDENTIFY YOUR SUCCESSORS Deciding which child or relative will sit in the corner office is often so emotional that it can stop succession planning before it starts. But it is the necessary first step. “You have to make an honest assessment of your children,” said Robert W. O’Hara, owner of O’Hara & Company, a financial planning firm in Chelmsford, Mass., that specializes in exit planning for entrepreneurs. “Don’t assume the next generation has the same skills.”Succession specialists advise business owners who can afford it to put their possible successors through rigorous outside analysis. Steve Swartz, a family-business consultant based in Minneapolis, has them answer career and management questionnaires and then sit for interviews and testing with industrial psychologists. Each candidate goes over the results with the psychologist to put together a skill-development plan.The advantage to creating a scientific and merit-based process, Mr. Swartz said, is that it not only finds the best job for each member of the next generation, it takes the emphasis off family politics like birth order and gender.Mr. Swartz recently finished this process with seven siblings and cousins who were vying to take over a family business and wound up choosing the new leader among themselves. “They decided one of the nephews should be C.E.O., not one of the children of the C.E.O,” Mr. Swartz said. “And they were quite pleased that this was evidence that they had relied on business criteria.”PREPARE THE NEW BOSS If a child or other relative expresses interest in taking over the family business, the owner should set up a formal system of hurdles to make sure the child gets the skills required of any other prospective manager.“Send your kids to work somewhere else for some time until they get a raise and promotion,” said Bernard H. Tenenbaum, the founder of China Cat Capital, a consulting firm in Princeton, N.J., focused on family-owned consumer products companies. “It gives them self-respect and brings fresh blood and ideas into the family business.”Before Jos Zamzow and Callie Zamzow Novak, a brother and sister in the fourth generation of family ownership, came to work at their family’s specialty products company, Dynamite Marketing of Meridian, Idaho, their father told them to work outside the business. The two spent about five years working in stock brokering, insurance sales and retail before they put in résumés at the family firm. “We took regular jobs at the company, jobs that we had to apply for,” said Jos Zamzow, who is 36 and now the vice president for manufacturing.“It wasn’t a foregone conclusion that they would have a place,” said their father, Jim Zamzow, 62. “Our family way has been that you have to earn your way in. I haven’t found there’s much value if you’re gifted something.”When a family has finally decided who will get the company’s reins, it can also avoid sibling power struggles by not passing on shares — especially voting ones — to children and other heirs who will not be directly involved in the business. Instead, they should receive houses, retirement accounts or life insurance.DEAL WITH CRUCIAL EMPLOYEES Often there is no family member who is interested in and capable of taking over the business. And even if there is one, tensions can drive out important nonfamily employees who feel overlooked. To ensure that a new leader does not lose top lieutenants, it can be smart to offer them a piece of the pie. Personality-based consultancies and similar firms can be particularly devastated when a top partner takes his clients elsewhere.In 2003, as Michael H. Bill Jr. was taking over MJ Insurance from his father, he brought in five top employees of the Indianapolis-based company as minority owners. He still owns 88 percent of the voting stock in the 130-employee company, which makes $23 million a year, but top employees now have a 30 percent nonvoting stake and 15 percent more is in a stock-buying program. “The goal,” said Mr. Bill, 42, “is to create a good platform for long-term succession beyond myself.”Keep in mind: If there are no family members or employees who are willing and able to take over the business, a sale may be the best option.COVER YOUR TAX EXPOSURE Until this year, a spouse could inherit a business tax-free, but any other relative had to pay up to 45 percent on any estate valued greater than $3.5 million (the estate tax lapsed at the end of 2009, and its extension is unresolved).To avoid a tax hit and keep the business in the hands of its partners, owners should have their business valued by a neutral source — to assign each owner’s share a dollar value — and then buy “key person” life and disability insurance policies on each partner. When a partner dies, this money is used to buy the stake from his or her spouse — who should be obligated to sell through a legal “buy/sell agreement” — and to pay estate taxes.In addition, the buy/sell agreement should cover how partners who leave through retirement or disputes will be paid. Mr. O’Hara of O’Hara & Company says a typical agreement spreads the payments over at least five years at the current prime rate — to avoid crippling the company because of a business dispute.There are other options. When the fifth-generation family owners of Schoedinger Funeral and Cremation Service, a chain of 11 funeral homes based in Columbus, Ohio, prepared a 15-year plan to pass on the company to the next generation, they used a mix of grantor retained annuity trusts and family limited partnerships.These accounting vehicles lower tax liabilities by letting a family discount the value of the shares and real estate being given, sometimes by more than 25 percent.When there are no heirs, family business owners who want to cash out without selling the firm to an outside buyer can set up an employee stock ownership plan.This kind of plan creates a market for the company where employees buy shares from the owner, thus giving the owner liquid wealth while keeping the company in employee control. These programs can cost up to $100,000 to set up, said Mr. O’Hara, and might not be appropriate for the smallest of firms.'"
"'10-03-18,'1','He also argued that the company’s financial organization was never as poor as described by members of President Obama’s automotive task force. Steven L. Rattner, the task force’s former adviser, wrote in Fortune magazine that G.M. had “the weakest finance operation any of us had ever seen in a major company.”“It’s not a situation where I’m having to rebuild the whole team from scratch,” Mr. Liddell said. “There’s some rebuilding to be done, but it’s not as bad as was characterized.”Mr. Liddell’s decision to move to Detroit from Seattle and work for a carmaker just out of bankruptcy surprised many in both the automotive and technology industries. He had already announced his plans to retire from Microsoft, where he was the chief financial officer, before agreeing last December to take the job at G.M., and was widely expected to take a job as a chief executive at an information technology company.Mr. Liddell, 51, said Wednesday that he first spoke with G.M.’s chief executive at that time, Fritz Henderson, in September. Mr. Henderson was ousted in December and succeeded by Mr. Whitacre, G.M.’s chairman.Mr. Liddell, who also holds the title of vice chairman at G.M., would not address speculation that he could become the company’s chief executive at some point. He said he was attracted to G.M. by the prospect of a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something that’s incredibly important and incredibly interesting.”A New Zealand native with an engineering degree and a master’s in philosophy, Mr. Liddell said he had “always loved cars” and drove a Ferrari to Microsoft’s offices each day. He said he read “every car magazine I can think of” and was working his way through driving every vehicle in G.M.’s lineup.“If I can be part of the team that helps the turnaround G.M., I think that’s something I can be incredibly proud of in 20 years,” Mr. Liddell said.“Compared to what else I was looking at, this was far and above the most interesting, challenging and important. What we’re doing here impacts the lives of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people.”'"
"'10-03-18,'1','Prices at the pump have increased in the last month because of rising demand and limited supply. Over all, energy prices fell 2.9 percent last month, which was offset somewhat by a 0.4 percent increase in food prices, including eggs, meat and fresh vegetables.A more closely watched measure that excludes volatile food and energy costs showed wholesale prices increased 0.1 percent.Compared with a year earlier, wholesale prices are up 4.4 percent, which economists consider elevated but not sufficient to sound an alarm about widespread inflation.Changes in producer prices often trickle down to the consumer level, though businesses have been reluctant to raise prices in the current economic environment as they compete for customers.“In subdued economic conditions, there just isn’t the demand to support higher prices,” said Paul Dales, an economist for Capital Economics in Toronto. “Companies have to cut prices to survive.”The Labor Department will release its barometer of consumer prices on Thursday. On Tuesday, the Fed held its regular meeting to set interest rates. In a statement, the central bank’s policy-setting committee suggested it was not concerned about inflation, though one member, Thomas M. Hoenig, dissented. He has expressed concern that the Fed was moving too slowly to restore higher interest rates and may set the stage for inflation.In its statement, the committee said, “With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.”Economists expect the Fed to keep rates low until the labor market and the broader economy show clear signs of improvement.Some argue that an extended period of low interest rates could usher in deflation, which occurs when weak demand causes prices to fall. Japan, for instance, is grappling with deflation concerns as it tries to emerge from a recession.But in the United States, concerns about deflation have subsided as the recovery has gained strength and demand has shown signs of rebounding. Still, Mr. Feroli warned, “I think we may be jumping the gun — we collectively, meaning economists and policy makers — in declaring deflation risks over.”Other economists believe that a healthy recovery will come only when inflation is more pronounced in the United States, and that central banks have set their target inflation rates too low.'"
"'10-03-18,'1','“There really isn’t a reason to sell here,” said William J. Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates. “You’re not seeing robust outright buying, but you are seeing some nibbling. There is a growing sense that it’s time to commit a little more to the market.”Building on the momentum, a report showed inflation in the United States remained tame in February despite an extended period of extremely low interest rates. Policy makers have kept rates at record lows in an effort to jump-start lending, but some economists remain concerned about upward pressure on prices.Trading was lighter than usual, stirring doubts about the sustainability of the momentum. But several analysts said they were reassured by the advance in the absence of conclusive economic data.Health care stocks posted only a slight gain as Congress moved closer to some type of action on legislation to overhaul the country’s health care system.A rise in commodities helped build the appetite for risk. The price of oil continued to increase, climbing 1.2 percent, to $82.93 a barrel, as producers decided to keep production levels unchanged for now. Copper gained nearly 2 percent.Ford’s stock surged more than 4.5 percent after the company’s debt was upgraded by Moody’s. The company became the No. 1 automaker in the United States in February, with sales rising 43 percent.Analysts said the market might need conclusive signs that the recovery was under way to sustain a move upward. With the S.& P. 500 now more than 70 percent above its levels a year ago, and the Dow approaching 11,000 points, some investors say they believe that the market’s exuberance may not reflect the reality of a halting recovery.“The equity market is three parts perception and one part reality,” said David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff, an investment firm. “It’s extremely hard to believe that zero percent interest rates can engineer positive sentiment on an ongoing basis. It’s really going to come down to how the economy and how earnings end up performing.”Investors will get a better sense of whether the tide has turned in the American labor market when the government releases its monthly employment snapshot. The jobless rate remains at 9.7 percent, and the economy continues to shed jobs each month.Interest rates were steady on Wednesday. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note increased 4/32, to 99 29/32, and the yield fell to 3.64 percent, from 3.65 percent late Tuesday.'"

Standing in front of one of Ms. Gurnee’s square canvases bearing thinly painted layers of nonrepresentational forms — spacey veils of muted color; translucent, bubblelike circles and ovals; and small, deftly brushed glyphic signs — you should “let the image’s vibrations contact you.”If you thus submit, they will activate patterns in your brain that Ms. Gurnee calls “fulgent cadences.” There are seven fulgent cadences, and different forms in the paintings switch on different ones. This experience is supposed to improve people’s decision-making processes by integrating diverse functions of consciousness.Whether the paintings are actually effective in the way Ms. Gurnee intends is hard to say. I tried to follow the instructions, but I didn’t experience any unusual changes in consciousness. The instructions say that you might not feel anything, though it is not clear whether this means that they are working anyway. Maybe only a brain scan would prove anything.The idea that art can have a direct therapeutic effect on the mind is not novel. Kandinsky, whose paintings Ms. Gurnee’s bring to mind, toyed with such magical thinking. Emma Kunz drew mandalas for psycho-spiritual healing.Ms. Gurnee’s paintings are appealing as semi-abstract cosmic vistas, but they don’t have the vibe that really out-there visionary art delivers. It is nonetheless refreshing to encounter a project animated by purposes so foreign to those of mainstream contemporary art.'"
"'10-03-19,'0','Long gone are the days cows and horses roamed amid a handful of academic buildings on the pastoral campus. Oakland was founded in 1957 as a public satellite honors college called Michigan State University-Oakland, on the expansive estate of auto and lumber baroness Matilda Dodge Wilson.Oakland embarked on a growth spurt under Russi, adding an athletic complex, new buildings and housing, and most recently, a medical school. The school has nearly doubled in size in the past decade and how has 19,000 students.Officials said a big jump in that number came after Oakland made its first N.C.A.A. tournament in 2005, after it dramatically won its conference tournament (then called the Mid-Continent Conference) when a 3-pointer by Pierre Dukes beat Oral Roberts, 61-60. The Grizzlies were 12-18, but they won the play-in game over Alabama A&M to earn the right to get crushed by No. 1 North Carolina, the eventual tournament champion, 96-68, in the first round.The result, university officials say, was more than $100,000 in unsolicited donations and a 10 percent surge in student applications in 2005-6. The longtime coach Greg Kampe, whose teams were proven winners in Division II, had a much more seductive recruiting pitch. He returns to the N.C.A.A. field with a far more talented team this time.The hotly debated jump to Division I, starting with the 1997-98 season, spawned doubts that Oakland could compete in a local marketplace crowded with powerhouses Michigan State and Michigan, along with established midmajor programs like Toledo and Detroit-Mercy.“I had one person, from our previous conference, tell me to my face that we shouldn’t expect to come crawling back when our trip to Division I fails,” Kampe said. “We’re not ever crawling back. This proves we belong as one of the up-and-coming midmajors. We want to be the next Gonzaga or George Mason. The next step for us is to be back in the tournament every year, and I can see that happening because we are starting to get those kids you need to reach the postseason.“We need to prove we’re not a fluke, and I think that’s going to bear itself out. Being back in the tournament, this way with a strong team, says a lot about where we are at.”The senior guard Johnathon Jones, of Okemos, Mich., came to Oakland because he saw how the 2005 N.C.A.A. experience changed the program, the campus, and how the team is perceived.“Nobody questions why I came here anymore; they can see why: we’re winning, selling out our games, we’re going somewhere,” said Jones, who is third in the nation in assists with 6.4 per game. “We believe. We set as one of our goals before the season to reach the Sweet Sixteen. Why not?”The senior forward Derick Nelson, of Lansing, Mich., also sees the momentum.“I don’t think people are surprised we are doing well, because we don’t hide from anybody,” Nelson said. “We know if we want to be the best, we have to play the best. We’re not afraid of anything now.”Oakland played a tough schedule, including road games against No. 1 seeds Syracuse and Kansas. The tournament-bound teams Wisconsin and Michigan State were also on the schedule.Oakland suffered blowout losses to all of them, but saw dividends later in the season and ended up with a solid ratings percentage index, ranking 51st. The Grizzlies have won 11 games in a row, took the regular-season conference title, and played commandingly in the league tournament.But it is the little things, like a random supermarket encounter, that reveal the power of an N.C.A.A. tournament bid.Kampe, fresh off the Summit League victory, had mentioned in a television interview that he had not gotten much sleep. He was grocery shopping a few days later when an elderly lady, hunched over her shopping cart, stopped and made eye contact with him.“You getting some sleep now?” the unfamiliar lady asked Kampe.He smiled, realizing what she was referencing.She nodded, and slowly walked away.Oakland, and its basketball team, are no longer anonymous.'"

"'10-03-19,'0','The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Thursday that it had expelled Provident Asset Management from the industry as part of a broader investigation into sales by brokers of unsuitable or fraudulent investments to retail customers.Provident is among “more than a dozen” firms the regulator is investigating, said James Shorris, the official overseeing the enforcement task force. Provident, based in Dallas, sold private placement offerings on behalf of an affiliate that was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in July on accusations that it was operating a Ponzi scheme, the organization, called Finra, said in a statement.“We’re looking at a large number of firms, driven in part by offerings we know are troublesome,” Mr. Shorris said in an interview. “The threshold questions the firm is supposed to ask are, ‘Do I understand what this investment is all about, and is it suitable for anybody?’ ”Finra, which started the investigation in response to a jump in investor complaints, is mining arbitration records and advertisements promising “unrealistically high” returns, Mr. Shorris said. Investigators are focusing on brokers who knowingly lured customers to frauds, as well as those who sold products they did not understand, he said.Finra’s investigation may also extend to so-called blind pools, in which investors back a management team without having a say in specific investments, Mr. Shorris said. Finra, which oversees almost 5,000 brokerage firms, is investigating other firms that sold Provident investments, the statement said.Provident was the wholesale brokerage firm for Provident Royalties and sold its offerings to customers through more than 50 retail brokerage firms across the United States, raising more than $480 million, Finra said.'"
"'10-03-19,'0','In fact, the technology caused a number of mechanical accidents when it was used in Soviet submarines from the 1970s until the early 1990s.Kirill Danilenko, the director of the Russian company, Akme Engineering, said that the technology could be made safe, with no greater risk of meltdown than that at a larger nuclear plant. His vision is that small reactors will become so common that utilities can connect them and “build power plants like Lego sets.”The promise of miniature reactors powering homes, offices and schools is still years from being realized. The first Russian design, a pontoon-mounted reactor intended to be floated into harbors in energy-hungry developing countries, is already being built. But most promoters expect small reactors to come online at the end of this decade.The plans are going ahead in Russia and elsewhere in the face of criticism that a diffuse nuclear infrastructure — the idea that many midsize cities, for example, could have their own small reactor — is inherently risky.But once the science is perfected, such reactors are potentially far cheaper to build for every unit of electricity generated than traditional nuclear power plants.This is no small matter as capital expenses are the largest cost for nuclear power, making it more competitive with coal.Around the world, much of the nuclear industry is embracing the tried-and-true economics of serial production. In serial production, reactor cores, like Ford cars, would be rolled off an assembly line, then shipped to the site of a plant. They could be used separately or as modules for a more powerful generator. This would be possible, however, only if a reactor were small enough to fit on a railroad car.American companies are promoting nine designs for small reactors, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group in Washington. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna group overseeing civilian nuclear power, has estimated global demand for small nuclear reactors could reach 500 to 1,000 reactors by 2040.The category is defined as reactors making less than 300 megawatts of electricity, or the amount needed to power 300,000 American homes. That is roughly a quarter of the energy output of big reactors.Small reactors have other advantages, too. They would fit the existing steam-generating equipment in old coal plants, for instance, making it easier to put nuclear facilities in current coal-burning energy plants. And small reactors have at least one nonproliferation benefit over their larger cousins: they can be loaded with fuel in the factory, reducing the need to ship fuel separately.Some models are tiny. One, for example, would be small enough to fit into a shipping container and would be trucked from site to site, like a diesel generator, except that it would need to be refueled only once every seven years or so.Proponents point out that Russian nuclear regulators and the United States Department of Energy have both endorsed small reactors. In America, companies with designs include Westinghouse, the maker of traditional reactors; Babcock & Wilcox, a maker of submarine reactors for the Navy; and NuScale, a start-up that spun out of an Oregon State University research project.The Russian company, Akme, is an acronym for atomic complex for small and medium energy and sometimes renders its name in English as Acme.Akme’s goal is to produce a prototype of a 100-megawatt nuclear reactor small enough to fit into a typical American backyard by 2019.The company was founded in December as a joint venture of Rosatom, the state nuclear power corporation, and a private electricity company owned by the Kremlin-connected oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska. It has $500 million in start-up capital.A minireactor will likely cost about $100 million.The design Akme chose is peculiar because it is cooled with a molten lead alloy, not water. In fact, the Soviet Union was the only nation to deploy liquid metal reactors at sea. Introduced in the 1970s, they packed enough power to propel submarines more than 45 miles per hour underwater. In fact, they were so powerful they compelled NATO to design an entirely new class of torpedo.But this cold war design is not without its drawbacks. The Bellona Foundation, a Norwegian environmental group and authority on nuclear waste in the Arctic, says the lead alloy coolant tended to freeze when the reactor had to be shut down in emergencies. That turned the reactor into an inaccessible block of lead, steel and waste.The group documented an accidental freezing of the core on one submarine, K-123, in the early 1980s after an emergency shutdown in the Kara Sea. The vessel limped back to base. The only way to repair it, though, was to remove the reactor segment, a job that took nine years. (The former Russian naval captain working for Bellona who revealed these and other details of reactor failures in a report in the 1990s was put on trial for revealing state secrets.)Today, hardened liquid-metal reactor cores litter the Arctic. While small, they still weigh hundreds of tons. No facility exists to melt out the lead alloy, which is itself lethally toxic, and extract the spent fuel rods. They remain an unsolved legacy of the Soviet submarine program; several are stored at a naval yard in Gremikha, on the Arctic Sea near Norway, according to Bellona.The product can hardly be called green, Igor Kudrik, a researcher at Bellona, said in a telephone interview.The Russian nuclear industry, in its eagerness to capitalize on the booming global demand for nuclear power, including new applications like small reactors, has dusted off unsafe designs, Mr. Kudrik said. “They haven’t come up with anything new,” he said.A spokeswoman for Akme said the company could not comment on military waste. Company officials said the commercial design would have to compete on safety, as well as economics, and that passive safety features would be built into the product. Anna Kudryavtseva, a vice president, said the nonmilitary version of the liquid-metal reactor would be “maximally safe even in not very capable hands.”'"
"'10-03-19,'0','But economists, lawyers and policy makers are uncertain about how to handle the problem in a way that is sufficiently credible so as to deter the kinds of risk-taking that brought the financial system to the brink of disaster.“In light of what has happened over the past two years, it is imperative that governments convince markets that they can and will put large financial firms into a resolution process rather than bail out its creditors and shareholders,” Mr. Tarullo said on Thursday night in a speech in Armonk, N.Y. “Yet no one can guarantee that future resolutions of systemically important firms will proceed smoothly or predictably.”Mr. Summers, who said that an overhaul of financial rules was a priority of the Obama administration, described “resolution authority” as one of six major goals the legislation should achieve.“It is wrong that taxpayers thousands of miles from Wall Street should be at risk because our financial system gives authorities no choice but to commit taxpayer money or to accept collapse and chaos,” Mr. Summers said. “Without the prospect of failure, it is difficult to contemplate the application of market discipline.”He added: “That is why we must develop a means to manage the failure of financial institutions. That is why we must insist that institutions go through the exercise of planning for their dissolution in the event of crisis before a crisis comes. Our financial system will not be fail-safe until it is safe for failure.”The 44-page final report of the Cross-Border Bank Resolution Group of the Basel Committee called for “firm-specific contingency planning” that would help the most interconnected financial companies survive a crisis or, if necessary, be dismantled in an orderly fashion, without risking a global financial crisis.Nout Wellink, the president of the Dutch central bank and the chairman of the Basel Committee, said its recommendations made “meaningful progress toward addressing systemic risk and the ‘too big to fail’ problem.”But as Mr. Tarullo said on Thursday, the goals of financial stability and market discipline are sometimes in tension.The issue does not easily lend itself to partisan divisions: it was under President George W. Bush, a Republican, that the federal government, fearing a financial panic after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, swooped in to rescue some giant financial companies.Even so, there have been some differences.Democrats have been inclined to have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has a long history of arranging bank failures, play a similar role for large financial institutions, and they would like to see large banks pay into a fund that would be used to liquidate a failing company.Republicans would like large financial companies to go through normal bankruptcy proceedings as much as possible, and they fear that a fund would symbolize a standing, if implicit, offer of a government bailout.The two members of the Senate Banking Committee who have been working most closely on the issue, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said on Thursday that they were in broad agreement on how the “resolution authority” should work, even if points of dispute remained.Resolution should be a “last resort” and “so painful that no rational management team” would ever prefer it to bankruptcy, Mr. Warner said in a talk at the National Press Club.Mr. Summers, who spoke before Mr. Warner and Mr. Corker, called for higher capital and liquidity requirements for banks, as well as strengthened regulation, a fee on the largest and most leveraged firms, and restrictions on risk-taking by banks.'"
"'10-03-19,'0','BEIJING — China’s reluctance to allow the value of its currency to rise “is a real concern” to both the United States and the country’s other major trading partners and could be subject to negotiations in coming weeks, the American ambassador to China said on Thursday.At the same time, a Chinese trade official offered the first hint of flexibility on the issue, saying his organization was polling more than a thousand Chinese manufacturers on how a change in exchange rates would affect their business.In a speech to students at Tsinghua University in Beijing, the ambassador, Jon Huntsman, said that economic problems in the United States had increased pressure there for a change in the value of the renminbi, which China currently ties to the value of the dollar. That has kept Chinese exports comparatively cheap and, some contend, hampered other nations’ recovery from the global recession.“My Chinese friends like to pitch this as just an American issue. I like to say that there are many countries that feel the same way,” Mr. Huntsman said. But he focused on the growing political opposition from Americans who say the currency policy is hurting them.“This is a real concern to people in my country. Unemployment is almost 10 percent. It’s a difficult economic period,” he said. “I’d be misleading you if I left you with the impression that this wasn’t a very, very important issue in the United States, and will continue to be.”'"
"'10-03-19,'0','So far this year, about $22 billion has been raised with public offerings in Asia. That is up from about $440 million during the first quarter of last year but drastically down from the $42 billion raised during the last three months of 2009, according to Dealogic, a research firm.“Last year, from around May to November, the market was strong, and investors were snapping up everything,” said Kester Ng, head of Asia equity capital and derivatives markets at J.P. Morgan Securities in Hong Kong. “This year is more volatile.”One recent victim of the changed mood was Zhongsheng, a Chinese car parts dealer that had hoped to raise $1 billion but delayed its offer and now looks set to raise only about half that.The performance of public offerings globally has been mixed at best. Shares of the Russian aluminum company Rusal, one of the most prominent debuts in Hong Kong this year, are now trading at about 8.7 Hong Kong dollars ($1.12), well below the 10.8 Hong Kong dollars at which they were priced in January.Huatai Securities, which raised $2.3 billion in Shanghai last month, is hovering about 11 percent above its starting price — a modest showing in the mainland Chinese market, where new issues were, in more buoyant times, often heavily oversubscribed and frequently more than doubled in price upon debut.The fact that shares no longer increase sharply when they hit the market is, to some extent, a sign that investors are behaving more soberly.Outside of Asia, many new listings have been pared. This week, the shipbuilder OSX Brasil sharply lowered the number of shares it would sell and their price.“Investors will watch pricing very closely, and are being very selective,” said Ashok Pandit, co-head of Equity Capital Markets for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank. “Expectations on the side of the issuer have to match those on the buy side, and the market is going through a process of finding that match.”Still, some of the issues, like Dai-Ichi, will generate large fees for the banks that advise on the deals. In South Korea, Samsung Life Insurance is expected to raise about $4 billion in May. And if the Chinese authorities allow foreign companies to list their shares in Shanghai, there could be big secondary listings from banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered.There will be many smaller deals as well.“There will be plenty of midsize deals by companies whose name may not be recognized by non-China followers raising $1 billion or $2 billion,” said Simon Aird, co-head of equity capital markets syndicate for Credit Suisse in Asia.In mainland China, investors are largely restricted from investing overseas. This means that the local property and stock markets are the only places for them to put their savings, ensuring that share issues always find plenty of takers.Mr. Pandit said funds in Asia had more cash than ever to invest. The region was spared the worst of the global economic crisis, and, with the main exception of Japan, is recovering rapidly. Its growing population, while becoming more consumerist, still has a high savings rate, meaning steadily rising flows of money into insurance and pension funds.“It’s a bit early to say, but I’m fairly optimistic that 2010 will be as strong as last year,” he said. “I think the historical data show that Asia can absorb more issuance than in 2009.”'"
"'10-03-19,'0','The FedEx Corporation raised its fiscal-year outlook on Thursday after quarterly profit more than doubled, with strong Asian export volumes more than compensating for flat domestic demand.Led by exports from Asia, FedEx reported an 18 percent jump in volume from its International Priority business. But average daily domestic package volume rose just 1 percent, reflecting the weak American economy.FedEx and its larger rival, United Parcel Service, tend to do their best at the beginning of a recovery, analysts said.FedEx raised its 2010 earnings forecast to a range of $3.60 to $3.80 a share from a previous outlook of $3.45 to $3.75. Analysts on average expected $3.64, according to Thomson Reuters.The company said profit for the third quarter, which ended Feb. 28, rose to $239 million, or 76 cents a share, from $97 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. That bested the analysts’ average estimate of 72 cents a share.'"
"'10-03-19,'0','Jim Black, the drummer and de facto leader of Pachora, was a force in constant motion at Rose Live Music in Brooklyn on Wednesday night. The hummingbird churn of his fingers on a dumbek, or goblet drum, was punctuated by an array of passing textures: the startled cough of a cymbal grasped in midcrash, or the hurried rustle of a shaker, or the deadening whomp of a detuned floor tom. Mr. Black, with his busy amalgam of Balkan and Middle Eastern rhythms, was working in a mode both familiar and dated. “We’re Pachora. We’re from the ’90s,” he said cheerily at the start of the band’s first set.Rose Live Music has lately been presenting a series of drummer-led bands: a fine idea, if not quite a necessary corrective for the New York jazz calendar. (This week in Manhattan the venerable drummer Roy Haynes holds court at the Blue Note; Lewis Nash, a worthy inheritor, is running the bandstand at Birdland.) The series inclusion of Pachora, a band once synonymous with the avidly cross-cultural downtown scene of the Clinton era, doubled as an event booking of its own, at least among a certain crowd.Technically, Pachora — Mr. Black, the clarinetist Chris Speed, the guitarist Brad Shepik and the bassist Skuli Sverrisson — never disbanded. But the group released its fourth and most recent album, “Astereotypical” (Winter & Winter) in 2003, and has since been a sporadic concern, though its members still work together in other bands.Mr. Speed and Mr. Shepik articulated most of the set’s melodies in tandem, flighty and fast, with notes spilling over from one phrase to the next. “Freaky Person,” the opening track on “Astereotypical,” deployed them in close synchronized harmony, over a dartlike, asymmetrical groove.In their solos each took a liberated approach to rhythm, moving in and out of the gravitational pull of the music. And each sought an incantatory approach with his phrasing, sliding between pitches like a devotional singer: Mr. Speed, with his microtonal scrawl, no less than Mr. Shepik, playing an eight-string tambura.The musicians upheld a relaxed chemistry, managing to make their capricious music feel almost roomy. And on the set closer, “Dratch,” from the 1999 album “Unn” (Knitting Factory), they summoned a bygone urgency. At one point in the ebullient chorus, as Mr. Black verged on rushing the beat, the notion of folkloric improv felt radical and new again, like a cause worth rallying around.'"
"'10-03-19,'0','The Universal Music Group, the world’s largest music company, announced plans on Thursday to test broadly whether lower prices — $10 or less — on new CDs will attract consumers who have cut back on buying CDs in recent years.The trial, which is to start in the next few months and extend through most of 2010, will include a sample of the label’s new releases and involve most of the country’s major retailers, including Best Buy and Wal-Mart, the company said.Deluxe versions of albums, which have extra songs or features, will continue to sell at a higher price.Jim Urie, the head of distribution at Universal, said CD sales had doubled at stores involved in a much more limited test of the pricing strategy. For the last nine months, Universal has worked with Trans World Entertainment, which set the lower prices at as many as 100 of its F.Y.E. stores.Some of the details of the plan were first reported on Thursday by Billboard.“It seems pretty obvious to us that a dedicated fan will gladly pay for extra content, for deluxe versions,” Mr. Urie said. “But the casual fan isn’t willing to pay $15 dollars for a regular CD.”'"
"'10-03-19,'0','WASHINGTON — Love it or hate it, one thing that is indisputable about the Democrats’ big health care legislation is that the cost figures are going to come out right where President Obama said he wanted them.When the president finally came forward with an outline of his own proposal, aimed at bridging differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation, he said it would have a 10-year price tag of about $950 billion and would reduce federal deficits over that same time period by more than $100 billion.A preliminary cost estimate of the final legislation, released by the Congressional Budget Office on Thursday, showed that the president got almost exactly what he wanted: a $940 billion price tag for the new insurance coverage provisions in the bill, and the reduction of future federal deficits of $138 billion over 10 years.So how did the numbers come out just right? Not by accident.Congressional Democrats have spent more than a year working with the nonpartisan budget office on the health care legislation, and as they fine-tuned many of the bill’s various provisions in recent weeks, they consulted repeatedly with its number-crunchers and the bipartisan staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.In other words, the overall numbers were never going to miss the mark. Whenever the budget office judged that some element or elements of the bill would cause a problem meeting the cost and deficit-reduction targets, Democrats just adjusted the underlying legislation to make sure it would hit their goal.Many House Democrats strongly disliked the Senate’s proposed excise tax on high-cost, employer-sponsored insurance policies. In the Senate-passed bill, that provision would have raised $150 billion over 10 years. Mr. Obama and White House officials reached a deal with organized labor groups to delay the implementation and limit the impact of that tax. As a result, the excise tax will raise only $32 billion over 10 years, according to the budget office.Of course, that meant coming up with $118 billion more elsewhere to plug the hole. Not a problem: to help make up the difference Democrats adjusted a proposed increase in the Medicare payroll tax for individuals earning more than $200,000 a year and couples earning more than $250,000. The tax will now apply to “unearned income” like dividends and interest.There were other tweaks. The final bill imposes an additional $16 billion in cuts to private Medicare Advantage plans, which now cost the government more on average than traditional Medicare, for a total of $132 billion in reductions.As Democrats put together the final legislation, they were focused on dual objectives.One goal was to keep the overall price tag at roughly $950 billion over 10 years and to make sure that the legislation would reduce future deficits by more than $100 billion.The other, even more crucial goal in recent weeks, was to meet the requirements of budget reconciliation rules, which mandated specific savings over five years through changes in laws under the jurisdiction of different Congressional committees.Think about it this way: Building the health care legislation was not some wild shopping spree in Macy’s, running through the store grabbing whatever looked nice off the racks and then heading to the cash register with credit card and a bunch of coupons in hand, only to let the cash register render its verdict.Rather, it was more like a trip to the local fruit stand with a set amount of money in hand, and every item clearly marked with a price per pound. The precise mix of apples, oranges, pears and grapes could be adjusted — a little more of this, or a little less of that — so there would be just the right amount of ingredients to make a fruit salad, without blowing the budget.By the end of the legislative process, Democrats had gone through the various provisions of the legislation so thoroughly that they had a pretty good idea of what would happen to the price tag every time they made an adjustment — rather like being able to guess the cost of a bag of apples just by holding it.Things did not start out that way. Last spring, Democrats were left scrambling, after early versions of the legislation showed steep costs and limited results. An early analysis of the Senate Finance Committee put the 10-year cost at $1.6 trillion — far more than Democrats ever wanted to spend. Another early tally, of the Senate health committee’s bill, put the cost at $1 trillion over 10 years, but said the bill would reduce the number of uninsured by just 16 million — a major shortfall.At times, all the back and forth left lawmakers frustrated as they waited for the budget office to provide answers. At one point, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, declared, “That’s what it’s going to say on my tombstone: ‘He was waiting for C.B.O.’ ”'"
"'10-03-19,'0','It was filed at the height of tensions between Google and media companies over copyrights — tensions that have since eased substantially. YouTube, which is by far the Web’s largest video site, has set up an automated system to detect infringing videos and signed revenue-sharing agreements with more than a thousand media companies.But more broadly, media companies remain wary of losing control as more of their products become digital, making them easier to copy.As part of their motions for summary judgment in the case, both sides released hundreds of pages of documents and exhibits on Thursday, including internal documents obtained through the discovery process.Among them were scores of e-mail messages from YouTube’s founders — Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim — discussing what to do about clips uploaded to YouTube that clearly belonged to major studios or television networks.In a 2005 e-mail message to Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital, YouTube’s major outside investor, Mr. Chen described a system that the company had put in place for users to flag copyrighted and pornographic content: “That way, the perception is that we are concerned about this type of material and we’re actively monitoring it.”Mr. Chen goes on to acknowledge that much of the infringing material will remain on the site, but that users won’t be able to easily stumble upon it.Google countered that the message was truncated and taken out of context, and that it merely suggested that YouTube was serious about policing its site for copyrighted content.One e-mail message revealed that even as YouTube’s founders were discussing how to deal with copyrighted clips, one of them was uploading such material.In July 2005, Mr. Chen wrote: “Jawed, please stop putting stolen videos on the site. We’re going to have a tough time defending the fact that we’re not liable for the copyrighted material on the site because we didn’t put it up when one of the co-founders is blatantly stealing content from other sites and trying to get everyone to see it.” Google said that message referred to “viral videos,” not pirated media content.In another e-mail message from January 2006, a Google executive refers to a conversation with Mr. Hurley and another YouTube executive about copyrights, and compares YouTube with the much less popular Google Video service.“YouTube is at an advantage b/c they aren’t the target that we are with issues like this. They are aware of this (I spoke with them on Friday) and they plan on exploiting this in order to get more and more traffic.”In its brief, Google pointed to internal Viacom documents in which executives discussed buying YouTube and described it primarily as a place for user-created videos, not a haven for pirated content as they assert in the suit.“Consumption of ‘branded’ content on YT is relatively low,” an executive wrote in an internal presentation from July 2006.Google also said Viacom filed the suit only when its negotiations over a partnership agreement with YouTube ended after Google bought the site. It said the suit was part of a push to get better licensing terms for its content.Google said Viacom used various methods to cover its tracks when uploading videos to YouTube. It hired outside marketing agents, used e-mail addresses that couldn’t be traced to Viacom when registering accounts and uploaded videos from places like Kinko’s, rather than from company computers, Google said.In one e-mail exchange, employees of the MTV unit of Viacom discussed how to alter a clip they were uploading so it would appear to be unauthorized, presumably because that might generate more interest in it online. “The goal is to make it look ‘hijacked,’ ” one employee wrote.“Viacom’s efforts to hide the source of the content it caused to be posted on YouTube were too good,” Google said in its filing, adding that “Viacom and its lawyers were unable to recognize that dozens of the clips alleged as infringements in this case were uploaded to YouTube with Viacom’s express authorization.”Given Viacom’s tactics, Google argued that it would have been impossible for its employees to know which videos were uploaded without permission. One of Google’s central defenses is that YouTube always complied with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act by promptly taking down videos whenever a copyright owner said they had been uploaded without permission.The Viacom filing suggests that as Google was trying to compete with YouTube in early 2006, executives at the highest levels of Google debated whether to emulate YouTube’s more lax approach to copyright.“Is changing our policy to increase traffic knowing before that we’ll profit from illegal downloads how we want to conduct business? Is this Googley?” asked David Eun, then a vice president for content partnerships.The filings suggest that Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive, supported a more liberal copyright policy for Google Video, while Sergey Brin, a co-founder, opposed it.At one point, a Google Video executive recoiled at the notion that Google would buy YouTube: “I can’t believe you’re recommending buying YouTube... they’re 80% illegal pirated content.” Google bought YouTube six months later.While most media companies are no longer fighting with YouTube, some of the biggest still view it as a rival. Despite a multitude of content deals, YouTube has struggled to build a large database of full-length television shows and movies. And it faces rising competition for that kind of content from sites like Hulu, a joint venture between NBC Universal, Fox and ABC.'"
"'10-03-19,'0','The price of consumer goods held steady in February, the government reported Thursday, the latest sign that near-zero interest rates and billions of dollars in stimulus money had yet to set off inflation.Prices showed no movement over all last month, the Labor Department said, but when volatile food and fuel costs were excluded, costs as measured by the Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent.The index also indicated that the price of cars rose last month, with used vehicles rising 0.7 percent and new vehicles climbing by 0.4 percent. Medical care costs increased 0.5 percent, and food prices rose 0.1 percent. But the increases were offset by a 0.5 percent drop in energy costs, tied to a drop in gasoline prices.As the United States tries to emerge from a deep downturn, the stability in prices offered reassurance that the government’s efforts to stimulate the economy had not yet spurred inflation. The Federal Reserve has set a target inflation rate near 2 percent, and since February 2009, prices have increased 1.3 percent, excluding food and fuel.“There is absolutely no rationale for any premature tightening by the Fed in this environment,” said Brian A. Bethune, chief financial economist for IHS Global Insight. “This report is a checkered flag for low interest rates.”A snapshot of wholesale costs on Wednesday offered a similar message: the Producer Price Index dropped 0.6 percent in February and was virtually unchanged when food and fuel costs were excluded.'"
"'10-03-19,'0','In late November, North Korea suddenly told its people that it would introduce new banknotes, ordering them to turn in their old bills for new ones at a rate of 100 to 1. It also put a cap on how much old money they could swap for the new currency.The shock measure was meant to arrest runaway inflation and crack down on illegal markets in the socialist state. But it only aggravated the food crisis, creating shortages and soaring prices, and reportedly led to isolated but highly unusual outbursts of protest in the totalitarian state.South Korea said it could not confirm the reports about Mr. Pak’s execution. Mr. Kim often keeps personnel reshuffles secret, and party officials who have disappeared from official functions and been reported to be dead in the South Korean news media have often resurfaced years later in new jobs.“It’s unusual that Mr. Pak has not been seen in public for two months, and there is speculation about his fate,” said Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman at the Unification Ministry in Seoul. “But we don’t have any information about whether he was sacked, arrested or executed by firing squad.”Until Jan. 9, Mr. Pak’s name appeared regularly in the list of officials the North Korean news media reported as accompanying Mr. Kim on inspection tours of factories, farms and military units. Names on the list offer guidance about who is in favor in the North Korean hierarchy.The failed currency reform threatened Mr. Kim’s main policy goal, which was to create at least an impression that its moribund economy would revive by 2012. That is when he is expected to announce one of his three known sons — most likely, according to observers, his youngest son, Jung-un — as his official heir.“The North Korean authorities have tried to reverse their currency policy failure, but they don’t seem to know how,” said Lee Seung-yong, an official at Good Friends, a relief group based in Seoul that collects information from sources within the North. “We have reports that the food situation is getting worse and some people are dying of hunger.”As its state-run stores failed to provide enough food, North Korea recently reversed itself and began turning a blind eye to private markets to resuscitate food supplies. But the markets remain empty, Mr. Lee said. With prices expected to continue to soar, those who have goods are not returning to the markets, he said.Reports that Mr. Pak was executed or arrested were also carried by Daily NK and Free North Korea Radio, both Web sites based in Seoul that rely on informants from North Korea.Park Sang-hak, a North Korean defector and head of a Seoul-based advocacy group, Fighters for Free North Korea, said that his informants in North Korea had heard “rumors” that Mr. Pak was either executed or sent to a prison camp. “But so far, our sources haven’t found anyone who says he actually saw this execution,” Mr. Park said.Ha Tae-keung, head of Open Radio for North Korea, which also gathers news from North Korea, agreed.“If they executed him to quell public anger, he must have been executed in public and thousands must have been mobilized to watch it,” Mr. Ha said.North Korea publicly executed Seo Gwan-hee, a party secretary in charge of agriculture, on spying charges in 1997 when a famine decimated the population, according to defectors. But Mr. Kim also banishes confidants embroiled in corruption or policy blunders to remote areas as warnings, only to reinstate them years later, Mr. Park said.'"

"'10-03-20,'0','“It was a gift,” Mr. Newman said. “As you all understand: a gift, it becomes yours.”But like many things in the legal world, state law on campaign contributions is vague, several election law experts said, and there is no clear answer as to what restrictions there are on using personal gifts toward a campaign war chest.On the one hand, experts said, state election law defines a contribution as a gift made in connection with an election. The law also says that contributions must be listed in the name of the actual contributor, experts said. And so if Mr. Rubenstein admits to giving Judge Anderson a gift to be used for her campaign, it would be a contribution, some experts said.On the other hand, the defense could argue that the defendants are not charged with making illegal contributions or gifts, rather with incorrectly identifying the source of money on campaign finance filings. But by the nature of gift giving and loans, the money did actually belong to Judge Anderson, the defense has said.Henry T. Berger, an election lawyer, said the law left room for arguments on both sides.“If it was a true, unrestricted gift from Seth Rubenstein to Nora Anderson that she could use for any purpose, then why can’t she use it for her campaign?” he said. “Clearly, it was a gift to her contemplated to be used for the campaign. When the election law included the word ‘gift’ in the definition of contribution, isn’t this the kind of thing they were contemplating?”The case could set important precedents for campaign financing, experts said. Many people are already calling for campaign finance reform because the laws are more than 30 years old and vague, they said.“If it’s determined that this type of gift is not a contribution, I think that may light a fire in Albany to finally do something on campaign finance reform,” said an election lawyer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was still pending.Mr. Newman also contended in his opening statement that members of Judge Anderson’s campaign committee were the ones who prepared, signed and filed the disclosure reports, and so she was not the one responsible for potential errors in them. The transactions between Judge Anderson and Mr. Rubenstein, who face up to four years in prison if convicted, were well documented, Mr. Newman said, suggesting there was no attempted cover-up.But Daniel G. Cort, an assistant district attorney, described the defendants’ actions as a clever plot, sparked in part by criticism surrounding an earlier $225,000 loan Mr. Rubenstein made directly to Judge Anderson’s campaign.“The defendants made certain that the answers on those financial disclosure statements would hide the true source of the money,” Mr. Cort said.'"
"'10-03-20,'0','The Census Bureau ended its partnership with the organization for this year’s census, the Internal Revenue Service dropped Acorn from its Voluntary Income Tax Assistance program, and Congress voted to cut off all grants to the group.A network that once included more than 1,000 grass-roots groups, Acorn, which stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, was created in 1970 and has fought for liberal causes like raising the minimum wage, registering the poor to vote, stopping predatory lending and expanding affordable housing. The organization helped roughly 150,000 lower-income families prepare their tax returns and obtain $190 million in tax refunds between 2004 and 2009, Acorn officials said.But long before the activist videos delivered what may become the final blow, the organization was dogged for years by financial problems and accusations of fraud. In the summer of 2008, infighting erupted over embezzlement of Acorn funds by the brother of the organization’s founder. Some chapters were also found to have submitted voter application forms with incorrect information on them during the lead-up to the 2008 presidential election, leading to blistering charges from conservative organizations linking Acorn’s errors to the Obama campaign.“That 20-minute video ruined 40 years of good work,” said Sonja Merchant-Jones, former co-chairwoman of Acorn’s Maryland chapter. “But if the organization had confronted its own internal problems, it might not have been taken down so easily.”The national organization’s housing affiliate, long one of the best-financed offshoots, has been hit especially hard. The group, which changed its name to the Affordable Housing Centers of America this year, now has 17 offices, down from 29 a year ago. The housing group’s annual budget has dropped to $6 million this year, down from $24 million last year.Some of Acorn’s state chapters have tried to remake themselves in recent months.Calls to Acorn’s New York City offices, for example, are now met with a recording that says: “Acorn is not providing services in New York. If you’re interested in hearing from local organizations with similar purposes, please press zero.”The New York chapter has been replaced by a new group, called New York Communities for Change, whose Web site promotes many of Acorn’s goals and many of whose staff and community members are the same.In Pittsburgh, Acorn officials said they were trying to continue work while they decided whether to stay with the national organization or form a new one. Maryellen Hayden, the volunteer director of Allegheny County’s Acorn, said the group was continuing to counsel people facing foreclosure and had recently sent two buses with dozens of members to Washington to rally for the Democratic health care bill.Many former Acorn staff members and beneficiaries of its work say that while the group was its own worst enemy in many ways, it was also one of the most consistent advocates for the poor. Acorn’s sudden demise, supporters say, has left a vacuum in services for communities that used to rely on it for free advice on employment, tax and loan matters.In Prince George’s County, Md., the Rev. Gloria Swieringa said she owed her home to Acorn. Ms. Swieringa, 72, who is blind, said her mortgage payment was $1,100 per month, more than she could afford on her fixed income of about $1,500 a month, until Acorn stepped in.After she tried unsuccessfully to persuade her mortgage company to lower her rate or readjust her loan, Acorn workers began writing letters, making calls and contacting the news media on her behalf. Last May, the company relented and lowered her monthly payments to $771 per month.“That’s what I know Acorn for,” Ms. Swieringa said. “And that’s why it’s just awful for it to disappear.”But other supporters have grown disenchanted. Rick Tingling-Clemmons, 66, a teacher in Washington, was an enthusiastic dues-paying member, but soured on the organization over the reports of embezzlement and dropped his affiliation last year. By the time the scandal over the videotaped employees erupted, he was already done with Acorn, he said, and he now believes it needs to reinvent itself with a new mission and a new name.“We get better, all of us, after we make mistakes that we learn from,” he said. “It’s from those mistakes that we learn and we get smarter. I think the people in Acorn will get smarter.”Bertha Lewis, the chief executive of Acorn, said in an e-mail message that her organization’s problems were the result of “a series of well-orchestrated, relentless, well-funded right-wing attacks” reminiscent of the McCarthy era.“Our effective work empowering African-American and low-income voters made us a target,” she said. “And the videos were a manufactured, sensational story that led to a rush to judgment and an unconstitutional act by Congress.”In the month after the videos were released, Acorn commissioned an internal audit by a former attorney general of Massachusetts, Scott Harshbarger. His report, released in December, said the employees portrayed in the videos had not engaged in any illegal activity. Last month, the Brooklyn district attorney’s office completed an investigation of the Acorn employees there who appeared in the video and concluded that they had not taken part in any criminality.Nonetheless, the damage had been done. Republicans and conservatives attacked the group, in part because the group’s registration efforts typically signed up voters who were believed to support Democrats. Those critics saw the videos as evidence of Acorn’s corruption.Darrell Issa of California, the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, described Acorn at a December hearing as a “criminal organization” working hand-in-glove with the Obama administration. In February, committee Republicans released a report saying that Acorn “exploits the poor and vulnerable” for political gain.A federal district court judge in New York ruled in December that the Congressional ban on funding for the group was unconstitutional. This month, the same judge barred federal officials from enforcing it, but no federal money is flowing to the organization while the government appeals the ruling.In January, Mr. O’Keefe and three other men were arrested in New Orleans and accused of trying to tamper with the office telephone system of Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana.Mr. O’Keefe has denied the charges and said the group was trying to investigate complaints that constituents calling Ms. Landrieu’s office could not get through to criticize her support of a health care overhaul bill.'"
"'10-03-20,'0','The president, of course, still spends time behind the scenes monitoring Afghanistan and weighing in on other policy matters. Aides said his personal engagement with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia in recent days appears to have broken through a logjam holding up a new arms control treaty. And advisers are juggling negotiations with lawmakers on matters like the handling of terror suspects.But presidential travel and the bully pulpit are vital tools used to send messages internationally and command attention at home, and Mr. Obama has chosen in the last couple months to focus those tools largely on his campaign for health care legislation.All of which may be the smart use of his limited time and public voice, given how critical health care has become to his presidency. If he had left on Sunday for Jakarta and Canberra as the central domestic project of his term fell apart in the Capitol, it would have been seen by many as a strategic mistake. As it was, Democratic lawmakers were unhappy that he kept the trip on the schedule as long as he did, given the do-or-die nature of the debate.But the decision to delay the trip until June came just days after the White House described it as vital because, as one official told reporters, “America has been somewhat absent from the region over the last several years and we are committed to re-establishing that leadership.”Now America, or at least the president, will be absent from the region for another three months. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said regional alliances “are critical to America’s security and economic progress, but passage of health insurance reform is of paramount importance.” Other aides said the Indonesian and Australian governments recognized it would be better to delay until a time when the president would not be distracted by events back home.Still, Michael J. Green, who was the top Asia adviser to President George W. Bush, said that Asian governments were frustrated by the lack of progress by Mr. Obama in advancing trade. “They can sense that health care has absolutely sucked all the oxygen out of the room,” Mr. Green said.The lack of public attention on Afghanistan has bothered some who otherwise support Mr. Obama’s policy. In the 38 speeches and public remarks since the battle for Marja began, Mr. Obama mentioned “Afghanistan” four times, always in passing — once to acknowledge an Afghan woman attending an International Women’s Day event and three times to thank visiting Irish and Greek prime ministers for troops and police officers serving there.Other than health care, the main topics in that time have been jobs, energy and education. (The count covers remarks posted on the White House Web site, not interviews, which generally are not released by the president’s staff.)Supporters of the Afghan effort said it was important for the president to explain to the public what the United States is doing there. Peter D. Feaver, a former national security aide to Mr. Bush, said Mr. Obama risks sending the message that “his heart’s not in it.” Mr. Feaver added, “Even if it’s an unfair inference, and I think it probably is an unfair inference, it’s one the allies will be happy to glom onto for their own interests.”But Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton, who is retired from the Army and is now a senior adviser at the National Security Network, a group advocating a “progressive national security” policy, said Mr. Obama’s silence should not be overinterpreted. “We say he’s a wartime president, but he has so much on his plate right now,” he said. “I’m not offended that a particular topic like health care has sucked up all the oxygen in Washington, D.C.”'"
"'10-03-20,'0','“There’s a real commitment from this administration to improve the integrity of this program,” Mr. McEvoy said.The testing for pesticide residues is expected to begin in September. It will be done by the network of independent certifying agents that are already accredited by the department to inspect and certify organic growers, processors and handlers.As of last July, 98 independent agents were licensed to inspect and certify about 28,000 organic operations worldwide, the inspector general’s report said.Mr. McEvoy said that details of the pesticide inspections were still being worked out but that they would probably focus on growers whose risk of pesticide contamination might be highest, like those whose organic fields are cultivated next to nonorganic fields or those that raise both organic and conventional crops.Some certifiers already do spot tests, he said, but many do not, testing only if they suspect a problem. The inspector general’s report said a review of four large certifiers, which were collectively responsible for inspecting almost a third of the organic operations nationwide, found that none did regular spot testing.The organic program’s budget increased to $6.9 million for the current fiscal year, from $3.9 million the previous year, Mr. McEvoy said, while its staff is slated to nearly double, to 31 from 16. The Obama administration is seeking to increase the budget to $10 million in the next fiscal year and allow the program to expand to about 40 employees.Christine M. Bushway, executive director of the Organic Trade Association, an industry group, said improved oversight, and more money to make it possible, were needed to ensure that consumers had faith in the United States Department of Agriculture’s organic seal. “Compliance and enforcement are critical to the seal and the long-term health of the industry,” she said.Sales of organic products reached $26 billion last year and, until the recession hit, had been growing by double-digit percentages each year.Ms. Bushway said the organic program never had the resources to keep up with the industry’s growth. “They were underfunded and understaffed,” she said.The inspector general’s report focused largely on conditions at the organic program at the end of the Bush administration, from 2006 through 2008.It said that in several cases officials had taken up to 32 months to act against producers or processors that had sold conventional products claiming they were organic — even as those products remained on the market. In one case, the report said, officials failed entirely to take action against an operator that, for two years, sold nonorganic mint under an organic label.The report also said that the organic program had failed to adequately vet several of the independent certifying agents it allowed to approve organic operations in foreign countries.Under normal circumstances, the program gives preliminary accreditation to certifying agents based on a review of paperwork they submit. That allows them to begin certifying and inspecting organic producers and processors. But the program is supposed to follow up with a site visit to inspect a certifier’s operations before making accreditation permanent.In five cases, the inspector general found, officials failed to make the follow-up visits, allowing the certifiers to operate for as long as seven years with only preliminary accreditation.Officials at the program said that in three cases, involving certifiers operating in Bolivia, Israel and Turkey, they did not send staff members to make the inspections because the State Department had issued travel warnings about potentially dangerous conditions in those countries.In two other cases, involving certifying agents in Australia and Canada, officials said that scheduling problems blocked them from arranging visits — in one instance for as long as five years.The Department of Agriculture said in its response to the audit that it had now visited and completed its review of four of the five foreign certifiers cited in the report and had scheduled a visit to the remaining certifier. It did not say if the reviews had found compliance problems.The audit also highlighted numerous inconsistencies in the way that certifiers operating in the United States enforced organic regulations.The report warned that officials must tighten oversight of the industry to give consumers the assurance “that products labeled as organic are meeting a uniform standard.”'"

Koy Kuong, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the ban would remain in place while the government worked to ensure that South Korean men hoping to marry Cambodian women were able to first prove that they were single and did not have a prison record. “We want to make sure that their marriages are real marriages, not fake, and not involved with human trafficking,” Mr. Koy Kuong said. It was the second time the government had imposed such a ban.'"
"'10-03-20,'0','BUFFALO — Missouri guard Zaire Taylor likes to describe his team’s up-tempo style of play as more “organized chaos” than “helter-skelter.” He believes his Tigers operate best in the open floor, capitalizing on run-outs to the rim and pouncing on turnovers.“Nobody’s going to play 36 minutes for us,” said the assistant coach Matt Zimmerman. “It’s not an easy way to go after things.”More alike than just their Tiger mascots, Missouri and Clemson pushed each other’s paces Friday afternoon in an N.C.A.A. tournament first-round game, pressing on defense, penetrating through the lane and popping 3-pointers when possible. Missouri Coach Mike Anderson charged his players with wreaking havoc defensively in the half court, and that’s what they did, turning Clemson over for 16 points in the first half, often ending with lay-ups all alone on fast breaks. Missouri outlasted Clemson, 86-78, in the second half, scoring 22 fast break-points and 20 points off Clemson’s 20 turnovers.“We haven’t played with this since of urgency since I don’t even know when,” Taylor said.For a team in perpetual motion, forward Keith Ramsey was the picture of efficiency, shooting 8 of 10 from the floor for 18 points. He punctuated the victory with a wide-open dunk in the lane.“If we can turn someone over, then we are comfortable,” Ramsey said.Andre Young kept Clemson in the game, connecting on 5 of 7 3-point attempts for 19 points.While Ramsey had three steals, it was the senior guard J. T. Tiller who pilfered five passes. His most impressive play came when he chased down an offensive rebound, then immediately shook past a defender and finished with a lay-up while absorbing the foul. Tiller scored 10 points.“We don’t have one lethal weapon in the half court, but if we get in the open court we have like 10,” said the sophomore guard Kim English.'"
"'10-03-20,'0','In recent weeks, the Iranian authorities have released dozens of high-profile opposition figures who were arrested after the disputed presidential election in June, rights advocates said Friday.The prisoners were required to post bail in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, the advocates said. Mohsen Mirdamadi, a former member of Parliament and reformist politician, was released this week after posting bail of $450,000. Saeed Leylaz, a prominent economist and journalist, and Bahman Ahmadi Amooee, another well-known journalist, were also released after paying substantial sums.The advocacy group Human Rights Activists in Iran said Friday that about 18,000 people had been arrested since last summer, and that many of them remained in prison. Emadeddin Baghi, a human rights activist and journalist, has been in solitary confinement for the past 50 days, the opposition Jaras Web site reported. At least six people were sentenced to death last week for their role in the protests, in addition to two others who were executed in February.On Thursday, on the eve of the Iranian New Year, the opposition leader Mir Hussein Moussavi issued a video reasserting his leadership and naming the new year one of “perseverance and patience.” It was a direct affront to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who by tradition names the new year in a message delivered on March 21.The 16-minute video, which was posted on Facebook, was the first from Mr. Moussavi since last summer, when the protests erupted after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won what was widely regarded as a fraudulent election. Mr. Moussavi’s wife, Zahra Rahnavard, who has also been at odds with the government, issued a New Year’s message as well.Mr. Moussavi said that events since the election on June 12 had led to a “new awakening.”He continued, “It is not right to treat people like uncivilized and ignorant people, as though matters should be decided for them.” In the video he is seen sitting next to a table with the traditional Haft-Sin, seven items that begin with letter S in Persian to mark the beginning of spring and the New Year.He predicted that the country’s deep economic malaise would be increasingly evident, with greater poverty and unemployment in the new year because of the government’s mismanagement.'"

He was 85.Nepalese leaders, in announcing his death, declared Sunday, the day of his funeral, to be a national holiday, to allow public mourning of Mr. Koirala’s death, and they also ordered that the national flag be flown at half-staff. Mr. Koirala died at the home of his daughter after being in frail health.Mr. Koirala’s death further complicates an already politically fraught situation in Nepal. The country’s interim Constitution expires in late May. The Maoists, now a political party, are negotiating with other parties to formally complete the peace process, ending their 10-year rebellion while the parties also are writing a new Constitution that would restructure the national government.Mr. Koirala, patriarch of the Nepali Congress Party and a symbol of the political establishment, had been leading a working group of top leaders from different parties, including the Maoists, to try to break a political impasse in the negotiations. His death raises questions about the shape and fate of the continuing talks.“Mr. Koirala’s death is a huge loss for Nepal and its ongoing peace process,” a spokesman for the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said in a statement.'"

"'10-03-21,'0','Still, Mr. Poneman is building something he hopes will be more valuable over time: A network of people that, in Mr. Poneman’s view, have economic value over time.“My goal is not to make as much money as possible now but to build as much capital as possible,” he said. “Eventually, I will be able to transfer that capital.”For now, that capital takes the form of his Facebook page, where he has 4,300 friends, and his uploads to YouTube, where his player interviews and scouting videos have drawn 500,000 page views in just seven months. Mr. Poneman has 2,000 contacts stuffed into his cellphone directory.He hopes to begin cashing in on the networking efforts in three weeks, when he inaugurates the new Web site, tentatively titled swagair.com. Though he keeps his revenue model and most other details private, Mr. Poneman said he had enlisted seven writers from around the country to contribute and was gearing the site to have a national focus like Scout.com and Rivals.com.“The strategy all happened itself,” he said. “I didn’t come up with it. Only after it was in motion could I see what it was that I was doing.”When Mr. Poneman set off on this path four years ago, he was a novelty: a white, suburban, Jewish kid with braces making his mark in the Chicago prep basketball scene. Videos of postgame player interviews on the Web site he created, Illinoishsbasketball.com, won a strong following of a few thousand daily readers, among them players and coaches in Chicago, and college recruiters around the country. He has built from there.Along the way, he has not lost sight of what originally attracted him to his work: His ability to provide exposure and opportunity for lesser-known players in Illinois and, eventually, perhaps other states.“All the same stuff gets written over and over,” said Mr. Poneman, who is from Evanston, “so the same kids get overexposed. But there are so many kids who need the help because fans don’t want to read them.”The challenge now, he said, is to prove he made the right decision when he decided to forgo college.“I would not skip college just so I could become a basketball scout and make money,” he said. “I would only make that choice if there was a larger impact I could make.”At the heart of his efforts, Mr. Poneman said, is a desire to help as many local athletes as he can to parlay their talents into college scholarships.His March 28 tournament is designed to showcase lesser-known players to coaches from mid- and lower-level college programs. He expects more than 100 athletes to participate at the one-day event in Deerfield.“His whole outlook, his vision, is different than a lot of everybody else’s,” said Sundance Wicks, an assistant coach at Northern Illinois University. “He is not just about the kids who are going big time. He is going to help a kid who might not have a chance or a look, and he is giving to them an outlet, a chance to be seen.”'"

Kristof for underscoring the importance of international educational exchange in “Teach for the World” (column, March 11).The State Department shares his belief in the power of person-to-person exchanges and administers a number of programs with the same goal of engaging young people globally and expanding the reach of United States public diplomacy.One example is the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant program, which sends recent college graduates to serve as English teaching assistants in schools or universities in countries like Azerbaijan, Cameroon and Sri Lanka. Last year, with additional financing from Congress, we expanded the program to send more than 500 Americans to 45 countries.Many of our participants engage with populations who have never met Americans before. The State Department hopes that more Americans will participate in these opportunities to deepen their knowledge and cultural awareness as they promote mutual understanding.The writer is acting assistant secretary, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, State Department.I’m so glad that Nicholas D. Kristof chose a journalism student studying in Nebraska to accompany him on his next trip to Africa.

"'10-03-21,'0','“If this is taken to its logical conclusion, you are talking about criminal defendants’ appearing before the judge chosen by the D.A,” said James Sample, a professor at the Hofstra Law School and the co-author of a 2008 report on recusal reform from New York University’s School of Law. “It’s turning the scalpel of recusal into a chain saw to undermine judicial independence.”A California law, mirrored in 18 states, gives parties a one-time right to insist that a judge recuse herself. The legal term is “peremptory challenge.” Colloquially, it is called “papering.”The challenges have stirred up judges in all corners of this courthouse, where personal histories and professional relationships have been intertwined for decades. Judge Bryan has been a prosecutor. Ms. Carr has been a judge. Many of the judges, prosecutors and public defenders have dealt with one another repeatedly over the years. Many face re-election periodically.Among legal scholars, the papering of a judge by ongoing players, whether a district attorney or a public defender, is frowned on. The judiciary typically handles the assignment of cases as it sees fit, and interference can appear to challenge judges’ independence. A boycott of one judge can be viewed as a warning to all.One judge felt so moved by the situation that he spoke from the bench about Judge Bryan. “I look to my colleague, who is now a subject of much public debate and in some quarters ridicule, and wonder whether or not I would have the courage to do what I thought was right,” Judge Eugene Hyman said last month as he made a ruling exonerating a man charged with murder.In the squat buildings in Santa Clara County’s civic center, the events have polarized what was already an adversarial process.For Ms. Carr, who is facing re-election in June, the fundamental issue may revolve around two people: Augustine Uribe, the convicted molester, and Troy Benson, her deputy, whom Judge Bryan accused of deceit.In 2006, Mr. Uribe was convicted of molesting his granddaughter and was sentenced to 38 years to life in prison. When video evidence of the girl’s medical examination emerged afterward — evidence that, the defense said, cast doubt on the conviction — Judge Bryan made her ruling.Mr. Uribe’s defense lawyer had argued that Mr. Uribe should not face retrial because his rights had been violated and asserted that Mr. Benson had lied and withheld information about the videotapes.In January, Judge Bryan agreed. She wrote in her opinion: “Mr. Benson’s numerous acts of misconduct, culminating with his false testimony in this proceeding, strikes at the foundation of our legal system and is so grossly shocking and outrageous that it offends the universal sense of justice to allow prosecution in this matter to proceed.”Mr. Benson faces an investigation by the state bar association that could lead to his suspension or disbarment. Mr. Uribe has been set free, although he may face retrial. Mr. Benson did not respond to requests for an interview. Judge Bryan declined to comment.In an interview, Ms. Carr said that her office had previous concerns about some of Judge Bryan’s rulings, which she declined to detail. The Uribe decision was “the straw that broke the camel’s back,” she said.After the ruling, Ms. Carr met with the court’s presiding judge, Jamie A. Jacobs-May, to lobby for Judge Bryan’s reassignment. Nothing changed and the papering campaign began.A 1957 state law gives any party involved in a case one chance to challenge a judicial assignment without giving a reason. It was upheld by the State Supreme Court in 1977, although the justices expressed “disapproval” of blanket challenges. In San Jose at least, the affidavits to bar a judge from hearing a case go directly to the judge in question, who is not permitted to ask the reason for the request.The weekly ritual of papering by the district attorney’s office has its mirror image in the office of Judge Philip Pennypacker, the supervising judge in the criminal division. His ritual involves keeping Judge Bryan busy with a few criminal cases that are exempt from the boycott.“We’re trying our best to deal with the roadblock thrown in our way,” Judge Pennypacker said.Ms. Carr is not alone in challenging a judge. Judges in San Diego County have reported that District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis papered them. A former judge, Ms. Dumanis said the challenges were not personal and were analogous to being called for jury duty and not being picked.While individual lawyers in Santa Clara County have asked judges to recuse themselves, the sheer number of challenges against Judge Bryan is believed to be unprecedented.In 2000, lawyers in the public defender’s office papered Judge Joyce Allegro, who had sat on a board of a victims advocacy group, to prevent her from hearing cases involving domestic violence. Judge Allegro was reassigned. Ms. Carr said there was little outrage then, although few knew about the papering until The San Jose Mercury News disclosed it several years later.Mary Greenwood, the county’s public defender, said there was a fundamental difference between challenges from the public defender and those from the prosecution. In criminal cases, the prosecution brings the judges their business.“The use of this tool can effectively force a judge out of the criminal division,” she said. “No other institution or individual has the power to do that. It creates an imbalance of power in the criminal justice system.”Alfonso Lopez, who was Mr. Uribe’s defense lawyer, said the fallout from Judge Bryan’s ruling had surprised him. “Now I understand why judges are afraid,” Mr. Lopez said. “It makes me think we are in a dictatorship.”The challenges have become an issue in Ms. Carr’s re-election campaign. In a debate, her opponent, Jeff Rosen, a deputy district attorney in her office, called the papering “un-American.”The decision, Mr. Rosen said, “does nothing for child molestation victims, nothing for Mr. Benson and nothing for my prosecutor colleagues’ going forward as we appear before an appropriately offended judiciary.”He added that he would refrain from such actions.Ms. Carr said she did not expect her challenge to Judge Bryan to influence judges’ decisions.“I have more faith in my colleagues on the bench to continue making decisions they think are right,” she said. “To imply that judges on our court may be somehow frightened doesn’t give them enough credit.”Among the judges, keeping Judge Bryan involves complicated logistics. Reassigning her other judges’ criminal cases has led to more roadblocks. Recently, she has been hearing a child molestation case, which was exempt from a peremptory challenge because she has heard an aspect of the case before.Once the jury is selected, the trial is expected to last three weeks. It is unclear if other major cases will be available to her.'"
"'10-03-21,'0','“Why don’t you use your head?” Mr. Johnson once bellowed at her. She bellowed back: “I’m too busy trying to use yours!”Ms. Carpenter’s association with the Johnsons began in 1960, when Johnson, then the Senate majority leader, was running for vice president on the Democratic ticket headed by Senator John F. Kennedy. One of her tasks was to stage rallies in the South that were known as Flying Tea Parties.“The name of the game,” Ms. Carpenter once recalled, “was to take those funny-talking Kennedy ladies from Massachusetts, with Lady Bird at the helm, and hit Texas and other states in the Bible Belt and prove that Roman Catholics didn’t have horns and tails.”After the election, Ms. Carpenter was named Mr. Johnson’s executive assistant. She was in the motorcade in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, when Kennedy was assassinated. She wrote the brief speech Mr. Johnson delivered at the foot of Air Force One when he returned to Washington as the 36th president. (“This is a sad time for all people,” he said, adding, “I ask for your help — and God’s.”)Ms. Carpenter spent the next five years as Mrs. Johnson’s press secretary. She coordinated news coverage of the White House weddings of both Johnson daughters, Lynda Bird and Luci Baines, and Mrs. Johnson’s many trips, including a widely publicized raft trip down the Rio Grande in 1966. She wrote about her White House years in a 1970 book, “Ruffles and Flourishes.”In 1971, out of the White House, Ms. Carpenter turned her energy to women’s causes, including the fight for an Equal Rights Amendment. Her efforts to establish the National Women’s Political Caucus grew out of a commitment to seeing more women elected to state and federal posts.Earlier, Ms. Carpenter was a prime mover in the battle to permit women to join the National Press Club, which had been an important institution in Washington for reporters as well as politicians since its founding in 1908. Before being accepted as members, women with press credentials fought to be admitted at least to the club luncheons at which visiting heads of state customarily appeared.“We made a great breakthrough in 1956,” Helen Thomas, a reporter who has covered Washington since World War II, once recalled. “Liz Carpenter got them to agree to let us sit in the balcony of the ballroom, in purdah, and listen to the luncheon speaker as we looked down on our press colleagues and the public relations men and the lobbyists as they ate.”It was not until 1971 that women were admitted as members.In her 1987 memoir “Getting Better All the Time,” Ms. Carpenter credited Eleanor Roosevelt with helping to open doors for women in the press.It was Mrs. Roosevelt, she said, who forced the wire services to hire women by allowing only women to cover her news conferences and who saw to it that “the stories were about substance, not hats.” Ms. Carpenter was among the reporters at one of those events.From 1972 to 1976, Ms. Carpenter was a vice president of Hill & Knowlton, a Washington public relations firm. She did some lobbying for clients like the Wine Institute and Sears, Roebuck & Company but spent most of her time planning promotional events. She returned to Texas in 1976.Mary Elizabeth Sutherland was born in Salado, Tex. on Sept. 1, 1920, the middle of five children — three brothers and one sister — of Thomas Shelton Sutherland, a rancher who later went into the road construction business, and Mary Elizabeth Sutherland.A sixth-generation Texan, she counted among her forebears one who wrote the Texas Declaration of Independence and one who died at the Alamo.The family later moved to Austin, where Ms. Carpenter was editor of her high school newspaper. She went on to the University of Texas at Austin and studied journalism.As a graduation present in 1942, she took a trip to Washington and decided to stay, finding work as an assistant to the correspondent for 26 small Michigan newspapers.She also looked up her congressman from Texas but found he had gone off to war. Instead, she met the congressman’s wife — Lady Bird Johnson — who was running his office. It was the beginning of their long friendship.In Washington, in 1944, she married Les Carpenter, a high school sweetheart who had been a fellow journalism student at the University of Texas. The Johnsons attended their wedding.Shortly afterward, Ms. Carpenter got a job as a reporter with United Press.When the war ended, the couple organized the Carpenter News Bureau in Washington, reporting for some 20 Southwestern newspapers. Mr. Carpenter died in 1974.In addition to her daughter, of New York, Ms. Carpenter is survived by a son, Scott, of Vashon, Wash., a granddaughter and a grandson.Her daughter said the most enduring lesson her mother had instilled at home was “remember to laugh.”At 71, after her children had long since left the house, Ms. Carpenter became the unexpected mother of the three youngest children of her brother Tom Sutherland, who had died of cancer. When the mother of the children, who ranged from 11 to 16, and their older siblings were unable to look after them, Ms. Carpenter took charge.That experience was captured in “Unplanned Parenthood: The Confessions of a Seventy-something Surrogate Mother,” a book Ms. Carpenter wrote in 1994.Ms. Carpenter maintained her close ties with the Johnsons after their return to Texas and in 1992 organized Mrs. Johnson’s 80th birthday party for 1,000 guests in Austin. Mrs. Johnson died in 2007.“It never occurred to me not to work,” Ms. Carpenter said in a 1987 interview, shortly after she had undergone a mastectomy, adding, “I had a restless spirit that kept drawing me to new adventures.” She never hesitated, she said, “to charge hell with a bucket of water.”'"
"'10-03-21,'0','Mr. Bishop and Mr. Green contrast the theories of Keynes and Smith with those of contemporary, number-crunching economists who say they believe unswervingly in the so-called efficient-market hypothesis, stipulating that market forces will determine the correct price for stocks and bonds. Mr. Smith, they note, warned of the “overweening conceit” of human beings, while Mr. Keynes wrote of the influence of “animal spirits” on the economy.The authors enumerate five “wrong turns” that they say nations are prone to make amid economic crises. Disdaining both liberal and conservative orthodoxies, they say that the following ideas, though frequently held, are just plain wrong: that financial bubbles are wholly bad, with no redeeming value; that governments must always avoid bailing out the financial sector; that crises can be solved without addressing underlying economic issues (global imbalances, in the case of the current crisis); that economies always recover naturally on their own; and that a rush to tighter regulation of financial markets will fix the problems.The book is at its best in re-examining what did — and did not — lead various nations to ruin in the past. Mr. Bishop and Mr. Green contend, for example, that the infamous boom and bust in tulip prices in Holland in the 17th century was not an example of sheer madness. Rather, they say, it was the unfortunate upshot of the “price-discovery process” after the introduction of what proved to be an enduring and important financial product: the limited liability corporation.“In reality, the bubble was a blip, and the Dutch economy was barely affected, in large part because no serious effort was made to stifle financial innovation” after prices collapsed, the authors say.As for the current crisis, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Green mince no words in analyzing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. “Capitalism as we knew it ended on Sept. 15, 2008,” they declare in their opening sentence. They fault former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. as failing to foresee that deciding not to bail out Lehman would set off a market panic.The authors say the ensuing loss of confidence prompted the huge — and, in their minds, otherwise avoidable — government bailouts that Mr. Paulson initiated in following days. (For his part, Mr. Paulson contends in his current book, “On the Brink,” that he lacked the legal authority to save Lehman.)MR. BISHOP and Mr. Green are a bit disappointing and not entirely original when prescribing cures for what they think ails capitalism. They warn against resurrecting regulatory measures like the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment banking until its repeal in 1999; they fear that such restraints would hamper the competitiveness of American banks internationally.They also advocate replacing the dollar with a new world reserve currency, which they say would increase American exports and help level the playing field of international trade. That, as they concede, is an idea borrowed from Mr. Keynes. So, too, is their argument that the economy might have benefited from more government stimulus spending, and still might be helped by it.Likewise, one of their big ideas is recycled from “Philanthrocapitalism.” This hybrid term describes a kind of enlightened capitalism currently personified, in their view, by Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett, who are giving much of their fortunes to charitable causes. Beyond that, the authors call for programs to improve financial literacy in the media and the general public, and for shareholders and institutional investors to demand that corporate managers focus on long-term success rather than on quarterly profits.But if their book has its shortcomings, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Green make a persuasive case that America needs to transform its basic economic theory and practice, or the road out of our current mess will be at least as long and winding as the road that got us in it.'"
"'10-03-21,'0','In 1973, I left for mandatory military service in the French Army and served in French Guyana. When I returned, we started a weekly section about computers that I decided to spin off as a separate publication for Brazilians.I found local investors and we started a Portuguese-language publication called Data News just as the computer industry was transitioning from mainframes to smaller computers. The Brazilian government, however, decided that computers were a matter of national security and had to be manufactured in Brazil, so in one fell swoop we lost our advertisers, all of which were foreign-based. My backers pulled out, too.I had sent a copy of the magazine to Patrick McGovern, head of International Data Group, which published Computerworld, and he suggested I contact him if I needed anything. I told him that there was no way Brazil could stick by its ban on foreign computers, given the country’s need to modernize, but that I needed help to get through this rough patch. He bought the magazine. I joined I.D.G. as vice president for Latin America, and we established a network of magazines in the region.I spent the next 10 years building I.D.G.’s businesses there. I moved to the United States in 1986 to become president of InfoWorld, an I.D.G. magazine. In 1989, Bill Ziff, owner of Ziff Davis, hired me as publisher of PC Magazine. After that I was president and then C.E.O. of Ziff Davis.Last June, I became C.E.O. of The Huffington Post. The advent of new media has meant that publishers can reach more people than ever before. The news cycle is now constant — by the second — as opposed to a few years ago, when people relied on daily newspapers and the evening news. Today’s technology allows people to engage with the news, to write comments, to blog about events and to share on social Web sites.The Huffington Post has roughly doubled in size each year since launching four and a half years ago. There’s still a gap between the time people spend on the Internet and advertisers’ online budgets. Most advertising dollars are still spent on TV, but that is shifting. We believe that the golden age of advertising on the Internet is still to come.My career has taught me that you have to go through life with your eyes wide open and be curious. If you do this, you’ll find incredible opportunities.Just jump on them and follow your instincts.'"

Nobody else was even 27.“I wish I could sit here and say we thought Garrett Jones was going to hit 20 home runs,” Neal Huntington, the Pirates’ general manager, said. “The bottom line is we thought he was a big-league player.”That is a more generous evaluation than the Pirates, and every other major league team, gave Jones in 2007. That was when he passed through waivers with no team claiming him.It was not the first time Jones had been rejected. The Atlanta Braves drafted him out of an Illinois high school in 1999. Jones had a scholarship to Purdue but signed with the Braves instead. Their bonus offer included college tuition if he ever wanted to enroll.“I figured, playing baseball every day, I could improve, and then just see where it takes me,” Jones said.It took him nowhere, at least in the Braves’ system. In 2000, Atlanta drafted first basemen Scott Thorman and Adam LaRoche, both of whom passed him on the depth chart. Jones asked for and was granted his release in 2002, then signed with Minnesota and rose steadily before stagnating at Class AAA.“Dangerous hitter; he had a knack for driving in runs,” said Pirates Manager John Russell, who saw Jones often when he managed in the minors. “This guy could hit, he could hit with power, he could run. He was a very interesting guy. He was one of those guys you looked at and said, ‘I’d like to see this guy in the major leagues.’ ”When he finally made it, for three call-ups in 2007, Jones disappointed himself. He was 1 for 8 the first time, 3 for 17 the second time. He hit better the third time but could lift his average to only .208, with two home runs.“I was pretty nervous,” Jones said. “I was just kind of overwhelmed, still in shock. It didn’t really register for a while. I was just kind of in awe and I wasn’t really focused on playing the game. I was more caught up in being in the big leagues, like, wow, I made it, this is awesome.”After a final full season at Rochester in 2008, Jones signed with the Pirates as a minor league free agent. A month later, they signed Eric Hinske — also a left-handed power-hitting first baseman — to a major league deal.Despite a strong spring training, Jones went back to the minors. He was still there when he turned 28 in June. That is past the age by which most players are considered serious prospects.“Probably around 26 or 27, you start moving out of the prospect phase,” said Shelley Duncan, 30, who had 30 home runs and 99 R.B.I. at Class AAA last season. “People look at you like you’re — what do they call it? — a minor league lifer, or 4A. People start saying that.”Duncan, who spent parts of the past three seasons with the Yankees, played against Jones in Class AAA. He called Jones humble and unassuming, not the kind of player to draw attention to himself. He also said he thought of Morneau every time he watched Jones hit.“He was almost like the same type of hitter,” Duncan said. “And when he got his chance, it wasn’t a surprise to see how well he did.”Duncan hit five home runs in his first eight major league games, then hit three in his next 60. Jones, likewise, had a hot start for the Pirates last summer, bashing 10 home runs in his first 75 at-bats after Hinske was traded June 30.He cooled off for a bit but finished strong, and only four major leaguers hit more home runs from July 1 through the end of the season: Ryan Howard, Prince Fielder, Derrek Lee and Mark Reynolds.“As the league adjusted to Garrett, he adjusted back,” Huntington said. “He still showed doubles power and hit some home runs. There were some encouraging signs that he may not be a one-hit wonder, because he could manipulate the barrel of the bat and hit that pitch away or handle that fastball in. There were no real glaring holes in his swing.”Russell says Jones has a maintenance-free swing, and no leg kick or hitch with his hands that can cause a long slump. The budget-conscious Pirates think they have a middle-of-the-order slugger for just over the minimum salary, $400,000.Jones thinks he is finally where he belongs. He does not seem bitter about his time in the minors, and said he only briefly considered what else he might do with his life; a career in law enforcement, perhaps.“But none of it could really compare to baseball,” Jones said. “You can only play baseball so long. I’d always think, well, you’re going to have plenty of time to do something else. Just enjoy playing ball as long as I can, and when it’s over, it’s over.”Three months short of his 29th birthday, his major league journey is just beginning.'"
"'10-03-21,'0','“Already people are interpreting this as demonstrating some kind of interest that China would have in disrupting the U.S. power grid,” said Nart Villeneuve, a researcher with the SecDev Group, an Ottawa-based cybersecurity research and consulting group. “Once you start interpreting every move that a country makes as hostile, it builds paranoia into the system.”Mr. Wortzel’s presentation at the House hearing got a particularly strong reaction from Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California, who called the flagging of the Wang paper “one thing I think jumps out to all of these Californians here today, or should.”He was alluding to concerns that arose in 2001 when The Los Angeles Times reported that intrusions into the network that controlled the electrical grid were traced to someone in Guangdong Province, China. Later reports of other attacks often included allegations that the break-ins were orchestrated by the Chinese, although no proof has been produced.In an interview last week about the Wang paper and his testimony, Mr. Wortzel said that the intention of these particular researchers almost did not matter.“My point is that now that vulnerability is out there all over China for anybody to take advantage of,” he said.But specialists in the field of network science, which explores the stability of networks like power grids and the Internet, said that was not the case.“Neither the authors of this article, nor any other prior article, has had information on the identity of the power grid components represented as nodes of the network,” Reka Albert, a University of Pennsylvania physicist who has conducted similar studies, said in an e-mail interview. “Thus no practical scenarios of an attack on the real power grid can be derived from such work.”The issue of Mr. Wang’s paper aside, experts in computer security say there are genuine reasons for American officials to be wary of China, and they generally tend to dismiss disclaimers by China that it has neither the expertise nor the intention to carry out the kind of attacks that bombard American government and computer systems by the thousands every week.The trouble is that it is so easy to mask the true source of a computer network attack that any retaliation is fraught with uncertainty. This is why a war of words, like the high-pitched one going on these past months between the United States and China, holds special peril, said John Arquilla, director of the Information Operations Center at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.“What we know from network science is that dense communications across many different links and many different kinds of links can have effects that are highly unpredictable,” Mr. Arquilla said. Cyberwarfare is in some ways “analogous to the way people think about biological weapons — that once you set loose such a weapon it may be very hard to control where it goes,” he added.Tension between China and the United States intensified earlier this year after Google threatened to withdraw from doing business in China, saying that it had evidence of Chinese involvement in a sophisticated Internet intrusion. A number of reports, including one last October by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, of which Mr. Wortzel is vice chairman, have used strong language about the worsening threat of computer attacks, particularly from China.“A large body of both circumstantial and forensic evidence strongly indicates Chinese state involvement in such activities, whether through the direct actions of state entities or through the actions of third-party groups sponsored by the state,” that report stated.Mr. Wang’s research subject was particularly unfortunate because of the widespread perception, particularly among American military contractors and high-technology firms, that adversaries are likely to attack critical infrastructure like the United States electric grid.Mr. Wang said in the interview that he chose the United States grid for his study basically because it was the easiest way to go. China does not publish data on power grids, he said. The United States does and had had several major blackouts; and, as he reads English, it was the only country he could find with accessible, useful data. He said that he was an “emergency events management” expert and that he was “mainly studying when a point in a network becomes ineffective.”“I chose the electricity system because the grid can best represent how power currents flow through a network,” he said. “I just wanted to do theoretical research.”The paper notes the vulnerability of different types of computer networks to “intentional” attacks. The authors suggest that certain types of attacks may generate a domino-style cascading collapse of an entire network. “It is expected that our findings will be helpful for real-life networks to protect the key nodes selected effectively and avoid cascading-failure-induced disasters,” the authors wrote.Mr. Wang’s paper cites the network science research of Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, a physicist at Northeastern University. Dr. Barabasi has written widely on the potential vulnerability of networks to so-called engineered attacks.“I am not well vested in conspiracy theories,” Dr. Barabasi said in an interview, “but this is a rather mainstream topic that is done for a wide range of networks, and, even in the area of power transmission, is not limited to the U.S. system — there are similar studies for power grids all over the world.”'"
"'10-03-21,'0','The doctor started off by giving me his card in case I wanted to contact him by phone or e-mail. I asked him as many questions as I could think of, speaking as slowly as I could manage. He seemed in no rush to move me along.When it came time for the exam, though, time flew. He listened to my breath and my heart; looked in my eyes and my ears; felt my neck, my abdomen and my kidneys; and tested my strength, my reflexes and my balance. The whole thing lasted a few minutes.He did not check my skin — indeed, I had been fully clothed — or give me a , despite a family history of . When I mentioned some concerns that other doctors had raised, he said he did not see any problem, but did not go back to check.By way of unfair comparison, Dr. Robert Nesse, a family-practice physician, told me he might spend up to an hour with a patient during a first physical, having a long discussion of family history, recent changes or abnormalities and social and mental dynamics; doing dermatological, pelvic and breast exams; and suggesting a schedule of preventive services. Then again, such a physical might cost up to $200.As for a schedule of preventive services, my AMG doctor shrugged. The $79 covers, among many other things, lab tests, , stitches, Pap smears, X-rays and minor surgeries like removal and a . If you want something done, they say, just make an appointment.So I had an EKG and, over the next 24 hours, called to schedule four different procedures. For one, the receptionist said I would have to speak to a doctor, but she obligingly scheduled the other three, all within a week. I can’t imagine getting that kind of response from most doctors’ offices for anything less than an emergency.Such service is unusual enough to have attracted the attention of the Insurance Department, which last year informed AMG that it could not continue to offer the $79 plan. It amounted to unlicensed insurance, the department said, but AMG’s profit margin was too narrow to prepare for unexpected situations (like 500 people showing up at once with ). As a compromise, Dr. Muney agreed to charge $33 extra for sick visits.AMG is certainly no substitute for — though it seems cheaper on the front end, it cannot help you in a catastrophe. Is it a good option for people who cannot afford or cannot get insurance?It depends on what kind of patient you are. If you have aggressive lung , AMG does not cover your needs. On the other hand, if you tend to avoid doctors, why spend $948 a year not to go?If you’re somewhere in the middle? Procedures at a standard fee-for-service practice add up quickly, and it would not take many — a mole removal, treatment for or an echocardiogram, say — to make AMG a clear bargain.At clinics like Beth ’s newish 24-hour office in Chelsea, meanwhile — which an online reviewer described as “sort of like a hypochondriac’s 7-Eleven” — rates are low, but you still have to pay as you go, and you might have to kill a few hours waiting.AMG employs eight doctors, seven of them graduates of foreign — as are about 40 percent of practicing physicians in New York State, according to the . So far, Dr. Muney said in a phone interview, almost 700 people have signed up for his unusual plan, thanks in part to subway ads. He thinks that those with chronic conditions like or get the best value.If you, like most people, seek medical care only a few times a year, AMG might cost more than going à la carte at a traditional private practice. It all comes down to how greatly you value being able to get an appointment within a few days, in any borough, and knowing that you can see the same doctor every time.As Dr. Muney and I spoke, the Congressional vote on a national health care bill was looming. He insisted that if his model were adopted by all doctors and , along with a 7 percent on wages (split between employer and employee) devoted to health care, it could eliminate the need for , , veterans’ benefits and coverage for government employees.That’s a bet he will probably never have to settle. But the novelty of his model, and the official insistence that he raise his rates, may serve as a historic artifact of just how weird health care got in the first decade of the 21st century.'"
"'10-03-21,'0','When David Stewart Wiley raises his baton next weekend to usher in the Long Island Philharmonic’s spring season, he will be conducting a Mozart piece that is a personal favorite, but one that he has kept in reserve since becoming the orchestra’s music director in 2001.“It’s one of Mozart’s most profound utterances,” Mr. Wiley said of the Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra in E-flat Major, which will lead off an evening of “Mozart and More” at the Patchogue Theater for the Performing Arts on March 27. The program, which ends the Philharmonic’s winter break from regular concerts, will be repeated March 28 at the John Cranford Adams Playhouse of Hofstra University. The soloists on both evenings will be Erica Kiesewetter, a violinist who is the orchestra’s concertmaster, and David Creswell, its principal violist.Mr. Wiley has been holding the Sinfonia Concertante aside, he said, while waiting, in part, “for the right place to put it.” The work is intimate, he said, and “the stage needs to fit the work.”The Patchogue Theater and Adams Playhouse fit the bill, the conductor said, with stages smaller than those of the Philharmonic’s home bases: Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, on the C. W. Post campus in Brookville, and Staller Center, at Stony Brook University. (The orchestra has performed in Patchogue since 2007; this will be its first appearance at the Adams Playhouse since 2004.)For the “more” of “Mozart and More,” the program will include works by Brahms, Kodaly, Rachmaninoff and Rossini.Coming up on the Philharmonic’s calendar: “Bach ... And All That Jazz,” set for April 18 at the Patchogue Theater; the Tony Award winner Chita Rivera, doing Broadway selections with a Philharmonic ensemble (May 1 at Tilles Center); the violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg (May 15 and 16, at Staller and Tilles Centers); “Voices by Candlelight,” a program by the Long Island Philharmonic Chorus (June 5 at the Adelphi University Performing Arts Center in Garden City); and the pianist Joseph Kalichstein (June 19 and 20, at Tilles and Staller Centers).'"

"'10-03-21,'0','THE worldly and the clever gathered at the dinner parties that William F. Buckley Jr. and his wife, Pat, gave in their Park Avenue maisonette. Yet even though the chairs in the formal dining room are still covered in chartreuse leopard print, it has been quite a while since anyone but a broker or a prospective buyer has spent much time there.Mrs. Buckley, a socialite and mainstay of the charity circuit, died in 2007, and Mr. Buckley, the writer and godfather of modern conservatism, followed 10 months later in early 2008. Their 10-room duplex came on the market at $24.5 million in May 2008, but there were no takers; in early 2009, as the real estate market was choking, the estate decided to take down the for-sale sign.Now, more than a year later, the apartment at 778 Park Avenue has been relisted at $12 million, less than half the original asking price. And it is not the only listing in the building to have had to, ahem, adjust its price. The late Brooke Astor’s 15th-floor duplex, with 14 rooms and 6 terraces, started at $46 million in May 2008 and is now being offered for $24.9 million.“Some of the prices of two years ago were quite aggressive and hopeful,” said Paula Del Nunzio, the senior vice president at Brown Harris Stevens who is representing the Buckley property. “These prices are reflecting the reality of the current market.”Ms. Del Nunzio is quick to point out that the apartment has “the most extraordinary suite of entertaining rooms that you could find,” with a private entrance on East 73rd Street and an 18-foot-long marble entry hall that opens onto a 27-foot-long gallery, leading to a living room, a library and a dining room.“This is the place,” Ms. Del Nunzio continued, “where all those conversations and dinners with statesmen and political figures, not to mention film and television stars, with a quiet family dinner thrown in here and there, happened. This is a rare opportunity to acquire a piece of New York’s intellectual history.”'"
"'10-03-21,'0','As a high-school teacher with nearly 30 years’ experience, I read with great interest the article by Elizabeth Green, and on the whole, I thought it was very apt. Every good teacher knows how important classroom management is and has come up with his or her own techniques. But there’s an underlying assumption in the article that misses a major point. Teachers need to operate in schools that are well run and are actively supported by competent, involved administrators to create an atmosphere in which teachers are encouraged to teach well. Too many teachers feel undermined by indifferent or overly intrusive administrators or school boards. LOUISE FORSYTHPoly Prep Country Day School,BrooklynIn my 1969 college methods course, my professor said the three keys to being a successful teacher were the ability to be “fair, firm and consistent.” He further advised refraining from smiling for at least the first week. Today, I advise new teachers to have “patience, flexibility and a sense of humor.” As for that first week, I counsel empathy.I totally agree with Doug Lemov: clearly, a strong grasp of the content being taught is a must, but as I have learned in the past, the ability to “drop the lesson plan and fruitfully improvise” when needed is a far more important skill as we strive to focus on individual students’ needs. Improved student learning is not accomplished by stressing standardized assessments, structured curriculum and rigid lesson plans. It is found in the connections teachers make with students when they grasp the way different students learn.DERRY B. CROSLEYGreenwich High SchoolGreenwich, Conn.Elizabeth Green describes several current searches for the “deliberate” techniques that make effective teachers. In the ’70s, I studied a set of such techniques called Instructional Theory Into Practice, developed at U.C.L.A. by Madeline Hunter. The problem then, and I presume now, is to get a staff or district to choose and stick with such a program so that the skills can become widespread, while avoiding turning it into a gimmick with a specialized vocabulary and mechanical behaviors.JON BAYLEYBainbridge Island, Wash.The range of approaches contained in Elizabeth Green’s article suggest that there is reason to review all assumptions about teaching, including the metrics we use to gauge success. While it is understandable that we want to organize, structure and manage a huge and most important activity, we run the risk of ignoring the fact that learning is a complex dynamic that has many individualistic components that are not taken into account when we employ universal methodology.'"
"'10-03-21,'0','The stereotypes are slowly fading. In 2004, after watching thousands of same-sex couples in San Francisco rush to the altar, Cambodia’s much-loved King Norodom Sihanouk wrote on his Web site that gays should be allowed to marry because God loved a “wide range of tastes.”His successor and son, King Norodom Sihamoni, holds similar views. “The Cambodian Royal Family, as a whole, share the same point of view as the King-Father,” Sisowath Thomico, a spokesman for the royal family, wrote in an e-mail message. “We’ve always been very tolerant about sexual preferences as some Khmer Royals are/were openly gays/lesbians.”And last year, a lesbian-themed film by the Khmer novelist and director Phoan Phuong Bopha, “Who Am I?” was a sleeper hit. “Love between people of the same sex is a very new topic in Cambodia,” the director was quoted as saying in The Phnom Penh Post, in an article headlined “Who Am I? Brings Same Sex Issues Out Into the Open.”The new open-mindedness is attributed to Theravada Buddhism, the predominant religion in Cambodia. “When you’re looking at Buddhist countries, you’re going to encounter an openness and tolerance,” said Caroline Francis, a spokeswoman for the Cambodia field office of Family Health International, a public health organization involved with gay-related health issues. “The religious teachings aren’t being used to arrest or persecute people because they’re gay or lesbian.”One of the first gay bars to open was Linga, an airy cocktail lounge with artwork on the walls and large windows that face the Passage, a bustling and prominent street. Linga draws a mostly male crowd that’s both Khmer and Western and seems to signal a newfound openness for gay Cambodians. And like many nightclubs throughout Cambodia, prostitution and sex tourism are not hidden from view.“I grew up in a small town, so I know what it’s like to think, ‘I’m the only one,’ ” said Martin Dishman, 48, a former hotel manager from Greenfield, Ind., who opened Linga in 2004. Perhaps not surprisingly, many of Siem Reap’s most visibly gay bars and hotels are owned by Westerners.A more refined newcomer is Miss Wong, an old-Shanghai-themed boîte with cherry-red walls and gold silk lanterns. While its owner is gay, it caters to a broader clientele. On a typical night, a mix of men and women, expatriates and tourists, artists and entrepreneurs, and straight and gay people all mingled over lemon-grass-infused vodka concoctions and mocha martinis topped with dollops of chocolate.But Siem Reap isn’t really a party town. Town life revolves around Angkor Wat, and by sunrise the streets hum with tuk-tuks whisking tourists to the temples. “This will never be the place to swallow four tablets of ecstasy and stay up until 4 a.m., dancing under a full moon in sequin hot pants,” said Dean Williams, an expatriate from New Zealand who owns Miss Wong.That might explain why there are more gay-owned hotels than bars. The newest and arguably most flamboyant is a male-only resort called Men’s, which features 10 sleek rooms decorated with male nude paintings, a large outdoor swimming pool and a sprawling, black-and-gold tiled sauna and a Jacuzzi.Upscale travelers prefer Viroth’s Hotel, a graceful seven-room haven in a renovated 1960s modernist house. While Viroth’s does not promote itself as a gay hotel per se, the owners Fabien Martial and Kol Viroth do nothing to hide their 10-year relationship.And the word seems to be out. On a recent Friday night, the hotel’s nearby restaurant, also called Viroth’s, was filled with a sprinkling of male couples sharing bottles of French wine and dishes like chicken curry and minced pork grilled in kaplou leaves.But for gay Khmers seeking a home, the place to be is the Golden Banana. It started as a humble B & B that opened in 2004 and has since expanded to three properties, including a stylish boutique resort with 16 rooms that feature platform beds constructed of flecked sugar palm wood and soaking tubs on the terrace.Guests might include backpackers in T-shirts or silver-haired male couples in matching polo shirts, who mingle freely at the palm- and bamboo-fringed swimming pools, sipping lime and mint iced tea. But under the direction of Dirk de Graaff, an expatriate from the Netherlands, the resort has taken on a second role: as a sanctuary for young Cambodian men exploring their sexual identity.IN a poor country where traditional family remains strong, young Cambodians are encouraged to marry and have children early. Many same-sex couples in Siem Reap still keep their relationship a secret; some have wives for appearance’s sake. Khmer men who visit gay saunas often conceal their faces behind motorcycle helmets until they’re safely inside. And lesbians remain largely invisible.Still, things are looking up for the city’s younger gay generation. On a recent evening, young staff members from the Golden Banana — which include both straight and gay men in their early 20s — were laughing it up at the newly opened Heart Rock Bar, an unpretentious dance club across the street from Miss Wong that’s become a popular spot for gay men.Beyond the glow-in-the-dark hearts on the walls and the stainless-steel cocktail tables, the dark and spacious club offered little décor or ambience, but the crowd of mostly younger Cambodian men didn’t seem to mind. They drank cans of Angkor beer, grooving to Top 40 hits by the Black Eyed Peas and Lady Gaga, smiling broadly late into the night and dancing freely with whomever they liked.IF YOU GOHOW TO GET THEREFlights to Siem Reap from New York require a stopover. A recent online search found a Korean Air flight from Kennedy Airport to Siem Reap, via Seoul, starting at about $1,500.Hotels in Siem Reap commonly give prices in U.S. dollars.The One Hotel and Hotel Be Angkor (the Passage; 855-63-965-321; theonehotelangkor.com and hotelbeangkor.com) are separate hotels with one owner in a single building.

"'10-03-22,'1','Since 2000, more people in the 25-to-39 age group have been living in their parents’ homes. By 2008, before the full effect of the recession was being felt, their ranks had increased by double-digit percentages since the decade began: by 32 percent nationwide, and by nearly 40 percent in Manhattan.In 1980, 11 percent of 25-to-34-year-olds were living in multigenerational households. By 2008, 20 percent were.These sons and daughters of baby boomers living with their parents again have been labeled boomerangers.The biggest increases were registered in these categories: nonwhite, foreign-born young men who had never been married, and college graduates.“As the great recession has deepened and the job market has become tighter and tighter for young people, most especially those from minority backgrounds, more and more return or never leave the parental nest,” said Prof. Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College of the City University of New York. “If such a trend continues or deepens, the economic crisis may be creating a true ‘Failure to Launch’ generation.”Last year, 37 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds were unemployed or no longer looking for work. Ten percent of young adults, ages 18 to 34, said in the Pew survey they had moved back with their parents because of the recession. Two in 10 are full-time students, a quarter are unemployed, and about a third said they had lived on their own before returning home.In part as a result, the portion of 18-to-29-year-olds who live alone declined to 7.3 percent in 2009 from 7.9 percent in 2007, according to the Current Population Survey. A decline that large was recorded only twice before, during or after recessions in the early 1980s and 1990s.If the numbers turn out to constitute a trend, it could signal other social implications: modestly reviving the multi-generational family and further delaying marriage and childbearing.According to the census, 56 percent of men age 18 to 24 and 48 percent of women in the same age group live under the same roof as their parents.Ashley Jain, 27, who works for a film advertising firm in the city, moved in with her parents in Guilford, Conn., after living in New York City for several years.“I moved back home in September mainly to start creating that ‘nest egg,’ ” she said. “Living in New York as a young 20-something isn’t very conducive to saving money, and especially after the recession hit, it made me all the more determined to save away a serious amount of money.”Ms. Bacchus, the City University graduate student, said living in her parents’ house had not affected her social life. “I live in the basement of the house, and my parents converted it into an apartment with a separate entrance,” she said.“My parents lived with my grandmother briefly in Guyana before they migrated to England and then America,” she added. “Their experience living under the same roof with my father’s family enabled them to understand the significance of granting me personal space within their household.”Katherine Brezler, 27, returned to her parents’ co-op apartment in White Plains because she could not afford her own place while she was student teaching and studying for her master’s. Now that she has a full-time job, she is looking for a place.“We love our parents, but ‘need our space’ is the common consensus amongst my peers,” she said.Micah Thau, 25, moved back with his parents in Mountainside, N.J., in June after losing his job as an engineer in Cleveland.“It definitely has been somewhat of an awkward situation in terms of my social life,” he said. “Even though we are in a recession, it is hard to openly tell friends that I am living at home after living in Cleveland for seven years and having lost two jobs in the past year or so.”Mr. Cruz, the scuba instructor, said his family’s rent-stabilized apartment certainly was a factor in his decision to stay home, but so was his grandmother’s age, 90.“Part of me stays because of the financial benefits — I could never find an apartment like this one for even double the current rent — and part of it is that, while this might sound pessimistic, the truth is my grandmother is not going to live forever so I want to spend as much time with her as possible so no regrets later on,” he said.Mr. Cruz also saw the bright side in living with relatives instead of friends. “It’s kind of like having roommates,” he said, “except they won’t disappear without paying their share of the bills.”'"
"'10-03-22,'1','Boeheim simply reminded us of the realities of the game. A more troubling assessment was offered by Russell Smith, the coach of the New York Gauchos, one of the major arteries in New York’s Amateur Athletic Union scene.Smith essentially criticized Roberts for being too laid-back, for not playing the game. “You got to hustle, bend some rules or do something,” Smith said.Most programs in this N.C.A.A. tournament, from Gonzaga and St. Mary’s to Syracuse and Kentucky, rely on A.A.U. affiliations for a supply of talent.At some programs, there is an accepted give and take, ranging from A.A.U. coaches getting employment within the university to an illicit exchange of money.Recruiting through the A.A.U. has become a fact of life, although some coaches, like Gonzaga’s Mark Few, try to limit their reliance. “I just chose to stay out of it,” he said.For a coach with integrity, bending the rules is problematic. Can you win without operating in a gray area?You have to talk to A.A.U. coaches, Boeheim said. “That doesn’t mean you have to go in a gray area — I don’t even know what that means,” he said. “Bend the rules, I don’t know what that is. You can’t bend the rules; you either break it or you don’t. There is not bending to me. You either do or don’t.”There is a story told of the time this season that Roberts met with a McDonald’s all-American from New York about attending St. John’s. Roberts told the recruit that he would play behind the incumbent, and the recruit’s mother, who was in the meeting, hit the ceiling.Kenny Charles, a major figure in the New York City youth basketball scene, said Roberts should have told the recruit that in all likelihood he would be starting. “You could say that’s bending the rules because typically a coach won’t say, ‘You’re going to start,’ ” Charles said. “That’s a kid you can bend the rules for without breaking the rules: Look, you come here and you’re starting. That might be bending the rules you normally use, but in that case, that’s what you needed to do.”The A.A.U. circuit does not encourage the sense of discipline or obligation that players presumably receive during their high school seasons.“You don’t have to even go to high school,” Rob Murphy, a Syracuse assistant and a former A.A.U. coach, said. “You can play A.A.U. ball, you don’t need a 2.0, you don’t have to get up and go to class. On game day, you don’t have to make sure you attend every class or you can’t play in that game at 4 o’clock or 7 p.m. You just kind of practice and travel.”In this respect, the A.A.U. system, which began as a sort of trust to protect the interests of young players and their communities, has become part of the problem.“It’s a different mind-set that you put into the kids early, and if you don’t have a person around them that keeps them grounded, it hurts their mind-set going forward,” Murphy said.You have one A.A.U. coach advocating bending the rules in exchange for winning talent. And Charles bluntly spells out the rules of the road in New York for Roberts’s successor. “For good or for bad, we are who we are,” he said. “If you’re the faint of heart, you should not apply.”The early name surfacing for the job is Paul Hewitt, Georgia Tech’s coach. Charles said Hewitt was a favorite of the A.A.U. community, but who calls the tune? The N.C.A.A. has an ocean of rules already, but it has to take on the unwieldy, largely unregulated world of A.A.U. basketball. Especially the coaches.“There are a lot of great ones,” Murphy said of A.A.U. coaches, “but there’s a lot of them who won’t deal with you unless it’s going to benefit them. Sad to say, it’s the nature of the business. That’s just how it is. I tell people the game of basketball is crazy.”The bracket part of March Madness is exciting; the business of college basketball continues to be beyond belief.'"
"'10-03-22,'1','That reflects where Haiti is now, too, as it awaits a March 31 international donors’ conference in New York with the hope of kick-starting the reconstruction effort.Although the country has taken a giant step beyond the shock and grief of the disaster, many here feel that inertia has taken hold, symbolized by the presidential palace, which looms like a smashed wedding cake over a capital still filled with rubble.“Where do we go from here?” asked Jean Noel François, an elected official from the Delmas municipality who has assumed the role of unofficial mayor in the Pétionville camp, ministering to his constituents from a tent under a tamarind tree. “That is what I asked President René Préval when I went to see him: What is the plan?”Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, who set up a Haiti fund at President Obama’s request, are scheduled to visit Haiti together on Monday to discuss recovery plans in advance of the donors’ conference. According to a draft summary of the Haitian government’s damage and needs assessment released last week, Haiti will need $11.5 billion to build anew.Before long-term reconstruction begins, though, Haiti faces the challenge of managing a displaced population of about 1.2 million temporarily resettled in some 460 encampments in the Port-au-Prince area. About 40 percent still do not have tents or tarpaulins.The rainy season, which officially begins in April but offered a preview on Friday when rain swamped tent cities, has the potential to wreak havoc on the many spontaneous settlements in areas prone to flooding or mudslides.Some of the largest and most overcrowded camps, like the one at the Pétionville Club, have been identified by bureaucrats for “decongestion.” Yet for the moment, these same tent cities continue to mushroom as a result of the food, water, sanitation and medical services provided them by international groups.At the Pétionville Club, Catholic Relief Services has registered 7,352 families and provided almost all of them with shelter kits — tarps, nails and rope — and 30-day rations of food (fortified bulgur, green peas, a corn-soy blend and vegetable oil).Hundreds of American troops were stationed at the camp until they started pulling out earlier this month. Now an unarmed Haitian security force, composed of about 200 volunteers wearing neon yellow vests, patrols the golf course, trying to mediate disputes.“We get a lot of cases: men beating up women, women beating up other women, people biting off other peoples’ ears,” said Romulus Renald Black, one of the volunteers. “We bring them into our security tent, judge them, and, if it’s a big case, we call in the police.”Another patrolman said that there had been several rapes and assaults but only one killing. As to the number of ear bitings, Mr. Black said, “You’d be surprised.”“Given the conditions, it has been remarkably calm and brotherly here,” said Clerveau Rodrigue, who has emerged as one of the camp’s leaders.The camp vibrates with activity, including Israeli-run classrooms and International Medical Corps-staffed health clinics. Women cook and clean, sweeping the loose dirt from their tents in what seems like a Sisyphean task. Men dig drains around their shelters. Boys build toy cars from plastic bottles, with buttons for wheels. Girls fetch water, chop callaloo leaves, jump rope. Babies, naked on the ground, eat dirt.Everything is for sale, like hair extensions in baggies and padlocks for the wooden doors that many have installed in their tarp-covered shelters. Inside a United States Agency for International Development tent outfitted with freshly made benches and a flat-screen television, one entrepreneur charges about 12 cents for screenings of a “Terminator” movie and the Malaysian kung fu film “Kinta.” Another young businessman rents out his Playstation in one of the designated “child safe” areas, a green netting atop four poles. A woman runs a bar atop a crate.At one end of what has become the camp’s main street, Mr. François has installed himself in a makeshift City Hall, with a dozen green wheelbarrows parked outside, the camp’s garbage trucks.“Everyone here has a problem, and they need their representative,” he said. “It’s ‘I need water, delegate. I need food, delegate.’ I have 400 trash pickup jobs to give out every day, and 5,000 people who line up to get them.”Moving families from encampments like the Pétionville Club entails finding and preparing some 1,500 acres of land — one relocation site recently opened and another is being prepared — and then persuading people to move outside the metropolitan area, international groups say. It will be an undertaking.“We understand we’re on private property here, but any kind of relocation is going to have to be really well planned,” Mr. Rodrigue said. “It will be like moving a town at this point.”'"
"'10-03-22,'1','Still, informal bargaining on the makeup of a governing coalition has already begun, and it will most likely begin in earnest on Saturday.Despite the calls for a recount, the election commission again rejected the idea on Sunday. A spokesman said the commission would conduct its own investigation, but that it would be impossible to recheck each ballot as some parties had demanded.Elections officials have pointed out that the count is being monitored by international observers, as well as by representatives of each political party.Mr. Maliki’s statement, which did not directly call for a recount, invoked his position as commander in chief of the military and seemed to imply violence would ensue without a new count. In a message posted on his Web site late Saturday, he said that election officials were obligated to respond to calls for a recount, including by members of his coalition.He said a response from election authorities was necessary to “protect political stability and to prevent a deterioration of the security situation that could lead to a return of violence.”His message came shortly after election results released Saturday night showed his coalition had fallen behind Mr. Allawi’s, after having been ahead the previous day. Last week, when he was leading, he dismissed allegations of fraud that had been made by other political groups, saying irregularities had not been significant enough to affect the result.In the southern city of Najaf on Sunday, 10 governors, all members of Mr. Maliki’s coalition, held a rally to demand a recount. One sign read, “No, no to the stealing of people’s votes.”But Intisar Allawi, a member of Mr. Allawi’s Iraqiya coalition, which has registered its own complaints about alleged election irregularities, said that Mr. Maliki’s message “represented a clear threat to the election commission.”“This kind of statement could take us back to terrorism and violence,” she said.Mr. Talabani’s statement on Sunday called for a recount to “avoid any confusion or doubt” about the results.Although the presidency does not wield the power of the prime minister, Mr. Talabani, a Kurd, is seen by many Iraqis as a more neutral figure than some of the politicians who have been calling for a recount lately.But Mr. Talabani may have his own reasons for wanting a recount. His party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, is part of a Kurdish political alliance that is trailing Mr. Allawi’s coalition in Kirkuk Province by about 3,000 votes. Kirkuk, which is contested by Kurds, Turkmens and Arabs, sits atop billions of barrels of oil.'"

Bestiaries were filled with images of mythical beasts and woefully distorted pictures of real creatures. Renaissance artists transformed the visualization of nature by putting more care into making their pictures accurate. The finest example of this new kind of art, a 4,500-page tome called ""The Histories of Animals,"" was published by the Swiss physician Conrad Gessner in the mid-1500s.Gessner hired masters of woodcutting to make lavish illustrations for his book. Whenever possible, Gessner had them work from actual specimens. But Gessners artists couldnt go to the Arctic or to Africa, so they still had to rely on second-hand information for exotic species. Gessners masterpiece is a transitional mix of the modern and the mythical.Text by Carl Zimmer and Brian Ogilvie, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts.'"

"'10-03-23,'1','Some liberals, however, already have begun mobilizing to oppose any changes to Social Security benefits, arguing that the program does not face an imminent crisis. A group called Social Security Works began forming in January, with financing from Atlantic Philanthropies, and is seeking alliances with other groups.In Congress, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and other Democratic leaders, who last year quashed White House talk of forming a Social Security task force, are not likely to be eager after the 14-month battle over health care to confront so controversial an issue, certainly not before November’s elections.Yet Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the moderate Democrat who is the House majority leader, gave a speech this month in which he called for the two parties to compromise on a mix of tax increases and benefit reductions to avert fiscal chaos. Among his options were proposals to gradually raise the retirement age for future Social Security recipients and to reduce benefits for those with high incomes.Early signs of disagreement have also been evident in the White House between members of the economic team, who generally favor addressing Social Security’s finances, and the political advisers, who resist it.The president’s debt-reduction commission is likely to force the issue, even though it is not required to report its recommendations to Congress until Dec. 1, weeks after this year’s midterm Congressional elections.Erskine B. Bowles, a former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton who is the commission co-chairman along with Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, said: “As Senator Simpson and I have said all along, everything is on the table. No one has mentioned to me taking anything off the table.”Mr. Simpson said Mr. Obama had in fact agreed that everything was on the table. Actuaries from the Social Security Administration will be among the experts the commission will call upon for help, he said.Because 14 of the 18 commission members are required to agree on any recommendation to Congress, few people think the panel’s Democrats and Republicans will succeed in coalescing around a package of both short-term and long-range deficit reductions, as Mr. Obama directed. Yet some Democrats in the administration and in Congress say they privately expect that some proposals, including on Social Security, could well end up in Mr. Obama’s budget early next year.“Whether or not the budget commission reaches a conclusion, and I think the odds have to be against that, Obama is going to have to say something about the long-term budget, and ignoring Social Security altogether is not politically possible if you want to do that,” said Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, who has defended the program against deep cuts or privatization but acknowledges that it is not sustainable without some combination of benefit cuts or tax increases.By 2016, Social Security will begin paying more in benefits than it collects in payroll taxes, according to the annual report of government trustees; reserves in the form of government i.o.u.’s will be exhausted by 2037, after which incoming taxes will cover three-quarters of benefits.Before his inauguration, Mr. Obama said of Social Security, “We have to signal seriousness in this by making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my watch, not someone else’s.”Similarly, some Democrats argue that their party should act now, while it controls the White House and Congress, rather than take the chance that Republicans will regain power and try to carve private retirement accounts from Social Security, as former President George W. Bush did unsuccessfully.Proponents of acting soon also argue that changes to benefits or taxes could be delayed so that current retirees and those nearing retirement are unaffected, and yet the promise of future reductions would immediately reassure global markets fretful that the United States’ debt is already its highest since World War II.An agreement on Social Security “would send a very important signal to the world,” said Robert D. Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director.That argument appeals to Mr. Obama, say Democrats who have spoken with him, and at the same time fits with advisers’ image of the president as someone who does not play “small ball” but seeks transformational changes.The administration includes several economists who are authorities on Social Security, including Peter R. Orszag, the budget director; Jeffrey Liebman, an associate budget director; and Jason Furman, deputy director of the National Economic Council.“Three of the best minds and prolific authors on Social Security among Democratic economists are all working for the White House,” said an adviser to Congressional leaders, who asked to remain anonymous to talk candidly. “So it’s natural that there has been a lot of thought given internally to different ways we could deal with Social Security.”'"
"'10-03-23,'1','But doctors soon found that beta blockers could be useful for treating heart attacks and heart rhythm abnormalities and lowering high blood pressure. Not only did the drugs help relieve angina pain, they also lowered death rates. Moreover, beta blockers are sometimes used to treat migraine headaches and anxiety, among other conditions.Dr. Black started out working in academia. But in 1958 he went against the academic grain by moving to a drug company. “One thing was clear at that time: going into industry was a no-no,” he said in an interview in Molecular Interventions, a journal published by the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics in Bethesda, Md. “If you were a good scientist, you didn’t go into industry.”But circumstances had left him little choice. In 1958, Dr. Black sought a grant from Imperial Chemical Industries to pursue his goal of developing a beta blocker. The company said it would be easier if he worked with others at its new campus instead of his laboratory at the University of Glasgow. Dr. Black agreed and went on to become one of the rare scientists to receive a Nobel Prize for work performed in industry. The two scientists with whom he shared the prize, Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings, who discovered different drugs, also worked for industry.In the research that led to propanolol, Dr. Black picked up on a theory that had been developed by Raymond Ahlquist and that others had ignored for years. Dr. Ahlquist proposed that there were two different receptors, alpha and beta, and that they caused different responses in heart muscle.Dr. Black focused on the beta receptors, the sites on heart muscle cells to which the stress hormones adrenalin and noradrenalin bind to make the heart work harder. Blocking the beta receptor would have a calming effect, Dr. Black reasoned.At the same time he sought a drug to relieve the pain of angina, which results from oxygen deprivation in the heart. Other research was aimed at increasing the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Dr. Black’s alternative strategy was to create a drug that would decrease the heart’s requirement for oxygen. The Nobel committee said he was the first scientist to recognize such an alternative therapeutic strategy for angina.The committee also cited him for developing drugs through a rational process based on the understanding of basic biochemical and physiological processes, rather than through the way most drugs were developed — through happenstance or the chemical modification of natural products.In a lecture in accepting the prize, in Stockholm, Dr. Black said he had to start cold in his quest because no compounds known at that time could diminish adrenalin’s actions on the heart.In 1962, Dr. Black’s team created one agent, pronethalol, which confirmed Dr. Ahlquist’s concept but which could not be marketed because of its toxic effects. Dr. Black went on to create propanolol in 1964. It was not approved for use in the United States until 1973.From 1964 to 1973, Dr. Black was head of biological research at Smith, Kline and French. There he also investigated the effects of a natural substance found in the body, histamine, which, among other things, stimulates the secretion of acid in the stomach, a factor in ulcers. At the time, histamine’s effects could be only partly blocked by antihistamines and none of the drugs then available could block histamine’s role in acid production.In this research, Dr. Black applied the same method he used in beta-blocker experiments. This time the target was the H-2 receptor. He came up with cimetidine, or Tagamet.That development took 14 years, in part because for a long time Dr. Black’s team misled itself in testing 700 compounds by using too small an amount of histamine to have the intended effect.Cimetidine revolutionized the treatment of ulcers by curbing stomach acidity to permit the healing of ulcers quickly and painlessly. The drug significantly decreased the need for surgery for perforated and bleeding ulcers.A further major advance in ulcer treatment came in the 1980s when two Australian researchers, Dr. Barry J. Marshall and Dr. J. Robin Warren, discovered that a bacterial infection, Helicobacter pylori, was a cause of stomach ulcers. Treatment then emphasized the use of antibiotic drugs.James Whyte Black was born on June 14, 1924 in Uddington, Scotland, near Glasgow. He was the fourth of five brothers in what he described as “a staunch Baptist home” where music held a central place. James was raised in Fife where his father was a mining engineer and colliery manager.Dr. Black said he lived an unplanned life, coasting and daydreaming through most of his school years. He went into medicine, he said, largely because he was excited by the physiology textbooks that an older brother, William, a doctor, brought home. James said he learned disciplined study while earning a medical degree from the University of St. Andrews.He graduated in debt and found academic opportunities “pitiful.” So he went to Singapore, where he was a lecturer in physiology at the University of Malaya from 1947 to 1950.On returning to England, he knocked on doors at physiology departments in London and by chance met a professor who sent Dr. Black to the newly appointed director of the University of Glasgow Veterinary School. Dr. Black accepted the challenge of leading its department of physiology, and, over the next eight years, built the department from scratch while learning how to be an experimenter.Dr. Black said that because he never had formal training in experimental science, he had to pick it up and make his own laboratory equipment.In 1973, Dr. Black moved to head the department of physiology at University College, London. In 1978, he moved again, to direct therapeutic research at the Wellcome Research Laboratory.In his autobiography for the Nobel Foundation, he described the experience as an emotional roller coaster, saying that “entrenched attitudes can absorb reformist efforts like a punching bag.”In 1984, he became chairman of the pharmacology department at University College, London, where he stayed until moving to Dundee.His wife, Hilary, died in 1986. They had a daughter, Stephanie. Information about survivors was not available. In 1976, Dr. Black won a Lasker Award and in 1991 was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in the United States. He was knighted in 1981. In 2000, he was awarded Britain’s Order of Merit, a rare honor bestowed by the Queen.'"
"'10-03-23,'1','MY first memory of flying is traveling to Italy when I was about 4 years old. Despite my mother’s efforts to ensure a pleasant flight for all passengers, I was a handful. Why not pull on that older man’s hair? Why not throw my juice across the cabin while screaming at the top of my lungs? I bet if there had been “baby Ambien,” my mother might have tried it on me.At the time, we lived in Bologna and Cortina d’Ampezzo and often flew to New York. Once we moved to New York permanently, I insisted on wearing my lederhosen, which may or may not have made me the class dork for several years.When I was 23, I got my dream job at Harper’s Bazaar and traveled quite a bit for fashion shoots and award shows. The world seemed smaller, more accessible, because it was all just a ticket away.But all that changed after I injured my spinal cord in a pool diving accident. I remember being underwater. I was conscious, but couldn’t move my arms or legs. All I was thinking about was how stupid it was and how much therapy I was going to have to do.I was only 24, and I had traveled so much. And then because of an accident, I couldn’t even breathe on my own. All my previous travel seemed frivolous, but thinking about it over the next several years was a welcome respite from my reality.One of my doctors in New York told me about an experimental procedure in Belgium. It seemed like a good idea, but the last thing I wanted to do was get on a plane. Several years later, though, I did go to China and Germany and underwent some experimental work. Now I have use of my arms, abdominal muscles and lungs. My fine motor skills are getting better and I’m even starting to use my legs.A few years ago, I started my own business. And I have to travel quite a bit to meetings, along with my assistant.Since I can’t stand up and move around, I always travel business class. At least that way, I can change position by lying down.A lot of people complain about business travel. Considering that I once thought I’d never do much of anything again, I love business travel. The airlines and crew have always been very helpful. I’ve had airline captains come out and help me and make sure everything was O.K. I appreciate it.But I also make sure that I don’t cause any other passenger any delays by arriving very early so I can get on the plane with no hassle. I think I’m trying to make up for that first flight so many years ago when I annoyed my fellow travelers.Sometimes passengers want to talk to me. Once I tell my story, we talk about other things, like business. Some people might think that’s boring, but for me it’s really life-affirming.Accidents like this don’t necessarily make people braver or role models. Eight years later, I’m still the same idiot I always was. I laugh at the same kinds of jokes and still like the same kinds of movies I did before my accident. And like everybody else in business class, I just want my business to be successful. On a recent trip, several flight attendants recognized me and made a point of telling me they liked my company’s lip balm.That was just so cool. It shows that life really can go on, no matter what. And I really believe that all the travel I’ve done helps me keep that attitude. Who knows? Maybe someday I’ll be lucky enough to have a business meeting in Bermuda.'"
"'10-03-23,'1','The grand New York City taxi fraud may not be as grand as officials first thought.After announcing that tens of thousands of cabbies had cheated passengers by improperly flipping on an out-of-town meter rate, the chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission said on Monday that “a fairly significant number” of the incidents resulted in no additional charges, suggesting they might have been simple mistakes.Many cabbies apparently changed to the higher out-of-city rate only at the end of the ride, possibly when trying to shut off the meter, according to a two-month sample of GPS data reviewed by the city. Because the cab had already come to a stop, no additional charges were incurred after the meter was switched.The findings, disclosed in testimony by Matthew W. Daus, the commission chairman, at a City Council hearing Monday, appeared to buttress the argument of many taxi drivers who scoffed at the existence of such a widespread scheme.“We have been vindicated,” said Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a drivers’ group. Ms. Desai has said the taxi commission acted irresponsibly in implicating such a wide swath of the city’s cabbies.In an interview, Mr. Daus said the initial numbers released by his office reflected a “worst-case scenario,” but he felt compelled to alert the public. “We never said all the drivers are guilty; we never said that,” he said.'"
"'10-03-23,'1','More money would be levied on banks with high-risk businesses, she said, to ensure that the policy worked to counter speculative activity by banks.During the financial crisis, the German government rescued the lenders IKB and Hypo Real Estate with billions of euros in capital and guarantees. The government also took a 25 percent stake in Commerzbank, bolstering its capital. Britain nationalized the lender Royal Bank of Scotland and supported other banks including Lloyds.France helped to rescue Dexia, which lends mainly to municipalities, with a capital injection and engineered a merger between two savings banks, Banque Populaire and the Caisse d’Épargne.The American proposal would aim to recover the billions in government funds spent bailing out giant lenders like Citigroup and Bank of America. It would remain in place for at least 10 years and would be levied on all financial institutions with more than $50 billion in assets, at 0.15 percent of covered liabilities.Further details were left to Congress, where a fierce fight is expected.The German cabinet is working on details of its plan and aims to fix the amount of the tax and other details at a meeting on March 31, the spokeswoman said. The country is willing to proceed with its own plans even if a global agreement is not forthcoming, she said.In Britain, Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer, is expected to endorse a similar tax in his budget proposals being announced on Wednesday, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan.A spokesman for the British Treasury said that Prime Minister Gordon Brown was an early proponent of such a tax. But he added, “Any proposal needs to be implemented by all responsible financial centers to be effective.”David Cameron, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, who hold a slight edge in polls just months before a general election, came out with an even stronger endorsement of the plan this weekend.“We had the biggest bank bailout in the world; we can’t just carry on as if nothing happened,” Mr. Cameron said in a speech. “A Conservative government will introduce a new bank levy to pay back taxpayers for the support they gave and to protect them in the future.”“It won’t be popular in every part of the City,” he said, referring to the London financial district. “But I believe it’s fair and it’s necessary.”In a statement Monday, the British Bankers’ Association said “any further reforms need to be timely, considered and internationally coordinated so they do not restrict credit to individuals and businesses as recovery picks up speed.”A French official, who was not permitted to speak publicly, said the government had no imminent plans for legislation on the matter and would first consult with international partners. The French economy minister plans to attend the German cabinet meeting at which the bank levy will be discussed on March 31.Analysts say that American lawmakers could yet block Mr. Obama’s plans to tax banks.“There are two dimensions — paying for the past and paying for the future,” said Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “It’s not yet clear that either will pass in the U.S. The whole financial reform package is somewhat up in the air.”'"
"'10-03-23,'1','Continuing to operate a chronically delayed flight will be considered “an unfair and deceptive practice,” under the new requirements, and subject to regulatory penalties. And airlines will have to publish contact information for consumer complaints on their Web sites and all e-ticket confirmations.The Transportation Department is also requiring airlines to publish plans outlining how they will deal with long tarmac delays. Besides giving passengers the option to get off a plane after three hours (with exceptions for safety and security reasons), airlines will have to provide food, drinking water, working lavatories and medical attention.The Transportation Department is considering extending the deadline for publishing flight delay data until June 14, to give the airlines more time to update their ticket databases.In addition, JetBlue, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have sought a separate extension on the tarmac delay provisions for their operations at Kennedy Airport in New York, arguing that the closing of the main runway there until July 1 for resurfacing was likely to worsen delays. Continental Airlines then asked for an extension at Newark Liberty International and La Guardia Airports, saying the runway’s closing would also worsen delays at those airports because they share airspace.Bill Mosley, a spokesman for the department, said those requests were still under review, but he did clarify a misunderstanding over reports that the airlines would be fined $27,500 for each passenger — millions of dollars for a large plane — if they violated the three-hour tarmac delay rule.“That’s the maximum fine for all aviation consumer-type violations — it’s not strictly related to this rule,” he said. “In almost every case, the maximum is not assessed. The department and the carrier agree to a compromise penalty to avoid litigation.”In fact, recent penalties from the agency have been far more modest, like the $175,000 in total fines levied against Continental, ExpressJet and Mesaba for poor handling of a flight diverted to Rochester, Minn., last August that stranded passengers on board overnight. It was the agency’s first penalty related to a tarmac delay.The aviation consumer protection Web site, airconsumer.dot.gov, has been redesigned to make it easier for passengers to file complaints.“The Obama administration believes that airline passengers have rights, and airlines have the obligation to respect those rights,” Mr. Mosley said.While it is difficult to predict what will happen in spring and summer thunderstorms — the worst time for long tarmac delays — statistics show delays have been less common lately, nationally and at Kennedy.According to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, there were 196 tarmac delays of three hours or more at Kennedy in 2009, but just 11 in the last four months of the year. But there were 713 tarmac delays of two to three hours at Kennedy, including 90 in the last quarter of 2009. Those numbers suggest that with the runway closing, some delays could tip over into violations.It would be counterproductive to waive the rule at an airport likely to have delays, said Kate Hanni, founder of FlyersRights.org, who has fought for the tarmac rule since she was stuck on a plane for more than nine hours in 2006.The group is still asking Congress to pass a similar three-hour delay provision, which is under consideration as part of the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization. “Any change of leadership at D.O.T. could change this rule, but a Congressional law is permanent,” Ms. Hanni said. “Airlines simply don’t want to make the fundamental changes they need to make to fix the problem,” she said. “The solution is to reschedule flights so they’re more evenly distributed throughout the day, or schedule bigger planes.”'"
"'10-03-23,'1','“They had some pretty serious investigating,” said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, an opponent of earmarks who voted against creating Mr. Wise’s office but has since offered praise. “There is an impact, and it was certainly felt in this case.”Just a month ago, Mr. Wise was telling colleagues that he was dispirited that the House ethics panel, the jury of sorts for the cases he brings, was repeatedly brushing aside or playing down his office’s findings. More recently, he has described himself as surprised but gratified by the unexpected results.“I went into it believing this was a way to make a contribution to the House, and I think we have,” he said in an interview, where he avoided discussing his relationship with the ethics committee. “We provide increased transparency and accountability in how the House handles ethics.”His critics, of course, think otherwise.“They are a very arrogant, dangerous little outfit,” said Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who defended one House member cleared by the ethics committee. “They are a rogue operation that needs to be shut down.”Mr. Wise’s office met resistance from the start. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, vowing to “drain the swamp that is Washington, D.C.,” had to twist arms to get enough votes to create the office in 2008. Before, the ethics committee often failed to open investigations of members unless a case was so egregious, like making sexual advances to House pages, that it could not be ignored. Now, outside watchdog groups can petition Mr. Wise’s office to open an inquiry.If the office finds troubling evidence, with the support of a board that hired Mr. Wise and oversees his work, it refers the matter to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, the formal name of the ethics panel, for further action.The committee has stepped up its own inquiries, too. As of January, 36 House members were under investigation, by far the most in more than a decade, according to its chairwoman, Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California. The panel is also doubling the size of its staff.“We take every allegation seriously and look at everything that comes before us rigorously,” Ms. Lofgren said.The flurry of investigations pushed by Mr. Wise and the six-member board that oversees his work has inspired an angry reaction from some senior members in Congress and defense lawyers, who argue that Mr. Wise and his colleagues sometimes ignore rules governing his inquiries and unfairly accuse House members of wrongdoing.“They have alienated and disenfranchised a lot of parties they have had to work with,” said Elliot S. Berke, who defended Representative Sam Graves, Republican of Missouri, against conflict-of-interest accusations from the ethics office.Mr. Berke and other lawyers said they had begun to advise their clients to not cooperate with Mr. Wise’s office, which does not have subpoena power.Mr. Wise, a Harvard Law School graduate and a registered Democrat, arrived at the House from the Justice Department where he helped win convictions in five major cases, including one against Enron executives.His record is now far different: Of the 12 cases he had referred to the ethics committee by last December, so far all but one House member has been cleared, while three of those cases are pending.While Mr. Wise claimed that Mr. Graves appeared to have a conflict of interest by inviting a business partner of his wife to testify at a House hearing on alternative fuels, the ethics committee threw out the case, calling it “fundamentally flawed.”Similarly, the committee dismissed a case involving Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, who was accused of improperly applying for a property tax credit in Maryland even though he is a legal resident of California, saying the accusation “is not borne out by the facts.”The committee decision that produced the biggest repercussions came late last month, when panel members cleared two congressmen of accusations that they had traded earmarks — money for pet projects that is awarded in no-bid contracts — for campaign contributions.Mr. Wise’s report on the case — based on dozens of interviews and a review of 200,000 pages of documents — offered an inside look at the trading that goes on between lobbyists seeking earmarks and members of Congress.When the report created an outcry, Democratic leaders — perhaps sensing vulnerability on the issue as they approached the midterm elections — moved to ban earmarks for for-profit companies, said Mr. Flake.Some House members, upset about all the attention on ethics, have talked of scaling back the powers of Mr. Wise’s office.“These concerns will have to be addressed,” Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, told The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, late last year, after seven fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus were targets of Mr. Wise’s office.Members of the board that oversees Mr. Wise’s office have defended his actions. David Skaggs, a former Democratic House member from Colorado who now serves as the board chairman, and Porter J. Goss, a former Republican House member from Florida, have met in recent weeks with House leaders to ensure continued support.“We are still, in any kind of an historic sense, at the beginning of the experiment,” Mr. Skaggs said. “It has been a bit of a roller-coaster ride, but largely it has accomplished what the House intended.”Then he added, “This was never a popularity contest.”'"
"'10-03-23,'1','Apple’s iBookstore on the forthcoming iPad is set to get larger. The company has just signed a deal with two more independent publishers to sell electronic versions of their books on the new device.Perseus Books Group, a large independent publisher that also distributes works from 330 other smaller presses including Grove/Atlantic, Harvard Business School Press and Zagat, signed a deal last week with Apple, following five of the six biggest publishers that have already signed such agreements.Separately, Workman Publishing Company, responsible for the “What to Expect” series, novels like “Water for Elephants” and the Silver Palate cookbooks, also signed a deal with Apple.The Perseus and Workman agreements come as Amazon.com, the largest e-book seller in the United States and the maker of the Kindle e-reader, is pressuring publishers that have not yet signed deals with Apple to refrain from doing so. With Apple’s iPad coming on the scene, Amazon is fighting to keep as much of its market lead as possible.Publishers have provisionally welcomed Apple’s entry into the market because Apple is allowing them to set consumer prices, within limits. Publishers have had no control over prices at Amazon, which has generally sold new releases and best sellers for $9.99, a price that publishers feared would erode profits in the long term.Like the other publishers who have already signed with Apple, Perseus and Workman will set consumer prices and Apple will serve as an agent, taking a 30 percent commission on each sale. E-book versions of most newly released adult general fiction and nonfiction with comparable hardcovers will cost $12.99 to $14.99. All publishers whose books are distributed by Perseus will be allowed to opt into the deal.'"
"'10-03-23,'1','Tony Kushner’s latest play, “The Intelligent Homosexual’s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism With a Key to the Scriptures,” his first epic-size work about American life since his Pulitzer Prize-winning “Angels in America” in the early 1990s, will have its New York premiere next spring in a co-production by the Public Theater and the Signature Theater Company, the two theaters announced Monday.The play, which explores politics, marriage, sex, radicalism and the labor movement under the roof of a retired longshoreman’s Brooklyn brownstone, was first produced under a commission from the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis as part of a festival of Kushner plays last year. Michael Greif (“Rent,” “Next to Normal”) directed the Guthrie production, as he will the new one, which will run in the Public’s 299-seat Newman Theater from March 22 to June 12, 2011. The production is expected to cost slightly less than $1 million, with the Public and the Signature, both not-for-profit companies, sharing the cost.After the Guthrie production, which had a running time of three and a half hours, Mr. Kushner said he began reworking the play by “moving huge pieces around and making all sorts of changes” based on conversations with Mr. Greif, the cast, artists at the Guthrie and others, he said in an interview on Monday.He continued reshaping the play in a two-week workshop at the Public Theater in September and during talks with the artistic directors of the Public and Signature, Oskar Eustis and James Houghton, and the producer Scott Rudin, who would mount any commercial production.Mr. Kushner said that the scope and themes of the play, and its 11 characters, remain intact from the Guthrie production, but that the script has also been influenced by his recent work editing volumes of plays by Arthur Miller.'"
"'10-03-23,'1','“What happened was that at that time, it was considered necessary, to demonstrate fertilization, that you identify the tail of the sperm in the egg,” he said. “We were never able see a tail and therefore we did not claim fertilization.”He said the images showed pronuclei (the nucleus of sperm and egg during the process of fertilization), currently considered sufficient criteria for fertilization.Even though he had grown accustomed to public rancor over his research and operations, nothing was as fierce as the American opposition to his in vitro fertilization clinic, he said. He opened the clinic in 1979 after he and his wife, who died in 2005, retired from Johns Hopkins. (There had been mandatory retirement at age 65). They were offered positions to chair the obstetrics and gynecology department at the newly created Eastern Virginia Medical School.The initial effort to get approval for his clinic failed because abortion opponents worried about the destruction of unused embryos. After the Jones Institute at Eastern Virginia Medical School opened in Norfolk, he said picketers tried to block patients from entering.In the beginning, the Joneses would allow only women without fallopian tubes to participate in studies to ensure that any potential pregnancies resulted from in vitro fertilization and did not occur naturally. (Many of the patients had had their fallopian tubes removed because of infection or other diseases.)The Joneses had 41 failures before their first success. In the days before hormones were used to prompt the ovary to spew several eggs, and before the use of high-tech imaging machines, in vitro fertilization was far trickier. Doctors had only one egg per month to try to fertilize — unlike today when they give women drugs to release upward of a half-dozen oocytes or more.Also, without ultrasound to peer into the reproductive tract, they relied on circumstantial evidence (examining cervix mucus and cervical dilatation) to try to estimate the time of ovulation. Today, drug combinations manipulate a woman’s cycle so she can ovulate at a predictable time.In one of Dr. Jones’s earlier attempts, doctors planned an egg retrieval at 1 a.m., when the woman was supposed to ovulate. The goal was to get the oocyte before it was released from the ovary. But a snowstorm delayed the patient and most of the medical team from arriving at the hospital on time. So, he said, after she arrived, he suctioned fluid from the area near the ovary and found the oocyte. Dr. Jones said he believed that was the first time anyone had ever seen an egg immediately after ovulation.Still the woman did not get pregnant.Despite general medical consensus against hormone drugs, he said that Dr. Seeger Jones, his wife, had a hunch that hMG — human menopausal gonadotropin — which prompts the release of several eggs, would increase the odds of success. They gave patients seven ampules per cycle, which could prompt the release of about three eggs. They had 12 failed in vitro fertilization attempts before the first patient, Judith Carr, got the drugs and then got pregnant.During Ms. Carr’s pregnancy, Dr. Jones said doctors worried because the fetus’s head measured on the low end of normal. On the day of Ms. Carr’s scheduled Cesarean section, with a news conference scheduled afterward, Dr. Jones prepared a statement should the baby be born unhealthy.“The note said ‘We had been terribly distressed to find that the child was abnormal and we request privacy for the family,’ and it also said ‘We had three other pregnancies in route and they all seem to be normal and we hope this individual situation was single aberration,’ ” he said. “I had this in my pocket, and fortunately it wasn’t necessary, and I threw it out on the way home.”Dr. Jones said Ms. Carr had a Cesarean section because they wanted to make sure the baby was not hurt in the birth canal. Elizabeth Carr was born healthy at 7:46 a.m. Dec. 28, 1981, two days before Dr. Jones’s 71st birthday.The two still stay in touch.“He’s like a grandparent,” Elizabeth Carr Comeau said. “We have this relationship where I don’t think of him as a doctor — even though he did really amazing things to get me here.”Arthur Caplan, a professor of bioethics and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, credits Dr. Jones’s “conservative demeanor” as paving the way for acceptance of reproductive technology.“He had the virtues that cleared the path,” he said. “He was a good parent, happily married.”With great foresight, Dr. Jones saw a need for an ethics panel and in 1984, started the ethics committee under the umbrella of the American Fertility Society, now called the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.He bemoaned the rise of commercial competition among doctors in the field. In the early days “the spirit was trying to help each other,” he said.“I regret the disappearance of that,” Dr. Jones said. “I’m disappointed at the overcommercialization, but I think this applies to medicine in general and this specialty in particular.”He spends winters in Colorado, close to two of his three children, in his home decorated with family photographs and memorabilia from his travels. He also has seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. The rest of the year he is in Norfolk, Va., still working at the Jones Institute.This year, he co-wrote, with Susan Crockin, an expert in reproductive technology law, “Legal Conceptions: The Evolving Law and Policy of Assisted Reproductive Technologies.” Currently he is working on a chapter about assisted reproduction technology regulations worldwide. Six years ago, he self-published “War and Love,” about his years as a surgeon in World War II and his correspondence — love letters, really — between him and Dr. Seeger Jones, a renowned endocrinologist, who died March 26, 2005, at age 92.Dr. Jones believes that young fertility investigators today should figure out which one embryo is likely to make a baby rather than transfer several. That will reduce costs, the number of multiples births and significantly increase success rates of in vitro fertilization, which currently hover around 30 percent — surprisingly close to the 28 percent success rate his team was seeing in the 1980s.While Dr. Jones also wants to figure out the secrets of the aging egg, his admirers (which include a global network of his protégés) would like to know his secrets of longevity.Good genes, said Dr. Jones. He considers the issue of longevity as only a scientist would: “It’s difficult to figure out what ages people as to whether their activities influence longevity or their inabilities influence their activities. I don’t know how to unravel that mystery.”When asked about his plans for the future, he gave his typical wisecrack response: “At my age, I don’t buy green bananas.” To which his 67-year-old son, Larry, added, “He always says that, but he’s planning on attending the A.S.R.M. meeting next October in Denver,” referring to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. That would be shortly before his 100th birthday on Dec. 30.'"
"'10-03-23,'1','The Environmental Protection Agency announced on Monday that it would overhaul drinking water regulations so that officials could police dozens of contaminants simultaneously and tighten rules on the chemicals used by industries.The new policies, which are still being drawn up, will probably force some local water systems to use more effective cleaning technologies, but may raise water rates.“There are a range of chemicals that have become more prevalent in our products, our water and our bodies in the last 50 years,” the E.P.A. administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, said in a speech on Monday. Regulations have not kept pace with scientific discoveries, and so the agency is issuing “a new vision for providing clean, safe drinking water.”Along with its other steps, Ms. Jackson said the E.P.A. was readying stricter regulations on four carcinogens often detected in drinking water, including a chemical commonly used in dry cleaning.The announcements come amid growing complaints that systems across the nation are delivering tap water that poses health risks to residents. Government and other scientists have identified hundreds of chemicals that are linked to diseases in small concentrations and that are unregulated in drinking water, or policed at limits that still pose serious risks.In some instances, laws are sufficient, but they have been ignored: More than 20 percent of the nation’s water treatment systems have violated key provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act over the last five years, according to an analysis of federal data by The New York Times. And the other major water law — the Clean Water Act — has been violated more than half a million times, though few polluters were ever punished.To correct such lapses, the E.P.A. intends to reform agency policies that essentially require regulators to examine pollutants one at a time. Those adjustments will allow government scientists to evaluate large groups of similar contaminants at the same time and to issue new rules that apply to dozens of chemicals.“This is a dramatic change in how we think about regulation,” said Cynthia C. Dougherty, the director of the agency’s office of ground water and drinking water. “We’ll be able to move much faster and issue stronger rules.” The agency previously announced it was developing plans to crack down on polluters and force water systems to abide by cleanliness laws.“We lost the public over the past decade by moving slowly and focusing on solitary contaminants that most people have never heard of,” said Dr. Pankaj Parekh, director of the water quality division for Los Angeles. “This will help us talk about health impacts, rather than long, complicated chemical names.”As part of its announcement, the agency said efforts were continuing on 14 drinking water standards, including rules regarding lead, copper, arsenic, atrazine — a popular herbicide — and possibly perchlorate, an unregulated rocket fuel additive that has generated controversy in the past.“We’re happy to see this,” said Brian Ramaley, director of the Newport News Waterworks in Virginia, and a former president of the Association of Metropolitan Water Authorities. “There has been a reluctance to get tough in the past, and hopefully this signals that things have changed.”Until new policies and rules are unveiled, it is difficult to say precisely how these shifts will affect Americans. Some within the E.P.A. and Congress remain skeptical.“There is a history of this agency making big announcements, and then changing very little,” said an agency regulator who was not authorized to speak to the media. “The real test will be to see how many new chemicals have been regulated six months from now.”Currently, only 91 contaminants are regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act, though more than 60,000 chemicals are used within the United States. No chemicals have been added to that list since 2000.Any new policies will most likely force water systems to use more advanced technologies, which are often costlier.“It is always difficult to find the resources we need,” said Mr. Parekh. “But these new policies will make it a little easier to justify rate increases, because they will help us give the public a more realistic picture of what is in their water.”To that end, the agency said on Monday that it also planned to collect more state data. There is no central government database that allows officials to monitor water tests by local systems. As a result, it has often been difficult to detect national trends, or for residents to know what is flowing through their taps.Officials said the agency would develop the new rules over the next six months by consulting with outside experts and other members of the public.'"
"'10-03-23,'1','BOSTON (Reuters) — Biogen Idec, the biotechnology company, said on Monday that it had come to an agreement with the investor Carl C. Icahn under which Mr. Icahn would abandon his threatened proxy fight in return for Biogen’s acceptance of a nominee to its board.The agreement brings the number of Icahn representatives on Biogen’s board to three and heads off what would have been Mr. Icahn’s third proxy contest in three years at the company.Biogen, which makes the multiple sclerosis drugs Tysabri and Avonex, is one of the world’s biggest biotechnology companies, with revenue of $4.4 billion in 2009. Tysabri, its most important product, is made in a 50-50 partnership with the Irish drug maker Elan.In 2007, under pressure from Mr. Icahn, Biogen put itself up for sale but failed to find a buyer. The next year, Mr. Icahn started an unsuccessful effort to place three directors on the board.Undeterred, Mr. Icahn circled back last year and investors voted in two of his representatives: Alexander J. Denner, managing director of Icahn Partners, and Richard C. Mulligan, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.Biogen has now agreed to accept Eric K. Rowinsky, a cancer specialist, who was part of the Icahn team — along with Mr. Denner and Mr. Mulligan — who took control of the biotechnology company ImClone Systems in 2006. Mr. Icahn sold ImClone to Eli Lilly in 2008 for $6.5 billion.'"
"'10-03-23,'1','HONG KONG — Air pollution in Hong Kong, one of the perpetual banes of living and working in this Asian financial hub, reached record levels on Monday and remained intense on Tuesday, setting off an official government warning to avoid outdoor activities and physical exertion.Pollution levels have been elevated in the city for days, casting a gray pall over the harbor and obscuring views of Hong Kong’s famed skyline. But by Monday, Hong Kong’s official air pollution index rose further still, to the worst levels since records started being kept in 1995, said a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Department.Air pollution index levels at several measurement stations soared above the top end of the government’s 500-point air pollution index by Monday evening.Pollution levels were 12 to 14 times the amount recommended by the World Health Organization, estimated the Clean Air Network, which campaigns to inform the public on Hong Kong’s pollution issues, on Monday.By Tuesday afternoon, pollution levels were still officially classified as “severe,” with many stations showing 300 points or more.Readings of 100 or above are classified as “very high” and come with the advice that people who are sensitive to pollution should reduce outdoor activities. Anything above 200 is considered “severe,” and can lead to coughing, phlegm and sore throats, the authorities warned. The previous record was 202, set in July 2008.'"

"'10-03-24,'0','WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans on Tuesday grilled President Obama’s nominee to be the Army’s general counsel, Solomon B. Watson IV, over the publication of two articles in The New York Times disclosing classified information when Mr. Watson was the newspaper’s chief legal officer.At a confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, a series of Republicans portrayed the articles as jeopardizing national security and questioned whether Mr. Watson could be trusted to protect classified secrets.The ranking Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona, asked how Mr. Watson “would respond to public disclosures that endanger U.S. citizens, neutralize the effectiveness of classified defense programs and harm national security.”Mr. Watson, a Vietnam veteran who spent 32 years at The Times before retiring in 2006, said he would “take aggressive action” against anyone in the Army who leaked classified information.“I believe in national security,” he said. “I’m a patriot. I do not, as a professional, abide people leaking classified information. I certainly wouldn’t be a leaker, if that’s the question for me. As general counsel for the Army, I certainly wouldn’t abide anyone within my jurisdiction leaking classified information.”'"

"'10-03-24,'0','WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday made it easier for people who say they cannot repay their student loans to receive bankruptcy protection. But the case arose in an unusual way, and the ruling is unlikely to have a broad impact.The case involved Francisco J. Espinosa, an airline ramp agent who took out four student loans in 1988 and 1989 for a total of $13,250 to attend a trade school in Arizona. Four years later, he filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws, proposing to repay the principal over five years without interest.Neither Mr. Espinosa nor the judge who approved his proposal followed the procedures contemplated by the law. Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code allows student loans like Mr. Espinosa’s to be discharged only if a bankruptcy judge finds that repayment would impose an “undue hardship.” But the judge in his case made no such finding.Nor did Mr. Espinosa notify his lender in the way required by law, which calls for the service of a summons and complaint like those in a civil lawsuit.But the lender did receive notices from the court about Mr. Espinosa’s proposal and the court’s approval of it. Although the loan was the only debt Mr. Espinosa listed in his proposal, the lender did not object or appeal.'"
"'10-03-24,'0','It is always encouraging to see a commitment to the Sisyphean task of getting the most out of America’s gargantuan defense budget and reining in costs on expensive, badly managed or poorly performing programs.The Obama team killed the anachronistic F-22 combat jet and is cracking down on the way overbudget F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Now it is looking at the long-troubled missile defense program. Lt. Gen. Patrick O’Reilly, the program’s chief, told a conference on Monday that some contractors continue to produce poor quality components for missile interceptors.That is not a good deal for American taxpayers, especially when there are huge and growing demands on the national budget. The missile defense agency is asking for a budget increase of $700 million, to $9.9 billion.General O’Reilly said he is withholding a portion of the profits from contractors responsible for the shoddy work. He neither identified the firms nor revealed the amount of the contract set aside, apparently because his decision is now subject to appeal. The Boeing Company, the Raytheon Company and the Lockheed Martin Corporation are the primary contractors for many weapons programs. In 2006, the Pentagon withheld some $108 million from Boeing because of shortcomings on a ground-based missile intercept.Penalizing contractors is sensible because profits are a strong motivator. But the penalty must be carefully structured so it does not boomerang. If contractors know profits will be reduced if a missile test is unsuccessful, experts say this could create a strong incentive for them to ensure the tests are (falsely) successful by conducting more scripted, less realistic tests.The Pentagon also needs to structure contracts more effectively. The Government Accountability Office said in 2009 that defense contractors typically get up to 84 percent of their promised profits just for “satisfactory” performance. That leaves only a small incentive for contractors to perform above-satisfactory work.'"
"'10-03-24,'0','Serving with an organization that works to end the harm caused by religion-based prejudice and hostility toward gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans, I commend the Episcopal Church for its courageous move to approve the election of the church’s second openly gay bishop, the Rev. Mary D. Glasspool.Your article stated that the move may “increase the tension with fellow Anglican churches around the world that do not approve of homosexuality.” That is an extraordinarily sad commentary considering the message — you can’t serve God if you’re gay.As an evangelical Christian, I once held the attitude that heterosexuality was the only sexual orientation sanctioned by God. But I have since met hundreds of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people of all faiths who in their hearts and minds find great joy and peace in their spirituality. Their spiritual experience is as real as mine — and perhaps more profound considering how some people work so hard to turn them away.For the church as a community to deny any person the spiritual experience that the church professes is the most precious gift is its greatest moral failure of our day.'"
"'10-03-24,'0','The arrest of an outspoken government opponent for making critical remarks on a television talk show drew condemnation on Tuesday from opposition parties and human rights advocates, who said the arrest showed that basic liberties were being eroded in Venezuela. The opposition politician, Oswaldo Álvarez Paz, was detained by the police on Monday and charged with conspiracy and spreading false information, among other things. A coalition of more than a dozen opposition parties said in a statement that Mr. Álvarez Paz had been arrested for a “crime of opinion” in an attempt to silence criticism and encourage a climate of self-censorship.'"
"'10-03-24,'0','“Governments have been willing to cushion the blow and expand the deficits, so the debate has not heated up,” said Justin Vaïsse, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center on the United States and Europe, who studies Muslims in Europe. “You’re not looking at a 1930s situation where a social crisis derives from an economic crisis.”Acrimonious debates and disputes over Islam — particularly the most visible manifestations like women wearing head scarves, veils and burqas and the construction of mosques — continue apace. But researchers have not seen a correlation between economic woes and Islamophobia.“The economic crisis hit the immigrant population, many of them Muslims, harder than it did the majority population,” said Werner Schiffauer, professor of social and cultural anthropology specializing in Muslim populations in Europe at the Viadrina University in Frankfurt an der Oder. “As they are dependent on welfare benefits, there was the accusation of blaming them, in a way, that Islam is responsible for a lax working morale.”Völklingen welcomed migrants, especially from Turkey, who came in the 1960s and ’70s as guest workers in the industrial boom years. Now, the rusting ironworks known as the Völklinger Hütte are defunct, a Unesco landmark but also a constant reminder of better days.The city’s population shrank to just below 40,000 last year from over 48,000 in 1974. Migrants and their children and grandchildren now make up 12 percent of the populace, with Turks the largest group. For immigrants who have worked here for decades, raised families and are now retired, a small prayer tower did not seem too much to ask.“All the churches here have big towers, and there are many churches in Turkey,” said Ihsan Urgaci, 65, a retiree who has lived in Germany for 40 years.But many local Muslims, like Ridvan Carpar, said it was better not to press the issue. Mr. Carpar, 35, came from Turkey when he was 5 years old and works in a kebab stand across from the mosque, which itself is evidence of the city’s changing face. Above the sign for Pasha kebabs, grimy letters on the facade still spell out “Schreiner’s Drugstore.”“Until now, we’ve never had any problems,” Mr. Carpar said. “A mosque is a mosque, whether it has a minaret or not.”Mr. Carpar inadvertently echoed the same sentiment as Frank Franz, the state chairman in the Saarland of the far-right party, the National Democrats, which has two seats on the city council. “A minaret has nothing to do with freedom of religion; it isn’t necessary,” Mr. Franz said. At a party meeting in Völklingen last month, red and white fliers declared, “Thank you, Switzerland. Minaret ban here, too!”In November a Swiss referendum banning the construction of minarets passed with 57.5 percent of the vote. The Swiss minaret ban showed, Mr. Franz said, “that the opinion of the people is not sufficiently respected in other parts of Europe.”The National Democratic Party — which the government has tried unsuccessfully to ban as a neo-Nazi party — may be represented on the city council in Völklingen, but their two seats are down from five before the last election in 2009, when the economic crisis was at its worst.So far, at least in Germany, the far right has not been able to capitalize on economic turmoil to gain a larger foothold. But the debate in Europe over visible symbols of its sizable Islamic population, with estimates ranging from between 15 million and 20 million in European Union countries, remains unsettled and fraught.The Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders had a strong showing in recent local elections in the Netherlands, just three months ahead of the June 9 national election. In France, Jean-Marie Le Pen’s National Front provoked outrage ahead of regional elections in southern France with a veiled woman standing in front of an Algerian flag in the shape of France, studded with minarets.President Nicolas Sarkozy has led debates over French identity and the Islamic veil, which many experts say is a strategic move to head off challenges from the far right. But that backfired in the first round of regional elections, when voters for the National Front stuck with their party and Mr. Sarkozy had trouble motivating his own base.Völkingen’s mayor, Klaus Lorig, from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right Christian Democratic Party, who faces an election in September and came out against the minaret, has struck a more conciliatory tone.“Purely as a matter of building code, it could be approved,” he said. “What I fear is that this effort, this attempt to come closer, that the delicate buds we’ve nurtured in the area of integration might be endangered if they insist on building the minaret.”'"
"'10-03-24,'0','Choosing long-term process and pragmatism over short-term personnel decisions and solutions, Zimpher announced changes to give the SUNY system more athletic oversight, including, eventually, a position to oversee athletics systemwide.The recommendations are a response to an audit of the Binghamton basketball program commissioned by the SUNY board. The program has struggled in the wake of Broadus’s being placed on leave, Joel Thirer’s resignation as the athletic director and the dismissal of six players from the team. The tipping point came when the star guard Emanuel Mayben was arrested on charges of possessing crack cocaine in September.The basketball program will operate in an awkward state. Without a permanent coach, Binghamton is unlikely to lure quality recruits this season and next.“To me, the most important thing is rebuilding the program,” said Patrick Nero, the commissioner of the America East Conference, of which Binghamton is a member. “If this is what it’s going to take, it’s going to make it difficult, but that’s better than it not be done correctly. I have full faith in the chancellor, and her record speaks for itself.”Zimpher said that Binghamton had not received a formal letter of inquiry from the N.C.A.A. about the potential violations revealed in the audit of the men’s basketball program. Two N.C.A.A. enforcement officers are assigned to Binghamton’s case as part of the process after a university reports potential violations.Zimpher stressed that she had met with the N.C.A.A.’s interim president, Jim Isch, and had pledged the full cooperation of Binghamton and the SUNY system. She has enlisted the law firm Bond, Schoeneck & King, which frequently helps universities with compliance issues.Zimpher’s recommendations included assigning SUNY’s interim provost, David K. Lavallee, to lead an overall effort for the SUNY system to ensure that academics remain the highest priority. Lavallee will also serve on the search committee for a president.Zimpher said that Charles R. Westgate, a professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering at Binghamton, would become a special adviser for academics and athletics for the SUNY system.Zimpher said the changes would bring additional SUNY oversight, but some at Binghamton expected more from her.“This is a nothing move,” said Kevin Wright, a professor in human development, who complained that after spending months and nearly a million dollars on the audit, Zimpher could have made more decisive moves.But Zimpher said this was a step to “right the ship” at Binghamton.“What is wrenching to me is the possibility that that reputation would in any way be tarnished, and that’s why we’re investing so much strength in the going forward strategy,” she said.'"
"'10-03-24,'0','BEIJING — This is a nation that builds dams, high-speed rail lines and skyscrapers with abandon. In newly muscular China , sheer force is not just an art, but a bedrock principle of its seemingly unstoppable rise to global prominence.Now China has tightened its grip on the much more variegated world of online information, effectively forcing Google Inc., the world’s premier information provider, to choose between submitting to Chinese censorship and leaving the world’s largest community of Internet users to its rivals. It chose to leave.Google’s decision may not cause major problems for China right away, experts said. But in the longer run, they said, China’s intransigent stance on filtering the flow of information within its borders has the potential to weaken its links to the global economy.It may also sully its image — promoted to its own people as well as to the international community — as an authoritarian country that is economically on the move, perhaps even more so than the sclerotic, democratic West.“The Chinese are very serious about pushing their soft-power agenda,” Bill Bishop, a Beijing Internet entrepreneur and author of the technology blog Digicha, said Tuesday. “Google just put a big hole in that sales pitch, and I think they know that.”China’s leaders appear fully aware of their dilemma. But at this stage in China’s history, and given the Communist Party’s determination to maintain absolute rule, they still put political control ahead of all other concerns.“What does Google’s exit say? What it says publicly is what everyone deeply engaged in China knows privately,” Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a Brookings Institution scholar and former Clinton administration adviser on China, said in an interview.“This is a system with very substantial domestic imperfections,” Mr. Lieberthal said. “And the view from afar that this is simply an unstoppable juggernaut — that they have found the keys to the magic kingdom — is not correct. China’s leaders understand this as well as anyone.”The conclusion of Google’s four-year Internet experiment in China — an effort to transplant Western free-speech norms here — was anything but smooth. On Monday, it effectively shut down the search engine it hosted inside China, after declaring in January that it would stop cooperating with Chinese censors.As Google began redirecting tens of millions of mainland Chinese users early Tuesday, Beijing time, to its Hong Kong-based Web site, google.com.hk, parts of the company’s remaining mainland operations quickly came under pressure from Google’s Chinese partners and from the government itself.China’s biggest cellular communications company, China Mobile, was widely expected to cancel a deal that had placed Google’s search engine on its mobile Internet home page, used by millions of people daily. One official in China’s media industry said that the company was scrapping the deal under government pressure even though it had no replacement lined up.Censorship, of course, is not new in China. The government has never released its grip on the information industry, and if anything has steadily tightened supervision of the Chinese Web in the past couple of years. Those restrictions have not noticeably inhibited its economic growth, which remained robust even as the West staggered through its worst recession in decades.But China also does not acknowledge to its own people that it censors the Internet to exclude a wide range of political and social topics that its leaders believe could lead to instability. It does not release information on the number of censors it employs or the technology it uses for the world’s most sophisticated Internet firewall. Its 350 million Internet users, many with fast broadband connections, are assured they have the same effectively limitless access to information and communications that the rest of the world enjoys.Google publicly challenged that stance in January, and reinforced its ideological opposition to China’s policies by finally pulling the plug on its mainland search engine after a failed round of talks with Chinese officials. That forced Chinese leaders to defend their control of the Web, which they did partly with an outburst of nationalism and vitriol.The cost, at least with some influential sectors of its own society, could be steep. In the technology sector, Google is viewed as an innovator that has spurred rapid development of the Chinese Web. Its departure will leave some Chinese companies with greater influence, but could also stifle competition, some fear.""Google is good at innovation, and when it leaves, the rest of the companies in China will lack motivation. Without its countervailing power, the industry won’t be as healthy,” said Zhang Yunquan, a professor at the Institute of Software at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Fang Xingdong, chief executive of Chinalabs.com, said the vast majority of Chinese Internet companies invested little in research and “simply copy each other’s technology.” With Google’s departure, their profits may rise, but China’s Web space will begin to stagnate, he predicted.Despite China’s mantra that the Google issue should not be “politicized,” it is, at the end of the day, highly politicized, especially inside China.Xiao Qiang, founder and editor in chief of China Digital Times, said that China’s leaders once saw the Internet as having both political and commercial uses that balanced each other to a degree. “But increasingly they see it as a political space,” he said.The implication of that thinking, post-Google, is that companies that want to be major players on the Chinese Web will have to prove their political fealty to the leadership, much as traditional media companies do. “Chinese companies have to be collaborators,” Mr. Xiao said.One Western official in China said that the leadership is now treating the Internet as a “core interest,” an issue of sovereignty on which Beijing will brook no intervention. The most commonly cited core interests are Taiwan and Tibet, the third-rail issues in China’s international diplomacy.That could make it even harder for China to negotiate Internet freedom issues with the United States and other nations. In fact, even among those who argue that China will do just fine without Google, China’s battle with the Internet giant is seen as a proxy for its broader confrontation with the West over rights, trade, climate change, and declining American hegemony.“I believe Google got some support from the U.S. government,” said Yan Xuetong, director of the Institute of International Studies at Tsinghua University. “This means the American government will adopt a tougher, more aggressive policy toward China.”'"
"'10-03-24,'0','The new effort this year is intended to remove from prisons criminals who are considered less threatening and divide them into two categories: those who pose little or no risk outside the prison walls, and those who need regular supervision.The goal is to reduce the number of inmates in the state’s 33 prisons next year by 6,500 — more than the entire state prison population in 2009 of , , or . In all, there are 167,000 prisoners in California.“People in the criminal justice world are looking at California with great interest,” said Jeremy Travis, president of in New York. “Some very important reforms are under way.”The effort, narrowly approved by the Democratic-controlled State Legislature and signed into law by Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, will be achieved through a range of steps long recommended by independent analysts and commissions.To slow the return of former inmates to prison for technical violations of their parole, hundreds of low-level offenders will be released without close supervision from parole officers. Those officers will focus instead on tracking serious, violent offenders.Some prisoners may also be released early for completing drug and education programs or have their sentences reduced under new formulas for calculating time served in county jails before and after sentencing.The effort represents a “seismic shift,” said Joan Petersilia, a criminologist at Stanford Law School and a longtime scholar of the state’s prisons.Public safety concerns have other states rethinking their decisions to save prisons costs by releasing inmates early and expanding parole.The same red flags are being raised here, but the overcrowding problem dwarfs that of any other state and the budget deficit — $20 billion and climbing — has left lawmakers with virtually no choice but to move ahead.The Schwarzenegger administration has floated a number of other ideas to reduce costs, including building prisons in for illegal immigrant offenders, turning over prisons to private contractors and, last week, having the handle inmate health care.The release of prisoners in California has stirred a backlash. Several hundred inmates at county jails were released in the last couple of months because of confusion over time credits in the new law.Attorney General , a Democrat who is running for governor, issued a directive clarifying the law, but not before one inmate in was arrested shortly after his release and charged with attempting to a woman. The man had been released on probation after serving time on an assault charge.That case prompted several lawmakers to call for abandoning early releases. And crime victim and law enforcement groups have been sounding alarms about what they consider the dangers of not more aggressively tracking the low-level offenders.“We are concerned about victims these felons will leave in their wake before being rearrested for committing new crimes,” said Paul M. Weber, the president of the Los Angeles police union.Proponents, including Mr. Schwarzenegger’s corrections secretary, Matthew Cate, have stood by the law, calling it overdue and necessary. The state spends, on average, $47,000 per year to house a prisoner. Early estimates suggest the new changes could save $100 million this year.“This was an opportunity to do something impactful without imperiling public safety,” Mr. Cate said, adding that allowing parole officers to focus on more serious offenders will improve public safety.Even with the new law, the system falls short of providing the kind of rehabilitation, drug treatment and education and job programs that academics and prisoner advocates have called for to help ensure prisoners and parolees do not commit new crimes.The governor and the Legislature received a report on March 15 from a state oversight board warning that cuts to inmate rehabilitation programs would jeopardize the effort to reduce recidivism.California is the only state that places all prisoners on parole at release, no matter the offense, Professor Petersilia said, and usually for one to three years. If a parolee is arrested or fails a drug test or misses an appointment with a parole officer, the offender lands back in prison.Now, low-level offenders will not need to meet regularly with a parole officer and must be convicted of a new crime to be sent back.Eric Susie, 24, recently had his parole terms readjusted under the new law. Mr. Susie had served 13 months in prison for possessing an M-80 firecracker wrapped with razors near a school (he argued, unsuccessfully, that it belonged to a friend).Now, more than a year out of prison, he no longer reports to a parole officer or submits to monthly drug tests and can travel more freely, including out of state to visit family in .“I feel like I am finally free,” Mr. Susie said. “I feel like I don’t have that monkey on my back, like being a prisoner. I feel like I am a human being and can get my life together.”Even the guards’ union, which so heavily promoted and supported the tough sentencing of the past that fueled the prison building and expansion boom, now says it supports the idea of alternatives to prison and did not publicly object to the new law.The overcrowding, union officials now say, poses a physical threat to its members, and the union has sided with plaintiffs battling in federal court to force even greater reductions of 40,000 inmates over the next two years.But even with the progress in recent months, State Senator Mark Leno, a Democrat from who helped push through changes in the prison system, suggested that further reductions would be a hard sell. Mr. Leno called the changes under way “a noble effort” and the best that could be achieved in the current political climate.Many lawmakers, he said, still want to lengthen sentences and spend more on incarceration, both politically popular notions.“We can’t control ourselves,” Mr. Leno said. “Or some of my colleagues can’t control themselves.”'"
"'10-03-24,'0','The detained leader of the country’s democracy movement, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, opposes registering her party for the elections planned this year in Myanmar because the governing junta’s many restrictions are “unjust,” her lawyer said Tuesday. The lawyer, U Nyan Win, said that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, left, had said that she would “not even think” of registering the party, the National League for Democracy, for the elections. But she also said that party members should decide whether the party would participate. Her comments came hours after Myanmar’s highest court refused to accept a lawsuit filed by the party, which sought to revoke five new election laws.

The plant, which opened in 2000 and closed five years later, polluted the groundwater and soil around the village of Plachimada, in the state of Kerala, the panel said. Coca-Cola said in a statement that it was unfortunate “that the committee in Kerala was appointed on the unproven assumption that damage was caused, and that it was caused by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages.” According to the panel, the bottling plant discharged a sludge that contained toxic chemicals like cadmium and lead.

"'10-03-24,'0','Separately, SAC Capital, the giant hedge fund, has been linked to a broad insider trading investigation by a former employee of the fund.Moore Capital, which manages about $14 billion, is as close to an establishment hedge fund as there is. Founded by Louis M. Bacon, a billionaire who splits his time between London and New York, the company started as a so-called macro investor that placed big directional bets on markets and has grown to become a large and diverse fund management company.In a written statement, the company called the arrested employee, Julian Rifat, an “execution trader,” meaning he did not make investment decisions. He was put on administrative leave after the raid.Moore Capital said the investigation did not involve any of its own funds and that it was cooperating with authorities — an indication that the trader was making the investments from his personal account.In a statement earlier on Tuesday, the Financial Services Authority, Britain’s main securities regulator, said the operation had involved the search of 16 addresses and had resulted in the arrest of six men, including two investment professionals.Britain’s insider trading investigation has resulted in five prison sentences, the most recent being for Malcolm Calvert, a former top trader at Cazenove, a British broker dealer, who was convicted of earning £103,000 from improper trades and was sentenced this month to 21 months in prison.The Financial Services Authority, part of what is called a tripartite regulatory system that includes the British Treasury and the Bank of England, has been under scrutiny of late. The Conservative Party has said it wants to abolish the agency as an independent entity.Like his contemporary Paul Tudor Jones, Mr. Bacon hails from the American South — Raleigh, N.C., in his case — and began making his fortune and reputation as a top trader in New York in the 1980s.Mr. Bacon, known for his support of environmental causes, has homes in Long Island, Scotland, Colorado and elsewhere.Even though Moore Capital said that none of its funds were involved in the investigation, the arrest is an embarrassment for Mr. Bacon, a man who is publicity-shy even by the standards of a hedge fund industry known for its secrecy.The presence of a major hedge fund in an insider trading case is also likely to increase the already acute suspicions of lawmakers in Brussels who are drafting legislation that would result in increased scrutiny and regulation of hedge funds operating in London. These moves have been met by sharp opposition from the British government as well as the industry.'"
"'10-03-24,'0','WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed adding the oil and gas sector and facilities that inject carbon dioxide into the ground to the greenhouse gas sources that are required to report their annual emissions to the government.The agency already requires 31 industries, representing 85 percent of the annual production of climate-altering gases in the country, to track and report emissions. The new rule, if accepted after a public comment period, would also try to track emissions of methane and fluorinated gases, which have a much more powerful impact on the atmosphere than carbon dioxide does.“Gathering this information is the first step toward reducing greenhouse emissions and fostering innovative technologies for the clean energy future,” Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement Tuesday. “It’s especially important to track potent gases like methane, which traps more than 20 times as much heat as carbon and accelerates climate change.”Methane is the primary gas that escapes in oil and gas drilling, and some petroleum drillers inject carbon dioxide into wells to enhance oil and gas recovery. The E.P.A. wants to know how much carbon dioxide is used in such operations and how much escapes into the atmosphere.The American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade group, said it would study the proposal to determine the sites it covers.The new rule, if adopted, would require the additional industries to begin collecting emissions data next January and submit their first reports in 2012.Environmental advocates said the rule would shed light on how much oil industry practices were contributing to the warming of the planet.'"

"'10-03-24,'0','This year’s New Directors/New Films, the annual roundup of recent moving pictures gathered by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art that starts on Wednesday and runs through April 4, pretty much looks like last year’s event  and those from years past. There are titles to treasure and those to avoid among the 27 features and 11 shorts, many of which have been cherry-picked and rather less discriminately culled from other festivals, including Cannes and Berlin. Among the bigger draws is the price of admission: if you’re a member of either institution, you can nibble or binge at $10 a pop (but you’ll have to smuggle your popcorn past the guards at the Modern).Given how New Directors covers the world  the filmmakers in the 2010 edition have tramped on five of the continents  it seems fitting that the opening-night (and nearly sold-out) selection centers on Bill Cunningham, the peripatetic street-and-society photographer whose pictorials are the first thing many turn to in The New York Times on Sunday. Aptly titled “Bill Cunningham New York,” the documentary is something of an inside job, having been produced by Philip Gefter, a former picture editor for the paper, and directed by Mr. Gefter’s husband, Richard Press. The Times even shares the copyright, which might have made the whole thing insufferably cozy if not for the wonderfully liberated Mr. Cunningham.Shot  as many selections in the festival’s first week were  on digital, the documentary is part biopic, part homage to Mr. Cunningham, a Harvard dropout turned milliner (he designed under the name William J.) who started snapping people on the street during World War II. Some of those life details along with some other high and low points, the hiring and firing, have been revealed elsewhere, including an autobiographical sketch he wrote for The Times in 2002. Still, the movie charms by bringing you into the private world of a man who would clearly prefer you direct your attention at the glorious, gaudy beauty embodied by the passing human parade that he immortalizes  and insistently democratizes  with lightning-fast moves and palpable joy.Despite his proximity to fashion’s power elite (hello Anna Wintour!), Mr. Cunningham retains a remarkable innocence. Fashion is his muse, not the manufactured glamour and celebrity fetishism that often pollutes it. To watch him standing at the ready on a Manhattan corner in his customary blue jacket, smiling at the people flowing around him, is to recall St. Francis rejoicing in the grace of the birds in Roberto Rossellini’s “Flowers of St. Francis.” Like Rossellini’s saint, Mr. Cunningham has retained his faith in a world that has lost the same. It’s too bad that the documentary, which errs with a self-serving scene of employees at The Times feting Mr. Cunningham, didn’t, like its subject, stick to the streets.It’s an index of world cinema, or perhaps the temperament of the New Directors programmers, that there’s little comparable ecstasy expressed in most of the remaining selections over the first week. Three of the programmers are from the Modern, including Jytte Jensen, Laurence Kardish and its chief curator of film, Rajendra Roy. The Film Society is represented by its program director, Richard Peña; Marian Masone; and Gavin Smith, the editor of Film Comment, who, in the interest of full disclosure, is a longtime friend. I’ve seen most of these people smile, so it might be the state of the world or the art that accounts for all the tumult and tears. At festivals, seriousness often comes in the key of misery, even when the work exalts.All it takes are a few exalting moments to lift a film, as in “The Father of My Children.” Written and directed by Mia Hansen-Love, it takes a fictionalized look at the touching and tragically true life and death of Humbert Balsan, a French producer who committed suicide in 2005. Balsan, here called Grégoire and played with allure and a respectful psychological opacity by Louis-Do de Lencquesaing, began his cinematic life as an actor, appearing in Robert Bresson’s “Lancelot of the Lake,” before turning to producing the likes of Claire Denis and Elia Suleiman. To her credit, Ms. Hansen-Love doesn’t try to explain the mystery that defines everyone, including Balsan, who departs the story midway, leaving his stunned family to sort through his legacy and its sorrow. “The Father of My Children” is scheduled to be released by IFC Films on May 28.“Northless,” the estimable feature debut of Rigoberto Perezcano, centers on a young Mexican trying and failing and trying again to cross into the United States. From its opening, with the dawn lighting up the sharply drawn hills, an image that simultaneously evokes “2001: A Space Odyssey” and “Silent Light” (by Carlos Reygadas, one of the brightest stars in the new Mexican cinema), you know you’re in the hands of a real director. With a confident eye, dry humor, expansive warmth and stealth-like politics, Mr. Perezcano follows the itinerant Andrés (Harold Torres), as he makes his way to Tijuana and into the lives of a storeowner, Ela (Alicia Laguna); her helper, Cata (Sonia Couoh); and Asensio (Luis Cárdenas), a wary butcher who maintains a proprietary relationship with both women.Making the most of his smart, spare screenplay written with Edgar San Juan, Mr. Perezcano creates a textured sense of place with his unassuming locales, including a street that dead-ends with the towering American fence that cuts Andrés off from a world of possibility. One of the pleasures of the movie, beyond its thoughtful camerawork  lighter-weight digital equipment, which inspires the shakes in too many filmmakers, has helped create an aesthetics of inattention onscreen  is how the themes emerge slowly through casual conversation, looks, exchanges. Although the movie, tantalizingly, appears to be heading into neo-noir territory (Asensio’s dark looks mass like storm clouds), it ends in more complex, inspired and subtle terrain. The finale, foreshadowed by an early, seemingly throwaway image of a truck hauling a bureau, is a knockout.There are other, flashier titles on view this week, including Yorgos Lanthimos’s “Dogtooth,” a critically divisive exercise in style from Greece about the kind of artificial grotesques who play the usual funny games, including animal torture and incest, and exist only in the movies. Épater la bourgeoisie and blah blah blah. Equally irksome and enervating is “3 Backyards” from the director Eric Mendelsohn, whose well-regarded “Judy Berlin” (1999) helped kick-start Edie Falco’s career. Ms. Falco returns to Mr. Mendelsohn’s world with a strained smile (and one very good, emotionally nuanced scene in a car with Embeth Davidtz) to play one of the Long Islanders whose backyards are linked by a lot of atonal clanging on the soundtrack, wildly showboating camerawork and a thick fog of unearned, uninteresting suburban angst.Far more involving if also more technically shaky is “Tehroun” (“Tehran”), one of several Iranian selections in the festival. Directed by Nader T. Homayoun, who wrote the script with Jean-Philippe Gaud and Mehdi Boustani, the movie offers a particularly pungent slice of neorealist life as it tracks the increasingly downward spiral of a struggling Tehran transplant, Ibrahim (Ali Ebdali). In its vivid, at times almost shockingly unvarnished depiction of an Iranian underworld that teams with child smugglers, prostitutes and thieves worthy of Dickens, “Tehroun” recalls films from Jafar Panahi like “Crimson Gold” and “The Circle.” (A supporter of the Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi, Mr. Panahi is believed to have been detained by Iranian security forces in early March.)Like those Panahi titles, “Tehroun”  as well as “Women Without Men,” which is being shown on March 30 and 31, and the April IFC release “No One Knows About Persian Cats”  is marked by a sense of despair bordering on fatalism. Directed by Shirin Neshat, an artist who’s worked in video and has made a fine jump to the bigger screen, “Women Without Men” follows four perilously independent women during the 1953 coup d’état that, backed by the Central Intelligence Agency, toppled the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh. The movie, which will likely and deservedly receive an American release, is dedicated “to the memory of those who lost their lives in the struggle for freedom and democracy in Iran  from the Constitutional Revolution of 1906 to the Green Movement of 2009.”'"

"'10-03-25,'1','The Manhattan district attorney’s office exhibited a “lack of transparency” in dividing $448 million in settlement accounts between New York City and New York State between January 2007 and December 2009, according to an audit released on Wednesday by City Comptroller John C. Liu.Mr. Liu’s audit said that the settlement money — which was at the heart of a bitter dispute late last year between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the district attorney at the time, Robert M. Morgenthau — had been properly accounted for. Still, Mr. Liu warned that the district attorney’s office needed to develop a formal policy to distribute the money, register all its bank accounts with the city and upgrade its computer system.“It doesn’t serve anybody any good to have accounts that fly under the radar,” Mr. Liu said in an interview. “With this much money, without checks and balances in place, the potential for misuse is clearly there.”In a statement issued after Mr. Liu’s audit was released, Mr. Morgenthau’s successor, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., accepted the recommendations, “so long as the procedures do not compromise prosecutorial independence or the confidentiality of investigations.”The money the district attorney’s office distributes to the city and state is collected from settlements, seizures and forfeitures.'"
"'10-03-25,'1','Mr. Zhong’s visit to Washington comes weeks before an April 15 deadline for the Treasury to deliver its semiannual report on foreign exchange. Many economists believe that China has deliberately undervalued its currency to support its export-oriented economy.China’s position has raised the ire of members of both parties in Congress, who say that the exchange-rate problem is holding back job growth in the United States. Two senators, Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, have introduced legislation that would effectively compel the Treasury to cite the Chinese currency for “misalignment.”The Treasury has not found China to be manipulating its currency since 1994, making the argument, among others, that manipulation involves intent. Successive administrations have argued that it would be more fruitful to convince China that its interests would be served by allowing the renminbi to appreciate, a move that could stimulate domestic consumption in China and help wean its economy off a reliance on American consumers.With unemployment near 10 percent in the United States, Congress has seemingly run out of patience with that argument.“We’re fed up,” Mr. Graham said on Tuesday. “China’s mercantilist policies are hurting the rest of the world, not just America. It helped create the global recession that we’re in. The Chinese want to be treated as a developing country, but they’re a global giant, the leading exporter in the world.”The Senate bill would let the Commerce Department retaliate against currency misalignment by imposing duties or tariffs. “The only thing that will make China move is tough legislation,” Mr. Schumer said.The two senators pointed to a new study by the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed research organization, saying the growing trade deficit between China and the United States resulted in the elimination or displacement of 2.4 million American jobs between 2001 and 2008.House leaders have taken a less combative stance. At a Ways and Means Committee hearing Wednesday, its chairman, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said of the currency policy: “Like so many other trade issues, it gets caught up in the polarization that grips trade issues — free trade vs. protectionism — a grip that I have believed harmful and reject.”Similarly, the top Republican on the committee, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, said it would be better for the United States to work through the Group of 20 meetings and the International Monetary Fund to persuade China to reform its banking and financial sectors, open its markets and improve protection of intellectual property.“Focusing on the currency valuation issue to the exclusion of the others is more likely to lead to collective frustration than to any improvement in the health of the critical U.S.-Chinese economic relationship,” Mr. Camp said.Niall Ferguson, a historian at Harvard, told the committee that the way the renminbi is currently valued held back the economic recovery by artificially raising the price of American exports; contributed to a “dangerous overheating” of China’s economy; risked unleashing a “protectionist backlash”; and made it ever-harder for China to revalue the currency, because the value of its foreign reserves would diminish.But he urged the United States to “pursue currency realignment on a multilateral rather than solely on a bilateral basis.”'"
"'10-03-25,'1','A decline in net worth isn’t always a bad thing, but you want to understand why it has dropped, explained Cheryl Krueger, a financial planner in Chicago. “Are your assets lower because you’re spending more than you’re earning or because of an external factor like a market downturn? Are your debts increasing or decreasing?”Increasing debts may be O.K. if you are advancing your education or starting a business, she added, but obviously not if you are simply spending to keep up with the Joneses.How are your ratios?Several experts also recommend looking at a few crucial numbers, or ratios: your debt-to-income ratio, your savings rate and emergency funds.“It begins to give us a good snapshot and longer-term trend of what is happening in their financial lives and whether changes need to be implemented,” said Patrick Collins of Greenspring Wealth Management in Towson, Md. “We set a target for each one of them.”The targets will vary depending on where one is in life. Younger people should dedicate no more than 30 percent of gross income to pay for all debt (car payments, mortgage, student loans, revolving debts), he said, and that should gradually decline to zero by the time they are ready to retire. As for savings, he said, everyone should aim to save 15 percent of their salaries, while empty-nesters preparing for retirement should rev up their savings to 20 to 25 percent. Understandably, you may miss these targets when you are struggling to pay for your children’s college or saving for a home (especially on the coasts). Meanwhile, your emergency fund should contain about six months of expenses in cash, Mr. Collins said, while retirees should set aside one year’s worth of fixed expenses.Are you spending more than you earn?Using an automated service is probably the easiest way to track spending. Many experts recommend using one of the popular programs like Quicken or online services like Mint.com, Wesabe.com or YouNeedABudget.com. Obviously, if you are living on a fixed income, this becomes even more important — establishing monthly spending targets makes it easier to track.“The problem with most people’s finances is that they talk about it, but they never consolidate and organize their financial data in an easily manageable way so that they can know at any given time exactly where they stand,” said Bedda D’Angelo, president of Fiduciary Solutions in Durham, N.C.What has changed in your life in the last year?Big life events can disrupt even the best strategies. Getting married, having a child or even becoming eligible for Social Security or Medicare will require that you make many financial decisions.“The main question here is really, ‘What has changed in my life that may change items in my financial plan?’ ” said Rick Kahler, a financial planner in Rapid City, S.D. “A person may need more or less insurance, update their estate planning, switch investment philosophy, save more or less for retirement.”Are you still adequately insured?Evaluating the costs and amounts of your homeowners’, renters’ and auto insurance policies should be an annual or biannual exercise. Consider raising your deductibles because that can lower your premiums. You might be able to lower your costs further by picking up an umbrella policy, which provides additional liability coverage, said Steve Podnos, a financial planner in Merritt Island, Fla. To do this, you would lower your liability coverage on all of your other policies to the minimum required by the umbrella policy, and then use the umbrella policy to pick up the difference, he said. This is especially important for families with teenagers.“As kids turn 16 and begin driving, the family liability skyrockets,” Mr. Podnos said. “Anybody of any means should probably have an umbrella policy. It’s the cheapest coverage you can get in terms of millions of dollars of coverage per premium dollar.”Next, turn your attention to disability and life insurance coverage. Do you have enough? Too much? A good rule of thumb: about 20 times salary for life insurance (for one or both spouses) minus any other resources you may have. If you are approaching retirement, you might consider dropping some or all of your disability or life insurance coverage if you have it (and maybe swapping it for a long-term care policy).“Once you hit your 60s, disability insurance is expensive,” Mr. Podnos said. You are paying a premium for what will amount to only a few years of coverage, since most policies stop paying at age 65 or shortly thereafter.Do you need to make any changes to your estate plan?Start by making sure the beneficiaries you have named — on things like your retirement accounts or your life insurance policies — are up to date. You also want to review the people you have named as guardians for your children, executors, trustees and those with powers of attorney.“Are they still the best choice for the job?” asks Jon P. Beyrer, a financial planner in Solana Beach, Calif.Estate planning documents like wills and trusts also need to be reviewed and possibly updated. (Did you buy anything this year that needs to be transferred to your revocable living trust?) And given the uncertainty surrounding the estate tax, families with taxable estates need to make sure their documents are written to account for that uncertainty.“If it’s more than five years old, it needs to be looked over by an attorney,” Mr. Podnos added. Also make sure your advance health care directives and health care proxies or medical powers of attorney are in place.How are you sleeping? Does your portfolio require any maintenance?The economic collapse reminded many investors that they tend to overestimate their tolerance for risk and volatility. That is why several planners suggest asking whether you can meet your goals with fewer risky investments like stocks. This is also the time to see whether your portfolio requires rebalancing to your target asset allocations, which many planners recommend doing at least annually. As you get closer to retirement, financial planners also begin to project whether your portfolio and other sources of income can sustain your current lifestyle. If you are off track, you need to consider incorporating potential solutions to make up for the shortfall.Have your outlook or goals changed? Are you happy?At its core, financial planning is not simply about money. It is about finding the best way to finance what you want out of life, whether that is spending more time with family and friends or traveling. And planners use their annual checkups to help clients make sure they are doing that.“We encourage people to ask themselves what they can do to be happier and better off a year from now, whether that is saving more money, paying off debt, changing careers or doing more charitable work,” said Dan Serra, a financial planner in Plano, Tex. “It’s a mix of evaluating life and money.”'"
"'10-03-25,'1','People who owned stock that became worthless can claim losses for it, Mr. Kess said, and may be able to file amended returns for previous years if they did not do so.Stanley H. Breitbard, who was national director of executive financial services for the former Price Waterhouse in Los Angeles, then founded California JumpStartCoalition, a nonprofit that encourages teaching personal finance to students, warned against two extremes. Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income, not at lower capital gains rates, so frequent trading can result in a high tax bill. But if Schedule B shows dividends but there is no Schedule D, you may not be rebalancing your portfolio to keep the right mix of stocks and bonds to meet your long-term goals within your personal risk tolerance.RETIREMENT SAVINGS “You always want to put away as much as you can on a tax-deferred basis,” Mr. Benson said. If you are an employee, look at your Form W-2 to see if you have made the maximum contribution to a 401(k), 403(b) or other employer-sponsored plan. The income from wages and salaries reported on Line 7 of the 1040 is after the retirement contribution.Self-employed people can set up several different types of tax-deferred retirement plans, including the Simplified Employee Pension, known as SEP, and Simple and qualified plans, such as solo 401(k) plans. And they can take a deduction for their contributions on Line 28 of the 1040. People whose retirement accounts have eroded in recent years may want to generate some self-employment income and contribute as much as possible to one of these plans to rebuild retirement savings, Mr. Kess said.People whose employers do not sponsor retirement plans or whose income is below certain limits can put $5,000, or $6,000 if age 50 or older, into a deductible I.R.A. To encourage lower-paid workers to save for retirement, Congress has authorized a tax credit, which offsets taxes dollar for dollar, of up to $1,000 for single filers or $2,000 for married filers. That is claimed on Line 50 of the return and on Form 8880.DEDUCTIONS Schedule A, which lists itemized deductions, gives rise to several planning issues. For people who are not liable for the alternative minimum tax, state income taxes are deductible. Some people are liable for taxes in two states because they maintain two homes, Mr. Benson said. With state taxes generally rising, people thinking of buying a second home or of eventually retiring to a different state may want to check the state and local tax rates first.If you take a deduction for mortgage interest expense, consider the rate on your mortgage, he said. With today’s low interest rates, it may make sense to refinance, he added, though the rules are tricky and careful study is needed.Many people write checks to favorite charities and claim a tax deduction. But the tax savings can be far larger if they give appreciated securities, which are deductible at market value with no capital gains tax due. Affluent people may “discover the enjoyment of lifetime charitable giving,” as distinct from bequests, Mr. Breitbard said. If so, they may want to set up charitable trusts, donor-advised funds or private foundations for tax-efficient giving.SELF-EMPLOYMENT If you are filing Schedule C as a sole practitioner, Mr. Kess said, ask your adviser if you would be better off with a limited liability company. Other tax-saving moves for self-employed people, he said, include hiring family members to do legitimate work. That will shift income to them and may make them eligible for retirement and health plans.'"
"'10-03-25,'1','Sandy Chilewich didn’t create her new pet mats so that Scooter, her black-and-white Havanese, could be chic. Ms. Chilewich, a Manhattan designer who makes place mats, floor mats and bags from woven vinyl, had a more practical motivation. “When we make custom floor mats, we have scrap left over,” she said. The Pet Mat ($35) was the answer, since it is relatively small, at 24 by 14 1/2 inches.“The next stop will be kitty mats,” said her husband, Joe Sultan, Chilewich’s chief executive. Will it have a cut-out image of a cat? Probably not, he said — there doesn’t seem to be a universal image of a cat. “We’re thinking of doing paws.”'"
"'10-03-25,'1','With American playwrights and theaters perennially pinched for income, the Public Theater and Roundabout Theater Company in New York are changing policies to help writers earn a better living while allowing theaters to retain a financial stake in new plays when they go on to future theatrical, film or television productions.The new policies are a response to growing complaints from playwrights. They say that they cannot afford to support themselves on income from their plays and that they — not theaters — are entitled to have the chance to make significant money from their work in the years after debut productions.A study by the Theater Development Fund this winter reported that the average playwright earns $25,000 to $39,999 annually from all income sources, with about 62 percent making less than $40,000 and nearly a third pulling in less than $25,000.Leaders of the Public said in interviews that they were immediately altering their policy on so-called subsidiary rights to help provide “a living wage” to playwrights, who often turn to writing for film and television for their livelihood. While the Public previously took an average of 10 percent of royalties for productions mounted over a 10-year period, it will now forgo that percentage until playwrights earn $75,000 in royalties from runs elsewhere. The policy change will mean a loss of at least $100,000 in annual income for the Public, which has an operating budget of $19 million. “The playwright needs the money more than the Public does,” said Oskar Eustis, the Public’s artistic director.Roundabout executives, in announcing their revision to subsidiary rights on Tuesday, said they were acting after discussions with playwrights about making money in the theater world. Roundabout had clashed in recent years with writers who were angry about the theater’s royalty policy; in 2008, the playwright Craig Lucas removed his play “A Prayer for My Enemy” from the Roundabout’s season because of the issue of future royalties.'"
"'10-03-25,'1','This brothy dish isn’t quite brothy enough to qualify as a soup — it’s more of a filling stew. I like to combine beans and greens, but this time I threw in some rice, which makes the dish all the more comforting and filling.1. Stem the Swiss chard, and wash both the stems and the leaves in at least two changes of water until thoroughly clean. Dice the stems if they’re wide, and set aside. Stack the leaves and cut in wide ribbons or chop coarsely. Set aside separately from the stems.2. Heat the oil in a large, heavy soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, and add the onion and diced chard stems. Cook, stirring often, until the onion softens, about five minutes. Add half the garlic, and stir together for 30 seconds to a minute until fragrant. Add the beans, bay leaf, Parmesan rind (tie the bay leaf and rind together with a kitchen string to make retrieval easier) and 2 quarts water. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce the heat and simmer one hour. Add the remaining garlic and salt to taste, and simmer for another 30 minutes to an hour until the beans are tender.3. Add the rice and pepper, and simmer 15 minutes until the rice is tender. Stir in the chard leaves, and simmer another five to 10 minutes until the chard is tender but still bright. The mixture should be soupy but thick. Season to taste with salt and fresh black pepper. Squeeze on some fresh lemon juice — 2 to 3 teaspoons — if desired, and serve in wide soup bowls.Advance preparation: You can make this through step 2 up to three days ahead. Bring to a simmer and proceed with step 3.'"
"'10-03-25,'1','A. The very clear answer is yes, given that so many consumers have had positive experiences and continue to use the site today. I don’t think we would have lasted five years if we didn’t have the filter.Q.. Some critics have compared becoming a Yelp advertiser with “buying protection” from the Mafia. Is there anything you do for an advertiser that gives protection?A. Absolutely not. There is this conspiracy theory being perpetuated by these businesses and then through the media that somehow the review filter is linked to our sales reps or that sales reps have any control, “Oh, we can make this review go away.” Absolutely not. The review filter is automated. It doesn’t take into account advertiser status. It works the same for everybody.Q. If nothing else, do you think you have a public relations problem?A. There’s simply anger over the accountability that Yelp brings and also this feeling of powerlessness because so much power is now being put in the hands of the consumer. But the important thing that gets lost with some of these business owners who are very upset with us is it’s the whole picture that counts. Focusing on that one review you feel is unfair misses the value, which is the whole symphony of opinions you get on your page.Q.. Do you wish you’d done anything differently in explaining Yelp to businesses?A. We’re hearing the frustration and confusion. We’ve stepped up our efforts in local business outreach in a huge way. We have a manager who now spends almost all of his time going to events where there are a lot of local businesses. We want to be there to help explain how the site works, how it can be helpful and the free tools.Q. Do advertisers get tools for dealing with nasty comments that nonadvertisers don’t?A. Every business owner can unlock their page and tap into free tools, including being able to privately or publicly message their customers. They can even put special offers up on their page that get broadcast to other parts of the site for free. It’s simple to unlock. There’s no cost. There are so many businesses that are succeeding on Yelp that don’t pay us a dollar, and we’re really excited about that.Q. So what’s the incentive to advertise on Yelp?A. The primary thing our advertisers are purchasing is actually advertising. Depending on what your price level is, you get a certain number of impressions of those ads, both at the top of search and on related business pages. So if you’re an Italian restaurant you might show up on a pizza restaurant page or another Italian restaurant page. Beyond that, there are also a couple of enhancements that happen on your business page. You’re buying out that ad inventory that would otherwise be on your page. You get a slide show so the photos on your page are a little bigger and rotate. You also get to highlight one review, which is clearly marked as your favorite. That’s it.Q. Does the venom directed toward you personally give you any empathy for a restaurateur or retailer who gets nasty reviews?A. Clearly there is an analogy there. But I would say I take my own advice. I’m able to see the big picture. I stay focused on the fact that consumers love it.Q. Have you ever thought to yourself, I’m the most hated man in small business?A. You can’t really feel that way if you have 30 million consumers visiting you every month. I meet business owners all the time, and the reality is they’re not all angry. The ones who are calling lawyers or calling the media are upset, but that’s not necessarily a representative sample. For perspective, it’s important to remember that there are up to 15 million businesses that you can find on Yelp and 10 million reviews. We have tens of thousands of advertisers. We have some lawsuits from a handful, I think 12, local businesses. In the grand perspective, it’s really a drop in the bucket.A. There were a few months when we slowed our expenses during the depths of the recession and became cash-flow positive. But as things stabilized, we started investing again, and so we’re not profitable right now. We have a lot of faith that our model will allow us to become profitable sometime within the next few years.Q. According to recent news reports, Google offered upward of half a billion dollars for your company. Why did the deal fall apart?A. We can’t comment about any conversations we may or may not have been having in the past. Recently we did complete a financing with Elevation Partners that allows us to remain independent, and we’re really excited about growing the company independently in the years to come.Q. If you sold Yelp, what would you do next?A. It’s hard to imagine a scenario where that happens in the near term. I’m very much committed to seeing Yelp through for a very long time.Q. So you won’t be opening a restaurant any time soon?A. Yeah, I don’t think I’m going to be opening any local businesses.'"
"'10-03-25,'1','On the way in, I had passed a futonlike flat on the floor displaying the season’s new sandals. They were not dissimilar to Prada’s sporty platform sandals, but were noticeably huge, with a wide, square toe and a rounded base like the bottom of a rowboat. My first thought was that they were bold and commendable: metallic T-strap sandals for men!“What size are those?” I asked, expecting an answer in the gentleman’s footwear range.“This is the last 38,” she said. “They’re really popular.”I had that vertiginous wah-wah feeling one gets when plunged into cognitive dissonance.The sandals, detailed with silver mesh, were more or less my size, but looked as if they would fit my dad, and seemed, literally, to weigh around three pounds. But they are very comfortable, which made me think that Shelley Winters might have enjoyed wearing them to assist in her own drowning by Montgomery Clift.Upstairs, I found an asymmetrical white goddess dress, which was difficult to envision outside a toga party. A rack of offerings in sea-foam green and soapy mauve were so timidly undersexed that it was impossible not to associate them with mothers of brides, but I couldn’t tell if this was intentional.We scuttled off to the dressing rooms, with stacks of loot. I was excited to try a sleeveless tank dress in shimmery liquid satin ($1,095). It didn’t give me the chrome hood-ornament effect I had hoped for. There was an asymmetrical bunching at one side that made me resemble a sock scrunched the wrong way down a combat boot.Johanna was confident that a particular pewter cocktail dress would win my love, once on. I wasn’t so sure; it was a roiling mass of gray pin-tucks, swooping in conflicting directions for a crosscurrent-undertow effect. I was willing to be won over, but the dress was not kind. I staggered out to show her.“I am your lung after five years of chain-smoking,” I said in the affectless voice of a disembodied organ.She liked it. I didn’t understand it.We had great hopes for a teal silk-jersey dress with lovely mandarin-neck detail ($600).“Nope,” Johanna called from the dressing room. It was clingy in all the wrong places — too tight over the curves; loose and baggy in the middle — basically the problem I had with the things I tried on: knit numbers that had a kicky Zelda Fitzgerald look on the hanger, but on the body evoked the wrong years of Brigitte Nielson.Best of show was Johanna’s first pick: the black sheath funeral dress ($895), which had lovely tailoring and made her look like the comeliest researcher in the cryogenics lab.I was totally bewildered. I cornered our salesman, the kind and helpful David Sim, and asked him as delicately as possible, “Is Calvin Klein being designed primarily for the Asian market now?”Mr. Sim smiled serenely. “Calvin Klein does a lot more business in Asia and Europe” than in the States.Suddenly it all made sense: the baby pinks, too-polite cashmeres, proper necklines and sheath cuts dropping straight from the shoulders to the knees, with fewer of the usual feminine detours. Once there were subtle perks to being a functional superpower: Everything was attuned to our cultural preferences, from candy flavors to comedy films to electronic beeping sounds. We were once the gravitational center of the aesthetic universe. We aren’t anymore.Who would have predicted that China would eventually come between Brooke and her Calvins?The brand has changed; the bronze Calvin Klein in white who danced so well at Studio 54 isn’t the sun god around which it orbits anymore. The brand’s aesthetic loyalties have expatriated to where the gold is.It’s our fault, really: We drove Calvin away. America went to the economic Russian roulette table with the bluster of a drunk cowboy. We became greedy, whacked-out and belligerent in those lost, unregulated years. We gambled away everything sacred, sucked our friends and families dry, ordered more rounds on our maxed-out credit cards and sucker-punched anyone who tried to tell us how fast our chips were falling.Now, in the unforgiving light of a fluorescent hangover, we are here: facing the loss of our face, our boots, our Calvins and everything that was in them, standing by a crumbling roadway, trying to hitch a ride on that slow boat to China.COOLER KLIME Styles may have changed at Calvin Klein, but you can still count on the essentials. It’s still a high, cool white box where one can find Hamptons linens, table-top sets and unabashedly huge coffee-table books by Kelly Klein on subjects like “Pools” and “Horse.”CLIPPED ’N’ KLEEN The staff is kindly and hospitable, used to a haute international clientele that likes shiny flat shoes and cashmere tanks.CRISPY KREME It’s a softer, pinker look these days for the perennially modern line, but if your idea of one-stop shopping includes everything from martini shakers to a vaguely Japanese asymmetrical wedding dress — well, you’re probably too wealthy to be American.'"
"'10-03-25,'1','Described as the most sweeping change in financial rules since the Depression, the legislation would create a council to detect and avert serious risks to the financial system.It would also expand the Federal Reserve’s oversight over the largest and most interconnected financial companies, create an agency to regulate mortgages and credit cards, and regulate many of the over-the-counter derivatives that helped bring about the 2008 financial crisis.The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, who was at the White House meeting, said that Democrats were emboldened after Sunday’s health care vote by the House.“There are Republicans I serve with in the Senate who frankly don’t want to just say ‘no policy’ when it comes to major legislative initiatives,” Mr. Dodd said. “And they would like to be part of this debate and offer constructive ideas to this proposal.”He added: “So I’m much more optimistic. In light of what happened on health care, I think, frankly the outcome there I think has strengthened our hand in reaching out to people who would like to be part of the solution.”The health care vote even prompted Mr. Frank to make a quip about the financial overhaul. “There are going to be death panels enacted by the Congress this year — but they’re death panels for large financial institutions that can’t make it,” he said.Mr. Dodd’s committee sent the bill to the full Senate on Monday on a party-line vote, after Republicans decided it would be better to bring their amendments to the floor of the Senate and not try to hold up the bill in committee.In contrast to the economic stimulus and the health care overhaul, where the White House outlined broad goals but largely left it to Congress to shape the legislation, the administration has been intensely engaged in drafting the legislation.“The president expects that we will finish financial reform in the next couple of months, certainly by the time we mark the second anniversary of the financial collapse in the early fall,” Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said.The administration has been trying to make it difficult for the Republicans to vote no by tapping into populist resentment over the bank bailouts. “People are going to have an opportunity to weigh in on behalf of the banks or on behalf of consumers,” Mr. Gibbs said. “And I’ll let their vote on that dictate which side of that ledger they feel most comfortable on.”The Democratic momentum appeared to be occurring amid a split in the Republican ranks.Mr. Corker, who had negotiated with Mr. Dodd after an earlier round of talks between Mr. Dodd and the top Republican on the committee, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, fell apart, said in a statement that “our hand has been weakened now that the bill has left the committee on a party-line vote,” calling it “a strategic error.”The comments were an implicit criticism of Mr. Shelby, who met with Republican members of the committee in the afternoon to plan strategy.The legislation that the Senate will take up after a two-week recess has critics on both sides.While it would lead to higher capital requirements, stricter regulation and new limits on risk-taking by banks, it would not break up any large banks, as some critics from the left have urged.Republicans and business associations have raised other objections. They are concerned about the scope of authority for the new consumer agency, as well as new rules governing the trading of derivatives and provisions intended to end the “too big to fail” phenomenon.The United States Chamber of Commerce has spent $3 million on an advertising campaign opposing the consumer agency.In a sharply worded speech to the chamber on Wednesday, the deputy Treasury secretary, Neal S. Wolin, criticized the campaign.“That campaign is not designed to improve the House and Senate bills,” he said. “It is designed to defeat them. It is designed to delay reform until the memory of the crisis fades and the political will for change dies out.”R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the chamber, later issued a statement accusing Mr. Wolin of “political grandstanding and distortion of facts.”'"

"'10-03-26,'1','Yet auditors found problems beyond the approval of nonexistent products. They determined that once a company registered as an EnergyStar partner, it could download the logo from the government’s Web site and paste it on products for which it had not even requested approval.The report is only the latest in a series involving the 18-year-old EnergyStar program, which was set up to guide the public on energy-efficient choices that could both save people money and help reduce the nation’s runaway energy consumption.Watchdogs within the Environment Protection Agency and the Department of Energy have reported in the past that Energy Star has taken some claims of energy efficiency on faith. Yet the new study suggests that it often does so on remote control.Congressional auditors said they were told by EnergyStar officials that some of the approvals, including the one for the gasoline alarm clock, had been issued by an automated system and that the details had probably never been reviewed by a human being.Ms. Vargas added that the automated system that green-lighted the clock was only a preliminary “screen” to evaluate energy figures submitted by manufacturers and to cut out products that did not qualify. Every product that is certified is reviewed by a human being, she said.But Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who requested the accountability office study, said in an interview, “I don’t think I’d admit that.”If a government employee or contractor examined the comical picture submitted of the space heater with a feather duster, or read the description of the gas-powered clock — with dimensions suggesting it was the size of an electric generator — “and red flags didn’t get raised, that’s a really troubling commentary,” Ms. Collins said.She said the ease with which the auditors had fooled the program suggested that consumers and agencies that rely on the logo were paying extra for products that might not actually save energy. “This program is extraordinarily easy to defraud,” she said.Ms. Collins also noted that the economic stimulus bill included hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for people who buy EnergyStar products and that many government agencies were required to choose EnergyStar products if they were available.In effect, people “are ripped off twice,” as consumers and as taxpayers, she said.Previous reports have suggested that the EnergyStar label is not always a complete or useful guide to the best consumer choices. Last October, for example, the inspector general of the E.P.A. said that 100 percent of the computer monitors that carried the EnergyStar logo had indeed met requirements. But so did 80 percent of the monitors that did not have the logo; the manufacturers had apparently not sought approval. For computer printers, 95 percent of the ones with the logo qualified, but so did 60 percent of the ones that did not have the logo.And some consumer products lacking EnergyStar approval consumed less energy than those that had it, the audit found.And the inspector general of the Energy Department reported the same month that EnergyStar claims were not “accurate or verifiable” for many products. The program requires manufacturers of windows and fluorescent lights to get their products certified by independent laboratories. But companies that make refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers, water heaters and room air-conditioners, in which efficiency is far more critical because they gobble more energy, need only check a box on a form to be certified.The Energy Department has promised to set up a system of independent verification for all products. Last week, it said it would begin testing refrigerators, freezers, clothes washers, dishwashers, water heaters and room air-conditioners. In October 2008, Consumer Reports magazine reported it had tested refrigerators built by LG of South Korea and found that they were not nearly as efficient as the maker claimed. LG eventually agreed to modify the machines already sold to reduce electricity consumption and to reimburse customers. Last week, the Energy Department said it had found a Samsung refrigerator that did not comply.The Energy Department does spot check some items with the EnergyStar logo, but mostly the ones that do not use much power in the first place. The department recently announced that several models of compact fluorescent lamps would have to remove the EnergyStar logo because they were not durable enough. It has conducted spot checks on regulated appliances that do not carry the logo and determined that some cannot be legally sold because they do not meet minimum efficiency standards.The audit to be released Friday did not set out to test any products but focused solely on testing the certification process by submitting bogus products.Gene Rodrigues, the director of customer energy efficiency at Southern California Edison, suggested that the EnergyStar label suffered from its appeal to manufacturers. “It may be that their ability to properly manage the brand suffered at the fringes,” he said of the program’s overseers.He argues that a strong federal certification program is vital. “What we in the program industry are looking for is for this to be a wake-up call to whip them into shape,” he said.In another sign that Energy Star is not dotting its i’s, program officials told the auditors that they sought to assure honesty by warning corporate applicants on some of its paperwork that intentionally submitting false information is a crime, under Title 18 of the United States Code.But it is a crime under Title 19, not 18, and the warning does not appear on all of the relevant forms, the report said.'"
"'10-03-26,'1','Washington also agreed to give European carriers new commercial opportunities to fly between the United States and third countries in the future, once existing European restrictions on airport noise pollution were lifted.At a briefing in Brussels, the chief negotiators for Europe and the United States acknowledged butting up against existing laws that limited how much they could achieve during the talks.“There are some things that weren’t possible,” said John R. Byerly, the United States deputy assistant secretary for transportation affairs. “We have to respect the abilities of each side to move forward as it can.”Mr. Byerly acknowledged there was no timetable for changing American legislation on foreign ownership, and Daniel Calleja, the chief negotiator for the European Commission, said there was no timetable for changing the noise laws in Europe. “We are not putting deadlines on the work of our legislators,” Mr. Calleja said.The European Union has predicted that the provisions in the agreement could increase annual trans-Atlantic traffic by as much as 26 million passengers, to about 75 million by 2013, and generate up to 12 billion euros in economic benefits, like lower fares for consumers.Airlines, however, criticized the deal, particularly over ownership issues.“It is disappointing that, at this critical time, we did not make significant progress on the issue of ownership,” said Giovanni Bisignani, the director general and chief executive of the International Air Transport Association.“The long-term financial sustainability of the industry is dependent on normal commercial freedoms,” he said. “I urge both governments to keep this on the radar screen for urgent follow-up.”British Airways, which called on Britain in 2007 to scuttle the accord if the United States failed to concede on ownership limits, expressed dismay that those limits would remain in place for the foreseeable future.“We call on both sides to honor the firm commitments they have made in this agreement to further liberalization, and to redouble their efforts going forward,” it said.Under the terms of the second-stage agreement, the United States did agree to further open its aviation market. For instance, European Union carriers gained greater access to travel by American government employees, which had previously been restricted under a policy called “Fly America.”In an apparent change of tone, Washington also agreed to explore ways that a proposed American trading system for carbon emissions could interlink with an existing European system, which includes aviation. But the two sides also agreed to continue negotiations toward a global approach to aviation emissions regulation under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations.The subject of emissions trading was deliberately left out of the 2007 open skies deal. The administration of President George W. Bush was opposed to Europe’s plans to include aviation in its emissions trading program starting in 2012, arguing that the European program was probably illegal under international conventions governing civil aviation.The accord signed Thursday contains a road map for discussions on greenhouse gas emissions, which signals that the United States is backing away from the aggressive attitude of the Bush administration, European Union officials said.The accord underlines that Washington “is showing more emphasis on cooperation rather than legal challenges,” Mr. Calleja said.“Today’s agreement strengthens our already close aviation relationship with our European partners,” the United States transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, said in a statement. “President Obama promised European leaders that we would reach an agreement this year, and today we fulfill that promise.”Analysts said the deal reached Thursday was a pragmatic one that at least guaranteed that the terms of the 2007 accord remained in place indefinitely.“The two sides have come together in a sensible way, keeping the fundamental elements of the original agreement in place and enhancing them,” said Jeffrey N. Shane, a partner with Hogan & Hartson in Washington and a former Transportation Department under secretary who helped negotiate the 2007 accord. “This ensures that we will continue to enjoy the benefits of a liberalized trans-Atlantic aviation market.”'"
"'10-03-26,'1','In its statement, the Dubai government said that $5.7 billion of the cash infusion came from the original $10 billion loan and the rest, $3.8 billion, came from internal resources. It remained unclear where these internally generated funds came from.Bankers in Dubai said that as a result, write-downs on loans would be less than previously forecast. They said that banks with significant exposure to Dubai, which include Standard Chartered, HSBC Holdings, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, might respond to the offer within a month or so.The package was presented to bankers Wednesday in meetings in Dubai.Last November, confusion, uncertainty and a brief spasm of investor panic ensued when the government of Dubai abruptly notified its creditors that it would delay interest payments on the $23 billion in debt that Dubai World owed creditors.The thought that Dubai, and by association its oil-rich neighbor Abu Dhabi, might not back the mountains of debt taken on by Dubai World and other government-sponsored entities came as a shock to banks and hedge funds everywhere. It contributed to a significant extent to the increased sensitivity that investors now have regarding the ability of sovereign countries to pay back their debts, especially in Europe.The harsh market reaction took government officials in the United Arab Emirates by surprise, and steps were quickly taken to ensure that Dubai World and its subsidiaries would not go bankrupt, starting with a payment earlier this year to holders of Nakheel’s bonds.In its statement, Dubai made clear that changes would come at Dubai World, through sales of noncore operations and other restructuring initiatives.Nakheel, whose highly leveraged luxury developments — including artificial islands off the coast — came to symbolize Dubai’s brash aspirations, will work on a restructuring agreement with its banks. It is now expected to fulfill its obligations to the holders of its Islamic bonds, or sukuks, which come due in 2010 and 2011.While analysts say it is likely that banks will take the deal, as they want to maintain ties with the United Arab Emirates, trade creditors may be less willing to accept a similar “haircut,” or markdown, on their positions. In the statement, Dubai addressed this issue by saying that trade creditors would be offered a “significant cash payment and a tradable security.”Nakheel will now be owned directly by the government, not Dubai World.While the real estate market remains weak in Dubai and growth is nowhere near as buoyant as it was before the crisis, the restructuring proposal is likely to give comfort to lenders and investors, many of which have forsworn the region because of the uncertainty surrounding Abu Dhabi’s commitment to Dubai.Still, Dubai public entities like Dubai World have experienced a wave of downgrades by credit ratings agencies and, dependent as they are on further borrowing to finance their investments, will have to scale back their spending ambitions in the coming years.Stocks rallied in Dubai on Thursday, with the benchmark DFM general index adding 4.3 percent, and the cost of insuring the emirate’s bonds with credit-default swaps fell.The shares of Royal Bank of Scotland, Standard Chartered and HSBC Holdings, which have significant exposure to Dubai, all rose in London.According to a Dubai government official who has played a leading role in working with the companies on their restructuring proposals, the reception to the proposal Thursday from banks so far has been positive.“We have every reason to believe the discussions are going well,” said the official, who was not identified because of government policy. “I feel we are on the right track.”Dubai, one of the seven members of the United Arab Emirates, has negligible oil reserves, unlike Abu Dhabi. Under Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, its ruler, the tiny principality has sought to modernize its economy by transforming itself into a regional financial and services hub.But as in the United States and Britain, property-sector lending grew unsustainably fast, and Dubai had to ask Abu Dhabi for help in renegotiating its debt. On Dec. 14, Abu Dhabi obliged, pledging $10 billion to help Dubai repay a maturing bond.'"
"'10-03-26,'1','SAN ANTONIO — A Defense Department official who is suspected of using private contractors in Afghanistan to help track and kill militants has denied that he did anything wrong, and he asserted that all his work had been approved by top American military commanders.In an interview with The San Antonio Express-News, the official, Michael D. Furlong, said his work was limited to managing contractors who gathered information intended to inform troops about their environment and to protect them from roadside bombs.He flatly denied claims that his team, which included former operatives of the C.I.A. and military Special Operations units, fed information to military intelligence agencies for possible lethal action in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Spying for the military by a private contractor is generally considered illegal.Mr. Furlong told The Express-News in interviews last week, parts of which were quoted in an article posted on its Web site on Wednesday, that the allegations were meant to cover up a turf war between the Pentagon and the C.I.A., which saw his activities as an infringement on their work. He said he had been locked out of his office at Lackland Air Force Base here, which prevented him from having access to e-mail messages and other documents that could prove his innocence.Mr. Furlong, a civilian employee of the military and a retired Army officer, complained that he was being treated as a “fall guy,” and he said no one on his team was ever involved with combat operations like kicking in doors or firing on militant targets. His work, he said, was aimed only at “providing the best force protection we can provide all those 20-somethings in the foxholes.” He added, “It’s about saving lives.”'"
"'10-03-26,'1','“Who would go into business on an ‘honor system’?” said Mr. Liu, who was joined at a news conference outside his office at 1 Centre Street by Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, and several advocates for the homeless. “This current honor system engaged between the agency and service providers is simply bad business practice. The City of New York is getting the raw end of this deal: poor management and no accountability.”The audit’s findings echo past audits and reports of shoddy management practices by the Department of Homeless Services, and undermine Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s promise after one such report in 2003 to do a better job of entering into contracts.The audit also comes as the Bloomberg administration, as part of an overall belt-tightening, has proposed cutting services to alleviate homelessness, an issue that has bedeviled the mayor since he took office. Though Mr. Bloomberg vowed in 2004 to cut the city’s homeless population of 38,000 by two-thirds within five years, the population remains virtually unchanged.The proposed budget of $329 million for the Department of Homeless Services for the next fiscal year is $11 million less than the current one, and roughly 11 percent less than in the fiscal year 2008.“These findings are disconcerting on many levels,” said Judith Goldiner, supervising attorney with the Legal Aid Society’s law reform unit. “By failing to adequately monitor providers, D.H.S. has shortchanged the city’s homeless, and taxpayers throughout the city. Such waste is unacceptable in any climate, and it is even more harmful during a time of economic strife.”But Bloomberg administration officials vigorously defended their policies. They said that the audit revisited a longstanding philosophical tug of war between the contracting approach favored by many social service agencies — which the administration said was too rigid and took too long — and its preferred per-diem approach, which the administration said was more flexible in dealing with short-term emergencies.“This is not news,” Robert V. Hess, the city’s commissioner for homeless services, said in an interview. “This debate has been going on for years.”Mr. Hess explained that the city had entered into no-contract deals because “it’s the only legal way we can add to our immediate need for additional capacity.” He added: “We come to an agreement with a landlord about a price per night; and we pay that as a billing rate. It’s the only way we can add capacity quickly.”City officials noted that Mr. Liu’s predecessor, William C. Thompson Jr., conducted a similar audit in 2003 that criticized the Bloomberg administration’s practices. Mr. Thompson went to court last October over a specific contract in the Bronx, just as he was entering the home stretch of his unsuccessful bid to defeat Mr. Bloomberg in the November mayoral election. The current audit began under Mr. Thompson.“We look forward to working with Comptroller Liu to find a better legal way to expedite shelter procurements and not leave the most vulnerable men, women, and children out in the cold because of bureaucratic red tape,” Mr. Hess said.Beyond the findings related to the debate over noncontracts, the audit said that the city did not get people out of temporary housing fast enough. On average, homeless families spend about nine months in transitional housing.In 2008, more than 90 percent of service providers did not meet their goals for moving people into permanent homes, the audit said. Sixty-two percent of those who were living in one temporary center in the Bronx stayed for more than nine months, at a cost of $4.3 million. One person stayed for six and a half years.The audit also described unsanitary conditions in apartments, with cockroaches, dirty mattresses and mold-covered hallways. Such findings mirrored the results of previous audits. The audit included photos of poor conditions that investigators said they found at several buildings, including one at 1173 Walton Avenue in the Bronx.Mr. Hess said that the conditions at 1173 Walton Avenue and other buildings, which were made known to the agency last summer, were now being addressed, with inspections every two weeks, versus a “bit longer” previously.“These were isolated incidents,” he said. “We certainly don’t want there to be anything other than high-quality conditions.”'"
"'10-03-26,'1','The revelations around the European cell were particularly disturbing, said Bruce Riedel, who was a member of the National Security Council in the Clinton administration and is now at the Brookings Institution. They showed that “Al Qaeda still has a significant operational infrastructure somewhere in Europe,” he said. Mr. Headley’s story also showed in clear contours the close relationship between Al Qaeda and the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, he said.Mr. Headley was able to use his Pakistani and American heritage to great advantage, playing up his American descent on his mother’s side in India, and then behaving as a Pakistani in Pakistan, where his father was born.As he became more intensely involved in the web of militant activities in Pakistan — sometimes training for months at a time — and then making five trips to Mumbai from 2006 to 2008 to scout locations, Mr. Headley kept his base in Chicago, the document says.Mr. Headley started his career as a militant scout with Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terrorist group established decades ago with the help of the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies to fight against India’s control of disputed territory in Kashmir.Lashkar was supposed to have been outlawed in Pakistan in 2002, but it remains active behind the veil of a public charity in Pakistan and, according to Mr. Headley’s plea, continued to be assisted by former Pakistani military officials in recent years.From 2002 to 2005, Mr. Headley trained at Lashkar camps on five occasions, learning about explosives, small arms and countersurveillance techniques.The plea names a retired Pakistani military officer, Col. Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed, known as Pasha, as Mr. Headley’s main contact with Lashkar. Earlier prosecution documents said that Colonel Syed was arrested last year in Pakistan on unspecified charges, but then released. In early 2009 Colonel Syed introduced Mr. Headley to Muhammad Ilyas Kashmiri, a Qaeda operative in North Waziristan, according to the document.Colonel Syed then served as the go-between for the men, who all met together in North Waziristan, according to the document.The visit in February 2009 may finally have put Mr. Headley on the radar of the American authorities, who started tracking him in the late spring of last year, Mr. Riedel said. Mr. Kashmiri is considered to be one of Al Qaeda’s most dangerous commanders. The Long War Journal, a Web site that specializes in reports on militancy, says he is a former member of Pakistan’s elite commando Special Services Group, though Pakistani intelligence officials deny that. He was the target of a drone attack last September. After initial reports that he was killed, it appears that he survived, according to Pakistani officials and militants.It was Mr. Kashmiri who asked Mr. Headley to help plan the attack against the Danish newspaper, the plea document says.After Mr. Headley’s second trip to North Waziristan in May of last year, he was told by Mr. Kashmiri that the “elders” had approved the attack in Denmark, a remark that Mr. Headley understood to mean the Qaeda leadership, the agreement says.The attack against the newspaper, which involved a Qaeda cell already in place in Europe, was planned to be particularly gruesome, with suicide attackers trying to kill everyone in the building, the plea says.As the planning for the Copenhagen attack unfolded, Mr. Headley returned to Denmark for a final scouting mission last August.He then met with the Qaeda team in Europe, according to the agreement. The precise location of that meeting with Qaeda operatives is not specified in the document, apparently in deference to investigations by Western intelligence agencies. When Mr. Headley was arrested on Oct. 3, 2009, he was headed to Pakistan once again to meet Mr. Kashmiri in North Waziristan to hand over 13 surveillance videos he had taken in Copenhagen.Mr. Headley’s plea agreement with the government was not his first. After being sentenced for drug trafficking in the 1990s, he served as an informant in Pakistan for the Drug Enforcement Agency as part of a deal for a lighter sentence. He was in Pakistan for the drug agency from the late 1990s until at least 2001. By 2002, he was training with Lashkar, raising the possibility that he had made contact with the militants while still working for the drug agency.In addition to sites in Mumbai, Mr. Headley scouted targets in Pune and Goa, the document says. He was sent to Mumbai several times, it says. There, he made videos of the targets, including the Taj Mahal Hotel, took coordinates with a GPS unit, and scouted sites in the harbor where 10 Lashkar militants landed Nov. 26, 2008, in inflatable boats. They killed 163 people.'"
"'10-03-26,'1','The Credit Suisse Group’s chief executive, Brady Dougan, received 19.2 million Swiss francs ($18 million) in compensation last year, increasing his salary almost sevenfold.Mr. Dougan’s pay included 17.9 million Swiss francs in bonuses and a fixed salary of 1.25 million Swiss francs, the bank said in its annual report, published on Thursday. That made him the highest-paid member of the executive board.Credit Suisse, which is based in Zurich and is Switzerland’s biggest bank by market value, said Mr. Dougan’s compensation in 2008 was 2.86 million francs. Credit Suisse reported net income of 6.72 billion francs for last year, compared with a net loss of 8.22 billion francs for 2008. The bank had a “strong start” to the year, Mr. Dougan said last month.Earlier, Deutsche Bank reported that the pay of its chief, Josef Ackermann, jumped more than sixfold to 9.55 million euros ($12.7 million) after the bank restored earnings. UBS’s chief, Oswald Grübel, declined a bonus and was paid 3 million francs in fixed salary after his company reported its third annual loss.Credit Suisse, which set aside 6.87 billion francs in bonuses for 2009, said last month that it deferred 40 percent of the variable compensation into future years. Members of the executive board received only deferred awards, which could be reduced in the future based on the company’s performance.The executive board’s total compensation for 2009 amounted to 148.9 million francs, including 132.4 million francs in bonuses. That compares with 106.7 million francs paid to the board for 2008, when Mr. Dougan and the head of the investment bank, Paul Calello, did not receive any bonuses.'"
"'10-03-26,'1','When suspicious villagers reported the strange couple in the old castle to the authorities, gendarmes searched the place for expected bomb-making material, but the studio with pictures of the mischievous monkey convinced them of the Reys’ innocence.Apparently, Fifi/George served much the same function when, in more serious straits in June 1940, his creators fled Paris on bicycles Hans Rey built from parts. As Louise Borden described in her 2005 picture book, “The Journey That Saved Curious George,” they left two days before the Nazis entered Paris and rode 75 miles in three days. Their four-month journey on bicycle, train and boat led them to Lisbon, then to Rio de Janeiro and New York, the drawings offering proof of their occupations when they sought American visas.Surely Curious George could not have more deftly escaped the elevator operator, the firefighters, the farmers, the cook and the zookeepers who at one time or another pursued him through a series of seven books selling almost 30 million copies (thus saving the day for the Reys again).Yet there is something curious here, in the sense of peculiar: a meaning that, the exhibition tells us, prevented the Reys’ British publisher from following the American example in naming the monkey. The suggestion of “strange George” would have also seemed a tasteless allusion to George VI, then the British king (which is why the character became known as Zozo in Britain).At first, the peculiarity is not apparent. The material for this show was gathered by the museum’s curator Claudia J. Nahson, who combed through the extensive archives left by the Reys to the de Grummond Children’s Literature Collection at the University of Southern Mississippi. It is an enticing, appealing, intelligent show, for which Ms. Nahson has included personal memorabilia (including a wedding invitation sent out in 1935, soon after Hans Augusto Reyersbach shortened his last name to Rey, and Margarete Waldstein shortened her first name to Margret; Hans depicted himself as an artist’s palette, and Margret, a photographer, as a camera).There are letters (including some fascinating prewar correspondence with the French publisher Jacques Schiffrin, who tested out one of the Reys’ early books on his son, André) and watercolors of George at his best, along with little-known characters from other books (like Raffy the giraffe, on whose neck a George-like monkey rides to sunlit safety above the clouds). In all, there are about 80 drawings and watercolors, along with photographs Margret took of Paris in the 1930s.The exhibition is also true to its pictorial subject. It playfully expands some drawings into full-scale sets (you enter the first gallery through a portal resembling the entrance to a French hotel in one of the Reys’ prewar books), creates a children’s reading room (with pillows shaped like Georgian creatures) and features a gallery of the Reys’ later work, whose sets evoke the places they ultimately considered home: first Greenwich Village, then Cambridge, Mass.And the peculiarity of the Curious George books? Like the Babar tales (which also grew out of the milieu of 1930s Paris) they have an almost colonial-era vision of the uncultivated naïf at large in the imperial world. But George is far more childish. One appeal of these volumes is their almost manic celebration of innocent desire.“Little monkeys sometimes forget,” we read of the warnings he regularly violates. Seeing something interesting, George, of course, “could not resist.” He lifts a lid on a pot of spaghetti, plays tricks on his bicycle, races down a fire escape, climbs a tree in a natural history museum. His curiosity is clever, but consequences are never foreseen: he seems to be a fearless 5-year-old.Yet his romps began at a place and time —Europe in 1939 — when consequences were all, when almost nothing about the world could be relied on, and when curiosity had to take second place to survival. One reason the Jewish Museum has created this exhibition (and why the new Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco will later show it) is that the Reys were not only Jewish, but they also had lives whose trajectory was a consequence of their identity.But was their work also linked to that identity and their experience? Though the show points out the analogies we might make between the Reys’ adventures and Curious George’s, ultimately, of course, those suggestions are fairly trivial. There is simply nothing in these books that gives a clue of the dark times in which the first of them was conceived or the second one written, nor of the personal facts that led to the Reys’ escape. There is nothing in any of the documents here — and Ms. Nahson said there was nothing in any of the material she examined, either — that indicated the Reys gave much thought to their Jewish origins; nor is there much to suggest an awareness of the wider world in which they were moving.There is a letter here from 1939, written by Hans Rey from the Château Feuga, where the couple had taken temporary shelter; he expresses concern about the war, but notes that “life goes on, the editors edit, the artists draw, even during wartime.”And yes, it does indeed go on, if you can find shelter, though generally, artists and editors have been deeply affected by their experiences. That letter to Schiffrin, in fact, went unanswered for months, since the editor had been drafted into the French Army; he later had to flee for his life as well.But Curious George and his world seem almost to have been a refuge in which historical forces were held at bay by a focus on the timeless innocence of childhood, sensed in the artificial world of this strangely tailless monkey.We know that both the Reys must have enjoyed adventure and exoticism. Hans had moved from Hamburg to Rio de Janeiro as early as 1924, and sold bathtubs and sinks along the Brazilian Amazon. Margret, eight years his junior, went to Rio in 1935; the two were soon married (their families had known each other in Hamburg) and opened Rio’s first advertising agency. Their belated honeymoon in Paris in 1936 turned into a four-year residence. They had taken their two pet marmosets on the voyage, but both had perished.You can sense George’s jungle origins in these facts, along with the almost restless enterprise the monkey displayed. But where is the rest of the world? In the books, it is present mainly by its absence. In the first Curious George book, the exhibition notes, “the ship’s arrival with the yellow-hatted man and George happily displaying their identification papers, stands in contrast to the Reys’ plight at the time.” The drawing was created “when they were struggling to secure the necessary papers to leave France.”There is also a fair number of H. A. Rey’s journals on display here — miniature notebook/calendars — but their main function seems to have been to keep track of expenses in difficult times. The ones selected for display are, presumably, among the most interesting, but their comments are cryptic and unrevealing. It is almost as if there were very little inner life to account for.The duo must have been terrific together; Margret Rey explained how she would often act out George’s gestures as her husband drew. The man in the yellow hat, the exhibition explains, was like Hans Rey, even smoking a pipe. Was George, then, a sort of joint cocoon for them, shaping a world secure enough to exist independent of the forces that gave them chase?The show points out that George’s later stories may reflect some of his creators’ experiences of America, invoking Hollywood, rocket ships, newspapers — the bustle of American commercial and social life. Somehow, the trials of the past must have been subsumed into these books and (judging from the exhibition) other volumes less well known. And whatever darkness they had experienced was displaced by the “disarming innocence,” “buoyant colors” and “unstinting optimism” the show correctly notes that we find in the artwork.For me, this simplicity makes the books less interesting than those of other children’s book writers and illustrators of their era — from Robert McCloskey to Maurice Sendak — but it is still no small achievement to capture the thrills and risks of curious innocence even if they couldn’t capture the real human world surrounding them.The Reys never had any children themselves, though many young readers may have pledged familial allegiance. Later in life, we read, Margret Rey told of a little boy who came to meet them, thinking they were the parents of Curious George. With “disappointment written all over his face,” the boy said, “I thought you were monkeys too.”Not quite, of course — any more than the world in which George moved was the world the Reys knew, all too well.'"
"'10-03-26,'1','The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, looking to counter what it sees as a decline in local journalism and original reporting nationwide, says it will provide money to set up seven regional reporting projects teaming public radio and television stations. The Local Journalism Centers, as they are being called, will hire reporters and editors to report on issues of regional relevance, including the reinvention of the industrial upper Midwest economy, efforts in upstate New York to attract innovative businesses, and agribusiness in the Great Plains. The ideas for what to cover came from the stations themselves, said Patricia Harrison, the president and chief executive of the corporation. “These stations are looking at issues they think need a much deeper dive than they are getting now,” she said. The corporation, which administers federal funds for public broadcasting, will invest $7.5 million in the project over two years, with $3 million more coming from local stations.'"
"'10-03-26,'1','The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Thursday that it was reviewing the use of swaps and other derivatives by mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment products that are often marketed to individual investors.The review has been prompted by what appears to be a growing number of funds, particularly exchange-traded funds, that have sought to use derivatives to provide outsize returns rather than simply track the performance of a market index.During its study, the commission’s staff will suspend any new approvals of exchange-traded funds “that particularly rely on swaps and other derivative instruments to achieve their investment objectives,” the commission said.Andrew J. Donohue, the director of the S.E.C.’s division of investment management, which oversees mutual funds, has been saying publicly for months that the commission was concerned about the dangers presented by funds’ use of derivatives.“Although the use of derivatives by funds is not a new phenomenon,” Mr. Donohue said, “we want to be sure our regulatory protections keep up with the increasing complexity of these instruments and how they are used by fund managers.”'"
"'10-03-26,'1','The choice of Iowa City as the first stop on Mr. Obama’s health care victory lap was fraught with symbolism for the president; it was Iowa, of course, that thrust him into the spotlight when, improbably, he came out on top in the Democratic caucuses here. When he delivered his health care speech here in May 2007, he was facing criticism for lacking substance; his proposal made policy analysts sit up and take notice.“Because of you,” Mr. Obama told the crowd on Thursday, “this is the place where change began.”Now Mr. Obama must convince doubting Americans that the changes he wrought will make their lives better, not worse. And he must also give political cover to Democrats who may have risked their jobs to vote in favor of the bill. Mr. Obama is expected to campaign aggressively for some of those Democrats. Others who did not support the measure, and especially those who changed their votes from an initial yes to a final no, may find it tough to get campaign help from Mr. Obama in the midterm elections this fall.With polls showing the public still uncertain about the law, Mr. Obama will make a series of stops around the country in the coming weeks to tout its more popular provisions, including one allowing young people to stay on their parents’ health insurance plans until they turn 26, another barring insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing medical conditions, and one granting tax credits to help small businesses cover their workers.Here in Iowa City, with Republicans criticizing the measure as a burden on big business, Mr. Obama used his talk to zero in on the aid for smaller employers.“This year, millions of small-business owners will be eligible for tax credits that will help them cover the cost of insurance for their employees,” Mr. Obama said, citing the experience of the Prairie Lights Bookstore in downtown Iowa City , which has been offering coverage to employees but is struggling with rising premiums. The local reference drew a roar from the crowd.“Starting today,” Mr. Obama went on, “small business owners can sit down at the end of the week, look at their expenses, and they can begin calculating how much money they’re going to save. And maybe they can even use that savings to not only provide insurance but also create jobs. This health care tax credit is pro-jobs, it’s pro-business, and it starts this year.”Back in Washington, Republicans were spotlighting another provision that affects business: : the elimination of a subsidy provided to businesses for the purchase of prescription drugs for retirees and their families. The office of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, circulated an article from The Des Moines Register quoting officials of Deere & Company, Iowa’s largest manufacturing employer, saying the bill would cost the company $150 million.Outside the Iowa Field House, a smattering of protesters were on hand to await the president. But so were supporters, with signs reading “Thank You.”Beyond the public option, the plan Mr. Obama signed into law differs in several significant aspects from the one he unveiled here three years ago. Back then, Mr. Obama expected to cover 45 million uninsured Americans; the new law will cover 32 million. Mr. Obama did not envision a mandate requiring all Americans to purchase health insurance; that is one of the more contentious aspects of the new law. And the president’s plan to pay for the bill entirely by rolling back his predecessor’s tax cuts proved unfeasible; the new law includes an excise tax on high-cost insurance plans.Mr. Obama, notably, did not touch on those differences in his speech here. But he did take Republicans to task for what he called “fear-mongering and overheated rhetoric” about the measure. Mocking his critics for referring to passage of the measure as “Armageddon”the president departed from his prepared text.“So after I signed the bill, I looked around to see if there were any asteroids falling, some cracks opening up in the earth,” the president said. “Turned out it was a nice day. Birds were chirping, folks were strolling down the mall, people still had their doctors.”'"
"'10-03-26,'1','Stocks surged for most of the day as Greece and Dubai moved closer to resolving deficit issues, tempering worries that debt troubles might spread to other countries.But a late-afternoon rise in the dollar helped spur a drop in commodity prices, pushing shares of materials and energy companies sharply down.The price of oil fell 8 cents, to $80.16 a barrel, sending Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, down 2.3 percent, to $60.76, and Exxon Mobil down 0.3 percent, to $66.30.As the price of raw materials fell, shares of International Paper declined 3.8 percent, to $25.21; United States Steel dropped 1.8 percent, to $62.37; and Alcoa fell 1.5 percent, to $14.11.Traders were unnerved by a tepid Treasury auction on Thursday, which resurrected worries that the nation might face difficulty financing big expenditures like health care and expanding unemployment benefits. Demand for seven-year government debt was weak, leading to slightly higher interest rates and a drop in prices.The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 7/32, to 97 29/32. The yield rose to 3.88 percent, from 3.85 percent late Wednesday.In recent months, deficit worries have widened to relatively stable countries like the United States. As they try to emerge from the downturn, governments are increasingly facing questions about whether they can afford big-ticket stimulus plans.“Is there enough buying out there to fund these deficits?” said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist for Bell Curve Trading. “That’s the big dark cloud on the horizon.”Concern that unwieldy deficits in Greece and Dubai would undermine the global recovery eased somewhat on Thursday.In addition, the government of Dubai pledged to provide its main investment vehicle, Dubai World, with $9.5 billion to help the firm restructure its debt.In November, a debt crisis in Dubai sent global shockwaves when Dubai World announced that it would need to renegotiate $26 billion in debt, raising the possibility of default.Dan Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital, said concerns about foreign debt would continue to hurt financial markets in the short term.“The notion that we’re going to have worldwide hyperinflation because of these imbalances is not happening,” Mr. Alpert said. “But when people start reading about strikes and riots in the streets, that’s when the markets start getting nervous.”Signs of stability for Greece and Dubai initially helped quell concerns about the European monetary union. But by day’s end, the euro had weakened 0.2 percent against the dollar, to $1.3291, after hitting its lowest levels since May on Wednesday.Investors in the United States got some reassurance from a report showing that the number of people filing first-time unemployment claims dropped more than expected last week.Jobless claims declined 14,000, to 442,000, better than the 6,000 drop predicted by economists. Much of the decline, however, was the result of an adjustment in how the number is calculated.America’s high jobless rate, which stood at 9.7 percent last month, remains a central obstacle to the stock market’s growth, analysts say. But a report on employment in early April could offer some clarity.'"
"'10-03-27,'0','President Obama’s choice to lead the agency that guards United States airports abruptly withdrew his nomination on Friday night amid questions about his work as a defense contractor, the second time the White House has lost a nominee for the critical security post.Maj. Gen. Robert A. Harding, a retired Army intelligence officer, was selected to take over the Transportation Security Administration, or T.S.A., just two and a half weeks ago, following the withdrawal of Mr. Obama’s first pick under fire.No third choice was announced, and the back-to-back failed nominations mean that the job is likely to remain unfilled for months to come.General Harding’s bid came unraveled after reports that his firm collected more federal money than it was entitled to for providing interrogators in Iraq.In a statement, General Harding said, “I felt that I could bring some leadership, vision and intelligence expertise” to the post. “However, I feel that the distractions caused by my work as a defense contractor would not be good for this administration nor for the Department of Homeland Security.”The president’s first nominee, Erroll G. Southers, a former F.B.I. agent and counterterrorism supervisor for the Los Angeles airport police, withdrew his nomination in January after giving conflicting answers about conducting police background checks on a man his estranged wife was seeing.'"
"'10-03-27,'0','Arnold Forster, an American Jewish leader, lawyer and writer who was a longtime executive of the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith, died on March 7 in the Bronx. He was 97 and lived in New Rochelle, N.Y.His death, at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, was confirmed by his daughter, Janie Forster Berman.Associated with the Anti-Defamation League for nearly six decades, Mr. Forster was its general counsel from 1946 to 2003. In that capacity he helped document, publicize and combat myriad forms of anti-Semitism in the United States and overseas. He was widely quoted in the news media over the years on a range of Jewish issues, including Zionism, a cause he defended ardently and about which he wrote frequently.His books, many of which began life as league reports, include “The Trouble-Makers” (Doubleday, 1952), “ ‘Some of My Best Friends ...’ ” (Farrar, Straus & Cudahy, 1962) and “The New Anti-Semitism” (McGraw-Hill, 1974), all written with Benjamin R. Epstein.Mr. Forster was also the author of a memoir, “Square One” (D. I. Fine, 1988), which has a foreword by Elie Wiesel.Arnold Fastenberg was born in New York City on June 25, 1912. To earn money for his education — he received undergraduate and law degrees from St. John’s University, then in Brooklyn — he worked as a lifeguard and actor. While performing at the Provincetown Playhouse, he Anglicized his last name at the suggestion of a director.'"
"'10-03-27,'0','LOS ANGELES — It happened to the motion picture industry in the 1930s and the music trade in the 1960s. Talent agents, initially brushed off as nothing more than opportunistic middle men, succeeded in making themselves vital parts of the machinery, helping the fast-growing but messy businesses mature.Is it time — finally — for the same thing to happen with video games?Agents have been trying to plow this turf for over a decade, succeeding with helping industry giants like Electronic Arts navigate Hollywood. But a deep cultural divide between the slick, Armani-suit-wearing agent crowd and rumpled computer-code-writing gamers has proven difficult to bridge.Sure, it made sense for a few extremely elite game creators to sign on with the likes of Creative Artists Agency and United Talent Agency. But in a booming business, why would most big-shot developers — or even small-shot ones — need help finding jobs, and why would publishers, burning through talent, want a bunch of agents around to slow them down?Fewer people are asking these questions now, with upstart video game agencies like Digital Development Management growing rapidly. Indeed, with the $46 billion worldwide video game market in upheaval — budgets are soaring for console titles even as free online games sharply cannibalize sales — agents are suddenly awfully useful: finding the right talent to complete increasingly complex titles, structuring deals across media, bringing in third-party financiers. And more agents than ever are looking to make a name for themselves in video games and new media, a consequence of layoffs after the merger last year of the William Morris and Endeavor agencies.“Agents, after trying for a long time, have become crucial to this particular entertainment genre,” said Elizabeth M. Daley, the dean of the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts, whose video game design program was recently named No. 1 in the United States by Princeton Review.“As the budgets get bigger and the moving pieces get more complicated, you’re a fool to try and handle deals by yourself,” she said.'"
"'10-03-27,'0','Ninth-seeded Northern Iowa, 10th-seeded St. Mary’s and 12th-seeded Cornell have all fit comfortably in the role of plucky underdog. Butler, which wore its home whites in its first two games, is more like Gonzaga or Xavier, teams defined as midmajors only because of the conference they play in.Gonzaga, which has been to the N.C.A.A. tournament 12 consecutive seasons, regularly plays the nation’s elite teams. Xavier, one of two teams to reach the Round of 16 the last three years, travels like one — in a private jet.“What it boils down to is revenue,” Stevens said of the midmajor label. “The bottom line is it’s about revenue, which has no impact on a five-on-five game. That’s how we look at it.”As Butler has reached a regional final for the first time, the Bulldogs may find themselves being introduced to new audiences, who are curious to learn about them. Some people might want to know where they fit in the Indianapolis sports landscape.“I think we rank below the Indianapolis Colts, first off,” Mack said with a grin.The Bulldogs have a loose, goofy quality that comes from knowing one another not just for a season, but for a college career.The prime targets of their barbs are Howard’s wispy mustache, which has its own Facebook page, and the rap career of Gordon Hayward, who is quite likely to make much more money in the N.B.A. than he will cutting hip-hop tracks. A rap he filmed wound up on YouTube, until it was pulled recently to save him more grief.“Gordon has inspired some other people at Butler to start rapping,” said guard Ronald Nored, who was unable to contain his sarcasm. “You might see some people coming out with albums from Butler University, so look for that soon.”The Bulldogs’ success is due to players understanding and accepting their roles, yet their run in the tournament has been marked by players who have stepped beyond them.Hayward, the sophomore forward whose skill may make him a first-round draft pick, is not known for doing dirty work. But in the waning seconds against Murray State, he deflected a pass and then dived to knock the ball into the backcourt as time expired to preserve the Bulldogs’ 52-50 victory.Nored, a 17 percent 3-point shooter, confidently made a 3-pointer against Syracuse to fuel the Bulldogs’ late comeback victory Thursday.“What it shows is everybody doing whatever it takes to win,” Nored said. “Everybody wants to get to the Final Four, everybody want to get to the championship game.”'"

"'10-03-27,'0','Ms. Palin was her usual bouncy and folksy self, speaking rapidly and cracking jokes. Mr. McCain stood behind her, smiling gamely.“She energized America, and she still does today,” Mr. McCain said. “I’m proud of Sarah Palin, and I know you are, too.”Ms. Palin, who has campaigned for conservative candidates across the country, has drawn a bit of backlash here for stepping into Mr. McCain’s race with J. D. Hayworth, a former Republican congressman from Arizona, who refers to himself as the “consistent conservative.” She said Friday that she wanted to “clear the air” about the criticism and that Mr. McCain is as much a candidate of the Tea Party as anyone.“Let’s not beat around the bush,” Ms. Palin said. “Everybody here supporting John McCain, we are all part of that Tea Party movement.”Ms. Palin, Alaska’s former governor, is the latest in a parade of prominent Republicans coming to Mr. McCain’s aid in Arizona. In recent weeks, he has stood side by side with Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts and Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential rival. And Jeb Bush has endorsed his candidacy from afar.But it is an open question what effect the endorsements will have in a state where Mr. McCain is well known and suspicion is running far deeper than during his previous races for re-election. Mr. Hayworth, who has drawn the support of several Tea Party followers and other conservative activists, welcomed Ms. Palin to Arizona but doubted that her seal of approval for Mr. McCain would mean much to voters.“What we’re seeing from the governor is a very understandable example of gratitude,” Mr. Hayworth said. “After all, it was John who really gave her an entree to the national stage.”Throughout their presidential campaign, Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin often drew differing strains of Republican voters to their rallies. When the two merged on Friday, the differences were even more pronounced. In six interviews with people in the crowd, five said that they had come to see Ms. Palin and were uncertain about Mr. McCain.“I love Sarah! I wish she was the president now,” said Shirley Daniel, 65, a Tucson nurse. “I’m not as much of a supporter of John. He’s a good man, but I think his time has come. I think Hayworth would be a better candidate for the Senate.”In her 15-minute speech, Ms. Palin did not mention Mr. Hayworth by name or dwell on the fact that Mr. McCain needed to win a Republican primary before facing voters in the fall. But she delivered a full-throated endorsement that ended with a plea, “Would you send a maverick back to the United States Senate?”Ms. Palin urged Republicans to rise up against the new health care law. Days after she instructed her supporters, “Don’t retreat, just reload,” she said that she was not advocating violence and warned Republicans not to be diverted by the criticism from Democrats. “We know violence isn’t the answer,” she said. “When we take up our arms, we’re talking about our votes.”Mr. McCain used the rally as an opportunity to amplify his opposition to the new health care law and emphasize his conservative credentials. He pledged to lead a fight in the months ahead, saying, “It’s going to be repealed, and it’s going to be done soon.”He spoke for slightly less time than Ms. Palin. And there was no escaping the fact that the fortunes of the two political figures had reversed. The McCain and Palin families were about 30 minutes behind schedule, and as Mrs. McCain opened the rally, it was clear whom the crowd wanted to hear from.“You have come today, I know, most of all to see my husband,” Mrs. McCain said to mild applause. “But I know you’ve also come to see Sarah as well,” Mrs. McCain said, and the crowd roared. As the applause continued, she added, “Hasn’t she been a breath of fresh air for our party and for our country?”Before heading to Phoenix for an evening fund-raising event at the Biltmore, the hotel where Mr. McCain conceded the election, as his running mate looked on after being blocked from delivering her own concession speech, Ms. Palin sought to keep the spotlight on the Arizona senator.“It was John McCain who warned us about this administration’s plan for growing government and digging us deeper into debt and spreading the wealth around,” Ms. Palin said, adding, “When all the votes are tallied, I think he’s going to win this one.”'"

"'10-03-27,'0','On Friday, the prime minister’s spokesman, James Maridadi, tried to play down the significance of the remarks. “Tsvangirai was speaking off the cuff in a very lighthearted way,” he said.Mr. Maridadi continued: “He wasn’t getting into the rights of gays. Whatever he said, it was a personal opinion, and he always invites people to agree or disagree with his personal opinions.”Homosexuality is illegal in Zimbabwe, but gay rights organizations have been allowed to operate openly. In nearby Malawi, such groups can work only clandestinely. Two gay men there could face 14 years in prison after they were arrested for holding an engagement party in December.Homophobia is the norm throughout Africa. In Uganda, a lawmaker has proposed harsh penalties for homosexuality, including the death penalty in some circumstances. In Kenya last month, the police broke up a gay wedding and arrested many of the guests; the police intervened, they said, to keep an irate mob from killing the participants.Zimbabwe is writing a new constitution that is meant to pave the way for new elections. In 2008, Mr. Tsvangirai bested Mr. Mugabe, the long-time president, in the first round of elections but then dropped out of a discredited runoff after state-sanctioned thugs terrorized his supporters.In early 2009, after months of violence, difficult negotiations and reluctant compromise, a power-sharing deal was consummated between the two nemeses. Mr. Mugabe kept control of the nation’s security forces, but he gave some ground to Mr. Tsvangirai, swearing him in as prime minister and divvying up the government ministries.Gay rights has not been a matter of friction between the two adversaries. In fact, Mr. Tsvangirai’s party, the Movement for Democratic Change, has “no position on gay rights per se,” said its spokesman, Nelson Chamisa. “We are for human rights, but Zimbabweans are very conservative, and something like gay marriage is condemned, not just by our culture but by religion.”He added, “We believe people should have the latitude to decide whatever is best for them. But — and I underline the word ‘but’ — the position of people in this country is that the word ‘gay’ should not appear in the constitution.”'"
"'10-03-27,'0','“Art cannot be science,” he goes on, “but it can convey the sense of wonder that drives scientists. It can visualize the worlds of science while honoring our sense of self as beings that transcend the mundane” — and thereby, he suggests, help us remember who and where we are.The show’s six screens are arranged in triptychs at either end of a long, dark room. At one end, a series of mandalalike “sacred shapes” made up of circles, triangles, squares — forms that have recurred in mythological and artistic representations of the cosmos — bounce out of the walls, evolving and morphing into cylinders, Slinkys, and other configurations. There is a red dot front and center, representing, Dr. Hossaini explained, the omnipresent center from which perception and creation proceed.The other end of the room is heavy on astronomical, geological and biological content, with a multilayered history of the universe, from the big bang to the Moon landings, flashing across the screens. The images flip in and out of visibility so fast that they almost register subliminally: comets, volcanic flows, galaxies and chemical symbols, among others, from a reservoir of 30,000 images pulled from the Internet. These images are constantly being reshuffled, as the artists, who met each other only last December, learn how to drive their show.The quality of the 3-D is not likely to make you forget “Avatar,” and Dr. Hossaini isn’t really interested in teaching you the mechanics of the expansion of the universe or the divergence of the species; this is not a planetarium or museum show. There is the sensation at one point of flying through a star field, but we recognize no constellation, nor do we arrive at any star.At other moments moons, comets and volcanoes burst forth, but unconnected to familiar surroundings, they seem alien. Human faces appear, but we don’t know who they are. The show’s collaborators appear to have decided to bypass the rational part of the brain and head straight for someplace deeper, to make us experience the universe not as a concatenation of forces but as a poem.Viewers can roam around or just sit on a mattress on the floor and let their eyes do the wandering. The result is trippy. I felt as if I were watching two shows, one — the sacred images in front — cold and abstract, but hypnotic; the other warmer and full of meaning, if somewhat predictable. Still, the two inform and at times reinforce each other. Near the end of the “history,” for example, the logos of companies like Wal-Mart and Delta Air Lines predominate in the background. These corporations are the evolved building blocks of modern culture, economics and politics (having even been granted personhood by the Supreme Court). Their logos have become the sacred shapes of our own time, just as the geometric shapes at the other end of the room were said by sages to be the soul of nature, building blocks of the world. I felt a click of my psyche reconnecting, the snake chomping down on its sacred tail.An hour spent on the floor interviewing Dr. Hossaini and his colleagues (who all spend time at the show every day and “very much want to discuss the work” with visitors, he told me later) left me feeling transported back to 1969, when animated discussions of issues of cosmic import could go on all night on similarly unadorned floors, under the influence of slightly different stimulation.Dr. Hossaini said that he (and the show) was partial to panspermia, the idea that life originated somewhere else — Mars, giant clouds in the Milky Way — and migrated to Earth, floating through space. That is a science-fiction-sounding idea that, as of yet, no astronomer can knock down.Likewise, the presence of comets in the show testifies to the theory, held by many astronomers, that the Earth got its water from being bombarded by comets, which are just “dirty snowballs” in the lexicon, early in cosmic history.Dr. Hossaini said he liked the idea that water was brought to Earth from space. I replied that in fact everything on Earth came from space. He laughed.“We’re stardust,” somebody in the dark said.'"
"'10-03-27,'0','The five-justice majority in Citizens United ruled that corporations and labor unions may spend their own money to support or oppose political candidates through independent communications like television advertisements. The decision did not disturb prohibitions on corporate contributions to candidates, and it did not address whether the government could regulate contributions to groups that make independent expenditures.The case concerning 527s, named after a section of the tax code, was brought by SpeechNow.org, which said it wanted to raise money to produce advertising to back candidates who supported the First Amendment. The group sued the Federal Election Commission, saying that limits on annual contributions from individuals were unconstitutional.Writing for a unanimous nine-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Chief Judge David B. Sentelle said the Supreme Court had identified only one government interest sufficient to overcome the First Amendment protections afforded to contributions for political speech: preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption.Chief Judge Sentelle said that Citizens United had foreclosed that rationale where the spending is not coordinated with a candidate.Indeed, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority in Citizens United, said that “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.”The election commission had argued in the SpeechNow.org case that large contributions to groups that made independent expenditures could “lead to preferential access for donors and undue influence over officeholders.”Chief Judge Sentelle said those arguments “plainly have no merit after Citizens United.”Since the expenditures themselves do not corrupt, Chief Judge Sentelle reasoned, neither do contributions to groups that make the expenditures.A special three-judge panel of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia used much the same reasoning to come to a different conclusion in a separate decision on Friday, this one concerning contributions to political parties. The case was brought by national, state and local Republican groups.The decision was written by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, who ordinarily sits on the appeals court and was a member of the nine-judge panel in the first case.The question was whether the so-called soft-money ban in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 is constitutional. The law, often called McCain-Feingold, limits individual contributions to political parties even if the money is to be spent on activities unrelated to federal elections.The Supreme Court upheld the soft-money ban in a 2003 decision, McConnell v. F.E.C. It said there was “no meaningful distinction between the national party committees and the public officials who control them” and so “large soft-money contributions to national parties are likely to create actual or apparent indebtedness on the part of federal officeholders.”That reasoning, left intact by Citizens United, was enough to dispose of the case, Judge Kavanaugh wrote. The challengers’ position, he said, “carries considerable logic and force” but boils down to “asking us to overrule McConnell’s holding with respect to the ban on soft-money contributions to national political parties.”“As a lower court,” he continued, “we of course have no authority to do so.”Judge Kavanaugh noted that recent developments had left political parties in a comparatively weakened position.“Under current law,” he wrote, “outside groups — unlike candidates and political parties — may receive unlimited donations both to advocate in favor of federal candidates and to sponsor issue ads. We recognize” the Republican National Committee’s “concern about this disparity, which, it argues, discriminates against the national political parties in political and legislative debates. But that is an argument for the Supreme Court or Congress.”'"
"'10-03-27,'0','DETROIT — Chrysler, which eliminated a quarter of its United States dealerships in the company’s bankruptcy last year, said on Friday it would let as many as 86 of those dealers reopen.Chrysler said it was notifying 50 dealers this week that they could apply for reinstatement, almost nine months after they were forced to abruptly close. The carmaker said 36 of its 789 rejected dealers had previously been given an offer of reinstatement.The notifications come as nearly 400 of the former dealers prepared to fight Chrysler’s decisions through an arbitration process created by Congress.They were the first sign that Chrysler might be easing its steadfast defense of the cuts. Until now, the company had argued that the closures were necessary given its diminished market share and warned that reinstating dealers could jeopardize its recovery.“The 50 dealers are in locations that offer customer-service benefits and will have limited adverse impact on the dealers within our current network,” Chrysler said in a statement. “Discussions to find mutually beneficial alternatives to arbitration with other dealers are under way.”'"
"'10-03-27,'0','BEIJING — A prominent Chinese scholar and film critic who was scheduled to speak at an academic conference in the United States this week said Friday that she had been barred from leaving China as punishment for her commentary on human rights and free speech.The scholar, Cui Weiping, 54, a poet and professor at the Beijing Film Academy, said that she had planned to lecture at Harvard and attend a conference sponsored by the Association for Asian Studies in Philadelphia, but that the director of her school called this week to say she had been forbidden to travel.“I was told I had classes to teach and that the lecture I was giving was not my specialty, but those were just excuses,” said Ms. Cui, who was to have left on Wednesday. “The real reason is that they want to put pressure on me, and they want to punish me.”Communicating through her superiors at the film academy, she said “they” — an unseen entity she described as “the authorities” — had repeatedly rebuked her for perceived sins: posting social criticism on her blog; sponsoring a seminar on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests; and sending out Twitter messages about the jailing of Liu Xiaobo, a writer who was convicted of subversion last year for demanding increased liberties.“These things made them unhappy,” she said, “and now they are going to make me unhappy.”Chinese officials have long used travel restrictions to punish those who have strayed across the murky line of public nonconformity. This month, Liao Yiwu, a writer and a tireless critic of the governing Communist Party, was removed from a plane as he was on his way to a literary festival in Germany.Other scholars and writers, including Tsering Woeser, a Tibetan essayist, have repeatedly been denied passports.Ms. Cui said she had been punished before for her writings. Academic officials canceled five guest lectures she was scheduled to give over the past year at schools around China. Last year, during the 20th anniversary of the crackdown in Tiananmen Square, two carloads of police officers spent several days parked outside her Beijing apartment, she said.“Until now, I didn’t want to talk about these incidents,” she said, “but now that they are limiting my academic freedom, I have to speak out.”'"
"'10-03-27,'0','TOKYO — Toyota Motor said on Friday that it would idle three plants in France and Britain for a total of 14 days to reduce inventory amid recent recalls and a slump in European sales.The company, which was the world’s biggest automaker by sales last year, will suspend output for four days in early April at its factory in Valenciennes, France, and for five days in May at its Burnaston and Deeside factories in Britain, according to a Toyota spokeswoman, Ririko Takeuchi.Toyota also plans to halt one of the two assembly lines at Burnaston for five days in early June, Ms. Takeuchi said.Toyota has recalled 8.5 million vehicles worldwide over gas pedals that could stick or get caught under floor mats. Toyota has also recalled the latest model of its flagship Prius gas-electric hybrid car, as well as several other hybrid models, because of braking problems.The automaker is halting production in France because of a slowdown in sales after the recalls, Ms. Takeuchi said. Plans for the closures in Britain predated the recalls, as sales have been lackluster in Europe in the aftermath of the global economic crisis.'"

"'10-03-28,'0','Caterpillar Inc. of Peoria has jumped to the forefront of manufacturing companies complaining about the cost of the federal health care overhaul. On March 18 the company sent a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative John A. Boehner, the Republican leader, saying mandated changes would cost it “$100 million in the first year alone.”Caterpillar’s complaint led to dozens of headlines, but a closer look at the impact of the new law indicates it is not quite the budget buster that the company’s human resources executive, Gregory Folley, implied in his missive.According to a regulatory filing by the company last week, the $100 million figure is Caterpillar’s estimated total cost for as long as the newly enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act remains in effect. And the $100 million charge is an accounting change, a noncash cost that has no affect on the company’s operations.In addition, the $100 million figure does not arise from changes to decades-long practices at Caterpillar. Rather, it comes about because the new law removes a tax break codified in 2003.No company sneezes at the elimination of a $100 million tax break. But in 2008, Caterpillar had $51 billion in sales, and profits topped $3.5 billion for the third straight year. The projected profits for 2010 are a relatively weak $1.56 billion, and the $100 million tax charge would mean an additional 6 percent reduction.Most companies steer away from politics, but Jim Owens, left, the company’s soon-to-retire chief executive, has held forth on climate change and other controversial issues. Most notably, in February 2009, Mr. Owens contradicted President Obama’s claim that the stimulus package would help Caterpillar rehire some of its 22,000 laid-off workers. He did so on the day Mr. Obama visited Caterpillar’s Peoria factory.'"
"'10-03-28,'0','“The crane had authorization to move mechanical equipment on to the top of 80 Maiden Lane,” Robert LiMandri, the buildings commissioner, said at a news conference. About 7:30, he said, “the boom drifted.”“There’s minor damage to the parapet wall of the topmost facade of the building,” he said.David Robertson, who lives nearby at 10 Liberty Street, said he was alerted to the crane’s fall by a noise that sounded like metal on metal. “You could’ve heard it half a mile away,” he said.Mr. LiMandri said it was too early to tell if there was any negligence or wrongdoing. “We are certainly going to pull this crane out of service and we’re gong to do a full investigation,” he said.Dave Lawrence, 26, who lives at 2 Gold Street, said he and his companion watched the crane being installed. “As it went up it was tilting, skewed,” he said. “As the crane got higher it was bad. We figured, they’re engineers, they must have it figured out.”The couple left for the day, then returned to hear sirens. “We said, ‘I bet that’s that crane,’ ” Mr. Lawrence said.The crane, which is owned by Bay Crane, looked precarious as it leaned on the corner of the building. Curious neighbors came out to watch — one woman even brought a bowl of pretzels.Susan Stevens, who lives at 100 John Street, said she was listening to the radio when she heard sirens. “I’d be nervous now if there was a crane near my building,” she said.Mohammed Bacchus, a security guard at 80 Maiden Lane, said he saw the crane begin to lean, then gradually fall toward the building. “It took about half an hour,” he said. “Then it just gently grazed the building.”While the latest episode appeared to have caused minimal damage, it jarred a city that experienced two fatal crane collapses over a two-month period, the first of which occurred almost exactly two years ago. In mid-March 2008, seven people were killed when a crane slammed into residential buildings on East 51st Street, destroying a town house. And two construction workers were killed in May 2008, when a crane fell at a construction site on East 91st Street.On March 8, James F. Lomma, the owner of the New York Crane and Equipment Corporation, pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges stemming from the latter collapse.Mr. LiMandri said the crane that fell Saturday was a mobile one used for relatively small jobs, and it had been used during the day, lifting mechanical equipment and building supplies.As for the effort to remove the crane, he said, “We’re going to work all night.”'"
"'10-03-28,'0','Frank Rich is right when he describes financial reform as providing a “great opportunity” for the president and the Democrats. The current situation in which Republicans are successfully claiming to be the party of the anti-establishment represents not only a ludicrous distortion of reality but also a political disaster for Democrats.The most effective way for the Democrats to unmask this Republican charade is to press ahead with strong financial reform legislation.Almost by definition any really effective comprehensive reform will have to be primarily a partisan measure, and that simple fact should be embraced by Democrats.First of all, anti-regulatory, free-market fundamentalism is a core tenet of Republican ideology. Second, while the Democrats are certainly happy to accept contributions from the financial industry, Republicans are far more dependent on this source and thus likely to favor the interests of their benefactors.Force Republicans to vote against reform that targets Wall Street bailout banks and pushes consumer protection, and perceptions that they are in the corner of ordinary people will start changing dramatically.'"
"'10-03-28,'0','The first major appeals-court nomination fight of the Obama presidency may be shaping up over Goodwin Liu, a highly qualified teacher and legal scholar. Mr. Liu, nominated to the San Francisco-based United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is raising hackles on the right because of some of his legal views, and because he is seen as a strong candidate for the Supreme Court in the near future. The White House and Senate Democrats should fight hard for the confirmation.Mr. Liu was born in Augusta, Ga., where his parents, doctors from Taiwan, moved to practice medicine in an underserved area. He graduated from Stanford, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, and then graduated from Yale Law School. After clerking for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, he became a highly regarded law professor at the University of California-Berkeley.Mr. Liu, who is 39, has written extensively on the Constitution and education law, among other areas. His views are not uniformly liberal — he has written in support of school vouchers and charter schools, market-oriented policies that many liberals and labor unions strongly oppose. But Mr. Liu’s conservative critics are taking aim at his support for affirmative action, gay marriage rights, and national health care, and his endorsement of the view that the Constitution is a document that evolves over time.His views fall within the mainstream of legal scholarship and American politics. Kenneth Starr, the conservative lawyer who investigated President Bill Clinton, and is now the dean of Pepperdine University School of Law, co-signed a letter endorsing Mr. Liu, vouching for his “independence and openness to diverse viewpoints.”Perhaps the biggest factor fueling the opposition to Mr. Liu is that he was openly critical of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito at the time of their nominations. Mr. Liu’s warnings that the two men would be extremely conservative justices have turned out to be completely on target. Republicans are also worried that Mr. Liu, by virtue of his youth, stellar credentials and ethnic background, could be on Mr. Obama’s short list for a future Supreme Court vacancy.Mr. Obama’s judicial nominees have so far been overwhelmingly centrists. A nominee like Mr. Liu stands out as an obvious target.'"
"'10-03-28,'0','Your March 21 editorial discussing credit rating firms (“Moody’s and the Debt Threat”) refers to a 2008 Securities and Exchange Commission report without noting that the same report also stated that there was no evidence that decisions about ratings methodologies or models were based on attracting or losing market share.While there are potential (and manageable) conflicts in any model, the market greatly benefits from the issuer-pays model as it allows us to distribute our ratings to all investors free of charge. That’s not the case in a subscriber model that creates information “haves” and “have-nots” in the marketplace.In addition, we have regularly published our rationale for maintaining the United States’ current triple-A rating (for example, resilient economy, status of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency), but have also cited its huge spending increases and deficits as reasons for concern in the long term.Should our opinion ever be that the United States (or any debt issuer) should have its rating adjusted, we will do so without consideration of the impact of that rating change on other entities. To do otherwise would compromise our independence and objectivity.Finally, in contrast to your implication that we won’t downgrade our bank issuers, since January 2008 Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services has downgraded the ratings of more than 350 banks and other financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank.'"

"'10-03-28,'0','CHICAGO — In the end, the winner of the Illinois Democratic Party’s open audition to be the nominee for lieutenant governor was not one of the some 200 unknowns who had stepped forward, among them a brick salesman, a police officer and a violinist. Instead, party leaders on Saturday chose a name familiar across the state: Sheila Simon, the daughter of former Senator Paul Simon.Ms. Simon, a 49-year-old lawyer and former City Council member in Carbondale, some 300 miles south of Chicago, will share the ticket led by Gov. Patrick J. Quinn, who was elevated from lieutenant governor last year after a corruption scandal engulfed his predecessor, Rod R. Blagojevich. Political experts said the choice seemed an effort to provide geographical balance for a ticket otherwise weighted toward Chicago, the state’s largest city, and some inoculation (if that is possible) against the memory of the corruption scandal.Ms. Simon, who had been endorsed by Mr. Quinn on Friday, won a vote of the state’s central committee, made up of 38 top Democratic leaders.Voters selected a Democratic nominee for the lieutenant governor in February: Scott L. Cohen, a pawnbroker and political unknown who had spent $2 million of his own money on his campaign. But, within days of the election Mr. Cohen resigned under pressure from party leaders after questions emerged over a domestic battery charge, unpaid child support and steroid use.Democratic leaders, who have battled a reputation for cronyism and back-room deals, announced that Mr. Cohen’s replacement would be picked in a manner that seemed to turn its old reputation on its head. All who wished to apply should do so. Résumés would be posted online. Interviews would be done in public.Among the applicants was an array of expected candidates — state lawmakers, mayors, county board members, convention delegates and former political candidates, including Ms. Simon.'"
"'10-03-28,'0','But that viewpoint, critics say, represents only those on the autism spectrum who at least have basic communication skills and are able to care of themselves.“Why people have gotten upset is, he doesn’t seem to represent, understand or have great sympathy for all the people who are truly, deeply affected in a way that he isn’t,” said Jonathan Shestack, a co-founder of the advocacy group Cure Autism Now, whose mission is to help finance research to find a cure.Mr. Obama’s seven other nominees to the council were confirmed this month. But parliamentary procedure in the Senate allows one or more members to prevent a motion from reaching the floor for a vote by placing an anonymous hold on the action, which an official with knowledge of the proceedings said had been done in Mr. Ne’eman’s case.The hallmark of autism is impaired social interaction, but the disorder can take an array of forms. Some people may hurt themselves or be unable to speak. Others may be hyperarticulate but unable to parse body language or facial cues. Some may have cognitive disabilities; others may have savant skills.Mr. Ne’eman declined to be interviewed, citing the pending action on his nomination. But in previous interviews with The New York Times and other publications, he has argued that those most severely affected by autism are the ones who benefit least from the pursuit of a cure, which he suggests is unattainable anytime soon. Instead, he says, resources should be devoted to accommodations and services that could improve their quality of life.Historically, the kind of genetic research supported by many parents of children with autism, Mr. Ne’eman has said, has been used to create prenatal tests that give parents the ability to detect a fetus affected by a particular condition, like Down syndrome, so that they can choose whether to terminate the pregnancy.“We just think it makes more sense to orient research to addressing health problems or helping people communicate rather than creating a mouse model of autism or finding a new gene,” Mr. Ne’eman has said.A senior majoring in political science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Mr. Ne’eman himself has a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, a form of high-functioning autism.Mr. Ne’eman, who grew up in East Brunswick, N.J., has said his condition caused him to be bullied in high school. His social anxiety was so great, he sometimes picked at his face until it bled. He was eventually transferred to a school for students with developmental disabilities.He founded his self-advocacy organization, which has grown to have several chapters across the country, in 2006, and he served on New Jersey’s Special Education Review Commission, where he wrote a report calling for legislative action to end the use of aversives, restraint and seclusion on students with disabilities.Mr. Ne’eman also became a critic of Autism Speaks, the largest advocacy group in the country, organizing protests last fall over a fund-raising video.But the split among autism advocates, suggests Lee Grossman, director of the Autism Society of America, may simply reflect the unmet needs of a growing population, for both research into potential treatments and for programs to support jobs and independent living.“We have this community out there frustrated and bewildered and reaching out for any assistance, and that makes us battle-hardened,” Mr. Grossman said. “We need to reframe the discussion. From our perspective, it’s great to have a person on the spectrum being nominated to this committee.”'"

Borman’s cross was chested out by a defender to Lindpere, a primarily left-footed player, and he sent a right-footed shot over the rookie Andrew Dykstra.“I hadn’t thought he had a right foot,” Red Bulls Coach Hans Backe said.“I don’t have,” he said. “It’s for walking.”The game also marked the M.L.S. debuts of both coaches: the former Notts County manager Backe for the Red Bulls and the former El Salvador coach Carlos de los Cobos for the Fire.The 24-year-old Dykstra was making his first start after the Fire surprisingly released Jon Busch, who had played every league game for the club in the previous two years. The Fire was playing its first official match since Cuauhtemoc Blanco left after three seasons to join the Mexican club Veracruz.RED BULLS SIGN AGUDELO The Red Bulls on Friday signed a second player, the striker Juan Agudelo, from their development academy.“He’s been impressive for a 17-year-old,” Coach Hans Backe said during the club’s annual media day on March 16. “He shows such power.

"'10-03-28,'0','Many of the arguments the financial industry is making in opposition to the plan echo the themes heard in the health care debate: more government involvement is the problem, not the solution; tightened regulation risks stifling competition; and the plan is fiscally irresponsible.But the common refrains mask the divisions among the legislation’s opponents, who tend to agree that the overhaul is dangerous but point to very different elements of the House and Senate plans.“I don’t think there’s a unified business community position yet, nor do I think there will be because there are so many different interests,” Steve Elmendorf, a lobbyist for Citigroup and other major firms, said in an interview.“There are obviously a lot of stakeholders here — Wall Street, big banks, hedge funds, insurers, mortgage brokers — who all care about what happens here,” he said.Indeed, the issue has attracted a dizzying array of lobbyists since last year, when the House began considering, and ultimately passed, a bill to impose a wide range of new restrictions. The debate has shifted to the Senate, where the banking committee approved a Democratic plan on a straight party-line vote.By the end of last year, lobbyists from some 400 businesses and groups, including bankers, beer makers, cruise ship operators and grocery stores, had registered with Congress to weigh in on the regulatory reform, according to data analyzed by the Center for Public Integrity, a research and advocacy group in Washington. That number is expected to climb when new lobbying reports are filed next month.In the last decade, the financial sector has spent more money than any other industry to influence Washington policy — more than $3.9 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Wall Street’s resistance to some of the plan’s core elements has already drawn condemnation from the Obama administration.One of the more public campaigns against the Democrats’ reforms does not come from Wall Street, however. It comes from an obscure, Republican-leaning group that is seeking to cast the plan as a boon to Wall Street.The group, the Committee for Truth in Politics, has spent an estimated $5 million on advertising against the proposals, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which monitors political advertising. The ads portray the financial reforms — misleadingly, the administration says — as a $4 trillion bailout for big banks.The group’s membership and financing have been kept secret, and it has refused to divulge its donors; it is suing the Federal Election Commission, claiming the rules for disclosure in political advertising are an unconstitutional impediment to free speech.James Bopp Jr., the lawyer and conservative advocate who represents the group in its lawsuit, said in an interview that the ads accurately reflected a section in the House bill that would allow the Federal Reserve to spend up to $4 trillion to stabilize the financial system in a liquidity crisis. He said characterizing the bill as anything other than a bailout “is a typical Washington lie where politicians do one thing in Washington, which is to advance the Obama socialist agenda, and lie about it when they go home because they don’t want anyone to know about it.”But Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who guided the bill through the House, calls the ad campaign “a complete mischaracterization” of the legislation, which he said would limit the Fed’s ability to support otherwise healthy banks during a liquidity crisis and prevent the type of bailouts that have gone to A.I.G. and other giant firms.The ads have run in about 10 states, including those of Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee.Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said his office had received “hundreds” of calls citing the “bailout” language in an ad by the Committee for Truth in Politics, after it started being broadcast in his state in February. “This is not a bailout,” he said of the Senate bill. “I don’t support bailouts.”The plan’s focus on tighter regulation of “too big to fail” institutions has also pitted bigger banks against smaller ones, with the smaller, community-based banks generally supportive of the proposed regulations and Wall Street opposed.Camden R. Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, an association that spent about $4.75 million last year on federal lobbying, said his organization was outmatched in finances and resources in the debate by Wall Street’s representatives in Washington.“Literally, when our guys are walking into a key senator’s office” to plead their case on the legislation, “they can see four or five Wall Street lobbyists walking out, and that can be a little intimidating.”The Chamber of Commerce, which spent a reported $123 million on lobbying last year, has already spent $3 million on ads criticizing the reform proposals, and it plans to spend at least that much more on future ads, David Hirschmann, senior vice president of the chamber, said in an interview. The group is reaching out to Democrats and Republicans, he said, on the Senate Banking Committee and elsewhere.The intensity of the rhetoric was on display at last week’s Chamber of Commerce meeting. The deputy Treasury secretary, Neal S. Wolin, was invited as the keynote lunch speaker and surprised some audience members by offering a bruising indictment of the chamber’s position on regulatory reform, calling the opposition “shortsighted and misguided.”“As the president has made clear, we will oppose efforts to weaken it,” Mr. Wolin said. “And my primary message to you today is this: so should you.”'"
"'10-03-28,'0','And some early research in behavioral economics suggests that financial incentives can be used to essentially kick-start healthy habits that then become self-sustaining, according to Gary B. Charness, an economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.That certainly seems to be how things worked out for Mona Ellender, 55, a database administrator who lives in Metairie, La. At the end of 2008, her employer, Ochsner Health System, which operates seven hospitals and 35 clinics in southeastern Louisiana, adopted a health incentive program designed and managed by Virgin HealthMiles, part of the Virgin Group.The Virgin formula focuses mainly on promoting physical activity, which can be measured using pedometers, accelerometers or heart-rate monitors. Online tools are important. Personal activity data is uploaded from the activity-tracking devices into an individual’s account on the Web. A general Web site includes health and dietary tips. Contests and online chat are part of the mix.Yet what first got her attention, Ms. Ellender concedes, was the money. Under the program, her premium payments for health insurance for her and her husband drop by more than $100 a month if she attains her activity goals.But soon, Ms. Ellender says, the main appeal became the improvements she was observing in her energy, appearance and weight. She says she walks a lot more than she used to, including 30 minutes during her lunch break and often after work. She attends an aerobics class most every day, she says. And she tracks her progress online daily. In 15 months, Ms. Ellender’s cholesterol level has fallen sharply. She has lost 40 pounds and intends to lose 14 more.“It’s made a big difference in my life,” she says.Her employer is pleased as well. After rising steadily for years, health insurance claims fell 5 percent last year for Ochsner, says Susan Piglia, director of corporate programs.It is the long-term trends — not a year or two — that matter most in health. But the health-incentive management companies do seem to be off to a good start. The employee participation rates in their programs — all are voluntary — are typically in the 50 to 80 percent range, far higher than for traditional wellness programs, which do not include financial incentives.Virgin HealthMiles, RedBrick Health and Tangerine Wellness use somewhat different approaches. Still, there are some common lessons from their few years of experience.In modifying health behavior, they say, rewards trump punishment. A person who does poorly in a program, for example, loses a chance to save money, but there are no penalty payments, only encouragement to convert to healthy habits. “The carrot definitely works better than the stick,” says Aaron Day, chief executive of Tangerine Wellness.Markets thrive on good information and good incentives. The market for personal health, it seems, lacks both. RedBrick Health was founded in 2006, with an eye toward having incentives focused on health instead of just cost savings.Kyle Rolfing, the chief executive, was previously a founder of Definity Health, a pioneer in developing consumer-driven spending plans like health reimbursement accounts and health spending accounts, known as H.R.A.’s and H.S.A.’s. (Definity was sold to UnitedHealth in 2004.) The rationale behind the high-deductible plans has been that if people spend more of their own money, they will be more price-conscious consumers of health care.The problem with H.R.A.’s and H.S.A.’s alone, Mr. Rolfing says, is that people do opt for less costly care but not better health. “The real goal is to get accountability about health and wellness at the individual level,” he says. “So the incentive — the return on investment — should be at the individual level as well.”PERSONAL health decisions also suffer from an information gap. The gratification for eating rich desserts is immediate, while the health consequences, if any, are well into the future. But online tracking and affordable digital devices, like pedometers, to collect timely data are beginning to close the information gap. At the least, users can constantly check measures of activity and calorie counts that are clearly linked to health.“We’re trying to create the good-driver discount for health,” explains Sean Forbes, president of Virgin HealthMiles. “One reason that’s been so difficult is there’s never been a way to really measure things before, but that is changing because of technology.”'"
"'10-03-28,'0','For instance, he has opposed efforts by state officials who try to crack down on abusive consumer-lending practices, arguing that national banks aren’t in their jurisdiction. At the same time, he rarely imposes serious penalties related to consumer protection, particularly against the big banks.“To have a regulator this partial and this helpful to the people he is supposed to regulate is, to say the least, very troubling,” says the attorney general, Tom Miller, who has tangled with the O.C.C. “It’s a pretty warped view of public responsibility.”Mr. Dugan casts himself as a zealous guardian of the safety and soundness of banks, a mission his agency sees as its first objective. As such, he has also taken positions that are at odds with the Obama administration and with other regulators, like opposing a proposal to limit banks’ ability to raise interest rates on existing credit card balances and opposing a special assessment on banks to shore up the fund that insures consumers’ deposits.He has managed to do so mostly behind the scenes, avoiding the fusillades that have been directed at other bank regulators like the chairman, . After all, who has heard of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ?“I call them as I see them,” says Mr. Dugan, who plans to step down when his term expires this summer. “I’ve done some unpopular things with the industry on things that they didn’t like. And I have done some unpopular things where people thought I was doing things that were too pro-bank.”Mr. Dugan has survived — even thrived — amid such criticism by retaining powerful allies, including the secretary, . Mr. Geithner has also been something of a piñata for critics, who contend that he, too, guards the welfare of banks at the expense of taxpayers and average consumers. The comptroller’s office is technically an arm of the Treasury Department, though Mr. Geithner has little day-to-day oversight.Mr. Geithner did not respond to multiple requests for comment.As Congress considers an overhaul of , including a new agency for consumer financial protection, the recent track record of regulators like Mr. Dugan and Mr. Geithner hangs over the debate.Last summer, proposed creating an independent consumer protection agency. But months of Congressional debate and furious lobbying by banks have undermined support for an independent agency. A main sticking point is determining what, if any, authority existing bank regulators should have over the agency if it is created.Some Republican senators — and Mr. Dugan — would like to protect the existing authority of the O.C.C. over national banks, arguing that a healthy banking system protects consumers.Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at , says that none of the current federal regulators, including the O.C.C., have been consumer guardians. By contrast, he said, attorneys general in New York and elsewhere have successfully rooted out consumer lending and investing abuses.“To me, the real bottom line is that 4 of the 16 largest national banks had to be bailed out or sold with federal TARP assistance in order to avoid failure,” says Professor Wilmarth.This track record, he says, proves that the “quiet” approach of the O.C.C. and the Office of Thrift Supervision “failed either to protect consumers or to ensure the safety and soundness of major banks.”MR. DUGAN bristles at the notion that he is too easy on banks and says his agency’s record on consumer protection has been “vigorous and sustained.” He says it is a “cheap shot” to suggest that his lobbying years color his viewpoint and that it demeans his employees and his years of public service.A 2005 appointee of President , Mr. Dugan came to the O.C.C. after working for 12 years as a lawyer and lobbyist representing the banking industry. Before that, he worked for the federal government, including stints as counsel for the Senate Banking Committee and as an assistant secretary in the Treasury Department.Though acknowledging some missteps at the O.C.C., he is quick to say that others deserve more blame, like nonbank lenders who dished out subprime and sleepy state regulators overseeing them.Although the comptroller’s office oversees two-thirds of the nation’s assets held by commercial banks, Mr. Dugan points out that national banks represent just percent of all assets from failed banks since the start of the financial crisis.Of course, that doesn’t account for national banks that avoided collapsing because of huge taxpayer bailouts — “too big to fail” banks like and . Mr. Dugan counters that most of the big banks repaid taxpayers with interest — unlike , and .“In the end,” he says, “the fact that they got the money but took steps to fix themselves, to raise , build loan-loss reserves to pay the government back quickly, will be viewed as a successful way to deal with a very difficult situation.”In addition, Mr. Dugan says, the O.C.C. has issued guidance to banks on risky mortgages, credit cards and gift cards. He says he would have done more to protect consumers if he had the authority to write regulations. For now, that is left to the Federal Reserve.“I’m not trying to say we are perfect,” he says, “but it’s a record that I think is good given the circumstances.”WHEN Darrell McGraw, the attorney general of , decided to sue in 2005, alleging credit card abuses, his office expected to face a phalanx of high-priced defense lawyers.What it didn’t expect was that Capital One would get a hand from the federal government.As Mr. McGraw tells it, his legal team was thwarted every step of the way by Capital One and the O.C.C.While Capital One didn’t comply with Mr. McGraw’s subpoenas, it did apply for a national charter with the O.C.C., which it obtained in March 2008. Soon afterward, Capital One notified Mr. McGraw that he no longer had authority over it.For more than a decade, the O.C.C. has beaten back state attorneys general who have tried to enforce state consumer laws against national banks, arguing that federal laws pre-empt those of the states: the O.C.C. has stopped from enforcing predatory lending laws, intervened in New York’s effort to investigate discriminatory lending and opposed a campaign by states to curb gift card fees.“It’s always disheartening when the federal government becomes the refuge for scoundrels,” Mr. McGraw says.Last year, the White House suggested giving states more authority to enforce consumer laws against national banks. Lobbyists counterattacked and Congress weakened the proposal.Mr. Dugan has made no secret of his opposition to increasing states’ authority. He argues that it could cripple national banking and be bad for consumers because it would create uneven standards and enforcement.West Virginia officials say they decided to pursue Capital One in part because of its state charter. Capital One says that it switched charters because it was evolving from a credit card company into a traditional bank and that the move had nothing to do with the West Virginia suit.A federal judge reluctantly granted Capital One’s request to stop the West Virginia case once the bank obtained a national charter.“While I find that federal law requires this result, I am sympathetic to the defendant, whose lawful investigation was hijacked by Capital One’s conversion to a national bank,” the judge, Joseph Goodwin, wrote. “It is questionable whether the O.C.C. will be as motivated or as effective in protecting the consumers of West Virginia.”The O.C.C. asked Mr. McGraw’s office for its investigative files. In February, the agency announced that Capital One would pay $775,000 in restitution, which West Virginia said addressed only one of seven issues it had raised.Mr. McGraw said the penalty “is not even a drop in the bucket.” The O.C.C. disputes the notion that it protected Capital One and says that its sanction was fair.CRITICS maintain that the O.C.C.’s campaign against the states weakened crucial consumer protections and ultimately exacerbated the impact of the financial crisis. In addition, they say that the O.C.C.’s own oversight efforts were so tepid that risky mortgages, credit card abuses and overdraft fees proliferated.“It’s not that they want to displace the states,” says Kathleen Keest, a lawyer for the Center for Responsible Lending. “It’s that they want to replace something with nothing.”While the debate over pre-emption dates back decades, critics say it culminated in 2004, when the O.C.C. issued sweeping rules blocking states’ ability to enforce consumer laws. The crackdown came just as the market for subprime loans was starting to explode.The O.C.C. and its critics disagree on the percentage of subprime and other risky mortgages originated by national banks: the O.C.C. says it was less than 15 percent of the total; others say more. But, critics say, the O.C.C. does not take into account the pivotal role that banks played in stoking the appetite for risky mortgages by securitizing the loans.In addition, national banks remain the largest provider of credit cards, and some were engaged in controversial practices like over-the-limit fees. The nation’s big banks also tend to charge the highest overdraft fees and tack on other dubious fees, critics say.Even so, the O.C.C. only sparingly takes robust action on consumer protection issues, particularly against the big banks. Mr. Dugan maintains that this is because the agency works closely with banks and tries to stop problems before they metastasize and require stronger measures.In the last decade, the O.C.C. has issued 124 formal enforcement orders related to consumer protection, according to an O.C.C. report in October. Of those, only 10 required banks to pay restitution, one called for a refund and nine required civil penalties.The nation’s biggest banks and credit card issuers were rarely penalized for consumer abuses. Providian Financial, Wachovia Bank and Capital One were among the bigger banks that were handed enforcement orders.Even the O.C.C.’s in-house watchdog — the Treasury Department’s inspector general — has criticized the agency. In a January report, the inspector cited multiple mistakes by O.C.C. examiners in the failure of Silverton Bank of . For instance, the O.C.C. had identified “significant weaknesses” in Silverton’s operations when it applied for a national bank charter in April 2007, but it approved the application anyway, the report said.The receiver appointed by the when the bank collapsed estimated that Silverton’s failure would cost taxpayers $1.26 billion.Three weeks after Silverton’s collapse, the F.D.I.C. urged its board to approve a special assessment on banks to help shore up its depleted fund. Mr. Dugan was the only board member to vote against the assessment, which eventually prevailed.Mr. Dugan said that he was concerned that added expenses would harm already-struggling banks and disproportionately affect big banks, most of which he oversees.Consumer advocates say they remain underwhelmed by Mr. Dugan’s efforts. “It’s hard to get help from an agency that thinks the banks are always right,” said Travis B. Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America.AT the customer assistance operation here in , employees tell callers to first try to resolve problems directly with their banks.On occasion, however, consumers are reimbursed as a result of O.C.C. intervention. Last year, the O.C.C. fielded 72,047 complaints — more than double the year before — and reimbursed $9.2 million.The woman who complained about her credit card limit was told to file a formal complaint, while the woman who disputed the fees was told that she was out of luck. The man who griped about overdraft fees got his money back.'"

Today Trader and its rivals are tiny operations, and they have modest followings. But they are harnessing all the crowd-sourcing features of the Internet circa 2010: YouTube, Twitter, and companies like GotoMeeting, a Web conferencing service.They are also harnessing a lot of market-related rage. The gruesome stock plunge of late 2008 and early 2009 was a searing, fool-me-twice moment for many people. The market again seemed hopelessly treacherous, a mug’s game. And if you had an account with the brokerage arm of any number of Wall Street stalwarts — like Lehman Brothers, Citigroup or Merrill Lynch — your losses were doubly galling. Your team helped put a sleeper hold on the economy, the near-collapse of which then ravaged your portfolio.Even many of those who took the safe route and years ago bought index funds have seen little upside. Look at the performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500, the most popular index out there. If you put $1,000 in it in 1999, you now have slightly less money in your account (about 0.3 percent less, actually).If the motto of the original day-trade boom was, “If the pros can do it, so can we,” the motto today is, “We can’t do much worse than the pros.”“There’s this idea out there that retail investors are dumb,” says Howard Lindzon, the co-founder of StockTwits, which curates a gusher of stock tips and financial news alerts tweeted by 20,000 regular contributors. “Well, it turns out that the institutional investors are pretty dumb. They nearly blew us all up with leverage.”Of course, anyone hoping to join the day-trade caravan had better wear a seat belt, as Mr. Lindloff’s experience on this Wednesday morning demonstrates. Before lunch, he will buy and sell about 44,000 shares, in 17 trades. He starts off poorly, losing about $500. But a timely bet on a company called Rackspace Hosting (“I don’t know what they do,” he says), as well as quick investments in Applied Materials, Eagle Bulk Shipping and a few others, have turned things around.“Up $210,” he says, removing his headset. Factoring in commissions, he’s made $60.IT is hard to say how many day traders are currently plying their craft, if that is the right word, in this country. Brokerage firms track the activity and demographics of their customers, but they have been reluctant to share that data. About the most we know is that the day traders skew male, and the number of trades per $100,000 in client dollars is a little less than half what it was back in 2000, according to the Charles Schwab brokerage firm.Even that figure seems high. As a job, “day trader” registers in roughly the same way as “disco ball manufacturer” or “Brooklyn farmer.” You know that someone has to be making disco balls and that maybe there are still a few plots of arable land in Brooklyn.Still, it can seem strange to see TV ads for an Atlanta company called Long Term Short Term, which offers two-day investment seminars, as well as DVDs, CDs and online tutoring, in cities across the country. Price: $3,995 a person. Part of the pitch taps into the simmering anger at professional investors.“People put their trust in stock brokerages that are now out of business, and have seen their 401(k) drop by 40 percent or more,” says Michael Hutchison, an executive vice president of Long Term Short Term, which does business as Better Trades. “Meanwhile, mutual fund companies are making $85 billion a year, and look at their performance. There are people who see all this and think, ‘Why don’t I educate myself?’”Mr. Hutchinson hastens to add that his company doesn’t encourage anyone to quit a job and trade full time. But more than a few attendees may be looking for a change in career. Many of the new day traders are people who recently lost jobs and can’t find work.“I get e-mails from people saying, ‘I worked for XYZ company for 20 years and I just got laid off,’” says Brian Shannon of Alphatrends, which, for $60 a month, offers proprietary online videos and a once-a-week live chat. “They’ve got a severance package or a nest egg that they want to invest themselves.”Mr. Gomez and Mr. Lindloff are among the few who started day trading in the late ’90s and never stopped. At a late breakfast, just after that $60 morning, the two are sitting at a sidewalk cafe. You expect them to be revved up and antsy. Instead, look like members of a mellow Southern California rock band that split up 15 years ago. The most agitated either gets while trading online is the occasional “goddangit,” Mr. Lindloff’s idea of an outburst.For years, Mr. Gomez was a manager at a self-storage facility, but he couldn’t resist trading commodities during office hours, and he had a hard time keeping his mind on his work. Mr. Lindloff worked at an Isuzu dealership for years, then made cold calls — knocking on doors — for Edward Jones, the brokerage firm. He left after three months.“I knew I wanted to trade,” he says.How good are they? Mr. Lindloff, who Mr. Gomez says is the more skilled of the two, says he has averaged somewhere between $100,000 and $120,000 a year for the last 10 years, even during the worst part of the Great Recession. With low expenses, he lives comfortably, though hardly extravagantly.“I basically have $80,000 to $100,000 in my trading account every day,” he says, “and take my earnings out of that account to live.”It is, to be sure, an odds-defying performance. The great mass of studies point to the same conclusion: trading is hazardous to your wealth, as an academic paper memorably put it. The losers far outnumber the winners.Exactly how far is clear from one of the most comprehensive looks at the subject in a yet-to-be-published study conducted in Taiwan. (The country is ideal for this kind of research because all trades go through one place, the Taiwan Stock Exchange, which is willing to share the information.) The authors sifted through tens of millions of trades, from 1992 to 2006, and found that 80 percent of active traders lost money.“More importantly, we found that if you were to look at the past performance of these traders, only 1 percent of them could be called predictably profitable,” says a co-author, Brad M. Barber, a finance professor at the University of California, Davis. Everyone else, it seems, was on a short-term winning streak. Even those who did modestly well found their that profits were wiped out, and then some, by transaction fees like commissions and taxes.“It’s not impossible to make money actively trading,” Mr. Barber continues. “There are slivers of people out there who are quite good. And everyone thinks they will be in that group of 1 percent.”So why do people persist in this line of work?“The technical term is thrill-seeking,” says Hersh Shefrin, a professor of behavioral finance at Santa Clara University in California and author of “Beyond Greed and Fear,” an exploration of investors’ mindscapes. “There’s an adrenaline rush. And the thing about day trading is that it gives you pretty quick feedback. If you buy and hold, a lot of things need to happen before you see a result, and much of what happens relates to external factors that are beyond your control. With day trading, you’re in charge.”Also, he says, “people enjoy trading.”IF Mr. Lindloff is earning steady six-figure returns, he is squarely in the rarefied 1 percent of winners. But for $199 a month you sort of expect a man with a mansion, a hot tub and hyperbolic claims of double-digit returns. Why do a few dozen subscribers pay to watch these quite appealing but hardly world-beating guys at work?“Eighty percent of it is camaraderie,” says Mr. Lindzon at StockTwits. “Look, my wife watches cooking shows and I tell her, ‘That’s not going to make you a better cook.’ With these guys, you get a community, you get to hang out with people who love stocks, and if you get a couple great ideas in a month, even better.”Services like Twitter are naturals for traders, and not just because they offer a geyser of pointers, whispers and news flashes. They also give a far-flung group of people a simulacrum of fellowship, which is something that day traders need almost as much as good ideas.Asked about the Today Trader method of buying and selling, both men seem momentarily stumped, as if they never saw the question coming. Then they talk about the search for “set-ups,” which seems to translate roughly as “golden opportunities,” but they struggle to put a finger on what set-ups are, or how to spot them.It has something to do with tracking trading volumes of stocks and buying heavily traded stocks as they rise in price. But how to know a stock will keep rising? Intuition, they say. It tells them whether they’ve arrived at the party too late (in which case they won’t buy), at the right time (in which case they buy), or just before it ends (time to sell).“A common phrase in this business,” says Mr. Lindloff, “is ‘the trend is your friend.’”The more you listen, the more you realize that for all the high-tech gadgetry behind Today Trader, at its core is a Newtonian principle formulated more than 300 years ago: a body in motion tends to stay in motion.The problem is that stocks aren’t bodies and their motion is subject to forces Newton could never have fathomed. Some of those forces are hard for the Today Trader duo to fathom, too. Mr. Gomez says that day trading has become far trickier in recent years because of the rise of robo trading — the use of computers to automatically buy and sell huge numbers of shares in superfast bursts, based on algorithms.Big, muscular Wall Street veterans like Goldman Sachs have the money, smarts and brute power to dominate this computerized battle, and many day traders may not even be aware how outgunned they now are.“It’s not something we fully understand, but algorithms don’t have emotions,” says Mr. Gomez. “It’s like these machines can smell a human. They can smell the fear of a discretionary trader. Stocks will still go from Point A to Point B. But what used to be a waltz is now more like mosh pit.”Daily hand-to-hand combat with a bunch of robots? It seems kind of crazy. But is it any crazier than leaving your money in the same place where it languished for the last decade?This is a not a simple question. Fortunately, one man is ideally suited to answer it.This is ironic, as has been noted by reporters who have come calling of late, because the company has spent five years and a fortune on an ad campaign whose kicker is “Talk to Chuck.” But in 2008, Mr. Schwab vacated the C.E.O. job — he is now chairman — and the company would like to wean the public off the idea that Charles Schwab is the public face of Charles Schwab.No small feat, given the name of the company and given the ubiquity of that face in many years of advertising. Mr. Schwab once said he took his grandchildren out trick-or-treating on Halloween and some people thought he was wearing a Charles Schwab mask.Though he wore a jacket and tie in his TV spots, he seemed to have the heart and soul of a revolutionary. The idea behind the company was to cut commission rates so low — they started off at $70 a trade in 1975, which was then a steal — that the average investor could trade without paying exorbitant fees to Wall Street. If day trading had a patron saint, it was this man.The current C.E.O. is Walt Bettinger, 49, who is sitting one morning in his San Francisco office, which is next to Mr. Schwab’s and has a killer view of the Bay Bridge. He knows the subject is day trading, and you can tell he finds this topic slightly annoying, the way a movie star would find it annoying if you asked about a film he made 20 years ago.“I think the day-trade concept is a paragraph in the story of Charles Schwab,” he says. “But it’s not the book.”The book, he says, is Schwab’s evolution from a company that was just focused on what he calls “self-directed investors” to a company that also offers advice to those who seek it and full-on portfolio management for those who prefer to leave their investment decisions in someone else’s hands.As a strategy, this makes sense because it turns out that traders are fickle customers. Even during the banner years, Mr. Bettinger said, the company had to constantly replenish its base of very active traders.The push to advise clients and to manage portfolios started gaining traction in 2005, and the company says that last year, customers moved $21 billion into assorted fee-based advice offerings — which suggests that the era of professional hand-holding in the wealth-management world is hardly over.Schwab now offers every item at the steam table of financial offerings, and Mr. Bettinger will not say he prefers one investment strategy to any other. He is, in fact, completely agnostic on the question and surpassingly unhelpful at opining about day trading. If that works for you, do it, he’ll say. Unless you’d like someone to manage your money — in which case, do that.It is a politic, even-handed answer that proves just how over the whole trading phenomenon the company is. Schwab today is a bit like that part-time insurrectionist you knew in college who denounced “the man” and later became a management consultant. You can understand the evolution and appreciate the maturity, but you can still think fondly of the days when he stood outside the dining hall pushing copies of The Workers Vanguard.About the most Mr. Bettinger will say about day trading is that it’s a “tough gig.” “You’re competing against mega-institutions that are trading in hundredths of a second.”HE’S right, and the Today Trader team keeps clashing with those mega-institutions. At one point, Mr. Lindloff buys shares in Patterson-UTI Energy, because he thinks it looks ripe for an uptick. Instead, it dives a few cents, and because Mr. Lindloff has an automatic stop on the trade — which sells the shares if they dip below a certain threshold — they are sold for a loss. A moment later, the shares shoot up.Mr. Lindloff thinks he has been juked and jived by a robo trader.“That was nothing but an algorithm boogie,” he mutters to the Today Trader faithful. “Goddang it. Drives me crazy.”“My analogy is that whole sector is doing great and they find one weak animal in a herd,” replies Mr. Gomez, “and they’ll attack it.”Mr. Gomez trades his own accounts but spends much of his time answering questions posted in the chat room. One is from a subscriber, Rick, who asks, “What do you guys do to stop kicking yourself (emotionally) about missed opportunity?”“The only thing you can control is your attitude,” Mr. Gomez replies into his microphone, moments after the question is posted. “Not looking back, not kicking yourself for not catching the whole move. You’re never going to be perfect. Nobody is going to be perfect.”Not even Today Trader. By the end of the day, Mr. Lindloff has traded 60,000 shares and is up $165. It would be a satisfying return, but commissions on those trades cost $300.“You know,” says Mr. Gomez, “a lot of people tell us that our down days are every bit as instructive as our ups.”'"
"'10-03-28,'0','Individuals have stashed an estimated $1 trillion in offshore accounts, the government says, allowing them to avoid up to $70 billion in taxes each year. The federal government estimates that abusive offshore schemes by corporations cost our Treasury an estimated $30 billion in tax revenue as well.Given our large and growing deficits, $100 billion in annual tax revenue would sure come in handy.“The bill is a huge step in the right direction because you cannot imagine how negligent we were with this stuff for years and years,” said Lee Sheppard, contributing editor of Tax Notes, a tax journal in Washington. “We’re getting serious about tax enforcement on cross-border investment flows in a way that we never have before.”UNDER the bill, a 30 percent withholding tax would be imposed on foreign financial institutions that refuse to provide details on their United States clients’ accounts, such as who owns them and how much money moves through them. The tax would be assessed on earnings generated by investments these foreign institutions have in United States Treasury securities, stocks, bonds or debt and equity interests in American businesses.The law was written broadly and covers banks, hedge funds, securities houses, derivatives dealers, commodity traders and private equity firms. Indeed, any financial firm that holds or trades assets for its own account or for clients must comply with the new reporting requirements.It will be up to the Treasury Department to decide how the law applies to insurance companies. The Treasury will also have to create a system to withhold the tax from institutions that do not comply with the reporting requirements. It has until the end of 2012 to do so.“Before this bill was passed, the I.R.S. had no reliable way to learn about offshore accounts, and that gave people the opportunity to cheat the system,” said Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who leads the Senate Finance Committee and pushed for the bill’s reporting rules. “Tax evaders cost our country tens of billions of dollars every year in unpaid taxes, and honest, law-abiding taxpayers pay the price.”It might seem surprising that the bill sailed through the legislative process, given its implications for financial institutions. But United States banks had no interest in lobbying against it; in fact, they may well benefit from the law as potential customers find it harder to shelter money in foreign institutions.The law also closes a gaping tax loophole that allows investors who receive dividends on companies’ shares to pay no taxes on them. The Government Accountability Office estimates that billions of dollars in potential tax revenue are lost each year through the use of so-called dividend equivalent strategies.Under our laws, dividends paid by United States companies to foreign shareholders are supposed to be taxed at 30 percent. But for many years, banks have structured deals using derivatives that allow clients to turn dividends into “dividend equivalents.” Though these payments look like dividends, because they are embedded in a derivative they do not generate a tax.Here’s how they work: Say a hedge fund holds shares in General Electric. By entering into a swap agreement with a financial institution, the fund can simultaneously sell its G.E. shares a few days before the dividend is issued and receive a derivative tied to the value of the shares and the dividend payment.After G.E. pays the dividend, the swap is canceled and the investor gets back the shares plus the dividend equivalent payment. The bank that did the trade typically charges a fee linked to the amount of tax savings the hedge fund reaps.The new law eliminates the tax-free aspect to this transaction, because it treats the swap payments as dividends.Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, has been scrutinizing tax-avoidance schemes for years. His staff’s investigations turned up the dividend equivalent transactions that the law addresses.“We’ve got a ways to go, but these are significant steps,” Mr. Levin said last week. He added that he still hopes to pass a law “that would allow us to take the same measures against foreign financial institutions that impede our tax-collection efforts that we do against our own.”While Ms. Sheppard predicted that the new law would have a big effect, she said there were more effective ways to clamp down on schemes. “If you really wanted to stop this, you would define tax evasion as a predicate act to money laundering,” she said. “Currently the money-laundering information the banks give the government is not given to the I.R.S. for civil tax enforcement.”Such a move would be deemed too radical by many. As a result, we must be content with incremental changes.ROBERT M. MORGENTHAU, the former Manhattan district attorney who spent many years cracking down on tax-avoidance schemes, commended the new law.“When citizens don’t pay their taxes, then other citizens have to pick up the burden,” he said. “It’s important that no group of people have immunity from U.S. laws, and this will go a long way to reaching these offshore accounts where U.S. citizens hide their earnings.”With our nation’s debt levels swelling by the day, we all face the prospect of higher taxes levied to cover those obligations. That makes chasing down tax evaders more important than ever.'"
"'10-03-28,'0','WASHINGTON — The agency that guards airline security inside the United States is likely to remain without a Senate-confirmed leader for months to come after President Obama’s nominee for the position abruptly withdrew late Friday night amid questions from Congress about his work as a defense contractor.The nominee, Maj. Gen. Robert A. Harding, a retired Army intelligence officer, pulled out of contention for director of the agency, the Transportation Security Administration, just two and a half weeks after Mr. Obama submitted his nomination. Mr. Obama’s first pick for the position also withdrew under fire this year, and the administration has not announced a third choice.The agency is facing a range of policy questions about potential changes, including the deployment of full-body scanners at security checkpoints and whether to allow its work force to unionize. Paul Rosenzweig, a former policy adviser to the Homeland Security Department in the Bush administration, said the lack of stable leadership at the top would make it harder to achieve goals.“The lack of a confirmed leader disables the ability of any administration to effect the type of change that it wants to,” Mr. Rosenzweig said. “Change comes slow to the federal government. It’s a bureaucracy, and it’s impossible to achieve change without concerted leadership.”General Harding’s bid for the job fell apart after reports that his company had collected more federal money than it was entitled to for providing interrogators in Iraq.'"

"'10-03-28,'0','Expensive, unproven approaches like vision therapy need to be questioned in order to protect the welfare of children and families and to uphold evidence-based treatment as central to quality care. Judith Warner’s article on vision therapy referred to a convergence-insufficiency treatment trial as a “gold standard,” but this single study, which recommended in-office therapy for convergency insufficiency, should not be used to substantiate all uses of vision therapy. As Warner notes, valid research shows that the most common reading disorder, dyslexia, is caused by problems with language processing, memory and attention, not with the eyes or visual system.The purported benefits of vision therapy can often be explained by the placebo effect, the increased time and attention children receive during treatment, maturation or educational techniques with which vision therapy is usually combined. Until there is stronger evidence for vision therapy, we do not endorse or recommend it.C. GAIL SUMMERS, M.D.President, American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and StrabismusMinneapolis'"
"'10-03-28,'0','And the drive itself became less about the hassle — which it surely was, even as I knew I was fortunate to live so close to the prison — and more of an opportunity to slow down and think as I cruised north, and then back south, essentially on autopilot.I knew Piper had skeletons in her closet. Doesn’t everyone? But hers jumped out in a way most of us never experience.One day in May 1998, while I was at work, a pair of Customs agents buzzed our apartment. When Piper asked what they wanted, they suggested it was better to talk in person. So up they came, five floors, and explained to Piper (who was still in her pajamas, working from home) that she had been indicted in federal court for crimes they said she committed many years before in an international drug ring.When she called me and said in an uncharacteristically shaky voice: “We have to talk. Right now,” I wondered what I’d done wrong this time.But it wasn’t about me. Rapidly, she filled me in on a series of unfortunate events that led to that very bad morning.I had known Piper for four years and dated her for two. Brassier, bolder, more adventurous than anyone I know, Piper is not your average girl. But she is still a pretty, blond Smith grad who looks as if she descended from Mayflower stock: the last girl you’d expect to end up behind bars. I mean, come on, an international drug ring? Didn’t see that one coming.To say she was freaked out and wondering if I would stick around for the messes sure to come is an understatement. To say that it never once crossed my mind to bail on her is simply a statement of fact.For the next five years as the legal system played out, a constant hum of anxiety became the third wheel of our relationship, an ugly piece of furniture we lived with every day. Well-meaning if misinformed friends shared a common refrain: “Don’t worry, girls like Piper don’t end up in prison.”Her lawyer told her that if the case went to trial she would be as good a defendant as they come, having lived a model life since her brief period of recklessness. He also told her that if she lost — and she never claimed to be framed, just young and stupid — she could easily serve seven years or more.After the legal dust settled, the lawyer arrived with the good news-bad news: Her plea bargain for money laundering would mean a 15-month stay in a minimum-security slammer à la Martha Stewart, 13 with good behavior, which we were sure Piper would exhibit.We considered every question and configuration about what goes on between a committed couple when one of them is going to prison for more than a year. Would there be conjugal visits? No. Was I allowed to see other women? No. Was she allowed to see other women? I told her to do whatever she needed.There were so many unknowns when I drove Piper to “self-surrender” at the Danbury prison on Feb. 4, 2004: How would she hold up? How would the separation change us as a couple?Once she was away, I paid her bills, kept her e-mail in-box from overflowing, signed for her packages, began my own weekly visitation routine and managed her visitation list so that she wouldn’t have three visitors one weekend, then none the next. At times I felt like a crazed mom juggling the kids’ soccer and piano lesson schedules.Soon enough I discovered I wasn’t the only man living this kind of life. In the prison visiting room, I found my brotherhood. Open for business Thursday through Sunday and resembling a neglected kindergarten with its wobbly chairs and tables, the visiting room wasn’t filled with only men, of course. But those of us there for our wives and girlfriends had a special bond. Like at a men’s room at Giants Stadium, where the hedge-fund manager sidles up next to the pipe fitter, we were drawn together for a common cause, feeling exposed, and maybe a little sheepish, but fiercely loyal and basically rooting for the same team.We also had new figures who featured into our relationships: the guards, who controlled their lives and, on visiting days, ours, too. We walked through that door, spat out our gum, turned off our phones and turned on the charm so as to avoid any hassles.AND so our routine was set. But I also had a life to live. When I had to miss a visit for an out-of-town magazine assignment, I felt bad. When I couldn’t make it because I went to a beach in Mexico with six people who didn’t happen to be serving time in the clink for the mistakes of their youth, I felt guilty.But I had to do these things for myself. It wasn’t until Piper was in prison that I realized I would resent her if I didn’t retain some semblance of what I defined as my “normal life.”Phone calls were a one-way street, from inside to out. When my phone rang with “unknown number” on the screen, I knew it was her and that the words, “This is a call from a federal prison,” would soon follow. Missing that call while in the subway, or answering it while at a party filled with happy people, broke my heart for different reasons.There’s an expression at Danbury, and I suppose at all prisons, in talking about the loved ones of inmates: “They do the time with you.” True, that. And we boyfriends and husbands also did the time with one another. But me being me, I wasn’t looking for a support group for “Women in Prison and the Men Who Love Them.” And men being men, there was not one on offer.Still, when you see the same faces week after week, you start to chat. Our Trader Joe’s leader was a regular like me, always optimistic, a warm smile on his face. He and I took baby steps making small talk as visiting hours ended, and we took the heavy stroll down the hill to the parking lot after.After Thursday or Friday visits, when I’d taken the train up, he began offering me a ride back in his VW bug, jazz playing pleasantly on his CD player, making it easier to feel O.K. as Danbury faded into the distance for another seven days.Then Piper learned that the husband of one of her inmate friends was my neighbor in Brooklyn, so I arranged to give him a lift whenever possible. It was win-win. I saved him four extra hours of subway, train and taxi time, and he proved to be a great travel buddy, picking up the coffees at the trendy cafe we both liked. The caffeine kicked in and NPR played while his baby snoozed in the back.Whatever the car-pool configuration, we appreciated our common ground. We talked a lot of logistics, as if prison were a puzzle to be solved or fantasy football game to be won. How much “good time” (prison lingo for time off for good behavior) did your lady have? What halfway house would she be released to after prison?There were limits. We never talked about sex, or lack of it, and I can’t remember ever using the word “lonely” in their company. We did not exchange bear hugs or cry on each other’s shoulders.But for that year, no one else in my life knew the reality of our circumstances, like why buying your lady a Diet Coke from the vending machine in the visiting room (because our women weren’t allowed to touch money) was among the greatest acts of love you were capable of performing.Friends constantly told me what an amazing boyfriend I was. My new prison fraternity, I’m sure, heard similar refrains. But it never occurred to us to congratulate ourselves for our commitment. We lived for that trip, for those few hours.Olivia Newton-John sings about being “hopelessly devoted,” and Woody Allen says that 90 percent of life is just showing up. We were, and we did. Every week we got in the car or train or bus and headed for Danbury. Not because we were amazing boyfriends, but because they were amazing girlfriends.And when we walked into that visiting room and saw their waiting faces, it was, bar none, the best moment of the week.'"
"'10-03-28,'0','With that being said, the Obama plan has a lot to recommend it. It would close many of the most obvious holes in the regulatory net. Congress could conceivably overcome its partisan divisions and pass an important bill this summer. If it does, the biggest reason to be nervous about the plan will not be any one of those details that has received so much attention in recent months. It will be something more fundamental. Whatever the regulatory apparatus, it will still be operated by regulators. Regulators will have to set capital requirements, decide when to close a struggling firm and find a balance between protecting consumers and still letting them make choices. The legislation does not spell out many of these details, and neither nor , the Fed chairman, has been especially clear about them. They have not offered much guiding philosophy beyond promising us that regulators will do better next time.In a way, this issue is more about human nature than about politics. By definition, the next period of financial excess will appear to have recent history on its side. Asset prices will have been rising, and whatever new financial instrument that comes along will look as if it is safe. “When things are going well,” , the former Fed chairman, says, “it’s very hard to conduct a disciplined regulation, because everyone’s against you.” Sure enough, both Bernanke and Geithner, along with dozens of other regulators, overlooked many signs of excess over the past decade.One way to deal with regulator fallibility is to implement clear, sweeping rules that limit people’s ability to persuade themselves that the next bubble is different — upfront capital requirements, for example, that banks cannot alter. Thus far, the White House, the Fed and Congress have mostly steered clear of such rules.So it is worth asking whether the current re-regulation plan has enough of a backstop. Even if Wall Street stays one step ahead of Washington, even if future regulators allow too many loopholes in the capital requirements, even if the government does not seize the next until too late, can re-regulation still serve the public good?[ II. How We Got Here ]For more than a half-century starting after , the enjoyed what the economist Gary Gorton calls the quiet period of banking. Before the Depression, financial panics were a regular part of life. They occurred about once a decade. People would get nervous about the health of their bank and, en masse, begin withdrawing their money. The bank, however, had lent the money to other families and businesses and did not have anywhere near enough cash to allow the withdrawals.In the wake of the bank panics of the early 1930s, the Roosevelt administration and Congress passed two crucial reforms as part of the . In one, the federal government set up a new agency, the , that would insure deposits and guarantee that savers would get their money back even if their bank went bust. In the other, banks were restricted to traditional lending. They could not use their deposits to speculate in and were no longer allowed to underwrite securities. Together, the two rules shored up the two sides of a bank’s business — its relationships with savers and with borrowers — and reduced the odds that a bank would go under. The quiet period was born.It began to end in the 1980s. Banks started facing new competition for both savers and borrowers. Households could put their money in like those offered by Fidelity and Vanguard, which offered better returns than savings accounts and sometimes with little risk. Meanwhile, companies, which had once relied on bank loans for financing, could more easily borrow from bond markets.These changes clearly brought some benefits. As Daniel K. Tarullo, a Fed governor appointed by Obama, has said, the New Deal regulations “fostered a banking system that was, for the better part of 40 years, quite stable and reasonably profitable, though not particularly innovative in meeting the needs of depositors and borrowers.” In the more competitive new system, borrowing costs fell. Credit cards, debit cards, A.T.M.’s and online banking brought convenience to consumers. The relatively high returns of the stock market became available to a wider group of people than before. Venture-capital firms turned ideas into companies.But there was a fatal flaw in the new system. The banks’ new competitors received scant oversight. They were not directly bound by Roosevelt’s restrictions. “We had this entire system of outside banks that had no meaningful constraints on capital and leverage,” Geithner says. Investment banks like Lehman Brothers were able to make big profits in part by leveraging themselves more than traditional banks. To use the down-payment analogy again, it was as if Lehman were allowed to put down only 3 percent of a house’s purchase price while traditional banks were still making larger down payments. When the house’s value then rose by just 3 percent, Lehman doubled its investment. , similarly, created a highly leveraged derivatives business that regulators essentially ignored.In response, the traditional banks started advocating for deregulation, so they, too, could plunge into mutual funds and help companies sell stock. In 1999, the Clinton administration and a Republican Congress repealed most of Glass-Steagall, officially allowing traditional banks to engage in other, more risky investments. Even so, the banks’ new competitors — investment banks, insurers, hedge funds and other firms that collectively became known as shadow banks — continued to face less scrutiny and to grow rapidly. Thanks to their leverage, they could make enormous profits by being just a step ahead of ordinary investors or simply by riding a bull market. “The profits these firms make are so out of proportion with any contribution they make to the economy,” Volcker told me not long ago.Eventually, so-called shadow banking made up roughly half of the American financial system. It also helped recreate the same preconditions for a panic that existed before the 1930s. The highly leveraged firms were vulnerable to panics. This time, the panic would come not from individual depositors — who were still insured by the F.D.I.C. — but from other financial firms. A central part of modern finance is something called the repo market, in which firms lend one another huge sums of money every day. If traders suddenly begin to worry that a second firm borrowing from their firm is in trouble, they immediately demand more collateral on the loan. Once one lender begins asking for more collateral, others get nervous and do the same. It is much like a bank run, this time conducted by phone and computer rather than at a bank’s front door. In September 2008, and did this to Lehman, effectively dooming it. Lehman’s collapse then set off a panic around the world.The deregulation of the last few decades has come in for a lot of blame for the current . It deserves some blame, too. If Citigroup and were still operating under the New Deal rules, they might not have flirted with bankruptcy. But take a minute to think about which firms had the biggest problems. They were the shadow banks: stand-alone investment banks like Lehman, and ; and other firms, like A.I.G., that were not banks at all. They were never fully covered by the New Deal regulation, and they were not the ones most affected by the deregulation.The root of the crisis, then, came not so much from the laws that were changed. Finance evolved, and Washington did not keep up. So the creation of another quiet period probably cannot revolve around restoring old rules. It almost certainly depends on new rules, whether they are of the sweeping variety or the more nuanced.In 1988, Congress created the Schumer box. Named for Senator of New York, then a member of the House, the box became a required part of credit-card solicitations, listing the interest rate, the annual fee and other basic numbers. The box serves a useful purpose. Among other things, anyone who does not want to pay an annual fee can quickly toss aside any credit-card offer that includes one. But over time, banks figured out how to charge new fees that were not covered by the Schumer box. They added new billing tricks to credit cards and made millions on overdraft fees in debit cards. Once again, Wall Street remained a step ahead of Washington.It would be foolish to imagine that we could come up with just the right mix of rules and regulations to prevent this from happening again. If regulators are entirely bound by rules and the private sector remains flexible, regulators will never be able to keep up. This is why some amount of discretion is a vital part of re-regulation.With this in mind, the Obama administration has proposed a new agency — the Financial Product Safety Commission — that would allow regulators to rely on their judgment more than they have been able to in the past. They would not simply be enforcing rules. They would have the ability to monitor the marketplace in real time. If banks were hiding debit-card fees or persuading millions of people to take out mortgages their incomes could not support — practices that brought huge profits over the past decade — the commission could issue a public warning or even prohibit a practice. Its powers would be similar to that of the , which monitors toy safety and other issues. Today, there is effectively no equivalent for consumer finance.The agency has become the most contentious part of the regulation debate, much as the public option was to the health care debate. , the lead Republican senator on the Banking Committee, has made clear that he opposes a free-standing consumer agency. In part, the Republican opposition reflects the banks’ views. But it also stems from a concern that regulators could stifle innovation or, going the other way, push banks to take unwise risks in the name of consumers. That is what happened with and , the government-sponsored agencies that helped support the growth of subprime lending.In recent weeks, senators have been discussing whether some version of the agency — housed inside the Fed, perhaps — might be able to win Republican support. The Fed, however, has a long history of poor consumer protection. For this reason, , the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has proposed giving the agency a dedicated budget and having its director appointed by the president.More important, though, than where the oversight function is housed is how it approaches regulation. In this regard, the administration is on to something. The agency may be the most politically assertive part of Obama’s plan, but it also reflects his — and his advisers’ — fondness for policies based on empirical research. The word they like to use is “pragmatic.” As White House and Treasury officials imagine the new agency, it would be an outgrowth of behavioral economics, a discipline that combines and economics to study how people really behave, rather than how they say they will or how academic models predict they will behave. The agency would even be able to run experiments, in which social scientists could study how consumers respond to different financial offers.Geithner’s assistant secretary for financial institutions is Michael S. Barr, who is on leave from the Law School, where he has studied consumer finance. One of Barr’s research collaborators — Sendhil Mullainathan, a Harvard professor and MacArthur “genius grant” winner — spent last year working for the Treasury and the , focusing in part on the design of the consumer agency.Mullainathan likes to say that in many areas of life, the profit motive promotes consumer welfare. People can understand what makes for a good shoe or mobile phone, and companies compete based on quality and price. In other areas, though, consumers are not able to distinguish a good product from a bad one. The issues are too complex. They involve interest rates, for example, or compound returns. Companies could theoretically try to educate customers about these subjects. But this is an uphill battle. It is far easier to appeal to instincts that people already have. So companies selling complex products often do not compete on quality and price. They compete with slick advertising or too-good-to-be-true offers, like those for low initial interest rates.“A lot of people think, Companies are trying to subvert what’s good for me,” Mullainathan told me. “But think of the guy in charge of a credit-card division. He’s doing his job. All he has to work with is the demand curve.” And the demand curve is based on the factors that actually influence consumer demand, not the ones we might wish influenced it. People really do sign up for mortgages with low initial payments even when they have no realistic hope of making the later payments.The only reliable solution to this problem is regulation. Government regulators make sure airplanes are safe, because consumers cannot monitor the workings of aircraft engines. The airlines then compete on things consumers can evaluate, like price, legroom, route convenience and in-flight television. The goal of the consumer-finance agency, Mullainathan says, would be to “take the powerful river of competition and make it flow in a direction that benefits people.”Barr recently showed me a mock-up of a credit-card bill created by a graphic designer — a new take on the Schumer box that could be updated over time. Even if the box did not become mandatory, banks could be given incentives to use it. Private groups might more easily be able to identify the banks that were hiding fees. Barr also mentioned the idea of replacing the stacks of paper that home buyers receive at a house closing with a simple mortgage-disclosure form. The form could highlight the most relevant information, and, unlike the mass of documents most people now sign, many might actually read it.By itself, the consumer-protection agency would be unlikely to prevent the next crisis. Modern financial crises tend to have many of their roots deep inside Wall Street, with complex securities that consumers never see. But the same idea behind the agency exists in other parts of re-regulation, too. In the Senate bill, a council of regulators, presided over by the Treasury secretary, would work with the Fed to monitor risks in the financial system as they developed. Crucially, the council would be able to monitor both traditional banks and shadow banks.All of this new regulation depends on the wisdom of regulators, who are, of course, human beings with the potential to be swept up in the enthusiasm of a bubble. And Obama administration officials — especially Geithner, the main architect of re-regulation — are sensitive to the idea that they are asking too much of human discretion. Their solution is to depend on capital requirements to prevent another financial crash. They refer to these requirements as cushioning or foam on the runway. So long as a firm has enough hard assets — and can get access to their cash value — it can survive a lot of bad investments and a lot of ineffective oversight.“We don’t know where the next crisis is going to come from,” Geithner told me. “We won’t be able to foresee it. We’re not going to pre-empt all future bubbles. So we want to build a much bigger cushion into the system against those basic human limitations. I don’t want a system that depends on clairvoyance or bravery.” He added, “The top three things to get done are capital, capital and capital.”Many others share this broad view. Shelby has talked about the importance of capital. So has , the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., who has occasionally clashed with Obama’s economic advisers.One good way to understand the importance of capital is to look at the fate of firms that entered the crisis with relatively thick cushions. In 2007, commercial banks had an average leverage ratio of about 12 to 1, according to a recent report by McKinsey & Company. This means the banks had a dollar in assets for every $12 in debt. That was enough for many of them, like , to survive the bust in decent shape. In , financial firms had an average ratio of about 18 to 1, and Canada endured the crisis better than perhaps any other rich country.By contrast, the five big investment banks in this country — Bear Stearns, , Lehman, Merrill Lynch and — were close to or exceeding a ratio of 30 to 1. Of the five investment banks, Lehman collapsed, Bear and Merrill were sold at cut-rate prices and Goldman and Morgan Stanley might not have survived without government aid.The crisis has made Wall Street much more conservative. But this will not last. It never does. Left to their own devices, financial firms will again take on big debts and big risks. They have a lot of incentive to do so. A analysis found that if one set of stricter leverage standards had been in place during the five years before the crisis, it would have reduced the biggest firms’ profitability by almost 25 percent.The model for setting future capital rules is the stress tests that the Fed conducted last year to gauge the strength of individual banks. Geithner convinced Obama to make those tests a core part of the financial-rescue strategy, and they ended up being something of a turning point in the crisis. Banks in the United States are healthier today than in many other countries, and the economy is growing more rapidly. Perhaps most striking, the rescue is on course to cost far less than the average clean-up from a financial crisis, according to statistics.Beyond the immediate crisis, Geithner saw the stress tests as a way to show what the Fed could accomplish when it had authority over all parts of the financial system, including the shadow banks. Moreover, the tests would be proof that the Fed now believed in regulation after decades of mostly ignoring it. In the new regulatory framework, the Fed — a repository of well-trained, nonpolitical economists and bank experts — would be given a vastly bigger role than in the past.But there is reason to wonder whether the capital cushions, at least in their current form, will be enough to overcome human limitations. The administration and Congress have been deliberately vague about what the capital ratios will be. They have not given out numbers or explained a myriad of details: how the ratios will vary by firm size, for instance, or how they will deal with so-called off-balance-sheet assets. Their approach has the advantage of keeping technicalities free of Capitol Hill horse-trading, much as setting interest rates is a process left to the Fed, not Congress. Vagueness also allows American regulators more freedom to coordinate with regulators in other countries. On the other hand, by remaining out of the public eye, capital requirements become yet another issue that will ultimately depend on discretion. Wall Street firms will have a chance to persuade the Fed that maybe they do not need as much capital as people first thought. No doubt, the firms will offer some highly sophisticated mathematical models to make their case.The stress tests, remember, were conducted when banks were financially and politically weak. When times were good over the previous decade, Fed officials — and not just — neglected to use the powers they did have. They came to believe the bubble rationales that Wall Street offered. It is not hard to see how that could happen again. The most telling case study may be Geithner himself.Despite the criticism that Geithner has faced for being too close to Wall Street, he has never worked there. He is a lifelong civil servant. When the Clinton administration was winding down, his mentor, , told him he could get a plum job on Wall Street. Geithner instead chose a low-profile job at the I.M.F. And as the president of the , he raised more alarms than many regulators did. He pushed his staff and bank executives to think about how much capital banks had and how much they needed. He warned that periods of calm often led to unanticipated crises and that once confidence started to slip, it could quickly vanish. Intellectually, he understood how things could go wrong.What he missed, however, was the fact that things were going wrong in some of the very institutions he was overseeing. “Financial innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk,” Geithner said in a speech at a Fed conference in in May 2007. Large firms, he added, “are generally stronger in terms of capital relative to risk.” Bernanke, who may have years as Fed chairman ahead of him, made statements that look even worse in retrospect. He did not merely say that bubbles were hard to identify. He actively denied that there was a housing bubble.Might future versions of Bernanke and Geithner do better? Maybe. But that does not seem like a great bet. Both men spent their careers studying and working on financial crises. Even some of their critics agree they are unusually bright. By all rights, they should have been the ones to come down with regulatory force, and they didn’t.What is the alternative? Canada offers another telling lesson. It relies more on blunt rules than the United States does. Canada requires any mortgage with a less than 20 percent down payment to be insured, and those mortgages are much less common there. It also sets a standard leverage ratio of no more than 20. As Julie Dickson, the chief financial regulator in Canada, told me, “We become nasty when banks get close to it.”Blunt rules inevitably have their problems. But they also send signals that can outlast a given administration or a given moment in the business cycle. In Canada, the well-publicized conservative capital rule not only restrained Canadian banks, but it also served as an immutable reminder to regulators and kept them from falling under the sway of bubble thinking.Five days before Geithner gave that speech in Georgia, Dickson gave a speech of her own in . She began by discussing the 1960s television show. Dickson reminded her audience that Samantha, the lead character, had magical powers and, among other things, could turn sows’ ears into silk purses. Dickson continued, “markets seem to be producing triple-A instruments from instruments that are not rated triple-A.” The sow’s ears, in her telling, were subprime mortgages that Wall Street repackaged into triple-A, supposedly risk-free securities that were touted as silk purses.The blunt, sweeping rule that has received the most attention over the past year is the Volcker Rule. Named for the former Fed chairman and Obama adviser who has been pushing it, the rule would, among other things, prohibit traditional banks from engaging in proprietary trading — the buying and selling of stocks or other investments for a bank’s own profit, rather than as a service to clients. On its face, the rule sounds like a re­instatement of Glass-Steagall. When Obama added it to his regulation plan in January, he seemed to be making a major shift.But if you listen to the rule’s main advocates — like Volcker or , a White House economist — you come to realize that it is often misunderstood. Its goal is narrower: to eliminate one of the subsidies that Washington now bestows on Wall Street. Traditional banks have access to cheap government loans to encourage them to lend freely and also to serve as a backstop during a panic. When banks turn around and use these low-interest loans to make investments they are essentially receiving a government subsidy for stock trading. This subsidy has helped Goldman Sachs and other firms reap big profits over the last year. “It’s just not appropriate for banks to get money subsidized by the taxpayer and use it for their own speculative investments that have nothing to do with their clients,” Goolsbee says.Yet the subsidy is not what caused the crisis. With or without it, a firm can bring down the financial system. Lehman nearly did, and it was not a traditional bank.So long as Congress can adequately define proprietary trading — which will take a little work, but is not as hard as Wall Street has suggested — some version of the rule seems like a sensible part of re-regulation. But it is not a reform that will serve as a reliable backstop to regulator failure.The boldest proposal along these lines would be to break up the banks. Some outsiders, like Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, argue that today’s huge banks are powerful enough to resist any effort at strong regulation. Their size alone could make it especially hard for the government to seize a troubled bank and wind it down in an orderly fashion. One middle-ground option would be to give regulators the authority to split up a big bank that began to have problems well before it would need to be seized.The flaw in this approach is that size is not the same as risk. Lehman and A.I.G. were not the country’s largest financial firms. The well-regulated Canadian financial sector is far more concentrated than the underregulated American financial sector. Canada has 4 of the 50 biggest banks in the world. The United States, with an economy 10 times as large as Canada’s, has 5 of the top 50.What may be more worrisome than the size of any individual bank is the size of the entire sector. It accounted for about 30 percent of all corporate profits in the decade before the crisis, up from 16 percent in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of that growth no doubt reflected innovations that improved people’s lives, like the A.T.M. But a significant portion probably did not. It reflected, among other things, Wall Street’s ability to make huge profits in good times and to be bailed out in bad times. It was what some economists have called the privatization of profit and socialization of risk. Wall Street was benefiting at the expense of society.There is a commonly accepted strategy for dealing with activities that impose costs on society. You tax them. A tax discourages the harmful activity. It also raises revenue that can help cover the associated costs. Economists refer to such taxes — on alcohol or pollution, for example — as externality taxes.The regulation blueprint that the Treasury Department released last spring did not include a tax on banks. But Obama has since proposed a tax that would allow the government to recoup any losses from the $700 billion bailout fund — the , or TARP — that was passed in 2008. The ideal regulation plan would create a permanent tax along these lines. Such a tax would acknowledge that banks serve a vital function in a market economy but that they also have a habit of taking unwise risks. No matter how hard regulators try and how smart they are, they often cannot keep on top of those risks. Taxpayers are then left to pay the bill, to keep a financial crisis from turning into a depression. A bank tax would force banks to share that cost.Obama’s TARP tax would be temporary, expiring as early as 2020. But Congress often extends tax provisions that began with a time limit, and the Obama administration seems quite comfortable with the idea of the tax becoming permanent. “Financial crises cause a huge amount of damage to the revenue base over time,” Geithner said. “So there is a very good argument you should put a tax on finance, like a tax on pollution.”If you add up the major parts of the Obama plan, you can see how it is meant to replicate Roosevelt’s regulatory successes, albeit for a very different banking system. The consumer-safety agency is today’s answer to the , which was created in 1934 to protect investors. Expanding the regulatory net to cover shadow banking is an attempt to reduce risk taking, just as Glass-Steagall was. Higher capital ratios are meant to make panics less likely. Giving the government the authority to take over dying investment banks simply extends the New Deal law allowing it to take over traditional banks.Still, there is a big thematic difference between the Roosevelt approach and the Obama approach. Roosevelt relied on the kind of sweeping ideas that this White House has largely eschewed. Roosevelt guaranteed bank deposits, separated commercial banking from investment banking and banned misinformation about stocks. Obama would hold banks to as-yet-undefined capital and liquidity standards commensurate with how big and how connected to other firms they are.It is a crucial step, as are many of the other new regulations in the plan. But it would be easier to have confidence in them if the administration and Congress took a few steps away from discretion and toward clarity. “Rule-based regimes,” Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor, said in a recent speech, “are inevitably crude and imperfect.” But Warsh suggested that they may be better than a system in which banks accept micromanagement under the assumption that they will be able to co-opt their micromanagers.To avoid this, the bank tax could move from being a sideshow in the regulation debate to the center of it. Regulators could also forge ahead with tough, well-publicized capital rules. The specific numbers do not need to be included in legislation, but the Fed — which will have the power to set the rules — does not need to wait for what may be an elusive global consensus. And, at the very least, the rules should be straightforward enough to be widely understood. “This whole idea of ultrasophistication — we’re just kidding ourselves,” Robert C. Pozen, an investment manager and author of a recent book on re-regulation, says. As the crisis showed, intricate mathematical models can too easily produce the answer that their handlers want to hear.Whatever their imperfections, simple rules have the advantage of sending signals that can outlast a given administration or a given moment in the business cycle. That is one of the lessons of the Roosevelt reforms and of the quiet period in banking that followed.The obvious reason to re-regulate finance is to prevent the next crisis or at least to make it less damaging. But there are other potential benefits to reform. Consider what has happened to the American economy over the last three decades. Highly leveraged financial firms became a dominant part of the economy. Their profits allowed the firms to recruit many of the country’s most sought-after employees — mathematicians, scientists, top college graduates and top former government officials. Yet many of those profits turned out to be ephemeral. So some of the best minds were devoted to devising ever-more-complex means of creating money out of thin air, the proceeds of which then drew in even more talent.A more serious approach to regulation could, if indirectly, have a big impact on this situation. By reducing financial firms’ profits, it could reduce the industry to a smaller and arguably more natural size. Re-regulation could remove some of the subsidies that Wall Street now receives. The cottage industry of hidden fees, ballooning interest rates and other misleading practices could be brought under control. Higher capital requirements and a bank tax could force financial firms to experience the bad times as well as the good. Above all, re-regulation could acknowledge that modern finance brings both benefits and risks.It is worth remembering that Wall Street’s long boom has not exactly been shared by much of the rest of the American economy. Wage growth for most workers has been painfully slow over the past three decades. Economic growth over the last decade was slower than in any decade since World War II. Surely, one goal of re-regulation should be to loosen Wall Street’s grip on the country’s resources, both financial and human, in the hope that they might be put to more productive use.'"
"'10-03-28,'0','In his classic study “The American Jeremiad” (1978), the Harvard scholar Sacvan Bercovitch put his finger on the distinctive shading our writers have given the ancient form: “American writers have tended to see themselves as outcasts and isolates, prophets crying in the wilderness. So they have been, as a rule: American Jeremiahs, simultaneously lamenting a declension and celebrating a national dream.” We Americans, the jeremiad proclaims, have failed to live up to our founding principles, betrayed our sacred covenant as history’s (or God’s) chosen nation, and must rededicate ourselves to our ideals, reclaim our founding promise.If the manifesto looks fearlessly to the future, seeking to replace the established order with something alto­gether new, the jeremiad is at once jittery and nostalgic, looking anxiously over its shoulder at a prelapsarian past. The American jeremiad, Bercovitch observed, “made anxiety its end as well as its means. Crisis was the social norm it sought to inculcate.” Whether “denouncing or affirming,” its vision “fed on the distance between promise and fact.” Aware that the present fails to measure up to past ideals, the jeremiad nonetheless can’t imagine a future on any other terms. It yearns to repair the breach.Consider Thoreau, one of Bercovitch’s 19th-century Jeremiahs. Bercovitch notes that Thoreau was writing “Walden” around the same time “The Communist Manifesto” appeared in print. Whereas Marx and Engels “proposed a new form of government, based on a wholly different social system,” Bercovitch writes, Thoreau was making “a protest from within,” hoping, “like a biblical prophet,” to “wake his countrymen up to the fact that they were desecrating their own beliefs.”That impulse, in one form or another, survived into the 20th century, and beyond. “The Great Gatsby” is a kind of jeremiad (as any student of Bercovitch’s will tell you). The Beats wrote jeremiads (“Moloch whose blood is running money!” “America when will you be angelic?”). Dylan wrote jeremiads (“If God’s on our side he’ll stop the next war”). Norman Mailer’s “Armies of the Night” has that jeremiad feel (“America, once a beauty of magnificence unparalleled, now a beauty with a leprous skin”). Martin Luther King, an actual preacher, wrote jeremiads. Some of Barack Obama’s best speeches have been jeremiads — as were Ronald Reagan’s, complete with city upon a hill.The inevitable question arises: Is it possible that some of our current American manifestos are really jeremiads, trapped in the wrong packaging? Some examples may prove instructive. First, one must separate the earnest from the merely tongue-in-cheek. A manifesto for the martini is one thing, a manifesto for the health care system something else entirely. And while Atul Gawande’s cleverly overstated title does convey the unexpected force of his simple proposal for saving lives in complex systems, it’s hardly a jeremiad — no ancient checklist-making covenant has been betrayed. It’s the same with Stewart Brand, whose “ecopragmatist” call for a new environmental agenda questions old pieties and embraces some heretical solutions (nuclear power, for instance). Like Gawande, Brand prizes the practical over the ideological. Neither wants a revolution — they simply want you to roll up your sleeves and get to work fixing problems. These are, if such is possible, modest manifestos.The fact is, “manifesto” implies a radicalism that American writers generally lack. For the conservative Mark Helprin, this is no doubt a point of pride. He’s radical only in his tenacious defense of what he sees as a distinctly American tradition. His “writer’s manifesto” defends not only copyright and intellectual property but life and liberty as well, and a Jeffersonian ideal of American individualism, against the digital hordes and the new quasi-Marxism of the creative commons. When Helprin writes that “the right of property transcends the material and is in fact a pillar of ethics and morals”; that copyright, now under assault, “is and has been a bulwark of civilization”; and that its loss can only lead to a kind of national degeneracy, you know you’re in jeremiad territory. (Likewise with Jaron Lanier, who laments the betrayal of the Web’s early ideals by the profit-driven software designs of Web 2.0, and fears the loss of individuality to Wikidom and the “digital Maoist” hive mind.)David Shields’s “Reality Hunger” is another matter altogether — and more surprising. Give him credit. Here’s a manifesto that goes for broke. More André Breton than Cotton Mather, Shields sets out “to write the ars poetica for a burgeoning group of interrelated (but unconnected) artists in a multitude of forms and media (lyric essay, prose poem, collage novel, visual art, film, television, radio, performance art, rap, stand-up comedy, graffiti) who are breaking larger and larger chunks of ‘reality’ into their work.” His book — made up largely of textual fragments taken from other writers — champions his vision of a new avant-garde by enacting it.Not exactly jeremiad material. Except for this. In the year 2010, can the very notion of an avant-garde escape a strong whiff of nostalgia? Shields seems to yearn for that mythical modernist moment when Duchamp’s urinal all by itself could make a statement. For all its celebration of collapsing genre boundaries, its declaration of independence from tyrannical artifice, Shields’s manifesto has an oddly retro feel, less “make it new” than “make it neo.” A pure product of its time, perhaps, but also of an American tradition. Our arts have betrayed us, Shields cries. We must look to the modernist past to find the way forward.Of course, “Reality Hunger: A Jeremiad” doesn’t have quite the same ring to it.'"

"'10-03-29,'1','The Environmental Protection Agency will soon begin a much-needed study of the effects on water quality and public health of a method of extracting natural gas called hydraulic fracturing. An E.P.A. investigation in 2004 was rightly seen as superficial and skewed toward industry, which provided much of the underlying data. This one must be comprehensive and transparent.It must also be swift. The search for natural gas has widened beyond the usual venues like Texas and the Rocky Mountain West to Pennsylvania and New York State, site of a vast deposit called the Marcellus Shale.Hydraulic fracturing involves blasting water, sand and chemicals into underground formations to unlock the gas. The technique has been implicated in a growing number of water pollution cases. New York State has been forced to review plans to allow exploratory drilling upstate, including New York City’s watershed, because of fears that an accidental release of toxic chemicals could poison the water supply for millions of people.Representative Maurice Hinchey, a Democrat from New York, had inserted a provision in a spending bill urging the E.P.A to undertake the study. Mr. Hinchey is also the co-author, with Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat, of a bill that would force industry to disclose the chemicals it uses and require regulation of the process under the Safe Drinking Water Act.Industry has publicly endorsed the E.P.A. review and expressed confidence that it will show that hydraulic fracturing is, in the words of the American Petroleum Institute, a “safe and well-understood technology” that has allowed access to huge new supplies of natural gas.At the same time, industry opposes the DeGette-Hinchey bill, claiming that the chemicals it uses are proprietary secrets and that new regulations would deter production. Mr. Hinchey and Ms. DeGette should stick to their guns. It’s important to enlarge the nation’s supply of natural gas, a relatively clean fuel. But where public health is an issue, federal oversight is plainly required.'"
"'10-03-29,'1','The pitchers are apparently healthy, but so far, nothing over the last month gives any indication that anyone on the staff will instill fear in opposing teams. Pelfrey’s earned run average is 7.97 over five starts, and he has allowed eight home runs, some of them definitely wind-aided.Oliver Perez has been passable in four starts but hardly terrific. And John Maine got over some early bumps to pitch fairly well in his last few starts.It has not been a disaster, but as Manuel said last week, there have not been any “wow” performances, either.Often, that is exactly how many pitchers want their spring training to progress. Do the work, gradually raise the pitch count and stamina, do not reveal too much to the opposition and the scouts, and go north feeling healthy and prepared. Pelfrey pointed out that he had the best spring training of his career in 2007, then started the season 0-7.“I don’t think it really matters,” he said. “It’s spring training. When they turn the lights on, it’s a totally different game. I’ll be happy to get out of Florida, though.”Even Johan Santana has a 6.75 E.R.A., but his surgically repaired left elbow appears sound, so the focus is on the next three starters.During the off-season, the Mets did not add any starters. They felt the pitchers they had were comparable to those they could have signed, aside from John Lackey, who always seemed destined for Boston.Pelfrey, Perez and Maine seem comparable to the free agents Jason Marquis, Jon Garland, Joel Pineiro and John Smoltz at this stage of their careers. The Mets stuck with their guys and hope they will make them look good for choosing inaction.“I think we’re going the right way,” Perez said. “Everybody knows that when we’re healthy, we’re fine, that we can compete and win this division. We know what we have to do.”Maine said he understood the questions about the staff but was more focused on making 30 starts than trying to prove people wrong. And Pelfrey, despite his numbers, seems relaxed and confident.“I feel good,” Pelfrey said. “That’s the biggest thing. I feel comfortable. It’s going to be fine. The results haven’t been the greatest, but like I told you, my best spring training I ever had, I started off 0-7 and got sent down. So I don’t put a whole lot of stock in spring training.”Reliever Ryota Igarashi got two quick outs in his one inning against the Cardinals on Sunday, then gave up three runs and three hits, including a home run, as his velocity was down to 91 miles per hour from 94. The pitching coach Dan Warthen said Igarashi might be physically fatigued, but Igarashi said, “There have been many things to think about every day and it’s making me a little tired mentally.” ...

"'10-03-29,'1','ADRIAN, Mich. (AP) — Federal agents conducted raids over the weekend in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio and arrested at least three people, the F.B.I. said Sunday. A militia leader in Michigan said the target of at least one of the raids had been a Christian militia group.Federal warrants were sealed, but an F.B.I. spokeswoman, Sandra Berchtold, said there had been activity in two southeast Michigan counties near the Ohio state line. She would not say whether they were tied to the raids in the other states.Scott Wilson, an F.B.I. spokesman in Cleveland, said agents arrested two people on Saturday after raids in two towns in Ohio. A third arrest was made in northeast Illinois on Sunday, a day after a raid took place just over the border in northwest Indiana.Michael Lackomar, a spokesman for the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia, said one of his team leaders got a telephone call on Saturday evening from members of Hutaree, a Christian militia group, who said their property in southeast Michigan was being raided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.“They said they were under attack by the A.T.F. and wanted a place to hide,” Mr. Lackomar said. “My team leader said, ‘No thanks.’ ”The team leader was cooperating with the F.B.I. on Sunday, Mr. Lackomar said.He said about 8 to 10 members of Hutaree trained with his organization twice in the last three years. His group holds monthly training sessions focusing on survival training and shooting practice, Mr. Lackomar said.F.B.I. agents in Ohio made arrests in Huron and Sandusky on Saturday night, Mr. Wilson said. He said no further information would be released until after the suspects appeared in court Monday.One raid occurred at Bayshore Estates, a trailer park in Sandusky, a small city on Lake Erie between Toledo and Cleveland, said the park manager, Terry Mills. The authorities blocked off the street for about an hour Saturday night, he said.'"
"'10-03-29,'1','The incongruity of it all can be seen clearly in an analysis of price-to-earnings ratios, a gauge of how expensive stocks are relative to their performance.Ratios in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index are hovering about 13 percent above the average since 2005; a year ago, they were about 40 percent below the average. That suggests that investors are betting on robust earnings through the end of the year, a view that many economists do not embrace.“The stock market has priced in a bit more than what we’ve got so far,” said Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor of The Stock Trader’s Almanac. “We’re due for a pause.”Recent rallies have been narrow, with a modest number of stocks reaching 52-week highs even when the broader market surged. There is a sense in some corners that stock prices will decline: investors are betting more on stocks’ falling now than they have since July.Mr. Hirsch, citing historical patterns, predicts a 20 to 30 percent dip in the markets before they can climb again. The Dow Jones industrial average is more than 60 percent above its lows a year ago, flirting with 11,000 for the first time since the onset of the financial crisis, though it remains more than 3,000 off its prerecession peak.The S.& P. 500 is up nearly 75 percent from a year ago, and the Nasdaq is up nearly 90 percent.The first part of this year had glittering reports on fourth-quarter earnings and mildly upbeat news on economic indicators like retail sales and orders for durable goods.In response, the broad-based S.& P. 500 has climbed 4.6 percent this year. Autos, consumer electronics, regional banks and home builders — all losers in 2009 — have led the way. Banking stocks, which drove much of last year’s rally, continue to surge, with many regional banks up more than 40 percent.Even during some of the stock markets’ better weeks, jitters have seemed to lurk just beneath the surface. The Dow rode a rare eight-day winning streak this month, but trading was light and day-to-day gains were small, casting doubt on the significance of the uptick.During much of the financial crisis, traders clung to bond funds for safety. But as the appetite for risk has returned, investors have begun snapping up stocks: over the last several weeks, new cash has poured into American equity funds at a brisk pace, and mutual funds have shown particular strength.Many market participants expect the momentum to continue, with stocks ending the year 10 to 20 percent higher. While few expect strong economic growth this year, investors believe that the recovery is intact and that earnings will continue to grow.“A lot of people believe the government will just keep pumping money into this,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research.There are signs that some of investors’ optimism may be excessive.Interest rates, kept at historical lows by the Fed during the financial crisis, are starting to rise because of the flight from bonds and concern over rising debt, particularly that of the United States.Standard mortgage rates hovered near 5 percent last week after auctions of seven-year Treasury notes were met with weak demand, sending yields higher. A sustained rise in interest rates would crimp growth by making borrowing more expensive for consumers, businesses and governments. It could also attract some investors away from equities and into bonds.Another concern is the nation’s intractable unemployment rate, which has hampered consumer spending and worsened a foreclosure crisis in the housing market. Employers are still not adding jobs, though the rate of job losses has declined in recent months, raising hopes that a turning point is at hand.Consumer confidence has improved modestly from its low a year ago, but spending is still weak.Some clarity may come to the market on Friday, when the government releases its monthly snapshot of the labor market. Forecasters expect the data to show 200,000 new jobs, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 9.7 percent.When first-quarter earnings results begin trickling in next month, investors will be looking for signs that companies have put cost-cutting behind them and strengthened revenue.“We’ve managed to at least temporarily suspend the financial crisis,” Mr. Roberts said. “The question now is, ‘You’ve gotten past the first act; what’s the encore?’ ”'"

"'10-03-29,'1','The Open Swiss Teams event at the end of the Spring Nationals in Reno, Nev., was won by John Diamond of Boca Raton, Fla.; Brian Platnick of Evanston, Ill.; Eric Greco of Philadelphia; Geoff Hampson and Fred Gitelman of Las Vegas; and Brad Moss of San Anselmo, Calif.They gained a game swing on the diagramed deal.At the other table, Diamond (East) did not respond over one diamond, so South could make a takeout double and rebid one no-trump over North’s one-heart advance, which ended the auction. Platnick (West) led the spade king, and declarer took his eight top tricks.There was more at stake when the momentum of the auction carried Hampson (South) into three no-trump.After West led his fourth-highest diamond, declarer saw that if he played on clubs to establish a ninth winner, he would probably lose three clubs and two diamonds or two clubs. Instead, he tried to bring pressure to bear on West.Hampson won the first trick with dummy’s diamond queen and called for a low club.East made the expert play of winning with his king so that he could return a diamond. (This would have been necessary to defeat the contract if declarer had had the ace-jack-third of diamonds and the queen-jack of clubs.) South took his ace and cashed three heart tricks to give this position (see Diagram 1):On dummy’s last heart, declarer discarded a spade. What should West have thrown?At the table, West pitched a spade. Now, though, South played another club and won the race. West took the trick and led a diamond; declarer won and played a club; West won and cashed a diamond; South took the last two tricks with his spade ace and club ten.Minus 120 and plus 600 gave the Diamond team 10 international match points on the board.The result would have been 6 imps the other way if West had discarded a diamond on the last heart. Then, when declarer played a club, West could have won and shifted to the spade king. The defenders would have taken two spades and three clubs.'"
"'10-03-29,'1','BANGKOK — Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva of Thailand met Sunday with leaders of the antigovernment protest movement here, the first significant effort to defuse two weeks of street protests.The meeting, an unscripted and unusual face-off among hardened political rivals that was carried live on Thailand’s main television channels, failed to make progress on the primary demand of protesters, that new elections be called. Both sides agreed to meet again on Monday.“All of us now have only one question,” Jatuporn Prompan, a protest leader at the meeting, asked the prime minister. “Will you dissolve Parliament or not?”Mr. Abhisit, looking uncomfortable at times, said he would “make a decision based on a consensus from the entire country” and questioned whether new elections would solve Thailand’s four-year-old political crisis.The talks came as the capital was hit by several weekend grenade attacks that wounded soldiers, the latest in a spate of such episodes.The demonstrators, who are known as red shirts, number in the tens of thousands and have become increasingly assertive. On Saturday they demanded that soldiers stop guarding the government district where the protests are taking place. The military agreed and removed hundreds of troops from all but one main government office.'"

"'10-03-30,'1','EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — History will reflect that the Nets of 2009-10 are bad. It will also now reflect that they are not the worst team in N.B.A. history.After serving as the league’s version of the Washington Generals much of this season, the Nets stiff-armed infamy by claiming their 10th victory in their 74th game, a 90-84 victory Monday over a depleted version of the San Antonio Spurs.“We got 10,” the public address announcer Gary Sussman said as the final buzzer sounded. “The Nets win. The Nets wiiiiiiiiiin.”Never has a 10th victory so late in the season been so sweet. The Nets’ win means that the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers will keep their distinction with nine victories in an 82-game season.This is as good as it will probably get for the Nets, who collectively breathed a sigh of relief that it did not get as bad as it could have gotten. The season started ominously. The team parted with its longtime coach Lawrence Frank, set the record for most losses to start a season with 18, and bequeathed interim coaching duties on a hesitant Kiki Vandeweghe, its general manager.'"

"'10-03-30,'1','Rest assured, though, that when the fight over financial re-regulation is complete, the next big battle between Wall Street and Washington will be over capital ratios and liquidity.“This is the big issue,” said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group. “There is a natural tension between the banks and regulators on this.”Of course, protecting against even infrequent crises probably means forcing banks to keep a lot of cash on hand in case their bets go bad. But that would come at the expense of economic growth as banks would make fewer loans.Mr. Geithner insists that if there is one change that needs to be made to the banking system to protect it against another high-stakes bank run like the one that claimed the life of Lehman Brothers, increasing capital requirements is it.But try pinning down Mr. Geithner, or anyone else in the Beltway, on how much capital banks should be required to keep, or even how the word “capital” should be defined, and certainties disappear.“We have not made a judgment yet on the number,” he said, though he allowed, “it will be higher than where the formal regulatory requirements were coming into the crisis.”If it seems that Mr. Geithner is being coy, he has good reason. The debate is fraught with uncertainty, and it extends beyond our borders to other countries grappling with the same question.For banks, where the line is drawn on capital requirements dictates just how profitable they can be.“A bank, or any financial intermediary, requires significant leverage to be competitive,” Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, wrote in a report released this month, referring to borrowed money.He went on: “Without adequate leverage, markets do not provide a rate of return on financial assets high enough to attract capital to that activity. Yet at too great a degree of leverage, bank solvency is at risk.”For borrowers, the exact capital ratio could determine how readily banks can offer mortgages and loans to small businesses. Bankers say that one reason they’re not lending as much as policymakers and businesses would like is the uncertainty around how much money they will need to hold onto under whatever rules are set by the government.For now, at least, that’s an argument that Mr. Geithner does not buy. “They certainly are holding more capital than they need now,” he said, after the government forced most of them to raise capital as part of the stress tests.One reason the Obama administration has not tried to propose a one-size-fits-all capital requirement as part of the proposed legislation is the worry that the issue would become too politicized — that banks would manage to successfully lobby lawmakers for a ratio that is too low, thereby giving investors a false sense of security.Instead, the final number is to be determined by a global coalition of regulators known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Mr. Geithner said.“By the end of this year, we will negotiate an international consensus on the new ratios,” he said.But even then, Mr. Geithner is likely to face a bruising battle, not necessarily from American banks but from their foreign rivals.“Our major global banks have more capital today relative to risk than do many of their major international competitors,” Mr. Geithner said.In Europe, banks and regulators focus on risk-weighted capital as opposed to pure capital, allowing those banks to keep significantly less collateral on hand for assets that are deemed not very risky, like ultra-safe Treasury bonds. That’s not the case in the United States.So as the world tries to harmonize its capital ratios and definitions — a global fix is important so that banks don’t try to arbitrage the system — United States regulators may feel pressure to appease the Europeans by agreeing to lower capital ratios.So how much capital is enough?Mervyn King, the outspoken governor of the Bank of England, has suggested that the level should be roughly double what it was before the crisis hit. (In the United States, precrisis, the ratio for Tier One Common was about 4 percent.) Even Mr. Ryan of the securities trade group says he knows “it has to go up.”And then there is N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor of economics who was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, who recently made a bold suggestion: “I think it is possible to imagine a bank with almost no leverage at all,” he wrote on his blog.He continued: “Suppose we were to require banks to hold 100 percent reserves against demand deposits. And suppose that all bank loans had to be financed 100 percent with bank capital. A bank would, in essence, be a marriage of a super-safe money-market mutual fund with an unlevered finance company.”His solution would certainly address Mr. Geithner’s musing about insuring against a 100-year storm. But that kind of low-risk, low-reward system would, in one stroke, radically alter our perception of economic prosperity and, indeed, likely create a very different type of storm.'"
"'10-03-30,'1','Mr. Allawi’s attackers were never found; he said that Scotland Yard told him they were Iraqi intelligence agents. It took him a year and 10 operations to recover from that 1978 attack, as well as another year of . Later on there were a series of failed attempts by his exile political group, the Iraqi National Accord, working with the , to overthrow Mr. Hussein.Along the way, he became a rheumatologist, working as a specialist in spinal surgery during his exile in London. When the Americans occupied Iraq, he was appointed as the country’s interim prime minister in 2004, but he then finished a distant third in Iraq’s first national elections, in January 2005.Now Mr. Allawi’s surprising comeback has pitted him against Mr. Maliki, whom he defeated by a 91-89 plurality, even though the country’s Accountability and Justice Commission — formerly known as the De-Baathification Commission — invalidated the candidacies of hundreds of his supporters, claiming they were former Baathists, and the government’s antiterrorism forces arrested several of his candidates.He confirmed that the commission was trying to invalidate another 10 of his Iraqiya list parliamentary winners, which potentially could cut away his narrow plurality. The commission says that means their seats will be canceled, while Iraq’s Independent High Electoral Commission maintains Iraqiya will be able to replace those who are removed with others from their alliance. The matter seems likely to end up in court.Hatred of Baathists among Shiite politicians runs deep, and suspicion of Sunni motives run equally deep; many Shiites, who make up 60 percent of the population, see Sunni support for Mr. Allawi as a disguised form of support for the old government.“They know this is not true,” Mr. Allawi, 64, said. “They know I fought Saddam and his regime for more than 30 years, more than anyone else in this government. They know I fought the Baathists, the idea of the Baathists.“Those who committed crimes should go to face justice, and the hundreds and millions of people who never committed crimes, they should be pardoned and should be part and parcel of the Iraqi society,” he said.It does not help either that some of his supporters have favorably compared him to Mr. Hussein, and that at his rallies enthusiasts could be heard chanting, “We will sacrifice our blood and our souls for you, Allawi.” That was the Hussein chant, first coined during the -Iraq war.Even some of his supporters admiringly repeat stories that show him as a strong man with some of the Hussein-like qualities many Iraqis seem to admire. While prime minister, they say, he personally shot several captured insurgents to death. “I don’t kill people,” he said. “It was all a fabrication.” Then he added, “I am tough on people who break the law, because I believe in the supremacy of law.”He also has a well-earned reputation as sometimes hardheaded and volatile; when he first visited the as prime minister, his forearm was bandaged and many said it was because he had angrily smashed his fist on his desk.American officials have carefully avoided expressing any preference for either Mr. Allawi or Mr. Maliki, but they had a friendly relationship with him during his tenure. “Allawi demonstrated the ability to make and execute tough decisions in security and other matters,” said Meghan O’Sullivan, then an American occupation official who is now a professor at Harvard.Mr. Allawi was critical of the arrests of his followers by Mr. Maliki’s government, particularly that of Najim al-Harbi, who was his Iraqiya list’s top vote-getter in the mixed Shiite and Sunni province of Diyala. He is being held in a secret location without access to a lawyer, Mr. Allawi said, on terrorism charges. “The De-Baath Commission is working very hard, probably they will de-Baathify the 91 guys who won,” he said, predicting that the commission would invalidate his candidates.“I can tell you with confidence if they have their way and start twisting things, I can assure you this country will be engulfed with violence and this violence will not remain inside of Iraq, it will spread,” he said.Whether he succeeds in forming a government or not, his family is not likely to join him in Iraq, he said. “I have my children and my wife in London because they can’t come here,” he said. He remarried after his first wife died. “What schools could they go to here? The children of , what would they do to them? They would kill them.”His conversation returned again to that night in Kingston upon Thames. “When I fought these guys who tried to kill me and then when I fought against Saddam, I had a very tough time,” he said, “but I’m not frightened easily.”'"
"'10-03-30,'1','WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to add bisphenol-A , or BPA, a plastic widely used in food packaging and plastic bottles, to its list of chemicals of concern because of potential adverse impacts on the environment and human and animal health.The agency will require new studies of concentrations of the plastic in surface water, groundwater and drinking water to determine where it exists in levels requiring action. More than a million pounds of the chemical, used to harden plastics, are released into the environment each year, the agency said.The environmental agency will also require manufacturers that use BPA to provide test data to help evaluate effects on growth, reproduction and development in aquatic organisms and wildlife.The action follows a Food and Drug Administration statement in January expressing concern about the human health risks of BPA, which the agency had declared safe in 2008. The agency said at the time that it would look into the potential effects of BPA on “the brain, behavior and prostate gland of fetuses, infants and children” and would join other federal agencies in studying the chemical in animals and humans.Monday’s announcement from the environmental agency indicated that the government was looking to reduce the use of BPA in food packaging, plastic bottles and other sources of exposure.“We share F.D.A.’s concern about the potential health impacts from BPA,” said Steve Owens of the environmental agency’s Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances.The moves by the two agencies are part of the Obama administration’s effort to regulate health, food safety and environmental matters more forcefully.But some consumer advocates said the administration was not moving quickly enough to assess the dangers of BPA and other industrial chemicals. This month, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, chided the environmental agency for not including BPA on a list of chemicals that would be more strictly regulated. Legislation is pending to ban or sharply curtail BPA’s use in consumer products.Concerns about BPA are based on studies that have found harmful effects in animals, and on evidence that the chemical seeps into food and baby formula, and that nearly everyone is exposed to it, starting in the womb.Health officials have said there is no proof that BPA is harmful to humans, but are urging people to limit exposure by discarding scratched or worn containers made with it (usually marked with a 7 for recycling), not putting very hot liquids into cups or bottles with BPA and using microwave-safe containers.'"
"'10-03-30,'1','Woods’s late entry in the wake of his recent personal troubles has affected prices on the so-called secondary ticket market, a major source for access to golf’s grandest occasion next week in Augusta, Ga., for those shut out by the normal process. The four-day badges for the tournament proper are otherwise obtainable only by Augusta National members and designated patrons, while tickets to practice rounds next Monday through Wednesday are sold by the club through a lottery.But rates are not soaring at the same pace as golf fans’ feverish expectation to see Woods swing a 6-iron for the first time on an American fairway since last fall.Legal brokers — who acquire tickets to sports events, concerts and the theater, then resell them for profit — generally describe the Tiger bump as slight. Though Woods may be the most compelling athlete around, distancing himself from the field with his disclosure of “repeated irresponsible behavior,” the appeal of the Masters for most is atypical in this celebrity-driven era.“A single player doesn’t make a significant impact at this tournament” on prices, said Sam Soni, the vice president for procurement at the broker RazorGator, with offices in four cities, including Atlanta.The Woods news flash triggered a “slight surge,” he said, sending sales up 50 percent for a few days before they subsided.To some extent, he suggested, Woods’s possible participation was already built into sales prices.“The market almost had anticipated he was coming,” Soni said. “I think everyone expected it.”At StubHub, based in San Francisco and with offices in 10 cities, sales volume quintupled briefly and its Web site page views spiked up 75 percent the day after his Masters enlistment became known, according to a spokesman, Glenn Lehrman. But sales prices rose by only 10 percent.TicketCity in Austin, Tex., had a 30 percent boost in sales prices, although the chief operating officer, Zach Anderson, observed that Woods had merely enhanced the existing momentum.“The Tiger announcement just pushed it over the edge,” he said.Carl White at WebTickets in Atlanta detected a price increase (around 20 percent) more for the practice sessions, especially Wednesday’s, which features an informal par-3 competition among Masters contestants.“People can afford them,” he said. And with no leader boards to gaze at, the galleries are looser, with some more likely drawn just to see Woods than to see his putting stroke.One WebTickets client “doesn’t know anything about sports,” White said, but contacted him about the tournament.“He’s hearing Augusta will be the center of the universe,” White said. “Some people don’t really care about seeing a particular person play. They just want to be part of the circus.”In sports, only the Super Bowl and the Kentucky Derby rival the Masters for percentage of broker business conducted with corporate clients. Most tournament attendees from the business world had already made arrangements when Woods committed. Until recently, costs often were not a consideration.Prices ebbed last year as many longtime Masters patrons from the corporate side, battered by the recession and sensitive to public scrutiny over entertainment spending, stayed home.“Last spring was the low point,” Anderson at TicketCity said. “Corporate dollars were pulled way, way out.”At RazorGator, corporate spending is up 60 percent over a year ago, said Soni, calling the turnaround a market recovery. “We’re back to where we were in 2007,” he said.According to Susce at AAATix, sales to the corporate-connected are up only “a smidge.”He added, “It’s not as dead as last year, but people still aren’t slinging that AmEx card out.”Augusta National sells an undisclosed number of badges for $200, good for next Thursday through Sunday, to people on its patrons list. No new applications are being accepted.The club says it does not honor badges that have been transferred and has threatened to revoke buying privileges of those caught reselling.Still, plenty find their way into the hands of ticket brokers, and their buyers are rarely, if ever, denied entrance.Major brokers are pitching the four-day badges for as low as $2,250. Badges for single days start in the $650 range. (Some sellers prefer to avoid the one-day badge because it must be retrieved and redistributed after each round.)The club charges $36 to Monday’s and Tuesday’s practice rounds, $41 for Wednesday’s. Those tickets are marked up considerably, too, by brokers, with Monday’s commonly priced at $200 or more and Wednesday’s at a minimum of $450.For all Masters tickets bought from StubHub through last week, the average was about $500, according to Lehrman; it was $518 in 2008. Last year’s average slumped to $400.Various ticket posts on eBay and Craigslist have worked Woods’s name into their sales pitches.“Tiger Is Back!” screamed one. “See Tiger’s Return,” said another. Some trying to unload Monday practice-round tickets point to the day as his on-course debut since the scandal broke.“I thought people searching for tickets might put ‘Tiger’ in their search” on the Internet, said John Gramelspacher of Atlanta, willing to part with his Monday pair for $400.'"
"'10-03-30,'1','In the nearly 50 years since 460 East 79th Street was built, the doors have been replaced. The doorman has not. Steve Keschl first opened the doors there in a professional capacity in June 1960, when he was 33 and the building was newly completed. Today, Mr. Keschl is 83, and he is still a doorman at the 20-story tower, now a condominium building.

Just keep going.” This is in my head.Why he never considered working at another building: I don’t like to change. I love to be in one place. Here and there, no. I like to be in one place.Why he has never called in sick since 1960: Every evening is the soup. This is my medication.What he eats for lunch: Only homemade eating. No restaurants. Everything from home. Today I have ham salad and cake. Cake has to be every day. I love cake. Cake every day. This I have to have. My wife makes the cake. If my wife don’t bake, then I bake. Soup and cake. This is my favorite.How it feels to be the longest-serving doorman in Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union: I love it. I pay my union dues. I’m never late.How he met Elizabeth, his wife: 1961 we married. I found her here. She was a nanny for a little boy. When I saw her when she came in, my friend says, “Oh, this girl is not married.” We start to talk. A year later, we got married.'"
"'10-03-30,'1','LONDON — All three agreed, at least, that things were going to be tough and that hard choices and painful cuts would have to be made. But none of them — not Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer, nor the two men who hope to succeed him, George Osborne of the Conservative Party and Vince Cable of the Liberal Democrats — ventured to say exactly where and when the cuts would come.Setting the stage for Britain’s election this spring, the three men met in a television studio Monday night to lay out their credentials for helping restore the country’s battered economy to health. More than a statement of specific plans, though, the debate was in effect an elaborate public job interview, a way to help weary, wary voters decide whom to trust with what money they had left after Britain’s worst recession in decades.The debate was informal and relaxed, with the three men answering questions from a studio audience and occasionally sparring with one another. With the economy the biggest issue in the election, which is likely to take place at the beginning of May, all three had something personal to prove.Mr. Darling had to demonstrate that although he might be associated with the problem — Britain’s finances crashed under the Labour government for which he works, and which has been in power for 13 years — he is in fact part of the solution. He is, he said, the only one with the experience, the tenacity and the judgment to tackle the projected $250 billion deficit and lead the economy through the hard times ahead.Mr. Osborne, who looks preternaturally young and sleek, had to prove that he is not too callow and inexperienced to run the nation’s finances. As the privileged son of a baronet and an important figure in the Conservative Party, which has traditionally been allied with wealth and elitism, he also had to show that he understood the pain of the common man. To that end, he repeated several times that “we’re all in this together.”'"

(AP) — Venus Williams improved to 10-0 against Daniela Hantuchova, but she had to rally to do so, with a 1-6, 7-5, 6-4 victory in the fourth round at the rain-delayed Sony Ericsson Open on Monday.The third-seeded Williams trailed most of the match but swept the final seven points, hitting winners on the last four. She overcame 45 unforced errors, including 11 as she fell behind, 0-4.Williams, the only American woman in the final 16, will play in the quarterfinals against No. 6 Agnieszka Radwanska, who beat Yaroslava Shvedova, 6-1, 6-4.Top-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova was hampered by a right shoulder injury and lost to Marion Bartoli, 6-3, 6-0, in the fourth round. Kuznetsova, the 2006 champion, required a trainer’s treatment three times and won only eight second-set points.An unusually inconsistent Roger Federer beat Florent Serra, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (3), despite losing his serve three times. Federer committed 35 unforced errors to 32 for Serra but won eight consecutive service points in the tie breakers.'"

"'10-03-30,'1','Erik Brown of Orange, Calif., a Republican consultant and donor, submitted a reimbursement request for $1,946.25 from his club visit on Jan. 31. He listed the amount as a meal expense at the club, whose interior was inspired by an orgy scene in the movie “Eyes Wide Shut.” When the expenditure came to light on Monday, after it was reported by The Daily Caller, a conservative online publication, party officials said Mr. Brown would repay the money.Michael Steele, the Republican National Committee chairman, has battled criticism for his spending habits. He has drawn consternation from party officials for delivering paid speeches across the country, and they expressed shock in January when Mr. Steele published a book, “Right Now: A 12-Step Program for Defeating the Obama Agenda.”Mr. Heye said Mr. Steele was aboard a flight from the party’s winter meeting at the time of the nightclub outing and was not involved. An interview request with Mr. Steele on Monday was declined.“We recognize the difficulty this incident has caused and assure our members and supporters that any necessary and proper remediation is being implemented immediately,” Mr. Heye said. “It is unfortunate that a loyal G.O.P. donor who has recruited other donors became involved in this incident while merely trying to help what turned out to be the improper request of a staffer who is no longer with the committee.”Mr. Brown did not respond to interview requests.The February filings to the Federal Election Commission show that the Republican committee spent $17,500 on travel by private jet, in addition to about $15,000 on limousines. The report also listed several hotel charges ranging in the thousands of dollars, including the W Hotel in Washington ($15,000), the Beverly Hills Hotel ($9,000) and the Four Seasons in Philadelphia ($7,000).Mr. Heye said the expenses were simply the cost of doing business and raising money. He said that Mr. Steele’s travel was “overwhelmingly on commercial airlines — that is the standard mode.” But he added, “There are times when there is a route that doesn’t exist.”When Mr. Steele took over the committee last year, it had $22 million in cash on hand. This month, records show, that amount is $9.46 million.In a radio interview earlier this year, Mr. Steele brushed aside criticism of the party’s spending, as well as assertions that some contributors had stopped donating or lowered their contributions.Mr. Steele told KTRS radio in St. Louis: “I am in this chair. If they want it, take it from me. Until then, shut up, step back and get in the game and help us win.”A New York Times review of the Democratic National Committee spending in the month of February found that the party spent about $11,000 on car services and limousines, with the largest expense being $9,800 for a private car service in Dallas. Other expenditures included a $32,000 bill at the Capital Skyline Hotel in Washington, for what party officials said was a weeklong staff retreat, and $256,000 on catering and equipment rental at the Washington Hilton for the winter meeting of the Democratic National Committee.The Democratic National Committee seized on the Republican financial report on Monday. A spokesman for the party, Brad Woodhouse, said: “If limos, chartered aircraft and sex clubs are where they think their donors’ money should be spent, who are we to judge?”Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party and a longtime national party official, said he was confident with the “internal controls” on committee finances.“The budget committee reviews spending on a regular basis,” Mr. Anuzis said. “Everything is fine.”'"

"'10-03-31,'0','Investors seem remarkably relaxed about the end on Wednesday of the Federal Reserve’s $1.25 trillion program to buy mortgage-backed bonds guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Just a few months ago, many worried that, without the central bank’s continued intervention, home loans could become expensive enough to scare off prospective buyers and send the market into a renewed slump. Now they are regarding the Fed’s exit as little more than a minor blip. But that could be a sign that complacency is seeping back into the financial system.Granted, there are reasons to explain investors’ sanguine view, and timing has much to do with it. For starters, a lot of traditional buyers of these agency mortgage bonds have either stayed on the sidelines or bought far fewer bonds than their portfolio allotments allow. They, along with index funds, now account for 18 percent of the market, down from 25 percent before the Fed stepped in, according to Credit Suisse.But many do not have other investment opportunities right now that match their stringent criteria, meaning they may move to fill any gap left by the Fed. Banks with cash to spare after raising their capital levels are obvious potential buyers, too, as Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief, pointed out at a conference last month.Bondholders are also about to receive a windfall. Credit Suisse estimates that Fannie and Freddie will put $136 billion back into mortgage bond investors’ hands from April to June as they purchase bad loans from the pools of mortgages underlying existing bonds. That should take the sting out of the Fed’s withdrawal. Assuming investors plow that money back into the market, those dollars would be enough to replace the central bank’s recent buying volume for three to four months.'"
"'10-03-31,'0','WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is proposing to open vast expanses of water along the Atlantic coastline, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the north coast of Alaska to oil and natural gas drilling, much of it for the first time, officials said Tuesday.The proposal — a compromise that will please oil companies and domestic drilling advocates but anger some residents of affected states and many environmental organizations — would end a longstanding moratorium on oil exploration along the East Coast from the northern tip of Delaware to the central coast of Florida, covering 167 million acres of ocean.Under the plan, the coastline from New Jersey northward would remain closed to all oil and gas activity. So would the Pacific Coast, from Mexico to the Canadian border.The environmentally sensitive Bristol Bay in southwestern Alaska would be protected and no drilling would be allowed under the plan, officials said. But large tracts in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean north of Alaska — nearly 130 million acres — would be eligible for exploration and drilling after extensive studies.The proposal is to be announced by President Obama and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Wednesday, but administration officials agreed to preview the details on the condition that they not be identified.The proposal is intended to reduce dependence on oil imports, generate revenue from the sale of offshore leases and help win political support for comprehensive energy and climate legislation.But while Mr. Obama has staked out middle ground on other environmental matters — supporting nuclear power, for example — the sheer breadth of the offshore drilling decision will take some of his supporters aback. And it is no sure thing that it will win support for a climate bill from undecided senators close to the oil industry, like Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, or Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana.The Senate is expected to take up a climate bill in the next few weeks — the last chance to enact such legislation before midterm election concerns take over. Mr. Obama and his allies in the Senate have already made significant concessions on coal and nuclear power to try to win votes from Republicans and moderate Democrats. The new plan now grants one of the biggest items on the oil industry’s wish list — access to vast areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for drilling.But even as Mr. Obama curries favors with pro-drilling interests, he risks a backlash from some coastal governors, senators and environmental advocates, who say that the relatively small amounts of oil to be gained in the offshore areas are not worth the environmental risks.The Obama administration’s plan adopts some drilling proposals floated by President George W. Bush near the end of his tenure, including opening much of the Atlantic and Arctic Coasts. Those proposals were challenged in court on environmental grounds and set aside by President Obama shortly after he took office.Unlike the Bush plan, however, Mr. Obama’s proposal would put Bristol Bay, home to major Alaskan commercial fisheries and populations of endangered whales, off limits to oil rigs.Actual drilling in much of the newly opened areas, if it takes place, would not begin for years.Mr. Obama said several times during his presidential campaign that he supported expanded offshore drilling. He noted in his State of the Union address in January that weaning the country from imported oil would require “tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.”Perhaps in anticipation of controversy, the new policy has been closely held within the administration. White House and Interior Department officials began briefing members of Congress and local officials in affected states late Tuesday.It is not known how much potential fuel lies in the areas opened to exploration, although according to Interior Department estimates there could be as much as a three-year supply of recoverable oil and more than two years’ worth of natural gas, at current rates of consumption. But those estimates are based on seismic data that is, in some cases, more than 30 years old.The first lease sale off the coast of Virginia could occur as early as next year in a triangular tract 50 miles off the coast that had already been approved for development but was held up by a court challenge and additional Interior Department review, officials said.But as a result of the Obama decision, the Interior Department will spend several years conducting geologic and environmental studies along the rest of the southern and central Atlantic Seaboard. If a tract is deemed suitable for development, it is listed for sale in a competitive bidding system. The next lease sales — if any are authorized by the Interior Department — would not be held before 2012.The eastern Gulf of Mexico tract that would be offered for lease is adjacent to an area that already contains thousands of wells and hundreds of drilling platforms. The eastern Gulf area is believed to contain as much as 3.5 billion barrels of oil and 17 trillion cubic feet of gas, the richest single tract that would be open to drilling under the Obama plan.Drilling there has been strongly opposed by officials from both political parties in Alabama and Florida who fear damage to coastlines, fisheries, popular beaches and wildlife. Interior Department officials said no wells would be allowed within 125 miles of the Florida and Alabama coasts, making them invisible from shore.The Interior Department and the Pentagon are discussing possible restrictions on oil and gas operations in some areas off Virginia and Florida, home to some of the nation’s biggest Navy and Air Force facilities. States are also likely to claim rights to the revenues from oil and gas deposits within 3 to 12 miles of shore and to some portion of lease proceeds, officials said.Mr. Salazar developed the offshore drilling plan after conducting four public meetings over the past year in Alaska, California, Louisiana and New Jersey. The Interior Department received more than 500,000 public comments on the issue.Mr. Salazar has said that he hoped to rebalance the nation’s oil and gas policy to find a middle ground between the “drill here drill now” advocacy of many oil industry advocates and the preservationist impulse to block oil exploration beneath virtually all public lands and waters.He has called the offshore drilling plan a new chapter in the nation’s search for a comprehensive energy policy that can open new areas to oil and gas development “in the right way and in the right places,” according to an aide.In many of the newly opened areas, drilling would begin only after the completion of geologic studies, environmental impact statements, court challenges and public lease sales. Much of the oil and gas may not be recoverable at current prices and may be prohibitively expensive even if oil prices spike as they did in the summer of 2008.At the Wednesday event, Mr. Obama is also expected to announce two other initiatives to reduce oil imports, an agreement between the Pentagon and the Agriculture Department to use more biofuels in military vehicles and the purchase of thousands of hybrid vehicles for the federal motor pool.'"
"'10-03-31,'0','When you can steal an election, you can steal anything. How will we get this guy to curb corruption when his whole election, and previous tour in office, were built on corruption? How can we be operating a clear, build-and-hold strategy that depends on us bringing good governance to Afghans when the head of the government is so duplicitous?Our envoy in Kabul warned us of this before the election, but in his case, too, we were told to look the other way. On Nov. 6, the ambassador, Karl Eikenberry, wrote to Washington in a cable that was leaked: “President Karzai is not an adequate strategic partner,” he warned. “Karzai continues to shun responsibility for any sovereign burden, whether defense, governance or development. He and much of his circle do not want the U.S. to leave and are only too happy to see us invest further. They assume we covet their territory for a never-ending ‘war on terror’ and for military bases to use against surrounding powers.”One reason you violate Rule No. 1 is because you’ve already violated Rule No. 2: “Never want it more than they do.”If we want good governance in Afghanistan more than Karzai, he will sell us that carpet over and over. How many U.S. officials have flown to Kabul — the latest being himself — to lecture Karzai on the need to root out corruption in his administration? Do we think he has a hearing problem? Or do we think he believes he has us over a barrel and, in the end, he can and will do whatever serves his personal power needs because he believes that we believe that he is indispensable for confronting ?This rule applies equally to the Israeli prime minister, Bibi Netanyahu, and the president, . There is something wrong when we are chasing them — two men who live in distance from one another — begging, cajoling and pressuring them to come to a peace negotiation that should ostensibly serve their interests as much as our own.Which leads to Rule No. 3: In the Middle East, what leaders tell you in private in English is irrelevant. All that matters is what they will defend in public in their own language.When Karzai believes that the way to punish America for snubbing him is by inviting Iran’s president to Kabul — who delivered a virulently anti-U.S. speech from inside the presidential palace — you have to pay close attention to that. It means Karzai must think that anti-Americanism plays well on the streets of Afghanistan and that by dabbling in it himself — as he did during his presidential campaign — he will strengthen himself politically. That is not a good sign.As Filkins and Landler noted, “During the recent American-dominated military offensive in the town of Marja — the largest of the war — Mr. Karzai stood mostly in the shadows.” And if Karzai behaves like this when he needs us, when we’re there fighting for him, how is he going to treat our interests when we’re gone?We have thousands of U.S. troops on the ground in Afghanistan and more heading there. Love it or hate it, we’re now deep in it, so you have to want our engagement there to build something that is both decent and self-sustaining — so we can get out. But I still fear that Karzai is ready to fight to the last U.S. soldier. And once we clear, hold and build Afghanistan for him, he is going to break our hearts.'"
"'10-03-31,'0','Eventually, if the judge’s reasoning is upheld on appeal, the invalidation of genetic patents could hit diagnostics companies, agricultural biotechnology companies and perhaps even traditional drug makers, though drugs are often protected by patents on their own chemical composition.But the industry is already moving to a period of somewhat less dependence on DNA patents for its sustenance. Diagnostic laboratories, for instance, are shifting from testing individual genes to testing multiple genes or even a person’s entire genome. When hundreds or thousands of genes are being tested at once, patents on each individual gene can become a hindrance to innovation rather than a spur.On Monday, Mr. Sweet, a United States district judge in Manhattan, ruled that parts of patents held by Myriad Genetics covering two breast cancer genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, were invalid.Myriad analyzes those genes in an expensive test that predicts whether a woman is at a high risk of getting breast or ovarian cancer. The plaintiffs in the case, which included various medical groups, said the patents on DNA were illegal and impeded access to the testing.The decision invalidating the gene patents stunned many lawyers who follow such issues.“It’s really quite a dramatic holding that would have the effect of invalidating many, many patents on which the biotechnology industry has invested considerable money,” said Rebecca S. Eisenberg, a law professor at the University of Michigan who has written widely on gene patents.The Genomics Law Report, an Internet journal, called the decision “radical and astonishing in its sweep.” It headlined its article, “Pigs Fly.”Although patents are not granted on things found in nature, the DNA being patented had long been considered a chemical that was isolated from, and different from, what was found in nature. But Judge Sweet ruled that the distinguishing feature of DNA is its information content, its conveyance of the genetic code. And in that regard, he wrote, the isolated DNA “is not markedly different from native DNA as it exists in nature.”The immediate impact will be limited in part because the decision, made in a district court, does not apply to gene patents other than the ones it considered, and its value as precedent for other courts is limited.Moreover, Myriad said Tuesday that it would appeal, and several lawyers said they expected the ruling to be overturned. Professor Eisenberg said “there isn’t a whole lot of doctrinal support” for considering DNA as information rather than as a chemical.Even before an appeal is decided, the landscape could change in a way that would render the Myriad case moot. A ruling is expected soon from the Supreme Court in the so-called Bilski case. That case does not directly concern gene patents — it is about a fight over a method of hedging risk in commodities trading — but it gives the Supreme Court a chance to set new standards on what is patentable.“We are still waiting, holding our breath for the Bilski case,” said Kari Stefansson, head of research at DeCode Genetics, which sells disease risk tests similar to those sold by Myriad.If Judge Sweet’s decision were upheld on appeal, the impact could be more far-reaching. The biggest impact would be on companies like Myriad and Athena Diagnostics that offer diagnostic tests based on genes.Some biotechnology investors and executives say that lack of patent protection for DNA could diminish investment and remove incentives to develop tests. That could slow the move toward so-called personalized medicine, in which genetic tests are used to determine which drugs are best for which patients.James P. Evans, a professor of genetics at the University of North Carolina, said that would not necessarily be the case. There is thriving competition in areas like testing for mutations that cause cystic fibrosis or Huntington’s disease, even though no company has exclusivity.“It’s quite demonstrable that in the diagnostic area, one does not need gene patents in order to see robust development of these tests,” he said.'"

"'10-03-31,'0','WASHINGTON — The White House and one of its top outside economic advisers, Paul A. Volcker, expressed confidence on Tuesday that legislation to overhaul the nation’s financial system would be completed this year, possibly before the Congressional summer recess.“I feel more optimistic than I would have felt a month or two ago,” Mr. Volcker, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987, said in a speech here at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Asked about reports that the Senate might move on the legislation by the end of May, the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said, “I don’t think that’s an unrealistic timetable at all.”The House passed a sweeping financial reform package in December, and the Senate Banking Committee did so last week, on a party-line vote. But Democrats would have to obtain some Republican support to overcome the potential threat of a filibuster in the Senate.“The president is clear that we are not going to compromise on what we believe represents a very strong piece of legislation,” Mr. Gibbs said, adding that President Obama was committed to provisions that include a consumer financial protection agency.'"

The other half stretches toward the glass ceiling, growing a foot every week along a nine-foot length of twine. When the plants reach the top, workers reel more twine from the spool, shift the entire row horizontally and band each vine to its neighbor so that by the end of a plant’s life it might grow parallel to the concrete floor for as many as 20 or 30 feet, a dozen vines tangled together like hoses, before each makes its own graceful turn upward.“It’s like a bonsai tree — you have to treat every plant exactly the same,” Mr. de Kok said. “As soon as it gets uneven, that’s when it starts to get away from you.”He sat at his desk with three monitors recording temperature data, carbon dioxide levels, light readings measured in joules per square meter, and countless other figures from sensors scattered throughout the glass building.To compete in a more crowded market, where increased supply eroded price, many exploit technology to scramble for tomorrow’s hot tomato.“There is a tremendous variety of tomatoes available, thousands of cultivars,” said Tom Papadopoulos, a senior research scientist at Canada’s Greenhouse and Processing Crops Research Centre in Harrow, Ontario.In the mid ’90s, beefsteaks were the dominant contributor to greenhouse revenue. Then it was tomatoes sold on the vine, the principal crop at Backyard Farms. They are medium-size fruit, round and firm, and are sold in clusters of four to six.Today, as tomatoes on the vine grow commonplace, many companies are going small — cherry tomatoes, or grape, or campari, larger than cherry and smaller than tomatoes on the vine. Backyard Farms recently introduced a new line of cocktail tomatoes on the vine, similar in size to Camparis and sold in clusters of eight and packaged in cartons like Tomato McNuggets.“They’ve got strawberry tomatoes in greenhouses now — that’s a special variety that also has great flavor,” Ms. Cook said. “What I find is the smaller ones tend to be the good ones.”While the diversification is industrywide, the ability to grow many generations of greenhouse plants in a single season allows breeders to introduce those varieties more quickly, Mr. Papadopoulos said. Advances in have allowed breeders to cross-pollinate precisely for control over specific attributes like size, color, disease resistance, firmness for shipping and levels of acids and sugars, the balance of which accounts for the bulk of a tomato’s flavor. Too little sugar turns fruit tart. Too little acid turns it bland. Too little of both leaves tomatoes with little flavor.As tomatoes ripen on the vine they develop more of those sugars and acids and other flavor elements. But most of the major farms growing tomatoes that are sold fresh year round are in areas where the climate is more hospitable to varieties best picked green.By creating their own climate — whether in Arizona, Maine or Canada — greenhouses allow growers to pick and ship tomatoes only when they’re ripe.That’s a major advantage. And while no one would mistake a Backyard Beauty for a tomato picked from a backyard in late summer — it is not as tender and its flavor is not as complex — it is juicier and has much more flavor than what you’d find in your deli sandwich.“They don’t make a tomato that my grandmother would have liked,” Mr. Papadopoulos said. “They make a tomato that my son would like or my daughter would like.”Some of the technical advances that have allowed for these changes don’t even seem like technology.Twenty years ago, the millions of blossoms on these vines would all have been pollinated by hand, electric vibrators shaking pollen loose from anther to pistil every 48 hours. Today, that work is done by , shipped in cardboard hives from that are stacked seven high at the end of the rows.Aphids, when they’re found, are kept in check by a small species of , no bigger than a flying ant, that lays its eggs in the pest’s larvae.Lately, the greenhouse has been experimenting with interplanting young plants alongside older ones so that when one generation is discarded, the next is already yielding fruit. The aim is a continuous flow of production, tomatoes ripening fully on the vine year round and landing in outlets as far away as within 24 hours of harvest.“Continuous production cycles, that is important now as the market becomes more competitive,” Mr. Papadopoulos said. “If they’re out of production for two months, people who buy tomatoes will go somewhere else, and maybe they will forget to come back.”For instance, the majority of growers in Canada’s greenhouse capital, Leamington, are unable to produce the year round because, experts say, there simply isn’t enough light to grow tomatoes there profitably in midwinter.Backyard Farms is some 130 miles farther north of that Canadian city. To compensate, it employs some 20,000 high-pressure sodium lights, fueled by cheap power from Madison’s town-owned plant. Switched on, the lights use as much electricity in 32 minutes as the average American household does in a year. Some of its 200 employees wear sunglasses.The environmental costs of pouring so many resources into a tomato is a touchy subject. Backyard Farms’ chief executive, Roy Lubetkin, when pressed, pointed to biological controls like the wasps that allow the company to grow tomatoes without , and to the four-acre reservoir of reclaimed rain runoff that supplies, almost exclusively, their irrigation water. And because there is no dirt at Backyard Farms, fruit needn’t be washed.“It’s real sunlight, it’s real rainwater, these are real bees,” he said. “What we’re really doing is allowing nature to do its thing.” But which is greener, a field tomato shipped to Maine from Florida or one grown in-state in a greenhouse? “We’re redder,” he said.Across from the four-acre reservoir of recycled runoff, hidden from the road, are three very large tanks that serve a boiler system that keeps temperatures hovering around 70 degrees year round.Two enormous tanks, filled with carbon dioxide, stand on end beside them. The gas, fed along the vines in perforated plastic bags, adds bulk to the fruit and speeds growth. The tanks suggest that greenhouse tomatoes, while delicious, aren’t particularly green.Such were the findings of a 2005 study by the British government that compared the ecological footprints of tomatoes grown locally in heated greenhouses with those grown in fields and imported from . Even taking into account emissions from an additional 700 miles of shipping, the local greenhouse tomatoes were still responsible for emitting nearly four times more greenhouse gases than the imported fruit. Barring some advance in heating or lighting, or possibly even in the tomatoes themselves, such is the cost of perpetual summer.Inside at Backyard Farms, the bees zip around the crates, workers and tomato vines that stretch on to the faint glass horizon. Through a door at the end of Greenhouse Two, pallets of tomatoes are boxed and ready to be loaded onto a truck. On this morning, they were suspended from their vines. By this time tomorrow, they’ll be back indoors, under supermarket lights.'"
"'10-03-31,'0','There is also debate over the blood test being used to identify the new statin candidates. Instead of looking for bad cholesterol, the test measures the degree of inflammation in the body, but there is no consensus in the medical community that inflammation is a direct cause of cardiovascular problems.The approved the new criteria last month for Crestor, which is made by and is the nation’s second best-selling statin, behind by . AstraZeneca plans soon to begin a new marketing and advertising campaign for Crestor, based on the new F.D.A.-approved criteria.Under those criteria, an estimated 6.5 million people in this country who have no cholesterol problems and no sign of heart problems will be deemed candidates for statins. That is in addition to the 80 million who already meet the current cholesterol-based guidelines — about half of whom now take statins.The new Crestor label says it may be prescribed for apparently healthy people if they are older — men 50 and over and women 60 and over — and have one risk factor like smoking or , in addition to elevated inflammation in the body.Some patients have long complained of from taking statins. And doctors periodically check patients on the drugs to make sure liver enzymes are not abnormally high. Doctors, though, have generally seen those risks as being more than offset by the drugs’ benefits for people with high levels of “bad” cholesterol and a significant risk of cardiovascular disease.But then came the unexpected evidence linking statins to a risk, reported last month in the British medical journal The Lancet. That report was based on an analysis of most of the major clinical studies of statins — including unpublished data and the results of the Crestor study that the F.D.A. reviewed. “We’ve had this drug for a while, and we’re just now finding out that there’s this diabetes problem with it?” said Dr. Hlatky.The F.D.A. acknowledged the diabetes risk, and told AstraZeneca to add it to Crestor’s label. But the agency nonetheless approved the new use on the basis of the clinical study, which showed a small but measurable reduction of strokes, heart attacks and other “cardiovascular events” among people taking the statin, compared with patients taking a placebo.“It’s an important milestone for the company and for the patient,” said Jim Helm, AstraZeneca’s vice president for cardiovascular products. “We are already discussing this with physicians.”Dr. Eric C. Colman, a deputy director of the F.D.A. center for drug evaluation, said the decision provided an option, not a mandate, for doctors and patients. “It’s good to hear that physicians are debating the potential benefits and risks of drugs,” Dr. Colman wrote via e-mail on Tuesday.An F.D.A. advisory committee had voted 12-4 in favor of expanding the usage in December, with some dissenters questioning the value of the test measuring elevated levels of inflammation.The new Crestor guidelines continue a steady expansion of the number of people considered candidates for statins over the last decade. The recommendations and guidelines have been expanded by various advisory panels — many of whose members have also done paid consulting work for the drug industry.Another of those panels is now preparing statin guidelines due next year, which are expected to further expand the number of candidates for the drugs.The clinical trial on which the F.D.A. approved the new Crestor use was a global study of nearly 18,000 people. It looked only at patients who had low cholesterol and an elevated level of inflammation in the body as measured by a test called high-sensitivity , or CRP.It was the inventor of the CRP test, Dr. Paul M. Ridker, a medical professor and cardiologist at in , who persuaded AstraZeneca to pay for the statin study, which he then led.Dr. Ridker said his proposals for such a study had been turned down by the and at least two other companies. One was Pfizer, whose statin Lipitor will lose patent protection next year and will be sold in inexpensive generic forms. The other was , whose statin Baycol was removed from the market in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths from a rare muscle disorder.Compared with those companies, AstraZeneca had more of a business interest in sponsoring Dr. Ridker’s study. Crestor, which had sales of $4.5 billion last year, will not be subject to generic competition until 2016 — and so the company has more years to benefit from expanded use of the product at name-brand prices. The drug, taken as a daily pill, sells for at least $3.50 a day, compared with only pennies a day for some generic statins.Dr. Ridker, meanwhile, receives undisclosed amounts of royalties from the CRP test. For a decade, he has argued that his test is sometimes a better diagnostic tool than cholesterol scores. And he says the Crestor study proved his case.“We found a 55 percent reduction in heart attacks, 48 percent reduction in , 45 percent reduction in bypass surgery,” Dr. Ridker said recently. “I felt I had one shot at a controversial hypothesis,” he said, “and it worked really well.”So well, in fact, that the study was halted after following patients an average of 1.9 years instead of the planned five years. With such improvement, a data monitoring board concluded it would have been unethical to continue the trial.“I don’t understand the antipathy out there,” said Dr. Steven E. Nissen, chairman of cardiology at the , who has consulted for AstraZeneca among many other companies but says he donates the money to charity. “If somebody comes into my office and meets the criteria, am I going to deny them a drug that reduces their chance of a or stroke by 40 or 50 percent?”But critics said the claim of cutting heart disease risk in half — repeated in news reports nationwide — may have misled some doctors and consumers because the patients were so healthy that they had little risk to begin with.The rate of heart attacks, for example, was 0.37 percent, or 68 patients out of 8,901 who took a sugar pill. Among the Crestor patients it was 0.17 percent, or 31 patients. That 55 percent relative difference between the two groups translates to only 0.2 percentage points in absolute terms — or 2 people out of 1,000.Stated another way, 500 people would need to be treated with Crestor for a year to avoid one usually survivable heart attack. Stroke numbers were similar.“That’s statistically significant but not clinically significant,” said Dr. Steven W. Seiden, a cardiologist in , N.Y., who is one of many practicing cardiologists closely following the issue. At $3.50 a pill, the cost of prescribing Crestor to 500 people for a year would be $638,000 to prevent one heart attack.Is it worth it? AstraZeneca and the F.D.A. have concluded it is.“The benefit is vanishingly small,” Dr. Seiden said. “It just turns a lot of healthy people into patients and commits them to a lifetime of medication.”'"
"'10-03-31,'0','HOUSTON — Oil prices have done something remarkable over the last half-year or so: they have barely budged.Memories are still fresh of the chaotic climb to $147 a barrel only two summers ago, accompanied by gasoline costing $4.11 a gallon. The spike led to accusations from drivers and politicians that oil companies were price-gouging. Then crude prices plummeted along with the economy, to around $34 a barrel just over a year ago, only to double again in a matter of months as confidence began to recover.And there the price has stayed, more or less, since August, reaching a rough stability in the $70 to $83 range.Economists and government officials say that if prices remain in that band, it could benefit the world economy, the future security of energy supplies and even the environment. The price is high enough to drive investment in future oil production and in supplies of alternative energy, they note, but low enough that consumers can bear it.“It’s a sweet spot,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard professor of international finance. “It’s not too low that it’s crushing demand for renewable energy sources or causing debt and fiscal crises in oil-exporting countries. And it’s not so high that it’s driving African countries deeper into poverty and threatening the recovery in the U.S. and Europe.”Gasoline prices have stabilized along with oil prices, with the average national price for a gallon of regular gasoline ranging from $2.50 to $2.80 since June. Prices are expected to go as high as $3 a gallon during this summer’s driving season. That is a relatively high price by historical standards, but it is more tolerable than in the summer of 2008, when prices exceeded $4 a gallon for weeks, and rose above $4.50 in a few states.Oil prices have jumped somewhat this week, but they are still within the band they have occupied for months. Light, sweet Texas crude closed on Tuesday at $82.37 a barrel.Energy experts say that several far-flung global developments have converged to put supply and demand in relative equilibrium, at least for the time being.Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have remained fairly disciplined in complying with their announced production cuts. Meanwhile, among non-OPEC producers, growing oil output in Brazil, Russia and the Gulf of Mexico has counterbalanced production declines in the North Sea, Alaska, Venezuela and Mexico.On the demand side, growing appetites for oil in China, India and other developing nations have been offset by declining demand in the United States and Europe, because of their slowing economies, conservation efforts and growing use of biofuels.“The current price range provides a geopolitical benefit,” said David L. Goldwyn, the State Department coordinator for international energy affairs. “With ample capacity in oil, and commercial inventories at five-year highs, markets are well positioned to absorb any potential supply disruption, even without resorting to strategic stocks.”While the last four decades have been punctuated by various oil price booms and busts stemming from oil embargoes, wars and recessions, periods of relative stability lasting months or years have been commonplace.Not surprisingly, oil producers prefer stability to plan their investments. “The worst thing that happens in our industry is volatility,” said G. Steven Farris, chairman and chief executive of Apache Corporation. With prices stabilizing, his company has increased its exploration and development budget by 50 percent, to $6 billion, this year.The new return to balance is rooted in the price spike that occurred from 1999 to 2008, when oil prices climbed from under $20 to nearly $150 a barrel. Those high prices performed their elementary economic function: they called forth additional supply.As prices rose, producers invested in expensive exploration and production projects around the globe. At the beginning of the last decade, fewer than 20 drilling ships were capable of finding and developing deepwater oil; today there are well over a hundred. Saudi Arabia and Russia undertook big expansions of their production capacity.When oil prices suddenly collapsed in late 2008, future supply gains were put in doubt. Several large companies postponed decisions on whether to go forward with big projects to develop oil sands in Canada, for instance, and smaller independents slashed their exploration budgets.But now most of the suspended oil sands projects are going forward, with an estimated 580,000 barrels of new capacity under construction. Meanwhile, many of the independent oil companies are pumping up their oil exploration investment budgets as well.“If we still had $35 oil prices, you would not have seen us be nearly as active in the Gulf of Mexico,” James T. Hackett, chairman and chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum, said in an interview. With prices recovering, he said his company was moving forward with an aggressive program of installing 30 deepwater exploration and appraisal wells this year in the Gulf, Asia and Africa, each costing $50 million to $200 million.“An $80 price curve tends to work for us,” Mr. Hackett added.The biggest long-term threat to the new balance is growing consumption in China and other developing countries. But some analysts express hope that such countries can curb their oil demand growth as they build power transmission lines that will enable them to replace inefficient diesel generators with alternative power sources like gas and nuclear.Stable, relatively high prices also may encourage conservation. Energy experts note that American drivers still have an incentive to buy efficient vehicles with gasoline prices at $2.80 a gallon, while high oil and low natural gas prices are encouraging use of compressed natural gas vehicles and biofuels in many countries.“The price range we are in is positive for encouraging diversity of supply,” said Mr. Goldwyn, the State Department energy official. “It’s high enough so that countries that subsidize the price of oil still have a high incentive to reduce those subsidies and it’s high enough to support energy-efficiency measures that are positive for mitigating climate change.”For all the good that stable prices can do, however, no one is willing to predict they will last forever.“Demand will change; supply will change,” said Christof Rühl, chief economist of BP, the oil company. “The world changes all the time.”'"
"'10-03-31,'0','Fresh off its acquisition of 16 additional theaters in the West End of London and across Britain, the Ambassador Theater Group is seeking business deals with theater owners and producers in the United States to create a cross-Atlantic distribution network for shows, one of the company’s co-founders said Monday.The executive, Howard Panter, said he had received final approval from the British government on March 24 for Ambassador’s purchase of two additional West End theaters — which now house the hit musicals “Wicked” and “The Lion King” — and 14 regional British theaters from Live Nation for £90 million (about $136 million). The sale, first announced in November, increases the company’s theater holdings to 12 in the West End and 27 regionally, making it the dominant theater owner in Britain.Mr. Panter, a regular producer of Broadway shows, including “Exit the King” last season and the Tony-winning revival of “Company” in 2007, said in an interview that he wanted to build on the acquisitions by forming partnerships with American theater executives. He hopes to increase the number of shows that transfer among a larger number of cities within the United States and Britain. Traditionally, most theater productions have moved mainly between London and Broadway.“We now have a much larger market in cities like Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow, and we’re hoping to start an unprecedented international distribution network that would move plays among cities in the U.K. and America in addition to New York and the West End,” said Mr. Panter, who founded Ambassador Theater Group in 1992 with his wife, Rosemary Squire.Mr. Panter said he was beginning to meet with theater executives in New York this week, though he declined to name them, saying it was premature to do so.'"
"'10-03-31,'0','But some of the most striking animals at Villa Lorena, located up a dirt road in the slum of Floralia, are the great cats that once belonged in the private zoos of drug traffickers, who still seem to find inspiration in the example of the dead cocaine baron Pablo Escobar.Indeed, descendants of the hippos once owned by Mr. Escobar still roam the grounds of Hacienda Nápoles, his once luxurious retreat, where he amassed a private collection of exotic species, including rhinoceroses and kangaroos.Ms. Torres’s sanctuary surpasses Mr. Escobar’s menagerie in its diversity. About 500 iguanas roam its trees and pathways near corrals for peccaries, flamingos, mountain goats and peacocks. Cages house toucans and spider monkeys. Ms. Torres closes the sanctuary to all but a handful of visitors.“The animals here are not meant to be exhibited,” she said before leaning through cage bars to embrace and kiss on the lips a roaring lion named Jupiter, who was recovered from a circus where he had suffered from malnutrition. “They need to be protected, and have a right to live in peace.”Some of the animals under her care found anything but peace before arriving at Villa Lorena. Several years ago, she nursed back to health a spider monkey called Yeyo, found by the police in a puddle of his own blood after being beaten by its owner. While Yeyo lost an eye from the abuse, he lived quietly at Villa Lorena until his death, she said.Then there is the lion named Rumbero, rescued from a drug trafficker near the city of Manizales. Rumbero’s eyes have an empty, glazed look. Ms. Torres said he was forced to consume marijuana, ecstasy and other substances at bacchanals in Colombia’s backlands.At almost every turn at Villa Lorena, animals display indignities suffered at the hands of man. A caiman with a severed limb stretches under the tropical sun. A macaw with a sawed-off beak flutters in its cage. Luís, a cougar who once belonged to a drug trafficker, limps around his cage, the result of having a front leg cut off.Ms. Torres speaks of each case with passion, somewhere between outrage and desperation, bringing to mind the episode in Nietzsche’s life when he broke into tears and threw his arms around a horse on the streets of Turin while attempting to save it from a coachman’s whipping.“We’ve received horses here, too, including one that a man in Cali tried to burn alive after dousing it with gasoline,” she said, motioning to Villa Lorena’s burial ground near the chimpanzee’s cage, where workmen bury all the animals that die at the sanctuary. “It didn’t make it.”For others in animal-rights circles here, Ms. Torres’s sanctuary raises issues that are both philosophical and practical. “Animals are not like human beings, who can adjust to being in a wheelchair,” said Jorge Gardeazábal, a veterinary surgeon at Cali’s zoo.Dr. Gardeazábal, citing the example of an ocelot with a severed leg, said that he preferred euthanasia in such cases, since the ocelot would be unable to carry out its genetic instinct to flee with quickness when it sensed fear. Still, he said he supported Ms. Torres’s sanctuary. “But it’s an activity that should be regulated by the authorities,” he said, to ensure the well-being of the animals and those who work with them.While Ms. Torres receives help from Cali’s environmental police, who deliver rescued animals to her doorstep, she shuns government financing and other involvement with the authorities. She relies, instead, on private donations and food given to the sanctuary by grocery stores.Eliécer Zorrilla, an official with Cali’s environmental police, said the hands of law enforcement were largely tied when it came to limiting the traffic in exotic animals, even those that were abused and ended up at Villa Lorena. Colombian law does not include prison terms for people found mistreating animals or owning a rare species, he said.Mr. Zorrilla added that his officers could seize wild animals from their owners only when they were in the process of being transported or traded. “We have no idea how many other wild animals, from this continent or others, are being mistreated in captivity,” he said.In an ironic twist, man’s clash with nature is also what sustains the animals in Villa Lorena. Roadkill, largely in the form of horses hit by cars, provides much of the meat for Ms. Torres’s carnivores. Workmen butcher the donated horse meat and toss it into cages, where it is quickly consumed.Ms. Torres said that it took time for Dany, the man-eating Bengal tiger, to get used to his new diet. He roared with startling vigor one recent afternoon when it came time to eat; steel bars separated him from the laborer throwing him raw flesh. “Dany’s one of the few animals here that I cannot embrace,” said Ms. Torres. “At least not yet.”'"
"'10-03-31,'0','A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, said such a disparity was irrelevant. “A fiduciary must make full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject to a cap on compensation,” the chief judge, Frank H. Easterbrook, wrote for the panel.Mutual fund investors unhappy with the fees they are charged may withdraw their money and invest it elsewhere, Judge Easterbrook said.Dissenting from the full appeals court’s decision not to rehear the case, Judge Richard A. Posner said the panel decision relied “mainly on an economic analysis that is ripe for re-examination.” Executive and other pay was out of control, he said, and the marketplace could not be trusted to rein it in.In the decision on Tuesday, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for a unanimous court, declined to take sides in the dispute between the two judges, both known for their engagement with economic theory.Justice Alito instead adopted the standard set out in the leading appeals court case on the issue, Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, which was decided in 1982 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York.The upshot was not a victory for legal clarity, Justice Alito conceded.The 1970 law, he wrote, was “hardly pellucid,” and the Gartenberg standard, which takes account of many factors, “may lack sharp analytical clarity.”Under Gartenberg, a mutual fund adviser violates the 1970 law only if it charges a fee “that is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm’s-length bargaining.”Justice Alito did give lower courts some guidance about the relevance of two kinds of comparisons.First, he said, courts may consider differences in fees charged to different kinds of clients. But he noted that there might be good reasons for the differences, including “the greater frequency of shareholder redemptions in a mutual fund, the higher turnover of mutual fund assets, the more burdensome regulatory and legal obligations, and higher marketing costs.” He added that parity was not necessarily required.Second, Justice Alito said, courts “should not rely too heavily” on comparisons to what other mutual funds pay their advisers. Such comparisons, he said, “are problematic because these fees, like those challenged, may not be the product of negotiations conducted at arm’s length.”In a concurrence, Justice Clarence Thomas cautioned against reading too much into the court’s opinion, which he said “does not countenance the free-ranging judicial ‘fairness’ review of fees that Gartenberg could be read to authorize.”The case itself, Jones v. Harris Associates, No. 08-586, was returned to the lower courts for application of the new standard.Justice Alito also suggested that another body might want to adjudicate the dispute between Judge Easterbrook and Judge Posner about whether the recent economic crisis suggested that more regulation was warranted. “The debate,” Justice Alito wrote, “is a matter for Congress, not the courts.”'"
"'10-03-31,'0','LONDON (AP) — The Royal Bank of Scotland has been fined £28.6 million ($43 million) for violating competition laws by sharing price data with a rival, Barclays, the Office for Fair Trading said Tuesday.The agency said that individuals in R.B.S.’s professional practices coverage team had disclosed generic as well as specific confidential pricing information to counterparts at Barclays Bank, and that the information was used by Barclays to set prices.Barclays brought the issue to the attention of authorities and was not expected to face any fines, the agency said.“The disclosures by R.B.S. took place in the course of a number of contacts on the fringes of social, client or industry events or through telephone conversations,” the agency said.“The information concerned the pricing of loan products to large professional services firms, such as solicitors, accountancy and real estate firms, in respect of which R.B.S. and Barclays are the main providers,” the agency said, “As well as general disclosures on future pricing, the investigation found that R.B.S. had supplied specific confidential future pricing information in relation to two proposed loan facilities.”The fine was reduced from £33.6 million because R.B.S., now effectively owned by the government, cooperated with investigators, the agency said.R.B.S. said it had introduced more training on competition law to ensure that there was no repeat of the offense.'"
"'10-03-31,'0','Housing prices are still inching up, but few analysts are presuming the trend will last.The Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller Index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in January, from December, according to data released Tuesday. It was the eighth consecutive monthly increase.But what appeared to be good news in the widely watched measure masked underlying troubles. The discrepancy is because of seasonal adjustments, which in theory smooth out the data. In the slow-selling winter months, seasonal adjustments lift the numbers; in the summer, the opposite happens.On an unadjusted basis, the index fell 0.4 percent in January from December, extending a pattern of decline.“We’re seeing a general weakening,” said Maureen Maitland, vice president for index services at Standard & Poor’s.House sales rose in the fall as buyers and sellers eagerly did deals before the government’s $8,000 tax credit was scheduled to end Nov. 30. Congress then extended the credit until April 30, but the momentum was lost, and sales volume plunged.'"
